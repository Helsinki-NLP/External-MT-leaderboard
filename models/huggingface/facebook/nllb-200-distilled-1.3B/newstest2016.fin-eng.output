A 9-year-old boy was found on the run in Tampere.
The police have been on a search mission for a 9-year-old boy who escaped in Tampere on Tuesday night.
A missing boy who left West Tampere with a friend has been reported on social media.
Police say the boy has been contacted and is not in any danger to life or health.
The boy's father told the Night-Words at midnight that the boy had been found.
He's fine, and now we're gonna start the follow-up.
The boy was found near the house, his father said.
Ronaldo is back in the game . He 's ripping the goal off Messi .
Cristiano Ronaldo scored five goals in the Spanish league this weekend and continued his exploits in the Champions League.
The battle between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo for the Champions League goal-kicking title turned, at least for a moment, in the latter's favour.
Real Madrid's Ronaldo single-handedly moved into the top of the all-time goalscoring list when he scored two goals from penalty kicks and one from a game situation in the goal of visiting Shahtar Donetsk.
Ronaldo has raised his average to 80 after Barcelona's Messi, who had tied him before Tuesday, has a total of 77 goals.
Real won the match 4-0.
Juventus have been stumbling in Serie A since the start of the season, but in the Champions League D-League they started strong with a 2-1 away win over Manchester City.
The winning goal was scored by Juventus' Alvaro Morata with over ten minutes to go.
The City offense was bored by the absence of the knee-jerk Sergei Aguero.
Aguero, who was injured in a preseason game this weekend, didn't get on the field until the final 10 minutes.
Manchester United's other side also suffered in the Netherlands against PSV Endhoven after suffering a 1-2 defeat.
ManU's 20-year-old quarterback Luke Shaw was only able to get a 15-minute overtime.
PSV's Hector Moreno's dangerous-looking slide hit the attacking ManU pack so hard that Shaw probably broke his leg.
Shaw lay on the lawn of Eindhoven's home stadium for 10 minutes before paramedics left to take him to the hospital.
Memphis Depay took the visitors to a 1-0 lead in the 41st minute, but ManU's joy lasted only a few minutes.
Moreno evened it before extra time.
The PSV winning goal in the second half was scored by Luciano Narsingh.
The Champions League season opens with the A-League side Paris Saint-Germain.
It was Angel Di Maria, the Argentine who traded his Manchester United shirt for a PSG shirt.
Di Maria broke through from the right and lifted the ball past Malmö goalkeeper Johan Wiland.
Edinson Cavani scored 2-0 for PSG in the second half.
PSG is being touted as one of the most successful teams of the season.
The assumption is not wrong, but Malmö, which is a member of the league's small clubs, is not the best possible place to compare.
PSG star striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic faced his former club Malmö FF for the first time in his professional career.
Ibrahimovic started his career at Malmö in 1999.
Roman Eremenko played 90 minutes as his team, Moscow's TsSKA, lost a B-block game in Germany to Wolfsburg 0-1.
The opposition party demanded his immediate resignation . The president made a false speech .
Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe gave the same speech he had a month ago.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe has again delivered the same speech to the country's parliament as he did at the end of last month.
During his 25-minute speech, Mugabe apparently didn't realize it was the same.
The speech raised doubts about whether 91-year-old Mugabe was at his best.
The main opposition party, the MDC, demanded that Mugabe step down as he was too old to rule.
Mugabe's aides were quick to say that the interference had taken place only in Mugabe's headquarters and that the president had done nothing wrong.
Mugabe's speech was earlier and now about China's impact on the country's economy.
Germany and Austria call for an extra summit on the refugee crisis
Germany and Austria have proposed an extraordinary summit of EU leaders next week in response to the refugee crisis.
The European Council President Donald Tusk, who chairs the summits, evaluated the request.
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that the Heads of State and Government should discuss cooperation with the countries of origin and how to register more effectively.
The European Parliament has also voted to approve the Commission's proposal to increase the number of EU citizens in the EU.
A teacher admits to shooting his girlfriend during an emergency call.
A voice only slightly colored, Shannon Lamb, a college professor, tells police during an emergency call that he shot his girlfriend and that the police need to come to their house.
Lamb stressed that his "golden dog" was alive and probably in shock, and said that the contact information of the dead woman's relatives was on her phone.
Inside the house, officers found Amy Prentiss's body and a handwritten note on a page of anger: "I am so sorry I wish I could undo this I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me", said the letter, which experts believe was signed by Lamb.
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Minnesota, had already traveled nearly 300 miles to the school campus where police believe he shot and killed a respected history teacher, Ethan Schmidt, at the door of this study.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard the shooting at 10:18 a.m.
She said Lamb made the fatal 911 call sometime after that.
By the end of the day, the death toll had risen by another one: Lamb committed suicide while the police were surrounding the woman.
Authorities were still trying to determine Lamb's motive a day after students and staff were forced to hide behind locked doors in a school shooting.
Researchers from both sides of the state have released data showing that students and staff described Lamb as a gifted teacher who may have had problems.
The students said they were waiting for his feelings.
The police at the scene of Prentiss' death, Gautier, say Lamb had no history of violence or criminal record.
Schmidt himself had included Lamb in a book he wrote in which he thanked the "great people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, which has a total of 17 staff members, and many students attended both men's courses.
On the other hand, there were some signs of trouble.
A student named Brandon Beavers praised Lamb, but said that he also seemed nervous and restless, as if something were wrong.
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamb told him he was under a lot of stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb had earlier requested a sick leave from Delta State University, saying he had some sort of health problem.
This year, he only taught two online courses.
Recent changes in the university's salary policy meant that even though Lamb had worked hard to earn his doctorate, it did not guarantee him automatic promotion and the position of assistant professor.
William LaForge, president of the university, said that as far as he knew, there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "clearly there was something in Lamb's mind".
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
After Lamb fled the campus, police tracked him down as he moved back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a .38-caliber pistol in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parents' home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, said Washington County coroner Methel Johnson.
Lamb's car was still running in the yard.
It was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this particular house, although Johnson said he believed Lamb knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb started working at the university in 2009 and taught geography and education.
Lamb graduated with a doctorate in educational science this spring.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as smart, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston told me she was 15 and Lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
Hairston and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a funny, older guy who tried for years to teach Hairston to play guitar.
He was quite the charmer back then.
All the girls were in a state of shock when he was there, said Hairston, now 40, of Brandon, a suburb of Jackson.
Apparently, Lamb and Prentiss had been dating for a while.
On the 911 call, Lamb said he killed his wife, but there's no evidence of their marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in a brick house on the river in Gautier.
The police said the dog was fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband Shawn O'Steen told the court they separated 15 years ago but remained friends.
"He's really upset", O'Steen described his daughter.
He was her mother's best friend.
Osteen said that he had not met Lamb, but had heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when Lamb and Abigail were both performing at the summer market three years ago.
Later, they played together in a few gigs.
O'Steen told me that his daughter makes and sings her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for several different online companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and occasional entertainer at The Julep Room, a haunted bar near Gautier, says he last saw Lamb and Prentiss the night before September 5, when Lamb finished his guitar and harp performance for a small audience.
Nothing seemed to be wrong.
"Just a happy couple", he said.
We were playing games and throwing punches at each other.
So they were both pretty smart.
The late teacher Schmidt was the director of the first-year seminary program and specialized in Native American and colonial history, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the school.
Schmidt was married and had three young children.
He attended Emporia State University in Kansas, where he was president of his fraternity and student government.
On Tuesday evening in Cleveland, a candlelight vigil was held on the Delta State campus, with some 900 people in attendance, including faculty and other staff, students, and community members.
Schmidt's wife, Liz, and Brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the Mass, during which the university choir sang the songs Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
We're back in class on Wednesday.
"We're trying to get our students back", LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
It's time to heal.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press reporter Emily Wagster Betrayed from Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana from New Orleans contributed to the report.
The case has been resolved by the fact that the police now say Lamb made the 911 call after Schmidt was shot, and that while Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife during the call, there is no evidence that they were married.
Toys R Us plans to cut staff for the holiday season
Toys R Us says it will not hire as many workers for the holiday season as it did last year, but the toy and baby retailer says that current permanent and seasonal workers will be given the opportunity to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and distribution centres across the country, up from 45,000 during the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the jobs are part-time.
The company said that interviews for applicants will begin this month, and staffing will increase from October to December.
With months to go before the holidays, the Christmas shopping season is approaching, and businesses are preparing to hire temporary workers to help fill stores and sell, ship, and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a huge moment for Michael J. Fox professionally.
It was also noteworthy for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theater waiting for the royals to arrive, and I realized the seat next to me was empty, and then I realized Princess Diana's seat was next to me", she said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary Back in Time.
The movie starts and I'm reminded that I'm only one artificial sneeze and one hand stretch away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time is a documentary film about the film Back to the Future, featuring interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson, Christopher Lloyd, and director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, "To me, it is without a doubt the greatest time travel movie ever made".
Back in Time is available on video, DVD and in select theaters in October.
The UN chief says there is no military solution to the Syrian situation.
The response of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to Russia's increasing military support for Syria is that this almost five-year conflict cannot be solved by armed force and that additional weapons will only exacerbate the violence and the suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief reiterated his call on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support non-discriminatory negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban told a press conference on Wednesday that he would meet the foreign ministers of the five permanent members - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - at a ministerial summit later this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the division between the Council, the Syrian people and regional actors had made it impossible to resolve the situation.
The European Union is committed to the implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution on the situation in Syria.
Eight opinion polls that show Donald Trump is serious.
Some people have tried to label him a windmill.
Others think he's just a joke.
Some of them are waiting to crash.
Although some Republicans have tried to sweep Donald Trump off the top of the polls, it has not (yet) succeeded.
In 10 of the last 11 national polls, Donald Trump has led by a double-digit number, and some have begun to seriously consider what this means for the real estate king's nomination opportunities.
Of course, the election season is still in its infancy.
These results do not yet mean that Trump is likely to be the Republican nominee.
Commentators note that at this point in 2011, Rick Perry was about to lose his leadership to the rising Herman Cain, neither of whom had backed any state in the nomination process.
There are also many reasons why he would have problems in the general election.
However, outside groups such as Jeb Bush's Super PAC and the conservative economic organization Club for Growth have noticed Trump's tenacity and have begun to use their funds to topple him.
The following recent opinion polls suggest that the Real Estate King is not just a passing phase:
Trump's approval ratings have turned a corner.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, Monmouth University opinion polls showed that only two out of ten Republicans were positive about the real estate kingpin.
By mid-July, the figure was 40 percent.
By early August, the figure was 52 percent.
Right now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative attitude.
These figures are also true for the first primary states.
In a poll conducted by Quinnipiac University in Iowa last week, 60 percent of Republicans said they had a positive view of Trump.
Two-thirds of Republican voters would be happy if Trump were the nominee.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either "interested" or "satisfied" if Trump were nominated.
Only two out of ten said they would be 'shocked' if she were to stand.
Only Ben Carson generates roughly the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% of those interested vs. Trump's 40%).
Next, what's your most exciting thing?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters would be "displeased" or "shocked" if the administration's favorite Jeb Bush were to run.
Trump's fiery nature is not a problem for most Republicans.
Despite widespread criticism of Donald Trump for his bombastic speeches and insults, a Monday ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters nationwide think the real estate mogul has the character to be president.
Quinnipiac's poll last week showed that in Iowa, which is hosting the first-ever Democratic convention, the figure is the same: 52 percent of Republicans think Trump has the characteristics of a leader.
However, according to an ABC/Post poll, 44 percent think his character is not suited to the presidency, and nearly six in 10 think his character is not suited to the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When Republican voters think like commentators, they think Trump is the real option.
According to a CNN/ORC poll, four in 10 people thought Trump was the most likely candidate when asked who was most likely to be nominated by the Republicans.
By the end of July, four out of ten voters were still in favor of Jeb Bush.
Disclosure: Republican voters have not always had the brightest crystal ball possible.
In the last election, at this time, four out of 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry should be nominated, and only 28 percent supported the final nominee, Mitt Romney.
In any case, this shows that the majority of Republican voters find Trump's campaign credible.
Even if the Republicans were to back another candidate, Trump would still win almost everyone.
Some commentators have noted that the fragmented field has likely contributed to Trump's lead, as anti-Trump support has been divided among numerous other candidates.
However, a poll conducted by Monmouth University in early September showed that in a hypothetical two-way race between Trump and almost all other Republican candidates, Trump would receive majority support in almost all cases.
He leads Carly Fiorina by 13 points, Marco Rubio by 14, Walker by 15, Jeb Bush by 19, and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie by 33 points each.
He's tied with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate Trump has to win?
If they were to be put up against each other, Ben Carson would beat businessman Trump by a whopping 18 points.
Just the majority of Donald Trump's supporters have said they've made a decision.
A new CBS/NYT poll Tuesday shows that just over half of Trump voters have decided who they're voting for.
Of course, the situation may change, and no one can be absolutely sure that he will never change his mind.
46% said they might change candidates.
Anyway, Trump's biggest competitor right now is another unlikely winner, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but those voters who said they made a decision are twice as likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Ever since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign speech two months ago, immigration has been at the center of the 2016 debate.
Some are concerned that Trump's dominance will drive Latino voters away from the Republican Party and hurt rebranding efforts.
According to a new ABC/Post poll released Monday, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So it seems that as long as immigration is at the center of things, so is Donald Trump.
Frustration with the government has reached a new high.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now have the support of about half of the Republican voters, largely due to their position outside of politics.
Six out of 10 Republicans said in an ABC/Post poll on Monday that they would rather elect someone outside of politics than someone with government experience.
They're also angry at the federal government.
A two-week-old Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa showed that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated with Republicans in Congress: 54 percent are "dissatisfied" and 21 percent are "really angry".
Jeremy Corbyn's first appearance at the Prime Minister's Question Time
Corbyn's first appearance in question hour has been eagerly awaited since his election.
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will meet David Cameron for the first time in a Prime Minister's Question Time.
Corbyn will rise to ask the first of his six questions shortly after noon, and his performance will likely be closely watched by both the media and Labour MPs.
Corbyn has been demanding for this weekly show "less theatre and more facts".
He has also said he could leave some of the opportunities for his colleagues to handle.
This meeting is the first parliamentary test of Corbyn's leadership since he was appointed to the shadow government and addressed the annual meeting of the Central Trades Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silent during the national anthem at a memorial service on Tuesday, the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has drawn criticism from Conservative MPs and made headlines.
Corbyn's decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention.
Corbyn's spokesman said he was "standing respectfully silent" and that he was "recognising the bravery of the Royal Air Force in the UK's air war".
Corbyn's shadow government member Owen Smith told BBC Two Newsnight that he would have urged the Labour leader to sing the national anthem even though he thought the King's House should be dissolved.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to be involved in Corbyn's inner circle, citing differences over economic, defence and foreign affairs.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that differences of opinion about the party's position in the European Union and the government's funding ceiling have "accumulated" even within the Labour Party since Corbyn's appointment.
Corbyn told a meeting of the Central Trades Union Congress that the Labour Party was proposing a change that would remove the whole ceiling.
Hours later, the shadow Labour and Pensions Secretary Smith said the party was "almost clear" that they were only opposed to the government's plans to lower the ceiling from £26,000 to £23,000.
Corbyn will become the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron in the last decade as leader of the Conservative Party.
The leader of the Labour Party has promised a new approach to politics and now says he has 'collected' ideas for questions to the Prime Minister, and received over 30 000 proposals.
Mr Corbyn, MP for Islington North, said the nature of the PM's questioning was too confrontational and that he would refrain from both clever rhetoric and sarcasm, promising instead to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges of young people.
Corbyn has said that the shadow government's finance secretary, Angela Eagle, acts as his substitute for questioning when Corbyn is not present - for example when Cameron is abroad.
Mr Corbyn has also suggested that other colleagues should also be allowed to speak at times and has said he has approached the speaker of the House, John Bercow, about the matter.
When Cameron took office in 2005, he said he wanted to move away from the political theatre often associated with prime minister's question-hours, but he later admitted he had failed.
Since it began to be broadcast in 1990, the Prime Minister's Question Time has been an important measure of the leader's discretion, his control of the House of Commons, and his standing with other MPs, although critics have criticised the Question Time as a mere mockery of far-reaching reforms.

The pound will rise as wages in Britain rise
The pound rose after the UK wage growth figures appeared to be rising and at the same time the FTSE 100 index rose with the offer of SABMiller.
Between May and July, wages in the United Kingdom, excluding bonuses, rose by 2.9% compared with the same period last year.
The growth rate was the fastest since 2009 and was seen as bringing with it expectations of higher exchange rates.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to USD 1,5505 and by 0.84% against the euro to EUR 1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index closed up 1.49% to 6229.21.
SABMiller was the most distinctive market share, rising by 20% after being approached by competitor AB InBev with an offer.
The agreement would link the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry's shares rose 0.9% after encouraging news from rival luxury group Richmond.
Richemont's latest sales figures were better than expected and also showed that sales in China, Burberry's key market, had started to grow again.
Glencore shares rose 5 percent after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion in an IPO as part of its debt-reduction strategy.
The stock of the packaging and paper group Mond was the biggest loser in the index, with a 4.3 percent drop after Goldman Sachs changed its recommendation for the company to sell.
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company disclosed its six-month pre-tax profit: an increase of 83% to £46.6 million.
JD Sports CEO says higher wages could hurt expansion
Peter Cowgill, CEO of JD Sports, says that if the minimum wage for workers is raised in the UK, it could mean that "potential consumers' purchasing power will increase".
However, this purchasing power is unlikely to outweigh the higher labour costs incurred by the company, Cowgill notes.
The costs could be directed towards the company's expansion plans, he added, which would mean fewer additional jobs.
Metcash is launching a grassroots campaign against the Aldi encroachment.
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from an attack by Aldi in South and Western Australia.
Grocery wholesaler Metcash has launched a grassroots campaign to defend the market share of IGA dealers in South and Western Australia ahead of Aldi's $700 million attack.
Aldi is preparing to open two distribution centres and the first store early next year in South and Western Australia, with up to 120 stores coming up, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food retailers and building the IGA brand through mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and purchasers have jumped on board, with brands such as Simmos, an ice cream maker from Dunsborough, offering tastings in IGA stores and shop owners selling discounted tickets to Australian rules football matches to their regular customers.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its defense strategy on September 29 when the food, alcohol and hardware wholesaler hosts its annual Investor Strategy Day.
The stakes are high, as South and Western Australia together account for almost 30% of Metcash's IGA retail area and have higher profit margins than Metcash's IGA network in the eastern states.
Shopping in South and Western Australia is notoriously cornered and IGA dealers have a much larger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, with more than 30% in the south and 24% in the west compared to 14% in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will capture around 5% of the food market in these two states within 12 months of opening the first stores, with revenue coming from all operators but mainly from independent retailers.
In his report this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimates that IGA dealerships could lose $360 million in annual sales and Metcash could lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in the South and 30 in the West next year, generating sales of between USD 500 million and USD 600 million in these regions.
The loss of food and food sales and quantities in Metcash's high fixed-cost base could cost Metcash about $13 million in operating profit losses before interest and taxes, Kierath said.
Meanwhile, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mainly to Ald and Coles, even though a recent Roy Morgan study found that IGA's customers were the most loyal of all.
Morgan Stanley believes that Metcash's food and beverage sales will decline by 3,8% in 2016, 4,1% in 2017 and 2,1% in 2018, reducing its market share from 14% in 2015 to 10,3% in 2020.
Last week, Hamish Douglass, the head of the investment fund and founder of Magellan Financial Group, said at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash could "very well lose money within a decade".
Metcash has refused to comment publicly on Douglas's comments.
However, it is understood that a member of Metcash's board contacted Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has fallen from 18% to 14% since 2010 and the revenues from Metcash's food and beverage business, which supplies products to around 1200 IGA dealers, have fallen by 43% since 2012, reflecting a reduction in debt financing of operations as sales and margins are under pressure.
However, the wholesaler has stood by its side, investing more than $150 million annually to bring prices down to the level of Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, helping IGA dealers refurbish stores by adding faster growing fresh food, and bringing a better selection of private label products to market.
Metcash CEO Ian Morrice says that the price cut and store improvements have increased its appeal and he hopes the wholesaler will return to a revenue growth path in 2017 for the first time in four years.
The Australian Tennis Federation President Steve Healy has expressed his support for Thanasi Kokkinakis .
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more credit than criticism for his behavior
Thanasi Kokkinakis, who has suffered as a bystander in the recent storm that has raged around his friend Nick Kyrgios, deserves credit for his behavior rather than criticism, says Australian Tennis Federation president Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger member of the talented duo known as Special Ks, was unwittingly exposed in a publicity stunt when Kyrgios teased Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly after, in a fiery qualifier in Cincinnati, the referee had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, when Harrison declared, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should have beaten that kid".
Although Kokkinakis was last seen tearing apart his bat after a cramp ruined his potential victory over Richard Gasquet at the US Open, Healy has been a stalwart defender of Kokkinakis.
As we speak, the young man is in Glasgow competing with Sam Groth for second place in a doubleheader with Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against Great Britain.
"I'm pretty sure Thanasi was just dragged into the mix", Healy said.
He broke his bat when he lost to a cramp at the US Open, but he's not the first player to break his bat in frustration, and I know Thanas well enough to know he's not proud of it.
But he's been acting out remarkably well, even in quite provocative situations at the US Open with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves credit.
He's got a great team around him, he's got a great family around him, and I think he's been treated a little rough.
He's very mature for a 19-year-old, he works hard, he fits in with the team and so on, and he's never had any problems with the other players, he's respected in the dressing room, he trains hard, he's in good shape and he's a pretty calm and mature young man, and I think he should be judged on his merits.
Healy has also supported the decision not to include Kyrgios in the important games starting on Friday, describing this 'joint decision' as a good solution for everyone, but still supporting the Canberra international's return to the team.
"We want the team to be fully focused on the games and not all the controversy around [Kyrgios]", Healy said.
And Nick has risen up really quickly, as Federer and Murray have pointed out, and he's growing up in public, and he's made some terrible mistakes and he deserves all the criticism he's got, but we're trying to support him, we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's best for both the team and for him if he spends some time out of public view and reflects on those consequences.
European migration crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes borders, detains migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency and closed its southern border with Serbia to stop people trying to enter the country illegally.
Chaos ensued at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in the neutral zone, and the Serbian authorities reacted with consternation.
People fleeing violence in their home countries have now pitched their tents and settled indefinitely on a stretch of road between the two countries' checkpoints.
But frustration grew.
As the police helicopter stopped overhead, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian riot police.
Some refused food and water in protest.
The Serbian Foreign Minister declared that it was 'impossible to accept' the return of migrants from Hungary, with more and more arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
 (((Serbia) wants to be part of the solution, not cause harm to civilians.
The European Union is committed to a comprehensive approach to the fight against terrorism.
The conflict on the border between Hungary and Serbia followed the failure of the 28-nation group to reach a contentious meeting on a common immigration policy in Brussels.
The Ministers agreed on the sharing of responsibility for the 40,000 asylum seekers who have now taken over Italy and Greece, and spoke with optimism about reaching a final agreement - by next month or the end of next year - on which EU countries will take in 120 000 additional refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria are calling for an extra EU summit next week to discuss the continent's migrant crisis.
Hungary, however, does not expect its neighbours or Brussels to act anytime soon.
Tuesday's state of emergency in two southern regions gave authorities greater powers to respond to a crisis, allowing roads to be closed and asylum cases to be expedited.
At the same time, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said that now that the fence on the Serbian border is complete, the country also plans to erect a barbed wire fence on part of its border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants through the country.
CBS News correspondent Charlie DAgata reports that even prisoners were being recruited to complete the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become the main bottleneck and destination for refugees arriving in the European Union, many of whom are fleeing the war in Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has argued that most of the arrivals are economic refugees seeking a better life, rather than war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is in stark contrast to other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, now criminalize attempting to cross or damage the 13-foot (4 m) barbed wire fence the government has built on the southern border with Serbia and include longer prison sentences for convicted traffickers.
Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We are very clear on this point: crossing the border illegally is a crime.
Parliament still has to formally approve the deployment of troops expected next week, but Associated Press reporters have been seeing heavily armed military personnel with vehicles and dogs at the border for days.
Orban's domestic security adviser, Gyorgy Bakondi, said authorities had arrested 45 people trying to cross the border, as well as 15 who had already made it further into the country.
They were able to cross the fence by breaking the fence, and are now in police custody, charged with offences under the new laws.
The authorities will fix the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossings on the border with Serbia on Tuesday morning after sending a train covered in barbed wire to close one of them.
The main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, was shrouded in chaos as Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container for people to be processed and mobs tried to break in.
About 20 of them got in, but thousands stayed out.
One group of migrants blocked the main highways between Serbia and Hungary, saying they would refuse food and drink until they were allowed into Hungary.
2016 election: National polls show Hillary Clinton's lead over Bernie Sanders has narrowed by half.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to lead the Democratic nomination race in double digits, but Senator Bernie Sanders is scolding her.
Clinton now has 47% of the Democratic vote (down from 58%) and second-place Sanders has 27% (up from 17%).
Vice President Joe Biden has not yet announced whether he will run for president, but he has the support of 15 percent of the Democratic voters.
With more than five months to go before the primary, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say who they will vote for.
But Clinton's supporters are more determined to support their own choice than the other candidates.
Clinton's popularity has declined in several demographic groups since the CBS News Poll last month, while Sanders has risen somewhat.
Clinton is a strong leader in women and moderates, but her lead has narrowed.
His popularity among men has dropped dramatically, and Sanders is only 5 percentage points behind.
Clinton's lead in the under-50 Democratic vote has been lost, and she's now tied with Sanders.
But Clinton is clearly ahead of older voters.
Last month, Clinton led Sanders by double digits over the Liberals, but now Sanders leads this group by five percentage points.
About half of the Democratic voters in the country say they would support Clinton enthusiastically if she becomes the party's nominee.
A quarter say they would support him with certain reservations, and 15% would support him simply because he is a candidate.
Six percent would not support him at all.
It is not surprising that Clinton's current supporters are very likely to be eager to support her.
Opinion is more mixed among those who currently do not support Clinton, with only a quarter enthusiastically supporting her.
While 48 percent of Democratic voters say they would support Clinton enthusiastically, fewer Republican voters (35 percent) say the same about Republican front man Donald Trump.
When Clinton supporters were asked in an open-ended question why they wanted her to run, the most popular answer was that she had the appropriate experience (16 percent), followed by the most popular answers being that now is the time for a female president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also mentioned her connection to Bill Clinton (9 percent).
The same views and the possibility of being elected were also mentioned.
Because the vice president has a significant impact on the Democratic presidential nomination, 57 percent of the voters would like to see him in the race, even if a third disagree.
When asked by Democratic voters who they would choose as the next nominee for the party, Biden is the most popular choice.
More than half of Clinton's supporters say they'd vote for Biden, who is far more popular than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to seek the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders will increase, and if Biden does, he'll lead by 20 percentage points, but if he doesn't, he'll lead by 30.
55% of Democratic voters believe Clinton has the best chance of winning the presidency, but that number is down from 78% last month.
On that scale, Biden is a long way off, but the percentage of people who think he's the most votable has increased.
When Democratic voters were asked what was most important about a candidate, however, they put opinion above voter turnout.
And last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate was considered an impossible candidate for these voters.
The Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, do very well on certain key issues among their party's voters.
Most people see Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest, trustworthy, strong leaders.
Biden's best performance of the three is honesty, while Clinton's strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as Sanders (15%), but 27 percent say they have no opinion of Sanders.
Democratic voters also generally view Clinton, Sanders and Biden as ideologically aligned.
When you look at all these things, about a quarter of the Democratic voters say they have no opinion of Sanders.
While questions remain about Hillary Clinton's use of her personal email address and server while she was secretary of state, most Democratic voters are satisfied with her explanation and say it did not affect their general opinion of her.
But it's a different story when you look at America as a whole.
Half the Americans are now dissatisfied with his explanation, and only about a third are.
Public opinion was divided in March soon after the matter came to light.
Most Americans say that the email controversy has not affected their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has declined.
More than six out of 10 Republicans say their opinion of Clinton has changed for the worse.
Although Clinton's own party voters consider her honest and trustworthy, she still has a problem with this among all registered voters: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, a figure that has fallen by 8 percentage points since last month and 15 percentage points since May.
62% of registered voters say they don't think Clinton is honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of registered voters nationwide also don't think Trump is honest and trustworthy.
But both Clinton and Trump are considered good leaders.
Of the six candidates in the survey, Biden, Carson and Bush are considered the most honest.
Sanders is generally considered honest, but there are many who have no opinion of him, and neither does Carson.
The margin of error in the survey of 351 Democratic voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is approaching Donald Trump in a national poll.
Ben Carson is closing in on Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll.
Two candidates in the new poll garnered half the vote, leaving the rest to fight for the seat.
Republican voters across the country are still strongly in favor of Trump, whose support has risen from 23 percent in the last CBS poll, conducted before Fox News's primary debate last month, to 27 percent in the poll released Tuesday.
However, Carson's share rose dramatically from 6 percent to 23 percent during that same period.
The poll also found that Carson is doing well with a variety of demographic groups and is pushing Trump out of the top tier of Republican voters.
The rest of the field is lagging behind, except for Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, and Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker has dropped the most, from 10 percent last month to 2 percent today.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are tied for third at 6%.
The margin of error in this latest survey of 376 Republican voters, conducted in September, is +/- 6 percent.
The latest CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson is on the rise in the polls, with 19 percent of Republicans supporting him, and Trump ahead of him at 32 percent.
Also, according to the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll, Trump was well ahead of Carson.
As Carson's popularity soared last week, Trump criticized the retired neurosurgeon unnecessarily, even though Carso apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said last Saturday during a campaign trip to Iowa.
Five fraternity members are accused of the death of a first-year student at Baruch College .
Nearly two years after a student was killed at a fraternity cheer ceremony in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people have been charged with murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity at Baruch College in New York City brutally attacked Chun Michael Deng during a membership rite in September 2013 and then delayed his transportation to the hospital, contributing to his death, police said.
Authorities say Deng was blindfolded and had a 50-pound bag of sand loaded on his back, after which he was repeatedly knocked to the ground as he tried to walk across the icy field toward the goal.
Finally, Deng complained of a headache, after which he lost consciousness.
Instead of calling the emergency number after Deng fainted, the brothers allegedly waited an hour before taking him to the hospital, police say.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, search the Internet for information about his symptoms, and contact the national president of the fraternity, Andy Meng, for advice, Police Chief Chris Wagner told a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide their ritual equipment and thus put the welfare of the brotherhood ahead of Michael Deng", said Police Chief Wagner.
They couldn't get Deng to wake up, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng received repeated blunt force trauma to the head, torso and thighs.
Too many families have suffered from fraternal animosity, with at least one student dying every year since 1970, said Doug Fierberg, lawyer for Deng's family.
The congregations and their members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is important.
The Monroe County grand jury has ruled that the first five members of the jury be charged with third-degree murder.
32 other members of the Brotherhood, including Meng, are also facing charges of violent mugging and criminal conspiracy.
'We do not want to hold only individuals accountable.If there is an organisation behind what happened, whether it has officially or unofficially accepted the situation, they must also be held accountable,' Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity severed its ties to the local chapter.
This is what happens when the U.S. central bank raises interest rates.
Interest rates will rise, and the bull market will crash, bond yields will rise, and the economy will be forced into recession.
We know this.
What we don't know is how long this is all going to take or how long it's going to take.
The past does little to help timing, especially when it comes to the economy.
The onset of recession has lasted from the first upturn sometimes as little as 11 months, sometimes as long as 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the US central bank in raising interest rates has often, though not always, been a determining factor in the response of the economy and financial assets.
That is why U.S. central bank officials have stressed so forcefully that investors should focus not on the beginning of interest rate hikes but on the development of the time frame for normalization.
There are, indeed, several variables in the equation.
However, in the end, market participants may find that all the hype surrounding the rate hike has been exaggerated.
The central bank's first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as the end of the cheap money era, said Julian Jessop, chief global economist at Capital Economics, in a message to clients.
Instead, we do not expect the gradual return to normal, albeit still low, of U.S. interest rates to be the kind of revolutionary shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that it will not have effects.
The following is an overview of how some sectors will react to past developments:
As the market has seen over the last month or so, waiting for the interest rate to rise can make things unstable.
When the promotion comes to pass, the effect is not so dramatic.
Return on capital appears to have a tendency to stagnate for 12-24 months after the first increase, possibly reflecting a delay in monetary policy, Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after a central bank increase.
More specifically, over the last 35 years or so, markets have generally been strong, rising about 14% when approaching a raise, after 250 days the situation is fairly flat (averaging 2.6%), and after 500 days the normalcy has been reached with an average return of 14.4% over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis by Bob Doll, chief capital strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
According to Deutsche Bank, the effect on shares is usually more pronounced later in the cycle when returns start to fall.
Recessions are part of economic life, but interest rates often contribute to their income.
In the current situation, the central bank faces certain challenges that have not been experienced before and which may accelerate the recession.
This is particularly true of GDP, which will be near its lowest ever before the central bank raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 withdrawals since 1950, nominal annual GDP has been below 4.5 percent only twice.
While the figure was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will hold up after the third quarter has progressed by 1.5 percent, reports the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta.
Raising interest rates in such a fragile economic environment can be risky and raises the question of whether this time will be different, Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been preparing for the Fed's rate hike all year, and everyone is looking forward to this week's Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which ends Thursday.
Although many strategists and economic experts believe the committee can approve the increase at this meeting, futures trading predicts only a 25% probability.
Our study shows that all upward cycles since 1950 have so far been supercycles of increasing leverage, with GDP surpassing its pre-recession peak very quickly after the recovery has begun, says the report.
On the contrary, there has been an unusually slow recovery from the worst recession in the observation period.
In the current cycle, the central bank has waited the longest to end the last recession, a record 35 months, and is now in its 74th month.
The fixed income has also been volatile in the market in anticipation of interest rate increases and the model is somewhat similar to the findings on capital.
The main difference is that when the central bank changes its policy, the effects are more quickly reflected in bonds than in shares.
The trend of bond yields appears to change immediately at the first increase/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the upside cycle, the yield on the bonds will fall immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab strategists believe that the increase in interest rates will bring about a convergence of longer-term and shorter-term bond yields, thus leveling the yield curve.
High yield bonds often perform better in this situation, although we are still cautious about seeking a yield, said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Surprisingly, Jones believes that the market has already adjusted to the central bank's line expectations.
In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are several signs that the market has adjusted to the outlook for tighter monetary policy, he wrote.
High shortterm interest rates, a flatter yield curve, higher credit margins and higher volatility are all characteristic of the market in the context of a tightening of the central bank's policy.
Generally, companies with a major presence in the United States benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive.
Multinational corporations with a lot of debt are doing worse when the dollar appreciation makes their products more expensive on the world market and their debt becomes more expensive than what they have financing for.
History shows that quality stocks are generally more profitable in the three months following the first interest payment, Goldman Sachs analysts said in their report to clients.
The companies with a high turnover outperformed the companies with a low turnover by an average of five percentage points after the increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high returns on capital and low volatility stocks performed better than lower quality companies, with the former averaging 4 (percentage points) and the latter 3 (percentage points).
The debt is gonna be a big problem.
Those companies with a lot of variable-rate debt are the ones that are losing the most, Goldman said.
Beyond the stock market, consumers have the opportunity to benefit from the dollar's appreciation.
Savers can also benefit from higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly the effect will be felt.
BBC Radio is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham accuses the channel of "populism".
He claims that it is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish it from its commercial competitor.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they were just a copy of the Brit Awards.
My fellow Congressman Damien Collins criticized The Voice, saying it was not original either.
BBC Radio 3 is "turning" into Classic FM, claims a leading MP, adding to the pressure on the production company to prove it does something commercial production companies don't.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told BBC executives that the public service radio station seemed to "publicise" its content and that it was becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish from a commercial competitor.
"It seems that Radio 3 - I don't like to use the term 'national broadcaster' - is becoming Classic FM", he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which were launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, launched last year, only looks different from the Brit Awards, which are held under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are two examples that I can remember straight away where you're actually just copying something that's already on the market", Bingham said.
The BBC's chief executive has denied the allegations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial rivals in terms of live music and sharing information with the public.
Radio 3 teaches me things about classical music that I can't learn anywhere else.
Its commitment to live music and music making is, in fact, first-rate.
In addition, I think it is very important that Radio 3 is committed to finding new music and ordering new works, he said.
Earlier this year, Alan Davey, head of BBC Radio 3, argued that the channel had to do more than ever to reach its audience because the British know less about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only part of the BBC's offer which was criticised for stepping on the toes of commercial competitors during the hearing of the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport.
Conservative Tory MP Damien Collins has criticised The Voice, a music competition the BBC bought from Dutch production company Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed, because it is not original and it is by no means unique?
Lord Hall claimed that this BBC1 programme, with Paloma Faith and Boy George as star judges, was produced very much in the style of the BBC.
He added that he wanted the production company to find success from the comfort of its own home the next time it started an entertainment series.
However, he refused to block the production of future seasons of The Voice, or to order that license fee money be used for other entertainment formats.
Online sales rose at their lowest point in August, Black Friday may be the reason
The Commission established the profitability of the sampled Union producers by expressing the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.
Last month, the rise was the lowest since the beginning of statistics in 2000.
Three years ago, online sales were boosted by the use of mobile devices to make purchases.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November may curb consumption
Online shopping has exploded for over a decade, turning many of Britain's shopping streets into ghost towns.
However, experts say that there are now signs of a flattening of online sales, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase for the first quarter of 2015.
Total expenditure in August was the slowest since the statistics began in 2000, rising by only 5% on the previous year.
Experts say there are signs of a flattening of online sales, with the latest figures showing only a 7% increase for the first quarter of 2015.
If you look at the growth levels of previous years and go back to 2000, it was clear that the situation would improve over time, Andy Mulcahy, editor of the JMRG sales index, told the Guardian.
He explained that three years ago, online sales were boosted when shoppers began using their mobile phones to make purchases.
It meant that more people were shopping online, and that they could do it in different environments, like on a couch.
But now it's flattening out, and it can go down.
The American Black Friday phenomenon has been cited as one reason for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that consumers will curb their shopping before the last Friday in November.
Last year, five times the average number of shoppers swarmed their computers to grab deals, taking down many of their merchants' websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, which has caused shoppers to quarrel over finds, may curb shopping
A study published by the British Retail Consortium found that only about one in five pounds was spent online.
For certain products, such as televisions and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made online.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than using fashion chains on shopping carts.
Muslims bury dead in Mecca for lift accident, consequences for bin Laden family
Muslims carried 29 dead bodies through the streets during the first burial in Mecca
Saudi Arabia has blamed the collapse in part on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group .
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured when the hoist collapsed.
Twenty-nine bodies were carried through the streets as hundreds of Muslims gathered to bury them, all of them killed when a hoist collapsed in the Great Mosque of Mecca.
The mourners, mostly dressed in white, filled the route to honor the first of the dead who made their final journey to Al-Moaissem's cemetery.
The sad procession passed a holy place where just a few days earlier a crowbar had fallen through the roof of a mosque and toppled worshippers.
The bodies were released for burial after the Saudi king confirmed that the bin Laden family's construction company was responsible for the disaster, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 worshippers were carried through the streets after a collapsed elevator in the Great Mosque of Mecca killed them .
Among the dead was Qasim Akram, a father of four from Bolton in the Manchester area, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Akram had been at the Grand Mosque with his parents before the start of the annual Hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi officials have already vowed to resume the Hajj to Mecca as thousands continue to pour into the city.
Today, King Salman said that the Binladin Group should not have left the crane up for a quarter of an hour when it was not in use.
The Saudi Press Agency, a state-run news agency, published an Arabic version of the decision, saying that the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The English-language news service did not mention this detail, but it did say that company executives are prohibited from traveling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to find out what caused the crane to fall into the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered ahead of a Hajj pilgrimage later this month.
Binladin Group has not issued any statements on the disastrous collapse and its representatives have not been contacted for comment.
The Royal Decree also accused the association of not using up-to-date protection measures and of not cooperating with the meteorological authorities.
There are dozens of elevators around the Great Mosque of Mecca, part of a massive construction project led by the Binladin Group.
The Binladin family has been close to the Saudi ruling family for decades, and it leads major construction projects.
The late Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was a rebellious boy who was disowned by his family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred in windy and rainy weather just days before millions of people arrive in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that every able-bodied Muslim must make at least once in his life.
Officials say 158 people are still in the hospital.
Authorities ordered a million rials (£174,000) to be paid to the families of the dead and the permanently injured.
The rest of the injured will get half of this.
B&Q boss says Eastern European cheap workers are behind the trend
British people are increasingly using the services of helpers, says Veronique Laury
The number of professionals from Eastern Europe is on the rise
The result is 200 more professional Screwfix stores.
Meanwhile, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores nationwide.
Writer Rupert Steiner, city correspondent for the Daily Mail.
It is said that the British are giving up their hammers and paintbrushes and are hiring skilled Eastern European workers to do housework
It seems if you're good with a hammer or a handyman at painting walls, you're in the minority these days.
The British are increasingly hiring assistants to do DIY jobs in their homes, says the head of the company behind B&Q.
Veronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, a home repair chain, said that the popularity is due to the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe and the fact that they offer their services at a bargain price.
This will result in Kingfisher planning to open 200 new Screwfix stores for workers and close 60 B&Q stores.
Laury said he wants more women to work at B&Q stores because eight out of ten purchase decisions made in the store are made by the most beautiful sex.
Nowadays, most of the staff are men.
He said that changes in population must be taken into account: there are now more single-woman households, with more home improvement work than ever before.
Laury said: "Most of the staff in our stores are still men.
We need to find a better balance.
But half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of the purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women play a major role in decisionmaking.
Laury is one of only five women to lead the UK's FTSE100 companies and has reorganised her management team to include an equal number of men and women.
Kingfisher is almost the only company in the group with exactly 50% women, including its CEO and CFO.
Laury said: 'This was a conscious decision - diversity is important here.
It hasn't been difficult to find good women on the board.
Kingfisher reported a decrease in both six months' revenue and sales after the group took on the costs of closing stores.
As a result of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, is opening 200 new stores.
The three-star government decided to resort to coercive legislation to save the country's economy.
It was a pretty quick time to get the effects.
The sharp head of the SAK and other workers' organizations was immediately forced to stand up and as a result the country stood on Friday in the face of a large demonstration by workers.
A lot of people think that makes sense.
We're asking if we should strike when things are bad enough.
They've even formed a resistance movement.
More than 50,000 people have already gone online to say they will not participate in the demonstration and will go to work.
In the good old days of consensus, this would have been impossible.
Of course, there was no Internet to protest, but to openly declare yourself a rich man would have been political suicide for a small person.
The protest of a few tens of thousands of people from a union of millions of members is not a moment, but it is a cause for thought.
The position of the trade union movement is not as clear as it was 20 years ago.
Not everyone knows the goals of the movement, the values have changed.
From the point of view of the interest in Ay's activities, the government's drastic solutions can also be seen as a direct gift from heaven.
After years of seemingly unending negotiations, unions are finally getting to the point of defending workers' rights in a visible and appropriate way.
The government may thus wish to strengthen the role of the ay movement, when union membership is perhaps seen as more necessary than before.
Whatever one thinks of the actions of the organisations, it is nonsense that a demonstration on Friday would somehow stop Finland.
Finland has stopped a long time ago.
For example, industrial production has been in decline for 31 consecutive months.
GDP continues to fall and unemployment is rising.
You'd think these things would be on everyone's mind.
University of Lappeenranta to make a big savings: target of 8.5 million savings, staff cut by 130
The Technical University of Lappeenranta is launching a cost-cutting programme aimed at reducing costs by a total of EUR 8.5 million.
As part of the savings, the university will start staff-wide consultations with an annual savings target of €6.5 million.
In practice, this means a reduction of about 130 employees.
The other activities are also expected to save two million.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the Greek authorities on the measures taken by the Greek authorities to implement the restructuring plan.
The government's budget cuts also have an impact.
This fiscal year, the university is running a deficit of about $2.6 million.
The expenditure will increase slightly next year, but at the same time the funding from the Ministry will decrease by EUR 2 million and other funding by EUR 3.2 million.
The total budget of the University is about EUR 85 million, so the savings target is 10% of the total budget.
The combined effect of massive cuts in teaching and research and a reduction in corporate funding is very significant for our university", says Rector Anneli Pauli in a university press release.
Before the summer, the impact of the cuts appeared to be even more moderate, but now the reduction in supplementary funding is showing new proportions.
Negotiations with the trustees will begin next Tuesday and will last six weeks, as required by law.
Onnibus wants to join Finnish railways
The owner of the low-cost bus company Onnibus, Sir Brian Souter, a British citizen, tells YLE that the company also aims to provide rail services in Finland.
I'm very interested in joining the Finnish railway.
My company, Stagecoach, is one of the biggest railway companies in Britain, Souter says.
The railway sector is to be opened up to competition gradually.
The first is the metropolitan area in 2017-2018.
After the local traffic, the long-distance traffic.
Souter says he's already reached out to the Department of Transportation.
The Department of Transportation welcomes the Onnibus' plans, according to Yle.
Among other international companies, at least Transdev (formerly Veolia), which also operates bus services in Finland and rail services in the rest of Europe, has expressed an interest in rail transport.
The US central bank has to make decisions about interest rates .
The rest of the world will watch as the U.S. central bank meets for two days on Wednesday and Thursday to make a critical decision on whether to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economists found that just over half of those who last week believed the central bank would raise rates now believe the situation is not yet resolved and that rates will remain at the current level of 0 to 0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, because it is seven years since the central bank cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching a situation where the central bank has the opportunity to move out of the zero-level and start normalising interest rates, said Angel Ubide, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has been doing relatively well, and the recovery has brought trillions of dollars to the balance sheet and created little inflation.
However, the central bank cannot ignore the less rosy global outlook.
It has warned the market to be prepared for a raise, but the signs are that they also believe that the odds are against a raise.
The decision will be published on Thursday at 20:00 (CET).
The shooter at Delta State University left a note apologizing .
After shooting his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - before shooting his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "sorry" for the first murder and hoped "it could be undone", authorities said Tuesday.
Mississippi Gautier Police said Lamb, a professor of geography and social sciences at Delta State University, called 911 around 10:00 a.m.
Monday and told me he shot and killed someone.
Lamb told the defendant that the police had to send officers to his home.
He said he killed his wife last night and also mentioned that there's a lovely dog in the house who doesn't bother anyone but is probably upset.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he wouldn't tell them.
Lamb didn't give an explanation for the shooting.
When police arrived, they found the body of 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a note written by 45-year-old Lamb that read, "I'm so sorry. I wish I could undo it.
I loved Amy and she was the only person who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove nearly 300 miles to Delta State, where he killed history teacher Ethan Schmidt, before finally killing himself late Monday while surrounded by police.
William LaForge, president of the university, said that as far as he knew, there was no conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "clearly there was something in Lamb's mind".
Authorities said Tuesday that despite claims published Monday that Lamb believed Prentiss was in a relationship with Schmidt, there was "no knowledge or evidence" of any "triple drama".
Shawn O'Steen said that he was married to Prentiss for about seven years and described him as "a good person".
The couple split 15 years ago, but they remained friends.
O'Steen told me that he and Prentiss had a 19-year-old daughter who is "shocked".
O'Steen said that Prentiss and her daughter were best friends.
According to Lindsay Knowles, Prentiss was working online from home, and according to the Sun Herald, Knowles was a close friend of Prentiss's.
Knowles told me that Prentiss, who had a dog named Lightning, had been dating Lamb for about three years.
"She always wanted to help other people", Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called his family sometime on Monday to tell them he wasn't going to jail.
When officers caught up with Lamb on Highway 1 near Greenville later that evening, Lamb pulled over, left his car on the side of the road, and ran into the woods, where he shot himself.
Lamb graduated with a degree in education from Delta State in the spring of 2015, according to a resume on the university's website.
Stars Who Lost Their Charm
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a rough few years.
In 2001, he was diagnosed with leukemia, and in 2009, his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, died of cancer.
Rumor has it he also had a drug problem, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All this really does require a tax.
Manchester United 's Luke Shaw has been out for months with a double fracture .
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture to his right leg in Manchester United's Champions League loss to PSV Eindhoven.
Despite the defender being in tears and out for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is hopeful that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The injury was caused by a reckless tackle by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after 20-year-old Shaw had rushed into PSV's territory.
He was treated in the field for nine minutes and had to be rushed to the hospital on oxygen.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double fracture in his leg and he is in hospital now".
He's being moved tomorrow or maybe the day after, and then he's going to be operated on in Manchester.
This is terrible, this kid comes to Manchester United at 18, he's in trouble, and then he plays great, and now this happens.
When I was in the locker room, he was wearing an oxygen mask.
She was crying.
I'm no doctor, but a double fracture takes at least six months, and he's not playing in the blocks.
I hope he gets to play this season.
Moreno seemed lucky to get a red card and a penalty.
Referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican player.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian journalist was wrong.
You can judge for yourself when I say it was a penalty and a red card.
That was a really bad two-legged tackle.
Shaw tweeted: "Thank you all for your messages, words cannot express how disappointed I am, my recovery begins now, I will come back stronger".

The English defender will have an extra boost to his recovery next June at the European Championships in France.
PSV coach Phillip Cocu said: "It's a really bad injury".
If a player is out with an injury like this, everybody's very sad.
Our players never intend to hurt their opponents.
Moreno broke his leg playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
Moreno takes this very hard because the intention is not to hurt the opponent, and when he hears that the injury is really bad, it's a bad thing, Cocu said.
I didn't see you in that situation.
The only thing I saw was the ball going the other way, so it looked like he [Moreno] was touching it, but I didn't see Luke's tackle.
Moreno told SBS6: "I know how it feels, I know how difficult this can be.
I feel terrible about this, I'm so sorry.
PSV's Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital after being challenged by Chris Smalling.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better than that, doesn't he?
Every parent soon learns one thing: If your child loves a book, it will not be long before he or she is practically memorizing it.
Unless you are David Cameron.
When asked by a holiday childcare service what his favorite children's book was, the prime minister chose Dr. Seuss's The Lorax, an environmental story published in 1971.
The choice was difficult, Cameron writes in a message posted on the SuperCamps website, adding: Funny, moving, creative and with a strong message. I enjoy reading this book to my children because it always seems to have a picture or message that we have not seen before.
All of this is true, but the next line, in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book, is a summary of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to fill in the rather brief original text.
In the walled city of Tarville, where all nature has vanished and even air is a commodity, Ted the boy hopes to win the heart of the girl of his dreams by fulfilling Audrey's wish to see the real tree, the lyrics tell and describe a love story that was not written by Dr. Seuss, whose real name was Theodor Seuss Geisel, who died in 1991.
If this is not suspicious enough, Cameron's line sounds like it was taken from a plot summary of the Lorax movie found on the Internet Movie Database website, which begins: "In the walled town of Tarville, where everything is artificial and even air is a commodity, Ted the boy hopes to win the heart of his dream girl Audrey".
Given that Cameron is a publicly active parent, it seems unlikely that he would be so unfamiliar with the plot of the book, in which a young, unnamed boy hears how the local nature has been destroyed by the greedy, wood-cutter and tool-cutter Kerskanen, disregarding the short, mustachioed creature that gave the story its name, the Lorax, who "speaks for the trees".
This relatively invisible PR task is probably outsourced to an assistant who apparently has never read a book to a child 20 times in a row.
The Prime Minister's spokesman said the text was likely to have come from Cameron's constituency office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameron's staff, but did not comment further at this time.
Adam Lyth was clearly in danger of being left out of the England squad, but it was still a tough spot.
Playing Pakistan in the UAE is a tough job, but when you look at the team England have chosen for the tour, I don't think it's likely that we'll repeat the 3-0 series we lost last time.
I wouldn't rule out a guest win.
Alastair Cook's side may be less experienced than the team three years ago, but they have some good dribblers and a strong mentality: they have no scars from 2012, just youthful positivity.
Moeen Ali is improving in his round-robin rounds and Adil Rashid is a forward option, although he's an unknown player at this level.
Adam Lyth has been dropped from the England cricket team and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to leave Adam Lyth's team is understandably difficult for me to analyse, as I am his head coach at Yorkshire.
His seven games have been good against strikers in challenging conditions, and the simple but harsh truth is that cricketers are judged by their performance.
For example, there was no uncertainty about Joe Root's selection before the announcement because, as I said before, the players are the best selectors.
A hundred points more, and Lyth could have continued his time on the team, but he was responsible for his own fate.
Hopefully, if he gets more runs for Yorkshire, he'll get another chance.
England's head coach Trevor Bayliss praised Lyth's attitude even when he wasn't performing as well as he could have, and I'm not surprised.
It's hard to answer the question of how long a hitter has to leave a mark.
Lyth was selected for the national team seven times, as was Sam Robson before him, while Nick Compton was selected nine times.
Compton was the only one who got to play both home and away.
The only complaint is that England chose Jonathan Trott to play for the Caribbean when Lyth was at its peak, but that missed opportunity is now a thing of the past.
Alex Hales is coming with us, and he's got a punch I appreciate.
He has in him, as a cricketer, something that we in Yorkshire saw early in the season when he scored 236 against us at Trent Bridge.
He must be given at least the same chance as others before him, but of course this depends on the composition of the team in the UAE.
There's been a lot of talk about Moen opening with Cook, getting an extra pitcher on the field but keeping four fastballs, and I'm not against that.
I don't see why a batsman couldn't bat there, and this left-hander has already proven himself to be quite a cricketer.
Moeen may not have done his duty in the county of Worcestershire, but he's three to them, and it makes little difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 games in the first slump before moving to the starting lineup in 2001.
He scored 300 points in one day and he didn't remember the past.
Zafar Ansari joins the team as a backup, and, from the little I've done with him, he seems like a very impressive young man.
People can look at his unadorned stats, batting average 31, with the ball at 35, and think it's a gamble, but there aren't many pitchers available, and the selectors picked the young ones.
He's gonna learn a lot on this tour.
Outside the team, England seem to have a few tough additions to the coaching side.
The appointment of Sri Lankan batsman Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the games may prove to be a sign of genius.
He's one of the nicest guys in the game, and he brings a tremendous amount of experience with him because he's done everything in all situations and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood joins the White Ball games, bringing with him both energy and a relentless flickering.
I've always thought he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether playing or coaching, and he has the same intelligence as Mahella.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room can refresh the team, even if their message is the same as before.
I mean, Colin's teammate from Durham, Ben Stokes, is resting in the ODIs, Root was given a similar break against Australia, and I certainly have no problem with that.
Even if not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors don't make schedules.
And we have to remember that just like the players, their work depends on the results.
These are never decisions made lightly.
If the economy is in trouble in 2017, Brexit supporters may take the win
David Cameron's half-hearted re-negotiation strategies to keep Britain in the EU are facing increasing problems every day, even if we do not take into account the heartfelt Jeremy Is it yes or no? Corbyn's choice for the leadership of the Labour Party or the Central Trades Union Congress's anger at Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their own Corbyns and Nigel Farage.
A European diplomat recently explained that because the EU is so deeply embroiled in a variety of crises, not all of which are its own fault, some Member States are fed up with the self-centred agenda of Britain, full of divisive concessions and disturbing treaty changes that most of these countries do not want.
At its annual meeting in Brighton, the Central Trades Union Congress decided that it too would not want them if they undermined social protection.
We could call it Dave and George's selfie agenda.
The Prime Minister and the Minister of Finance are late for summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument with or without a local icon, and then come home saying they are winning supporters for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants to look outside the EU tent of Britain - "Don't leave us alone with France", they say of Berlin - suggests that the most shortsighted ministers and officials in certain capitals are now at a point where they don't care if we stay or if we leave.
The German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, a cautious and moderate ally, has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave before it goes to waste, as happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Holland of France is up for re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's a force that's fading, too.
Poland could soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It is difficult to see these countries sacrificing themselves for the self-absorbed when their energy should be directed rather at preventing Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom - they do not want that either because of their own similar separatist tendencies.
So, my friend suggests, some of these ministers may even be deliberately planning to make useless remarks in the style of the Scottish National Party during the 2017 UK referendum campaign to speed up the Brexit process.
The renegotiations were a setup and the renegotiations had no relevance for Britain.
Europeans have had a hard time seeing how greedy the Fleet Street press can be and how EU-skeptic the press monopoly is, which it was not at the time of the Tony Benn-inspired referendum in 1975 when our membership, which began in 1973, was confirmed at a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the greatest European opportunist who made a name for himself writing about the "straight bananas of the EU" as a correspondent in Brussels in the early 1990s.
Ed Miliband may have been a fool, but at least he knew who his enemies were.
They included a number of tax-evading scammers, foreigners who hacked phones, and individuals who are nominally resident elsewhere and who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same thing about them, but he realized that if you're in a cage with a craving gorilla, you have to give up bananas for the sake of the illusion, unless you want to be on that gorilla's lunch list and later on at dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair himself in his opposition to Cameron's renegotiation move, as Bair had conceded the principle behind the rejected EU constitution, which was rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, thus giving Blair a way out of the situation.
And the press never forgave him for that, either.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn who patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday (I told him he had no time to waste on me) seems in danger of re-adopting Neil Kinnock's 1980s boycott of Murdock strategy, which was a mistake then and now.
While it may take time, he must develop a coherent strategy to reach out to the media, not to me, but no doubt to Andrew Murray, whose BBC couch Corbyn left on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position in Europe is, to put it beautifully, evolving.
He says he would like us to remain in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside the UK Independence Party, the war painting fanatics of the UKIP and the more fierce nationalists of the Conservative Party can certainly support this view.
Mr Benn said this on both radio and television this week, when his inner scout would have liked to admit that Corbyn's choice to appoint the tough John McDonnell as Shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his great-grandfather was on TV trying to be disloyal to his Labour colleagues in government without losing his seat.
Hilary's little prank was more tempting.
But the fight to stay in the situation no matter what - Ben's statement - was not what McDonnell said, and it is not what Corbyn told the chiefs and MPs in a private meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the non-hierarchical, emotional and personal image that Corbyn wants to convey (remember he even touched me), communication discipline is important in an age of 24-hour TV, and especially in the swirl of social media, which is a welcome breeding ground for paranoia and fraud.
As Mr McDonnell has said, it is only fair not to give Mr Cameron a free pass to Europe by allowing him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted.
At least that's what Simon Jenkins thinks.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic spin on EU membership (and in line with their Bennite regulated economy and anti-capitalist past) is no longer just a difficult debate among left-wing thinkers for whom narcissism of small differences is central to doctrinal dogma.
As for his ambivalence about NATO (Tom Watson is convinced that Corby is not campaigning to surrender), foreign diplomats will just have to try to explain it to their superiors.
Why should Paris or Berlin (which have suspicious voters too) waste political capital on concessions to Britain when it may be completely useless?
The United States is already somewhat disappointed by the poor British military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even under a conservative government that is cutting costs, as I was reminded at the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Experts criticize the e-cigarette assessment by Public Health England
Researchers have said that the government-funded agency's claim that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than traditional ones originated from a meeting of 12 people, some with ties to the tobacco industry.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet in criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE published its "Pillar of Excellence" report last month, describing it as a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
However, several researchers have questioned the durability of the data and pointed to links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
The medical journal Lancet published an editorial last month attacking the PHE's main conclusion on the "exceptionally harsh basis".
Two other researchers, writing in the BMJ, have questioned whether the claims are based on rock or sand.
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, say: The main principle of public health is that policies must be based on proven efficacy.
They say the public's expectation that PHE's claim that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than traditional cigarettes, based on the best current estimate, is based on a detailed assessment and modelling of the evidence.
In fact, it comes from one meeting of 12 people, where a multi-criteria decision analysis model (MCDA) was developed to synthesize their opinions on the harm associated with different nicotine-containing products, and the results of this meeting were summarised in the study.
McKee and Capewell say that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO reportedly previously received funding from Bristish American Tobacco for an independent study.
He also supported BAT's public health claims in the sustainability report, they say.
One of the 12 people at the meeting reported receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he reportedly received earlier from the tobacco company Philip Morris International, they add.
The criteria for selecting panel members are not disclosed, but the panel includes several well-known e-cigarette advocates, some of whom also report receiving funding from the industry in the study.
The others present are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the Director of Tobacco at PHE.
The study produced by the group largely acknowledges that there is a lack of controversial evidence of harm in most products and most criteria, McKee and Capewell write.
However, none of these links or limitations are mentioned in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell say PHE's claims that there is no evidence to date that e-cigarettes act as a route to smoking in children or non-smokers are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, says that the claims made in the BMJ have been answered before.
He says: "E-cigarettes are far less harmful than smoking".
Half the people who smoke their whole lives die from addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence shows and what it does not show, especially with so much public uncertainty about the relative dangers of tobacco.
Almost 80,000 people die each year from smoking-related diseases and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By explaining the current evidence - that although e-cigarettes are not risk-free, their harms are only a fraction of the harms of traditional tobacco - we are fulfilling our national responsibility.
The BBC should drop EastEnders, says former Channel 4 executive
Former Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson has said that the BBC should stop broadcasting programmes such as EastEnders and The Voice and that commercial competitors would "give anything" for hits such as this soap opera set on Albert Square Street.
Johnson said that licence fees should only be used to produce programmes that other UK broadcasters do not.
He criticised the BBC for placing public service programmes, which are likely to have smaller audiences, at the lowest times of day against the most watched programmes of competitors and channels such as BBC4.
After BBC chief executive Tony Hall said the company wanted to work more with other organisations, Johnson said that he had tried for six years at Channel 4 to establish a relationship with the BBC, to no avail.
I do not understand the idea of the BBC producing and broadcasting programmes that would be clearly suited to unsubsidised competitors, Johnson told the House of Commons Communications Committee as part of its inquiry into the future of the BBC.
If the licence fee is to be maintained - and I am not sure that would be a good idea for this medium or in the long term - it should at least limit its production to programmes that others do not make and produce.
The Voice is being broadcast at the top of the hour because we want to get as many people as possible to support it for the future.
The idea that no one else is going to be on the show is a joke, it's ridiculous, it's obviously nonsense.
Johnson said: 'I don't see why a regressive tax should fund programmes that could be funded without government support.
The Voice is one of them, and EastEnders is another, no doubt made in-house.
Frankly, the other channels would give you anything for it.
I don't see how that's a public service broadcast.
I don't think it would weaken the BBC in any way.
Johnson, who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was hunting for viewership because of the ambitions of the people who work there and because they believe it is the best way to achieve long-term support.
His comments on the BBC's most popular series are reminiscent of former Sky executive Tony Ball, who used his 2003 MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh to suggest that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the BBC's public service programmes for smaller audiences "go to BBC4 where viewership is often not measurable, but the BBC fulfils its responsibility and can then hypocritically say, defending £4 billion in licence fee revenue, 'Of course, we do all these unknown programmes that nobody watches'.
They put them in a broadcast booth where no one ever comes to see them.
On the issue of the licence fee, Johnson told the committee: 'I challenge you to look for a more regressive system for whoever gets the most in return.
Of course you all think, we all think 150 pounds a year is a lot of money, but I don't know if that's true for people for whom 150 pounds is a lot of money because they don't use the BBC very much.
Former Skynet and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should reassess its role under Reith as 'informing, educating and entertaining'.
He said that only a small part of the BBC's output is now classified as education - he said the figures were 1% of TV production and 0.1% of radio - and that it should take its cue from Australian and Canadian broadcasters and change its mission to inform, enlighten and entertain".
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should focus more on events such as the Proms, which he said are only shown on television for a few hours, and ally with commercial companies so that they can all be seen online.
Sound genetics allows for the control of brain cells by sound waves
The video shows the shuttle launchers changing direction as soon as a pulse of sound hits them.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically engineered nervous systems that can be controlled by sound waves.
Small shuttle craft change direction as soon as they are hit by a sound pulse too loud for the human ear to hear.
The pulses work by switching on genetically engineered motor neurons with membrane channels that respond to ultrasound.
Related: Scientists read and write brain activity in light
The researchers said that the worms demonstrate the effectiveness of a new technique called sound genetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate certain brain, heart, and muscle cells from outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told The Guardian that the technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that involves directing electrical impulses into the human brain to treat Parkinson's disease.
Shuttle worms normally do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that when they were surrounded by liquid containing microscopic bubbles, the situation changed.
He found that the bubbles amplified the ultrasonic waves, which then travel inside the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves affect TRP-4 ion channels, structures found in the cell membranes of some worms.
Sound waves cause these ion channels to open and activate cells attached to them, reports a report in the journal Nature Communications.
To make ultrasonic shuttle worms, Chalasani genetically engineered worms to have TRP-4 ion channels in some of their motor neurons.
When Chalasani used ultrasound on the modified carpets, the microbubbles amplified the sound waves and transmitted them to the carpets, where they connected the modified motor neurons.
The method has some similarities with optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn on and off nerve cells using light pulses.
However, Chalasani says that sonogenetics may have some advantages over optogenetics.
Unlike light that must be sent through optical fiber to a desired location inside the brain, low-frequency ultrasound can pass through tissue unimpeded, allowing it to be sent to the brain from the top of the skull.
We believe that using gene therapy and a therapeutic virus, it may be possible to make targeted human nerve cells respond momentarily to an ultrasound signal for certain neurological treatments in a clinical setting, Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture equipment delivered to your home!
The ads are a disgrace to the British arms trade .
Watch this video from Amnesty International against gun violence.
They're horrible killing machines!
The ankle-crushing footcars!
Grape bombs!
And electrical anesthetic pumps that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful sound and graphic language of the cartoons leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world's biggest arms dealers is a sharp parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government's willingness to trade arms to oppressive governments at a ceremony at the ExCeL Centre of Defence and Security Equipment International in the London dockyard.

A separate campaign also produced many posters at bus stops and on the subway lines, calling for more information.
Important information, Are you travelling on the DLR route on 15-18 September? together using the London Underground font and logo, as the DLR track is transformed into a tank image.
This September, a swarm of arms dealers will arrive on the DLR route... asking customers to help stop the arms sales.
These 300 posters are by artists whose work was displayed at Banksy Dismaland's Museum of Cruel Designs.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped spread the posters around London using Ad Space Hack Packs, a six-pound pack of six-inch keys that the collective claims access a third of the advertising space at bus stops across the planet.
Transport for London has not been amused by this unauthorised "poster vandalism".
One of the spoof commercials produced by the Special Patrol Group.
Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, says that artists are increasingly questioning and wanting to take political works to audiences outside galleries.
Many artists have started working with activists in the resistance, because they realized that they had to go out into the world if they wanted their art to have an impact on society.
Another anti-gun poster greets business travelers on the subway.
The video, which has been viewed more than 100,000 times on Facebook in the last 24 hours, was created for free by the advertising agency VCCP, and the graphic designer and background artist worked for free.
Matt Leverin, creative director at VCCP, noticed that the gun show was not advertised at all, and there was also a blank space on Excel's calendar at the time, and he thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They toyed with the idea of a more realistic corporate ad, but it was more arresting to emphasize it with bright colors and animation.
'They have done a fantastic job of helping us raise questions about the illegal torture equipment being sold at fairs,' says Tom Davies of Amnesty.
Now the UK government must act and ensure that no instruments of torture are sold illegally in our own neighbourhood.
Perhaps the most creative art for the gun show comes from inside Excel, where exhibitors sell fantastically decorated products.
Saab revealed in a press release that it had received an order from the US Army for the AT4CS RS shoulder-fired.
This includes the unique pipe-locking head, which delivers excellent effects from behind the armor to the inside of the target.
Whatever it is, it's not pleasant.
Eight golden rules for living in a dorm room
It's been 11 years since I moved into a student residence at the age of 19, and I still believed in barets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the violent smiles of the people I irritated and the numerous, long complaints from others.
A lot of what I've learned can be summed up in eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm can be anything from nerve-wracking to absolutely terrifying.
It's tempting to gossip: tell me where you're from, if you took a break and where, what you think of Corbyn, and why I really don't love or hate Marmite because really it's just a yeast syrup HAHA find me in my room.
Just breathe.
And also help others breathe, ask questions, show interest.
It'll guide the conversation and help you find the people you like, not the people you wouldn't want to talk to even if your eyelids were on fire and they shared extinguishers.
Give people room.
People's rooms often become cocktail parties, movie night parties, and social gatherings, but they are also places where people dress and fix their underwear.
Related: Don't even think about going to college while you're in a relationship
College is a tough place for introverts.
Your room should be a place to rest, but in many apartments, a culture of wandering from room to room is formed that is friendly, social, and produces lifelong friendships.
It could mean hell for someone trying to rest.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, "I like you and I want to be your friend, but you need to leave now so I can regain the energy I used to talk to you".
Try to sense when your college buddy is tired of socializing and maybe text him instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking, knock.
There was this guy in my dorm who thought if the door wasn't locked, he was invited in.
He saw some pretty amazing stuff.
Make friends by baking.
Because you're starting college in the peak of the baking trend, knocking on people's doors with a plate of chocolate chip cookies and introducing yourself seems a little less weird, less "welcome to the neighborhood, I baked you something, now smile when I ask you personal questions" from the '50s.
Serving homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your roommates will feel obliged to talk, and in time they may associate your face with a tasty surprise.
Of course, that depends on how well you can bake.
The poorly mixed flour, sugar, and fat bubbles are likely to make people just pretend to sleep when you knock.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Understandably, taking a chicken is stealing, but what if you only take a drop of milk into your tea?
Check with the milk owner.
It's entirely possible they'll give you permission, even if they're boiling inside.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying and you get my sympathy, but try to be more mature about it than my roommate who mixed detergent in her milk to punish the people who stole it.
He's in prison now.
You can't make a noise that'll keep people from sleeping or studying.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're like that old saying, "a pot roasting pot".
A girl in my hallway asked her neighbor if they could turn down their drum and bass music because it was three o'clock in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The answer was to increase the volume.
When they finally stopped at five o'clock in the morning, the girl kindly let them sleep for two hours before she played her own music, locked the door, and left for the three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same dorm room as you?
Or conversely, wouldn't it be incredibly awkward if you thought of your roommate as your future spouse, you hooked up, you divorced, and then you saw him every day and possibly lost all your mutual friends to him?
Of course, your heart wants what it wants, but if the hot roommate is really not your future spouse, you could at least try to reason with your superior.
In that joyous moment when you discover that someone has left his key in his unlocked room, the line between teasing and bullying is thinner than it seems.
A good joke is fun, but it can be undone in an instant.
You can teach a useful and fun lesson about safety by hiding something, but never mess up someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.

A racist attack on a hostel for foreign students in Kite - a house designed as a reception centre was dusty in Salo
A racist attack was carried out on the hostel of foreign students in Kite in North Karelia on Saturday morning.
Contrary to what the police had previously said, the accommodation is not for minors seeking asylum but for foreign students who have been in Finland for a longer period of time, says Heidi Luukkainen, a teacher at the Kitee Evangelical Folk School.
The windows and walls of the dormitories of the National University were painted with racist signs, such as swastikas, and a metal object was thrown through the window of one of the dormitories, reports the police in Eastern Finland.
According to Luukkainen, who teaches social security education to young people at the National University, there were about ten people in the building at the time of the attack.
"It was a weekend and adults are free to move around, so some of them might have been elsewhere", says Luukkainen.
The People's University has people from 12 different nationalities.
They are students who have been in Finland for some time and recently arrived minor asylum seekers.
Everyone who was in the messed-up building has an A-rat.
Some are in primary school, some are in vocational studies and some are studying Finnish", says Luukkainen.
A-status is a so-called permanent residence permit, which can be issued for four years at a time to a foreigner who has already been in Finland for some time.
The police in Eastern Finland are investigating the attack as a misdemeanor and a violation of the peace.
According to Luukkainen, a press conference was held on Monday for the students, with the necessary interpreters present.
There's no panic here, and no one's wanted to leave.
We have had foreign students for twenty years, and this is the first time that something like this has happened", says Luukkainen.
According to Luukkaine, the mess has already been cleaned out of the walls.
The suspects were at least three men, and they were driving a white car.
I think this is a youth weekend headline, now that this subject has come up.
Nothing more serious than that", says Luukkainen.
Saló also has a hospital, which has been designed as a reception center.
It happened last week.
MTV reported on the website Tuesday night.
The wall of the hospital had a swastika and the words "You are not welcome" written in English.
It's been reported to the police.
Corrected on 15th September at 16:02 for incorrect information provided by the police regarding the age and status of the people living in the building.
The government is shutting down the Y train to Karelia. Passengers are in their tracks.
The Y-train running from Helsinki to Raaseporin Karja will stop running in March.
The news angered passengers on the first shift of the train at Helsinki's main railway station.
The people of Siuni are particularly affected by the drought, said Torbjörn Bengtström, a resident of the municipality.
It is a very stupid thing to do, because the population is growing all the time and people who go to work need a quick and smooth connection to Helsinki.
This can't be down to anything but political will or lack of it.
Bengtström says in the HSTV interview video that he will come to the capital by tractor.
There are also changes in trains in other parts of the Netherlands.
The H and R trains running on the terminus will be combined to form a new R line.
The Purola station in Järvenpää and Nuppulinna in Tuusla will be decommissioned.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications and the VR on Tuesday published information on the routes for which the Ministry will purchase rail transport for the next contract period.
The contract period changes every year and there are routes to be cancelled throughout the country.
The new four-year agreement, to be finalised in the autumn, will be adopted by the Monetary Committee at a later date.
Bengtström from the Dionysian region considers that the State's train-cutting operation is short-sighted.
We make the same mistakes that have been made before and repeat them in a very systematic way.
Then it's time for a little remorse.
The Y-train is also used by people other than the people of Raasepor and Siuni, as it is fast and bypasses several stations.
Annina Pöyrö from Espoo was saddened by the fate of those who traveled farther from the city by train.
"It's especially bad for people who have to re-plan their trip", he said, lamenting the Y train.
I'm sure you'll be a little relieved.
A new train connection is likely to be built to the coastline, replacing the Y-train in the Helsinki Region Transport Area (HSL), which will take you to Kirkkonum.
This adds to the costs for HSL, which in practice is the local authorities of the region and their taxpayers.
"We are now starting to investigate the different options and their impact on service levels and ticket prices", said HSL CEO Suvi Rihtniemi.
It is not yet possible to estimate the exact costs.
Rihtniemi says that based on the number of passengers, HSL has paid approximately EUR 1 million per year for the Y-train, although the Ministry has paid much more.
The R line coming up the end of the line will miss two stations.
Instead, the number of train journeys in Ainola and Saunakalli will double.
A total of 28 small stations and numerous routes stop throughout the country.
The Ministry will no longer purchase train services on the routes Joensuu-Nurmes, Tampere-Keuruu and Jyväskylä-Haapamäki-Seinäjoki.
The Beating-Joensuu route is shortened to Beating-Theft route.
The train frequency will be reduced on the routes Riihimäki-Lahti, Hanko-Karjaa, Kouvola-Kotka port and Kajaani-Oulu.
The total number of journeys made by the terminated shifts is over half a million a year, while the total number of journeys purchased by the Ministry is about nine million.
The new agreement is intended to bring the State savings of 12.3 million a year.
The contract is worth approximately EUR 27,5 million per year.
Sixten Korkman wrote a chapter in his book, The Current State of Capital, entitled "Marx is a Person to Be Familiar With".
The world economic crises have brought Karl Marx (1818-1883) and his major work Capital, published between 1867 and 1894, to the fore, writes former SKP chairman Yrjö Hakanen in his book, The Current Situation of Marx's Capital, published today.
"He is now taken more seriously than in a long time", Hakanen writes in his foreword.
Marx's predictions of the development, internationalization and ever-widening penetration of the capitalist economy into all spheres of life, the concentration of capital and the growing role of money and imaginary capital have proved astonishingly far-sighted.
The author of the book, based on the Capital Seminars organised by Hakasen, is also Professor Sixten Korkman, a respected economist at Aalto University.
In his book, Korkman writes that Marx is relevant "now and forever".
But the former director of the Institute of Industrial Research and the Industrial Delegation is not a Marxist, is he?
No, not at all.
Korkman says by telephone that he does not consider Marx a contemporary economic thinker but rather an interesting social theorist.
Today, the social sciences have become differentiated and specialized, but Marx was a philosopher, historian, sociologist, economist, journalist, political agitator, and literary connoisseur.
"The common perception is that ideological history tells of the wrong opinions of dead men", Korkman begins.
It's true that Marx's predictions were badly wrong.
Although Marx understood the nature and significance of the industrial revolution, he drew conclusions that were too far-fetched from the beginnings of capitalism, Korkman argues.
But Korkman sees value in Marx's radical stance.
"What is more relevant about Marx is that he asked good questions", he says.
Now we're back to discussing Marx's interests in wealth distribution.
"Marx may be an inspiration to anyone who wants to understand the big picture, the changing world of the technological revolution", Korkman analyzes.
But in what the government is expected to decide tomorrow, Marx will not help.
I mean, he thought capitalism was a hopeless case that should just stop.
Still, Korkman thinks it's worthwhile getting to know Marx.
"In the '70s, Marx was impossible to read", says Korkman.
"The Maoists and the Trotskyites and the other sects all hated capitalism, but each hated the other even more".
Today, the debate is more diverse and Marx can also be approached without the ideological and political weight of the past.
"Every social scientist should be familiar with Marx's world of thought - as with other classics", says Korkman.
UN calls for war criminals to be brought to justice in Sri Lanka
The UN is calling for the establishment of a special court to investigate war crimes committed during the Sri Lankan civil war, AFP news agency reports.
The UN report on the civil war between 1983 and 2009 was released on Wednesday after a long delay.
The report blames war crimes on both the Sri Lankan military and the rebels known as Tamil Tigers.
The Sri Lankan civil war is estimated to have killed at least 100,000 people.
The exact number of casualties is also unknown.
The UN report calls for a thorough investigation into the major military offensive in the final months of a long war in 2009.
The report blames the Sri Lankan armed forces for torture, kidnapping and systematic sexual violence, which were as likely to be suffered by men as women.
The report says the rebels are guilty of forcing bystanders and children to fight.
The report says both sides are guilty of murder.
Sri Lanka responded on Wednesday that it would conduct its own investigation but would not allow the establishment of a UN court because of foreign judges.
In England , they gave you a yo-yo test and you had to check your social media .
The autumn student papers were on Wednesdays in a long foreign language, the majority of which was English.
Over 16,000 people tested their English skills.
You could write a paper on social media.
Based on my own experience, I had to ask myself if social media makes us lonely and unhappy.
Alternatively, an article of 150-250 words in English could be pointed to the owner of the advice column on the website.
It was titled Dear Agony Aunt.
Agony Aunt is in charge of Lelia's Finnish lounge chair.
She had to ask for advice on how to get parents to view things from the perspective of the young ones.
There were four subjects in total, one of which had to be chosen.
"It was the hardest of them all", says Mia Lybeck, an English instructor at the third Swedish-language high school in Porvoo.
The third topic was merely a quote from former European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso.
And the fourth subject, Lybeck said, was pretty cool.
I had to write a speech on why companies should hire young people.
"At least our school has a speech-writing program", says Lybeck, who rates the whole experiment as "fairly normal".
The Finnish or Swedish test was conducted in English, and asked questions about texts that, for example, addressed the adaptation of the summer squid to climate change and the processing of large amounts of data.
On Wednesday, some long Russian (168 students), German (124), French (52) and Spanish (27) were also written.
The autumn tests will continue on Friday, when the next test will be held in Sweden or Finland.
In high schools, the test is administered as normal, so it is not affected by the attitude of the employees.
The University Graduate Council urges students to find suitable transportation in time to make it to the test.
An additional period may be granted if it can be shown that the delay was not due to personal negligence.
A shop was robbed at gunpoint in Oulu .
In Oulu, a shop in the Kellon district was robbed on Wednesday morning.
Police said the robber was wearing dark clothes and a commando uniform that covered his face.
He's a normal-sized man in his 30s.
Police say the man threatened staff with a small weapon and was given a small amount of cash as a bounty.
They're investigating it as a grand theft.
Police are preparing for tens of thousands of demonstrators arriving in Helsinki with support patrols from elsewhere in Finland.
A protest against the government's cuts will blockade Helsinki city centre on Friday, police predict.
According to preliminary reports, tens of thousands of people may be expected.
The members of the SAC, AKA and STTK associations will meet at the Railway Gate at 11 a.m.
Police are also believed to be involved in the demonstration.
The police on duty are responsible not only for alerting and policing but also for ensuring that the giant show goes on.
The roads leading to the railway terminal will be closed to motor vehicles from approximately 9:30 to 14:00.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
From the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is cut off at the Kaisaniemi traffic circle, from the west direction starting from the Mannerheiminte.
Captain Seppo Kujala, is the Helsinki police station manned enough?
At least for now, it looks like we've had enough.
I'm not taking sides on police labor struggles.
The European Union has a responsibility to ensure that the EU's nuclear safety policy is implemented in a timely manner.
Police won't give us the exact patrol numbers.
"Some are coming, but as a rule we will manage on our own", says Kujala.
Police are advising people to avoid private vehicles in central Helsinki on Friday.
Kujala estimates the worst traffic jam will extend from Hakaniemi level to the core.
Traffic will be at a standstill from dawn to dusk.
The arrival of protesters from other parts of Finland is accompanied by a large number of buses.
They won't be allowed into the Iron Gate.
Buses are usually a little far away.
The rest of the journey then involves walking to the protest site", says Kujala.
The demonstration will also stop public transport in Helsinki.
From a police point of view, there's a silver lining.
The issue of the smoothness of public transport, which is normally at hand at these large crowds, is now partly taken care of by itself.
The organizers of the demonstration have informed the police that tens of thousands of opponents of the government's economic policies may come to Helsinki.
Police expect the demonstration to go smoothly.
They're ordinary people, working or unemployed, ordinary citizens.
Finns are reasonable and peaceful people", says Kujala.
Local demonstrations will also be held on Friday throughout Finland.
The Friday demonstration is extraordinary in many ways. Remember these strikes and demonstrations?
The large demonstration organized by the trade unions on Friday is in many ways interesting and extraordinary.
For example, there is no good comparison in Finnish political history, says Martti Siisiäinen, professor emeritus of sociology at the University of Jyväskylä.
No wonder the ay movement protested.
If it did not, it would raise its hands to the government, says Sieskeinen.
The far-right government has struck at the core of the Finnish corporatist tradition - and also at points that have been important for the development of the Finnish welfare state.
The government's tight grip on contract law is a failure.
There are many features here that really try to bring the ay-motion to its knees.
And the ay movement has a place to look in the mirror.
The mirror is needed, for example, because the ay movement does not have the support of all employees for Friday demonstrations.
What is new is the sharp division that the demonstration will create among those who the ay movement would like to join the demonstration.
The unemployed from all over Finland demonstrated in Parliament in November 1993.
If you look for a Friday protest to compare it to, it could be the giant unemployment rally, the 1993 Murrostorstai, says Siisiäinen.
In the midst of the Great Depression, the organized Brutal Thursday brought together 20,000 unemployed.
The Esko Ahon (centre) government stumbled from one labour market crisis to another.
It was said that relations between the Finnish government and wage-earning organizations had never been so bad as during the bourgeois rule of Ahon.
Now the government and the ay movement are perhaps even worse than in the days of Murrostorstein.
Besides, the most bourgeois government in Finland is now in power, says Siisiäinen.
The current coalition is still interesting in that it is so far to the right, despite what the fundamentalists say.
Even in the days of the Jüttik, there were certain elements of the old workers' movement.
Several thousand protesters are expected to attend on Friday.
The demonstration will also stop public transport and possibly close daycare centers and schools.
Although the protest may not receive unshakeable support from the salaried, it may become the largest in years.
In recent years, about 300 demonstrations have been held in Helsinki every year.
They're all over the place.
Traditionally, the Finnish ay movement's demonstrations have been quite peaceful - although the methods have become more severe in recent years.
Traditionally, in Finnish demonstrations, conflict is avoided, and law is obeyed.
The protesters try to avoid damaging or destroying property, says Siisiäinen.
The late 1990s, however, brought a new wind.
The culture of protest has changed.
The EU membership made farmers nervous to throw eggs and the police prepared to get pig shit on them.
In 1998, the firefighters went on strike for three months.
There were also striking demonstrations by pilots and air traffic controllers, among others.
Remember these strikes and demonstrations?
Strikes in the 1970s
The most important strikes of the 1970s were the metal strike of 1971 and the power plant and electricity strike of 1977.
The metal bands' strike was attended by 70,000 metal bands.
The strike was suspended at the suggestion of the Conciliation Board after seven weeks.
The metal workers got a 16% raise.
In the spring of 1977, a 49-day power strike caused blackouts across the country.
The first was in 1993
On 4 November 1993, some 20,000 people, many of them unemployed, gathered in front of the Houses of Parliament to express their support for work.
Firefighters went on strike for three months in ' 98 .
The firefighters' strike was one of the longest in the 1990s, if not the longest in the nation.
Farmers protested against the EU in 1994 and 1999
The police were caught in the act of chicken eggs during a farmers' protest against the EU in 1994.
"Siberian teaches, EU stops", was one of the slogans.
The farmers in Espalde dropped tons of snow.
The 1999 Helsinki EU Summit also saw farmers protest and burn hay outside the meeting place.
The nurses went on strike in 1983 and 1995.
Nurses went on strike for about a month in 1995.
The last time they went on strike was in 1983.
The strike of 1995 was marked by a few deaths during the strike.
You threatened to strike and fire nurses in 2007.
The threat of mass deportation finally led to the negotiations.
Doctors went on strike in 2001 .
"Doctors on strike - forcing", was the slogan of the doctors on strike in 2001.
The strike by local doctors and hospitals lasted for about five months and sparked a lively discussion about how strikes can jeopardize patient safety.
After the strike, the public sector raised doctors' salaries.
Students on the move in 2013
In 2013, around 5 000 students marched in Helsinki from the Senate Tower to the Parliament House in support of their studies.
The Central Criminal Police is investigating the background of a Finnish truck full of refugees for the Austrian police.
The Austrian police have asked the Central Criminal Police for help in investigating the background of a migrant truck registered in Finland.
On Sunday, Austrian police stopped a truck carrying 42 refugees in Aisterheim, near the German border.
It is not known whether the truck was possibly on its way to Finland.
The people on the refrigerator were all in good condition.
We've been exchanging information with the Austrian police.
The investigation and main responsibility lies with the crime scene in Austria, says Tero Haapala, Chief Inspector of the Central Criminal Police.
At the end of August, other refugees in Austria who were traveling in trucks met a more fatal fate.
At that time, all 71 passengers on board apparently died of suffocation.
According to the public broadcaster Yleisradio, which first reported on the cooperation with the Austrian police, the truck belongs to a Finnish limited company.
The company is engaged in, among other things, the restaurant business and its CEO is a man of foreign origin, about 40 years old.
Two Iraqi men have been arrested in Austria on charges of human trafficking.
A captain who beat up refugees, a former drug trafficker and a rich businessman. The story of five smugglers.
A greedy king of smugglers, a violent boat driver, a stylish missionary and a self-righteous cab driver.
For example, such people are involved in human smuggling into the European Union.
Criminologist Andrea Di Nicola of the University of Trento and journalist Giampaolo Musumeci have met and interviewed dozens of smugglers and their "customers", and their book The Death Travel Agency is being published in Finnish this week.
In the book, they present the backdrop of human trafficking, offer solutions and introduce smugglers at all levels of the business.
HS will present five of them.
I 'll kick your ass right now .
The Kerkenna Islands off the east coast of Tunisia are not a popular destination for foreign tourists, but many Tunisians head there for the summer.
The islands are also ideal for smuggling because of their location, being only 120 kilometers from the Italian island of Lampedusa.
For comparison, the distance from Helsinki to Tallinn is about 85 kilometres.
There, in the village of El Attaya, lives the Emir, a chained-up captain and father of six children.
The Kerkenna Islands are famous for their shrimp, but it's more profitable for a fisherman to transport people.
And that's what Emir has done in his blue, 30-foot wooden boat hundreds of times.
If the boat is full, it can hold 40 people.
The Emir earns about 8,000 euros after expenses for one trip.
Emir has five assistants who look for clients all over Tunisia.
Customers come from many countries, but during the Arab Spring, a huge number of Tunisians fled the unrest.
After that, the situation calmed down until the refugee crisis again began to flare up.
Customers arrive in small groups from the mainland to Kerkenna Island.
The Emir will house them in empty houses for as long as he sees fit.
The food is served in such a way that the customers barely survive.
The cost of accommodation is about 75 euros a night, and if the customer runs out of money, it's their problem.
We'll be out on the water at midnight with the lights off.
The first night, you drive off the islands, then you pull over, wait for the day, and drive the next night to Lampedusa.
Sometimes the sea is rough, and in 20-meter-high waves, passengers cry and vomit.
At the destination, the human cargo will be unloaded in half an hour and the Emir will be on his way back.
Emir wants to be feared.
That's why he beats his clients, and at least he claims to beat the hanging men to death.
In his book, he relates that when a policeman once caught him, he threw all his passengers overboard and told them to swim to the nearest island.
"I grabbed customers by the neck one by one and threw them overboard", says Emir.
The quietest travelers come from the Sahara.
His countrymen say he's got to beat this one up for this.
I'll kick your ass right now.
We need to show them who's in charge here immediately.
Just a regular cab driver .
Goran is a regular cab driver in Bogovača, Serbia.
His cab's not very good, the starter is dying, and he's seen his best days anyway.
However, the most important thing for Goran's customers is that the taxi is moving at all and that it is moving towards the Hungarian border.
Bogovaða is a small village of 500 inhabitants about 40 miles [60 km] southwest of Belgrade.
The village is adjacent to an asylum centre, which is mainly for families.
In the forests surrounding the city, men traveling without their families are housed in tents, huts, and abandoned cars, which each has now managed to find or build.
The forest also has families who, for one reason or another, have not applied for asylum in Serbia.
Some are also housed in private residences, but that's a public secret.
Among the savages, Goran finds most of his clients.
They are often walking exhausted - the route through the Balkans requires a large number of border crossings and weeks of walking through difficult terrain, often in mountainous areas and in darkness.
When they finally reach the Bogovada area, a major hub for human trafficking, the people are dead tired.
Goran's passengers are mainly Syrians, Afghans, Pakistanis, Iraqis and Kurds.
The best customers are Syrians, he says in his book.
"They say their piece once and that's enough", Goran praises.
He says the Africans are trying to pick a fight.
That's not what Goran likes.
You're a fool, you're a fool, you're a fool all the way.
First, they agree on a price of, say, 300 euros, then they cut it down to 200 and finally offer 150.
Goran emphasizes that he is a kind and good-hearted man.
I'm not interested in money.
I'm just doing my job and helping people", he says in the book.
Goran says he works cheaper than others and charges only 50 euros per person for transport to the Hungarian border.
It's a thousand miles, most of it on a comfortable highway.
I heard the colleagues are asking for three or four times the price.
Goran earns about 50,000 euros a year.
It's not a lot of money for a smuggler, but it's a pretty nice annual income in Serbia.
Serbia has ordered that taxis not be allowed to transport migrants within 12 kilometres of the Hungarian border.
Goran doesn't care: he knows the roads and shortcuts and takes his passengers a mile from the border.
Then he points his customers in the right direction and then he's gone.
In a Work of Mercy
A 35-year-old man in the Congo is called a Missionary, and that is not just a nickname.
Indeed, in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, he has a Protestant church that is frequented by many Congolese refugees, and a small center that helps Congolese refugee children.
In addition to preaching, the missionary runs a smuggling business that moves people from the Congo to Europe.
He thinks he's doing a work of mercy.
It's important to look good as a missionary.
She polishes her shoes many times a day and makes sure that the rubber band of her white underwear sticks out elegantly under the low waist of her jeans.
The missionary is proud of his new Mercedes, SUV, and three motorcycles.
When not preaching, the missionary organizes people from the Congo to Uganda and on to Europe.
The customer first calls one of the five missionary telephone numbers.
He advises arriving at the border in the morning, hiding the money in a safe place, and mingling with the merchants crossing the border.
To obtain asylum or refugee status, you must tell the Ugandan authorities that you are from, say, a war zone in North Kivu and that you have been forced to flee violence in your home.
Often that's true, but if it's not, the missionary arranges for the client to have a new identity.
The old identity card is destroyed and replaced by a new one.
A missionary's contacts in the Ugandan police help.
The client is then directed to the same place where the real asylum seekers go: to the asylum procedure, to NGOs, finally to the UNHCR.
The missionary knows the red tape, having come to Uganda as a refugee himself.
He charges for each step separately: filing an application with the Ugandan police costs about 100 euros, handling documents for a humanitarian organisation about 150 euros and the process of moving to, say, a European country costs between 4 500 and 7 000 euros.
Foil and ice cubes
Tom is a novice smuggler, former drug courier.
A 40-year-old Irishman is on patrol off the French coast in Calais, where his job is to load people onto trucks bound for Britain.
He has an Afghan living in London, a French taxi driver, and dozens of truck drivers who may not even know they're in the human smuggling business.
At night, Tom and the cab driver pick up their customers, usually two or three people, somewhere near the centre of Calais.
They're driving on the A26 trying to avoid the police.
If the police stopped the car on the highway, Tom and the driver would go straight to jail for organizing illegal immigration.
Tom doesn't want that. He's been in prison for seven years for drugs.
The taxi stops, Tom and his customers run across the highway to a rest stop where the drivers sleep before continuing across the Channel to Brittany.
Tom chooses the right truck, makes sure it's going to England instead of Holland, and then he cuts the safety belt on the safety cover.
It's got to be quiet, so the drivers don't wake up.
Sometimes the driver is involved, but then it's more expensive.
When the route is clear, Tom wraps his customer in aluminum foil, the same as the one wrapped around a roast or oven potato in the kitchen.
It should keep the police's heat scanners from spotting who's hiding.
Some use an ice-filled sleeping bag for the same purpose.
Tom leaves his client in the truck and leaves the scene, hoping that the driver will not rush the smugglers at least before Britain.
The King of Smugglers
Muammer Küçük is one of the most famous human smugglers in the world.
The rich Turkish has been called the master of marketing and the undisputed king of illegal landings in the Mediterranean, controlling the sea routes from Turkey to EU countries, mainly Greece and Italy.
Küçük has been operating since the 1990s and has continuously developed new smuggling methods.
He also has a competitive advantage over other entrepreneurs: He demands money only when he arrives.
One of the new methods is the luxury ship scam, whereby a leisure fund is allegedly chartered from Turkish ports to take American or European families on comfortable, tourist cruises of a few days.
In reality, the ships are full of Syrians, Iraqis, Kurds and Afghans, who are transported from Istanbul to a port on land and then by sea to Europe for a fee of between EUR 5 000 and 7 000.
Customers are kept in human warehouses, such as old industrial buildings, until it is time for them to leave.
They're gonna put people in minivans and drive them somewhere along the coast.
They're told to hide in the vegetation and wait for the signal.
Once it's given, we must board quickly.
Passengers must remain hidden under the deck for the entire journey.
The Coast Guard can only observe the depth of the ship, since no other signs of a crowd are visible.
Food and drink are provided, but the less passengers defecate and vomit, the better.
Küçük receives approximately EUR 53 000 after the expenses of a single luxury cruise.
Instead of handling the practical matters himself, he hires captains, recruiters, guards, hosts, and other lesser agents to do the work for him.
In the summer, there are at least hundreds of transports and Küçük makes millions.
He is believed to have acquired land, a pharmaceutical company and over 100 apartments through shell companies.
Muammer Küçük was arrested in 2011 at the same time as a Turkish Democratic Party MP and a pharmaceutical entrepreneur.
Since then, he's obviously been missing.
Correction: The book Death Travel Agency is coming out this week, not next week.
In her book, an American Olympic runner tells of her illness and her prostitution.
A new book by three-time Olympic 1500-meter runner Suzy Favor Hamilton has drawn attention in the United States.
In his book Fast Girl, Favor Hamilton talks about quitting his career and becoming a prostitute.
Sports Illustrated published excerpts from the book on Tuesday.
Favor Hamilton ended his career at the Sydney Olympics.
He came into the race in top form and finished second in the qualifying round.
But in the finals, he panicked.
He was on top right from the start, defending his lead with a manic run.
But 150 yards before the goal, his strength was over.
He collapsed on the track, and the other competitors passed him one by one.
I felt like an idiot and I thought I'd never run again.
But I forced myself to cross the finish line, Favor Hamilton says in his book.
It was later revealed that Favor Hamilton suffered from bipolar disorder.
His brother Dan had committed suicide a year before the Sydney Games, and he himself felt enormous pressures to succeed.
Favor Hamilton was a 43-year-old mother when she became a prostitute in Las Vegas.
The couple had no financial problems, but she was fascinated by the idea of making money by having sex with strangers.
She also persuaded her husband to approve of her actions.
Hamilton Favor's fee was 450 euros an hour.
He says he spent the money on luxury.
Another explanation given by Favor Hamilton for becoming a prostitute was that he wanted the same adrenaline rushes he had from competing in track and field.
Later, Favor Hamilton found out that he had bipolar disorder.
The former star runner's double life came to light in late 2012 when Smoking Gun magazine published an article about him.
Favor-Hamilton competed in the Barcelona, Atlanta and Sydney Olympics.
In 2000, he set a world record of 3.57.40 in the 1,500 meters, but finished last in the Sydney Olympics.
The world champion cheered as the federation disciplined the Norwegian ski jumper, "Straight-back".
The Norwegian skiing king, Petter Northug, has crossed the line of propriety, at least in the opinion of one of his colleagues.
Northug and the Norwegian Ski Federation have been twisting the athlete's contract all summer and fall, just like last year.
Although the federation has offered Northug a better deal than other athletes, it has not been enough for the multiple world champion and Olympic champion.
As a result of the contract dispute, the Norwegian Ski Federation decided to exclude Northug from the World Cup next season.
The decision was praised by two-time world champion Astrid Jacobsen.
He said he was glad the union disciplined the ski jumper.
"Thank you for showing your back", Jacobsen wrote on his Facebook page.
"We cannot allow one active athlete to avoid working for a federation sponsor", he continued.
The dispute between the Norwegian Ski Federation and Northug is about money.
Apparently, Northug would like to be part of the national team for the season so he can advertise his own sponsor.
Jacobsen said he was happy to represent an association that cares about future generations and doesn't leave one athlete alone.
He also stressed that the Union had granted Northhug financial and other privileges for many years.
I know that because I've been part of the system.
Jacobseb doesn't accept that one athlete has completely different rules than just because he's the best.
Northug issued a statement on Tuesday asserting that he would like to represent Norway at the World Cup next season and then the World Cup and the Olympics.
Astrid Jacobsen won a total of six World Cup medals in her career, including two golds.
He was on the team that won the gold medal last winter in Falun.
The day of the shield of the roasters is also celebrated in the Nordic countries
On the day of the festival, September 25, there will be a pickup in various restaurants and shops that have been awarded the "Fried Translators" badge.
The aim of the day is to highlight Finland's high level of culinary expertise and to lower the threshold for leaving the restaurant and raise awareness of the importance of the shield as part of high quality.
At the same time, it is worth noting that not all high-quality restaurants are concentrated in the capital region, but top restaurants, checked and rated by an independent operator, can be found throughout Finland.
The international attention it has received is a testament to its importance as a way of raising awareness of the chain and the organisation.
In the northern part of the country, the day will be held in Vaasa, in the restaurant Fondis and in Kantarelli.
The festival is being held in Kokkola, with the participation of the restaurant Old Town.
The event has also received considerable international attention.
It has been decided to make the event one of the organization's major international events, held on the same day in different parts of the world.
Finland will continue to host the event.
The Court of Justice has been informed of the establishment of the Terrible Reception Centre
The Finnish Migration Agency and the Finnish Red Cross (SPR) are cooperating to establish a refugee reception centre on the grounds of the former garrison of Kauhava, currently owned by LSK Business Park Oy.
The complaint states that the area still has a permanent nature of critical infrastructure, which is used by the Defence Forces and its partner, Finland's Special Networks Ltd.
The Kauhajoki newspaper reports that the private individual said that placing the reception centre in the same building would pose a significant security risk, which was not taken into account in the preparation of the case.
The complainant claims that the Defence Forces may have interests in the area of the former Air War College and the airport, the impact of which has not been ascertained during the preparation of the reception centre.
The case states that for the last two years, negotiations have been held on the organisation of flight training and the possible entry of a foreign operator to the airport.
The issue was discussed with, among others, Minister of Defence Jussi Niinistö (PS) and Arto Rady, Chief of Staff of the Ministry of Defence.
The individual submits to the Registrar that the complaint is not a matter of objection in principle from the reception centre but that the planned location in the former garrison area is wrong.
The terrible city council handled the reception center issue last Monday.
The situation in Syria is reflected in Ukraine and the Baltic Sea region
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU citizens who are in the EU to a maximum of 15 per cent.
The President said that the concern for the management of the refugee situation united all participants.
He said the EU had to be more open to the idea of a common foreign and security policy.
Especially in these times when we face great challenges.
The situation in Syria, as well as the actions of Russia and the United States in the region, could also have an impact on Ukraine and, consequently, on the Baltic Sea region.
The Commission is optimistic about the development of the dialogue.
If that situation develops in a positive direction, that is to say the United States and Russia are able to, it will have an impact on the situation in Ukraine and on the continuing tensions in the Baltic Sea.
The report also states that the NATO question was also sidelined in the discussions.
The president didn't make a statement about the labor market.
Finnair is cancelling 16 domestic flights on Friday, starting a couple hours before closing.
One flight is cancelled Thursday and 15 on Friday.
The list of cancelled flights can be found on Finnair's website.
Finavia reports that the airport operations are managed by the management during the stoppage.
However, traffic jams and delays at security checkpoints and other service points are to be expected.
Protests close down streets in central Helsinki
The demonstration on Friday will close down the streets of central Helsinki.
Police say the streets leading to the railway tunnel will be closed to vehicles from about 9:30 to 2:00.
Cars are not allowed to enter the direction of the mainland from the Kaivakattu, the Postkattu and the Töölönlahdenkattu railway stations.
From Union Street in the direction of Hakaniemi, traffic is diverted to Union Street at the Kaisaniemi traffic circle.
According to the police, the closing time depends on the number of people attending the demonstration.
Only emergency vehicles are allowed in the area.
Metro and tram drivers will be on the streets all Friday .
Metro and tram drivers will take part in a demonstration on Friday morning from morning traffic to night traffic.
The railway and metro workers' association informed STT about the incident this evening.
Most of the Alko's will close for two hours, even with the post office closed.
The protest on Friday will also cause disruption to the Postal Service.
Significant delays are expected, for example, in the delivery of daily mail.
Most of the post offices are closed.
The Finnish Red Cross is still running the blood drive despite the strike.
Meal transportation, hospital shipments and laboratory samples are also being taken care of.
The status of services is available on the Post's website.
Most of the Finnish Alps close their doors for two hours on Fridays.
The service industry union Pam has instructed its employees to stop working between 11 and 1 p.m.
Pam has also urged workers in the grocery store to join the trade union demonstration.
The representatives of SOK and Kesko tell Helsingin Sanom that they will try to keep the stores open if necessary by force majeure.
According to Kesko, no information is available yet on the possible closure of individual shops.
Helsinki day care centres partially closed
The Helsinki Department of Early Childhood Education reports that day care centers in Helsinki will not be fully functional on Friday.
In response to the protests of the professional associations, day care may be concentrated in certain day care centres and no club activities in day care centres and playgrounds will be organised.
Daycare centers and groups for children with developmental disabilities and multiple disabilities will remain open.
In addition, afternoon activities for students with developmental disabilities and autism are normally organised.
The Department of Early Childhood Education promises to provide more information about the changes in operations tomorrow.
Media analyst: The bee is taking a big risk
The Commission has also been involved in the preparation of the draft directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens.
This kind of direct speech channel is also needed in the future.
This will not be the last time, Sipilä told reporters in parliament.
The Commission has not yet decided on the frequency of the Prime Minister's television and radio speeches.
According to Sparrow, speeches may not always be broadcast on the YLE channels in the future.
If any other channels sign up to be channels, then let's see.
"Now we'll use this channel tonight", said the Squirrel.
According to Sipilä, the state of the Finnish economy is so serious that it requires a television and radio address to the citizens.
This is a rather complex issue which requires a longer discussion.
That's why we ended up on this channel.
The speech will be broadcast from 21.05 to 21.20 on both TV1 and Radio Finlandia.
You can also watch it at the Yule Arena.
The owl takes a big risk
The media researcher hopes Sipilä's television speech does not reveal a more general government inward-looking.
Is it an attempt to take more power over the public debate and to refuse to question the public debate?
I am reminded of the recent comment by Foreign Minister (Timo) Soini that he does not follow the media agenda and does not allow it to define him.
In the name of democratic debate and publicity, I hope these matters are not connected.
I understand the commercial media is outraged by the announcement of the Squirrel.
It would be strange if the media field didn't respond.
The communication styles of policy makers are not a matter of publicity in a democracy.
The role of the media is to ensure that politicians' agendas are not taken for granted.
Koivusi says that the TV speech is a big risk for Sipil.
The sparrow should bring something new and special to the table when it speaks to meet the exceptionally high expectations set for the speech.
Is there anything else on the table today that we've already heard?
Or can he speak in a different tone, a different way, or different words, or say something new?
Koivunen says that if the promise is just more of the same old thing, one has to wonder why such a big gesture was made and Yle gave it an exceptional time.
I would like to say that I am not in favour of the Commission's proposal to introduce a new system of taxation.
There is a danger that the message of politicians or parliament and government will be branded as a message which is certainly not in line with the interests of the party or the general line.
A sly move by a lizard
The media expert stresses that what the Prime Minister does not say is also important in Sipila's forthcoming speech.
In the evening, we should look carefully at what Sipilä lacks and what it lacks, says Heikki Kuutti, research coordinator at Jyväskylä University.
Kuut said the TV speech was a clever move by Sipil, because it allowed him to express his own views without any noise.
This will allow the message to reach a wide audience without the journalistic filter, unlike a press conference where journalists can ask critical questions.
The Sparrow is going to bypass the media and speak directly to the people.
However, there is a danger that the media will misinterpret the speech because they will not allow detailed questions to be asked.
According to Kuut, it's very important how the Gull is portrayed on TV - the amount of sweat, whether the hands are shaking.
He's likening Sipil to a father figure who now tells the people what to do.
If Sipil can present his case well, it can work.
It is different from a governmental announcement, for here one person is speaking directly to another.
This is what Obama and his associates do regularly.
It 's really extraordinary .
Political researcher Erkka Railo considers the Prime Minister's speech to the citizens to be truly exceptional.
He said that this had not happened in decades for a prime minister to speak directly to the people.
"Exceptional times require exceptional means", says Railo.
The researcher believes that the prime minister wants to get the Finns sympathetic to the forthcoming blackmail.
On Friday, the workers' organizations will organize a demonstration and strike against the government's actions.
The chairman of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, says on Twitter that Sipilä could make a speech on the state of the nation in parliament as a prime minister's announcement, which would also allow for discussion.
The report also calls for the EU to be involved in the fight against terrorism.
This is no time for monologues.
Six months from the election.
You can't hide forever, Rinne wrote on Twitter.
A 9-year-old boy on the run has been found in Tampere .
The boy was in good health when he was found.
The boy's father updated his Facebook page.
The police department also confirmed the incident to the Evening Standard.
The boy went out to play at four o'clock in the afternoon.
Later that night, no further contact was made.
Dad thanks everyone who helped him find it.
Thank you for the dozens of contacts and observations you've made in the last few hours.
The update was shared close to 15,000 times, which is an incredible balance in such a short time.
The Finnish UFC star was disappointed by the violent wilding of young people:
Volunteer activist Makwan Amirkhani posted a video on Facebook that appeals specifically to young people from immigrant backgrounds.
Makwan Amirkhani was to make a powerful speech against street fighting by young people.
Born in Iran and arriving in Finland with his family at the age of five, Amirkhani has won both of his professional fights in the most prestigious UFC freestyle series.
Amirkhani says he got a text asking him to look at an Instagram account.
The account has been uploaded videos of teenagers fighting in extremely violent ways.
Amirkhani says he's disappointed in the way the youths are being made crazy.
Amirkhan, 26, has more than 62,000 followers on Facebook.
The guys kick people on the ground, sit on top of each other and hit each other without any thought of these consequences, what happens when you do these videos, Amirkhani updates.
It 's hard to defend anymore .
Some of the young people in these videos are immigrant.
According to Helsinki Police Commissioner Jarmo Heinosen, the fighting videos on social media have been uploaded by both immigrants and native Finnish youths.
The fact that you guys are fighting in the street.
You make the lives of so many other immigrants in Finland more difficult, reminds Amirkhani from Turkey.
Amirkhani reminds that in Finland there are websites that search for crimes committed by immigrants.
These isolated cases have become quite outrageous.
It's a little hard, boys, defending you anymore.
You should remember that you are still in a foreign land and will be visitors here for quite some time.
That's a slightly different way of saying thank you for being here, says Amirkhani.
Amirkhani urges young people to remember their loved ones.
If they ever become the victims of racism, you will blame yourselves.
Now, you guys, think twice before you go along with this.
Amirkhani says that violent action fuels racism.
You're making me hate you in a way that I don't like myself.
You're in a pretty bad place anyway, and you're not gonna make it any better, Amirkhani decides.
SAK pledges its stance on the austerity package
The chairman of the SAK, Lauri Lyly, said on Twitter that the employee association would consider its position on Monday on the alternative savers proposed by the STTK.
Lauri Lyly commented on the STTK proposal on Twitter.
The STTK, a union of staffing agencies, said earlier on Wednesday it would present its own proposal to the government to achieve the five percent productivity cut demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
However, this would require the largest employee organisation, SAK, to soften its position.
The SAK chairman, Lauri Lyly, commented on Twitter.
Lyly writes that the SAC working committee will consider the matter on Monday.
Lylly said the SAK was looking for solutions to 'open up the labour market' and that agreements between active parties were needed to replace mandatory laws.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a new directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The Commission has already concluded that the aid was necessary to ensure that the aid was compatible with the internal market.
Comment: "The show of greatness threatens to slip". "It feels a little funny to punch".
It may feel a little funny to punch if you already have a piece of paper in your pocket, writes Pekka Tiinanen.
The mood at the mercenary camp varies from one end to the other.
Is it to yell at the government to overthrow it or to make a deal with it?
On Monday, the leaders of the SAK alliance expressed their holy rage against the government of the Republic.
Threatened to shut down the whole of Finland.
The threat was spreading to the Akawa.
The teachers' union OAJ threatened to close schools and daycare centers.
On Tuesday, the OAJ cancelled. No school or day care center will be closed completely.
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
He said he had contacted the government and was preparing an alternative proposal for a five percent productivity cut demanded by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (center).
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
At first, there was no word of a yard from the SAK office.
The report also calls for the EU to be able to take on board the EU's nuclear programme.
However, Lyly finally announced that the SAC's working committee would meet next Monday to discuss the situation and that the SAC would seek solutions to "open up the labour market".
In order to create a common representation among employees, the SAA should tend to adopt a 5% productivity cut as a target.
No wonder Palolan's NSC has good relations with the Sipil government.
The right-hand man of Palola, Jukka Ihanus, the director of the STTK's social impact, previously served as special assistant to the Prime Ministers of the Centre, Matti Vanhasen and Mari Kiviniemi.
Palola described the government's Ay skills as being constantly improving.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should be given a mandate to investigate the alleged violations of the principle of subsidiarity.
I know it feels a little weird to punch a guy when you already have a piece of paper in your pocket.
Edited at 6:00 p.m. to add to the list of comments made by Lilly.
Russia accused Finland of being a bad host: 'This must not happen again'
The President of the Russian Duma, Sergei Naryshkin, criticized the Helsinki Conference of the Enterprise.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of energy.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly of the OCTs began in Ulaanbaatar, the capital of Mongolia, where Naryshkin gave extensive comments on the July celebration in Helsinki.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
We considered that this was contrary to the values of parliamentary democracy and the principles of open dialogue.
This must not happen again, Naryshkin stressed, according to the Interfax news agency.
In addition to Finland and the EU, Naryshkin's criticism was directed at the United States, where he was also banned from entering.
The EU's sanctions are political suicide, he said.
The Russian delegation arrived in Mongolia without incident, so Naryshkin continued to poke Finland by praising and thanking Mongolia for its "excellent organization".
I am confident that the Parliamentary Assembly will proceed constructively and with positive results, unlike the one held in Helsinki in July.
The Mongolian leadership understands that there should be no obstacles to parliamentary dialogue.
Naryshkin has met with the meeting leader Ilkka Kanerva (cook) in Ulan Bator, who has already held talks with the Russian delegation, according to Russian media.
The lock is facing the real playoff troll, "goals in a nutshell".
Tappara and Lock continue their bull days in Hakam Forest today, as both are on fire for the second day in a row.
Janne Lahti predicts that no real celebration of goals will be held in Hakamets today.
Tappara came to Kuopi yesterday to cheer for a 3-2 over Kalpa.
The rise was manly, as last season's silver team was at its worst after a two-goal deficit.
Tuesday was a lot more fun.
The Blues, who had started the game with a bang, had a round zero score and a losing record of 2-3.
Tough game, goals close, if they play anything like last year, Lock striker Janne Lahti predicts the setup on the club's side.
The killer's turned into a playoff nightmare for the Ravens.
Because in the last two seasons, Tappara has dropped out of the finals of the same series as Luko.
Both times, the deciding seventh game was required.
Last season, Lock cut the series in the fourth game, but Tappara moved up the next three and passed.
There are no major changes in the squad, except for the goalkeepers.
The cashiers who were both rejected yesterday will be paid a small fee today.
With the goal of the Tappara, Mika Noronen makes room for Tom Bear, and between the Lock-Pols, Rasmus Rinne replaces Ryan Zapolski.
Point of view: a bad play in progress
Sports director Toivola wrote an inappropriate sequel for head coach Iron Maiden, writes Santtu Silvennoinen from Tampere.
It's a classic.
In 1976, Sylvester Stallone wrote the script for the movie Rocky, in which he himself played the lead role.
The challenger sensationally put the world heavyweight champion Apollo Creed in the ring.
Rocky was a big fan, even though he lost the title fight.
Thirty years after the premiere of Rocky, Mika Toivola wrote the story of the restless ashes of Pori.
The nameless, knife-handed potato chipper, to everyone's surprise, advanced to the 2006 SM finals.
The team was full of unnamed but tenacious underdogs like Rocky.
There was a white Indian, a Porin Matt, and a Pele Field.
In the playoffs, the players would dye their heads red and cut off their Iroquois.
Hope turned into a blonde.
The great TV anchor JP Jalo called Coach Neumann.
The ace took the silver.
Hope was one of the heroes.
The writer Toivola believes that this season's novella will work the same way as it did ten years ago.
A man who works as the Ace's athletic director has built a patchwork of bad boys.
Semir Ben-Amor and Josh Gratton have been digging up guys in the back like Rocky pigs in a slaughterhouse.
Masi Marjamäen, Mikko Viitasen, Juha Kiilholma and Matti Kuparisen's merits are somewhere other than in the disc-playing game.
I think you're forgetting that Rocky VI has the lead role of Big Iron Rock.
Karri Stone has crossed Iron Stone for Sean Connery.
The Iron Rock is as clumsy a lead actor in the scripted Rocky as Connery would have been in the original 1976 production.
There's nothing in the Iron Throne but Rocky as a nickname.
The Iron Calf's philosophy is not to rush and play tricks.
He appreciates a hard game, but it's one thing to play hard like a pig.
Last season, Garret Stafford of the Aces knocked Tappara Jere of the Cowboys over the head.
He got two minutes and ten minutes from the judges, but the Iron Rock put him in the shower.
He didn't deserve a minute!
We only play the ones who deserve it.
I don't approve of this kind of game, and it's not part of the ace race. Iron Man, who was hot, went after the game to the Hundred Kingdoms.
The Aces this season are a weirdly structured team.
There are trains, there are veterans, there are cops and there are lifeguards.
There are virtually no key players of the best playing age.
No wonder the head coach has been complaining about a lack of skill.
How much influence have you had on player acquisitions, Big Iron?
Last season's events are affecting procurement and unfortunately the market situation was rather tight, Irutakallio replied diplomatically.
There's a cop under the surface.
The 1953 model year Iron Horse is reportedly interested in moving to the position of sports director.
The men's contracts expire in the spring.
The aces are tied at 1-6 in three league games this season.
I don't think it would have been a good idea for him to write a sequel.
Olga Temonen is playing the mother of Sipe Santapuk.
Olga Temonen reveals that if she had met her husband Tuuka as a teenager, they would have had nothing in common.
Olga Temonen is acting for the first time under the direction of her husband.
Yes, I play the mother of my husband's friend in the movie.
In a way, it feels crazy, the actress and producer Olga Temonen laughs.
She has been married to former bassist and director Tuukka Temose of Apulanna since 2008.
The couple has worked together before, but this is the first time Olga has acted under Tuuka's direction.
Olga's role in the film You Made Us Beautiful, which tells the story of Apulanna's early years, is that of drummer Sipe Santapuk's mother, Sirkka.
Sirkka is supportive of her son, even though his father, Risto (played by Lorenz Backmann), tries to be the voice of reason.
The more I get to know my real role model, the easier it seems to be to play the part.
He's a great guy, and I'm grateful to Tuuka for trusting me with the part.
Olga had met Sirka before the film project, but since then the two have become very close.
They've met, talked on the phone, texted.
The grass has been a great help.
We've gone through a lot of different angles in their history.
And it's also a good thing that Sirkka understands that drama is drama and the truth may need a little coloring.
Olga emphasizes that Sirkka was almost the only one in Heinola who blindly believed that ApuLannas would become the biggest band in Finland.
The '90s were a recession. It was really sad.
There was a pretty slim chance that anyone would actually make it, but Sirka had some intuition, and he was right.
Olga says that she had heard a lot from Tuuka about his youth before filming.
But sometimes the parents' stories have been a little different.
Yeah, if you're a 15-year-old teenager, how much do your parents really know about what you did?
Olga reveals that her own youth was very different from that of Tuuka, known as Heinolan's notorious skateboarder.
Olga was a simple, nice girl who had nothing to do with the movie Tuuka.
The best he could have done was fall in love with her in secret.
Olga says that she has worked with Tuuka so much in the last 10 years that a big joint project is not scary.
Everything's always been super great.
Now the whole production team is going to shoot in Heinola for a month.
True, a couple in the city often plan to drive home for the night because of their young children, since the distance is not too long.
We'll take over the whole of Heinola for a month.
They've given us a very warm welcome, just asking which streets and when to clear.
Iron Sky 2 became the most expensive Finnish drama film
The film Iron Sky: The Coming Race, directed by Timo Vuorensola, has a budget of 17 million euros.
We're shooting in Belgium in October.
Director Timo Vuorensola is set to start shooting Iron Sky 2 in Belgium in October.
The sequel to the sci-fi film Iron Sky, Iron Sky: The Coming Race, becomes the most expensive Finnish drama film of all time with a budget of 17 million euros.
Previously, the title of Finland's most expensive film has been Jalmari Helander's Big Game.
The ongoing Angry Birds animation will also surpass Iron Sky 2 once completed, with a budget of over €100 million.
The film, directed by Timo Vuorensola and produced by Tero Kaukomaan, will start shooting in October at the AED Studios near Antwerp and will last eight weeks.
Director Timo Vuorensola is leaving for Belgium next week.
I'm not afraid of a giant budget.
I've been so sick of relaxing!
I have such a relaxed feel for the script because I know exactly what kind of movie it should be.
Everyone on the task force seems to realize that we're doing something unprecedented.
It's great to go to Belgium.
Even though time is tight, there's no fear in the ass.
I'm more excited and I can't wait to show this movie to the public", she tells Iltalehti.
The film was originally budgeted at $8 million to $10 million, but as the script progressed, the budget also increased.
It's a big budget, but it's also a big story.
But I'm afraid it would cost $100 million to make a movie because every angle and every effect is so expensive.
Now everything's twisted so tightly, there's not a drop of loose.
The film's production company, Iron Sky Universe, launched a crowdfunding campaign on Wednesday and a bond offering an annual interest rate of 4 to 8 percent.
The final rate shall be determined by supply and demand during the campaign.
The company shall repay the loan within two years at the latest.
The film stars Udo Kier, Tom Green and Vladimir Burlakov.
- What's that?
Big logos are coming back on shirts .
The trendsetters' fronts have recently been decorated with large logos.
Not long ago, a fashion conscious person avoided clear, large logos like Crocces as a trap.
Advertising a sweater or a T-shirt was seen as a bit of a joke.
But times are changing.
Sports have become a real fashion mega-trend, and so have old, familiar sportswear brands like Adidas and Nike.
And as so often before, the line between funny and trendy is blurry: if something is already really cool, it starts to become ironic and cool.
First came the norm core trend, or the taboo fashion, where the trendsetters surprised by favoring the most boring basic clothing as a way to stand out from the crowd.
Now, instead of the gray basic college, they put on that shirt buried in the bottom of the closet with the manufacturer's gorgeous logo on the front.
The bigger and more traditional, the better.
In addition to logos, Adidas' recognizable tracksuits, fan-team jerseys, and New York Yankees flags have also made a comeback.
The Calvin Klein logos on the underwear that start at the edge of the jeans are now a cool detail.
The trend seems to be moving from sports brands to luxury brands.
For example, the front of Versace's autumn sweaters makes it clear which iconic garment is in question.
Would you be willing to show off logos in your outfit?
A Russian politician published evidence that I wasn't stuck in a tank door for hours!
The alleged special incident took place in Nizhni Tagil, where the Russia Arms Expo 2015 was held, showcasing products of the Russian defence industry.
In recent days, the Russian media have reported in colorful terms that the Russian Emergency Management Agency had to detach the large Zotov from the tank door for five hours.
Zotov has since done everything he can to deny the information.
He even posted a picture on his own public Facebook page showing him peering out of the hatch of an armored vehicle in a rather good mood, and at least the pictures show no sign of being stuck or angry.
It's all bullshit.
Let's start with the fact that I didn't go in a tank. It was a BMP-3.
I'm an ex-soldier myself, Lieutenant Colonel, I served in the Urals.
I went in there, looked around and came out peacefully, Zotov told Komsomolskaya Pravda.
I wasn't stuck, and I certainly didn't spend five hours in that position, he said.
Zotov told the Russian military TV channel that he was fascinated by the new Russian technology at the exhibition because he himself is a former professional soldier.
That's why I was interested in what was inside the wagons, I was fascinated by our technology.
And I came out through the trunk, he said.
I've been to every tank.
And in the next exhibition, I will definitely visit all the tanks and all the armored fighting vehicles, Zotov promised.
Zotov also called the reporter who wrote the story a fool.
One idiot wrote it and everyone else repeated it.
There was no such thing.
I went in, and I came out.
I am tall and rotten, but nothing like being stuck in a tank somewhere happened", he told Russkaja sluzhba novotei radio.
Zotov's statement is supported by the fact that no photograph of the alleged trapped gun has been published, despite the fact that 50,000 people visited the exhibition in a few days.
The allegation of Zotov's being trapped originated from a story on the Bloknot.ru website, where Zotov was told that he had broken out of the tank door while trying to escape and eventually threatened to shoot everyone around him if he did not get out of his cage.
Later, the Bloknot website published a follow-up story in which the exhibition organizers shared their views on what happened.
Everyone's just used to soldiers jumping out of armored vehicles quickly.
But Congressman Zotov, because of his size, simply lingered when he came out.
But he certainly did not sit there for five hours, said Alexander Pisarevski, coordinator of the exhibition, to Bloknot.

Designed by architects Mogens (1901-87) and Flemming (1902-84), Lassen's 1962 pinnacle looks as if it were designed today.
A cubic steel skeleton is like a work of art, and that's what it was originally.
The architectural brothers are known for refining the shape of the nail for a long time with mathematical precision.
It was originally presented only to the distinguished dinner guests of the gentlemen.
The cube candles are made by the family company By Lassen, which continues the design heritage of the famous brothers.
The candles are handmade in Holstebro, Denmark, in eight, four and one-candle versions, in four different colours.
The cube comes in black, white, and nickel and copper.
The candle is very relevant right now and it fits into many homes.
It's been a favorite of interior design bloggers lately.

A leak has occurred at the Kittilä mine of Agnico Eagle, a Canadian-owned mining company.
The process water purified from the gold mine has been leaking into the ditch from what is called the enrichment basin.
The company has announced that measures to correct the leak have been initiated.
The pool contains neutralized enrichment sludge from the foaming process and purified process water.
In general, the water is either pumped for reuse as process water or discharged into the environment via a surface treatment plant as permitted.
The leak was estimated to be about 300 cubic meters per hour when it was detected.
The company claims that the quality of the leakage water meets the current permit requirements.
Nothing else was released into the environment.
The leak was detected on a routine inspection Monday morning.
No structural damage to the pool's damaged structures has been detected.
The company says it is working closely with the authorities to monitor and remedy the situation.
The mine employs about six hundred permanent workers.
Danish Minister for Foreign Affairs warns against cutting too much
The report on the country of Finland published today by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) broadly follows the views of the government and the Treasury.
The organisation pushed Finland to undertake comprehensive structural reforms to cope with economic problems.
The IMF believes that reducing overtime pay and paid holidays would support Finland's competitiveness.
Reforms would be needed to the whole system of contracts and to unemployment insurance.
Danske Bank's chief economist Pasi Kuoppamaai said that while there was agreement on structural reforms, there were some minor differences.
The IMF's assessment contains many messages of sympathy for the government's actions, but also contains words of warning about what should not be cut too much.
This is the case, for example, with infrastructure investments, says Kuoppamäki.
The IMF also believes that growth projects should be implemented as quickly as possible to support weak economic growth.
The IMF forecasts Finland's economic growth rate to be 0.4% this year, accelerating to 0.9% next year.
In its new economic forecast, Danske forecasts growth to be at zero this year.
The IMF is a little more optimistic about this year.
They could have been based on the latest observations.
This morning the Statistics Office reported that total production was in a low growth in the summer, notes Kuoppamäki.
The decline in industrial confidence or other so-called softer indicators may have once again attracted less attention.
The differences, however, are only a few percent decimal places.
Nintendo , recovering from a deathbed , has appointed a new CEO .
Tatsumi Kimishima, who worked under Satoru Iwata, who died of cancer in July, will start work on Wednesday, Nintendo said Monday.
Iwata had been running Nintendo since 2002 and was a popular and charismatic face in the gaming industry.
Iwata, for example, was responsible for the successful launch of the Wii console.
The choice of 65-year-old Kimishima is not a big surprise.
He was one of the names that were put forward as possible successors to Iwata.
Kimishima is a safe choice to follow in Iwata's footsteps, Ace Research analyst Hideki Yasuda told Reuters.
Kimishima's mission is seen as bringing Nintendo heavily into mobile gaming, but not eating the company's bread on the side of traditional gaming consoles.
More and more minors arriving in Finland alone
As early as February 2015, the Swedish Migration Agency admitted that up to hundreds of children who have arrived in the country disappear every year.
The Swedish Migration Agency reports that hundreds of minors disappear every year in Sweden, according to SVT.se and Dagens Nyheter.
The Finnish Immigration Service's inspector-general, Juha Kannelmaa, explains the situation in Finland and how it has changed.
Is it the same in Finland?
How many asylum seekers go "underground" each year? - In Finland, a total of 156 unaccompanied minors applied for asylum in 2013.
Nine of them disappeared.
In 2014, 196 such applications were made and 11 of them disappeared, says Kannelma.
The reason for the disappearance may be that the proceedings show that the applicant is already registered in another country applying the Dublin Regulation and has been found to be of legal age there.
In this case, it may be more attractive for the applicant to disappear than to continue the proceedings in Finland and be returned to the country responsible for processing the application.
Similarly, some disappeared persons are also found later when they seek asylum in another Member State.
In 2014, there were a total of 3651 asylum seekers in Finland, of which 134 applications were rejected on the grounds that the applicant had probably moved out of Finland, so 123 adult asylum seekers disappeared in the past year, he says.
Is it increasing?
As of 6 September this year, we have received a total of 586 applications for asylum from unaccompanied minors.
He also stressed that the EU had to make a concerted effort to ensure that the EU's nuclear programme was implemented in a way that would ensure that the nuclear weapons would be used effectively.
What about those who have made the decision to convert?
Do they also disappear into the "dark market"?
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of asylum seekers in the EU to a maximum of 150.
The EU has a number of programmes to support the development of the European Union's external relations.
He's taken action on this.
The EU's minister for home affairs, Orpo, discussed refugee issues on Monday and described practical measures to control the flow of asylum seekers through Sweden to northern Finland.
Nina Mikkonen is selling Timo T.A. ' s studio online . Look at the pictures of the equipment .
The equipment used by Timo T.A. Mikkos, a media pioneer who lost his ability to work due to illness, is now for sale.
Mikkonen's wife Nina Mikkonen sells devices on Huuto.net that were once the most advanced tools for professionals in their field.
The first to report the online ad was the online newspaper Iltamakasiini.
Today, much of the equipment is left behind by technological progress.
In the digital media world, we no longer record television programs on Betacam tapes.
Nina Mikkonen is confident that there will be interest.
Of course, the hardware is no longer as up-to-date, but these are needed as long as there is old-generation material that needs to be digitized.
On the other hand, there are also many amateurs, collectors and builders of their own studio, Nina Mikkonen, who is considering IS.
The reason for the sale is that the Mikkos are trying to move out of their current home in Stormland.
There's no way we can take all this stuff with us.
I've been slowly starting to inventory and see what stuff is being given away.
This is where I started, Nina Mikkonen says.
There's no use for TV and radio anymore.
The evidence of recent strokes clearly shows that a man with a long career will never return to work.
Nina Mikkonen points out that now only goods and equipment are sold.
The real life work of Timo T.A. Mikkonen was already archived in the summer at the National Audiovisual Institute, whose representatives went to the box shop to pick up films and other material from Myrskylä.
Traffic is at risk of being more congested than expected, with subways and trams likely to be shut down all day Friday.
Metro and tram drivers will decide today whether to expand their force on Friday's demonstration.
The original plan was to suspend subway and tram services only for the Friday demonstration.
It's the afternoon to decide if we're gonna have a traffic stop for the day.
Chief Pekka Hirvonen says the threat to the field is high.
Since night and shift surgeries are bad for drivers, government plans to cut the livers are opposed.
However, Hirvonen thinks that a day's traffic is a kind of dilemma.
If the subway and tram stop on Friday, public transportation in the capital region will be virtually completely stopped.
According to VR, trains do not run on Fridays between 6am and 6pm.
There's no traffic on Friday, no long-distance or short-distance.
Trains departing before 6 a.m. will be taken to their destinations.
According to HSL, most of the buses will be left in storage.
The ACP members are absent from work on Fridays from 3 a.m. to 3 a.m. on Saturdays.
A small number of buses are likely to be driven, they are driven by a supervisory force, HSL spokesman Pirkko Repo believes.
Repo says HSL can't tell you exactly what bus shifts are running on Friday.
The employee organisations will organise a demonstration at the Helsinki Railway Station on Friday from 11 to 13 o'clock.
Hungarian police use tear gas against refugees
Hungarian police attacked hundreds of refugees with tear gas.
The incident occurred on the border of Hungary and Serbia, where many refugees are trying to make their way to Europe, reports the AP news agency.
Sky News is reporting that refugees have been trying to break through the border fence.
The refugees, many of them women and children, fled in panic.
Local media reported that Hungarian police had also used water cannons against people.
A Muslim boy was arrested at a school in Texas after his teacher thought his own watch was a bomb .
In Texas, U.S.A., 14-year-old Ahmed Mohamed has been arrested after his teacher thought a homemade clock he brought to school was a bomb.
Mohamed told the Dallas Morning News that he just wanted to show off his electronic hobby.
But one of the teachers kept the watch looking like a bomb.
The police were called, and the situation eventually ended with the boy being taken in handcuffs to a juvenile detention cell.
At no point has Mohammed been found to claim anything other than that he had made the watch.
Still, it's possible the boy could be charged with making a fake bomb.
According to Mohammed, the police had said that the watch looked like a "movie bomb".
The watch is in police custody, but it was reportedly made up of a circuit board and a digital display with wires between them.
The incident happened last Monday and Mohamed was punished with a three-day forced vacation from school.
Her father is furious about the incident and the country's American-Islamic Council is considering whether it is another manifestation of Islamophobia in the United States.
Britain is in a state of unrest after the Labour leader refused to sing the national anthem.
The song is a plea to God to protect the Queen, but Corbyn is an opponent of the monarchy.
The criticism of the right-leaning press has been echoed by members of Corbyn's own Labour Party.
This has offended the people, said Labour MP Kate Green in a BBC radio interview.
Green thinks Corbyn should have joined the song.
Yesterday's memorial service honored the British Air Force pilots who fought the German Luftwaffe in 1940.
The Labour Party has issued an official statement defending Corbyn, saying he showed respect for the pilots by attending the event.
We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to the heroism of the Royal Air Force pilots.
He stood respectfully silent during the national anthem, the statement underlined.
Corbyn's election as leader has divided the Labour Party.
There are those among the MPs in particular who fear he will drive out moderate voters with his radical views.
Corbyn is in favour of a unilateral ceasefire, an end to austerity and an increase in public spending.
Corbyn is due to appear for the first time as leader of the Labour Party in Parliament today during the Prime Minister's Question Time.
Mr Corbyn has asked the public for suggestions on what questions should be asked of Prime Minister David Cameron.
Cameron tweeted at the weekend that Corbyn had been elected leader.
The Labour Party is a threat to our national security, our financial security and the safety of our families, the Prime Minister tweeted on his personal account.
The cause of death in the Minnesota family is still unclear . The father of the family was awaiting trial .
South Lake Minnetonka police have been investigating a family death in Greenwood, Minnesota for nearly a week.
The family of five was found dead in their home on September 10th, and a few days later, police confirmed that the shooter was the father of the family, Brian Scott Short, 45.
After first shooting his wife and three children with a shotgun, Brian Short killed himself in the garage of his home.
Dead for days .
The family was found after the school became concerned about the children's absence.
Based on this report, the police went to the house for a search and found the Short family dead on all sides of the huge house.
According to the Star Tribune, it's possible the victims had been dead for days.
A Million-dollar House and a Successful Business
The investigation into the death of South Lake Minnetonka Police Chief Michael Siitar is still ongoing.
The motive for the bloodshed is still unclear.
The shooter, Brian Short, was a successful businessman who had made his fortune on a social media site for nurses, AllNurses.com.
In a 2014 interview with StarTribune, Short said the site had four million unique visitors each week.
I've had 50 offers to buy the company in the last ten years.
I've given up on them all.
But I still have a lot of ideas I want to implement.
Maybe at some point I'll sell the company, but not yet.
One of the things that helped them to succeed was the purchase of a two-million-dollar, luxury home in Greenwood in 2011.
The house is advertised on the Zillowi real estate website as a car collector's dream: not only does it have 12 rooms, but it also has a garage large enough to hold eight cars.
The case is pending.
But according to the Star Tribune, the father of the family was facing a lawsuit.
She was sued by the test prep company Achieve Test Prep over comments on AllNurses.com.
According to Achieve Test Prep, Short's website had not removed comments defaming prep courses and, as a result, they had lost customers to competitors.
However, according to StarTribune, it is very unclear whether the trial would have had a very significant impact on Short's business.
The Loire was offering the cupcake coffee.
The owner trio was also awarded the Finnish Hippo Horse Owner of the Month Award at a feeding event.
This is great, Loiri said cheerfully of his honorary plaque.
The celebrated Fabrice Duo won the Derby on the first Saturday in September and won €100,000.
The legendary artist Loiri was still confused by Fabrice Duo's success in the Grand Prix.
I still can't believe that happened.
According to Loir, a successful horse trainer, working with a horse gives him complete peace of mind.
Pekka decides and decides where the horse is taken to race.
And I'm going to keep my mouth shut, Loire.
A stunningly beautiful gesture from an NHL star. "The greatest gift ever made by an athlete".
Montreal Canadiens superstar P. K. Subban has donated $10 million to the Montreal Children's Hospital.
According to a hospital press release, this is the largest single donation ever made by an athlete to a charity in Canada.
In addition, 26-year-old Subban has pledged to help the hospital in another fundraising effort for the next seven years.
Subban signed with the Canadiens a year ago for eight years and $72 million.
Subban's donation is therefore significantly higher than his annual income of $9 million.
As a reward for his donation, Subba will be given a hall in the hospital that bears his name.
Canadiens players have made significant contributions to local hospitals in the past.
A year ago, longtime captain Jean Beliveau, who died, raised millions of dollars for the same children's hospital, among others, and Saku Koivu raised a huge sum for another major city hospital to get the hospital the PET scanner needed for cancer research.

Soon 150 million vehicles will be connected to the Internet: The cyberattacks on cars are being prepared
The Automotive Security Review Board (ASRB) also supports technological development and innovation in the industry, Intel said in a press release.
The board is made up of top security experts from around the world.
The ASRB researchers will conduct continuous security testing and audits aimed at standardising best practices and design recommendations for advanced cybersecurity solutions and products.
At the same time, Intel released the first version of its best practices for cybersecurity.
The company will update the report based on the findings of the ASRB in the future.
The international ICT research and consultancy Gartner estimates that by 2020 some 150 million vehicles on the road will be connected to the grid.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road.
The same estimate suggests that 60 to 75% of these vehicles will be able to consume, create and share web-based data.
We can and must improve the cybersecurity of cars, says Chris Young, Director of Intel Security.
The ASRB will allow Intel to establish security best practices and support the view that cybersecurity is an important component of the design of every connected car.
Few things are more personal than our own safety on the road, which makes the ASRB board the right idea at the right time.
Intel is one of the world's leading innovators in computing.
The Ford Focus RS costs about 52 000 euros in Finland!
The Ford Focus RS has been waiting for years like the moon rising.
Finally, the car is also starting to be in the spotlight in Finland.
Ford has released the RS data as the automotive world looks to the Frankfurt Motor Show.
Powered by a 2.3-liter, 350-horsepower engine, Ford's new four-wheel-drive RS accelerates from zero to 100 in 4.7 seconds and reaches a top speed of 175 miles per hour (266 km/ hr).
The Finnish version also has an interesting price, which is reportedly EUR 52 000.
The car is now available for order, although Ford does not say when the first cars will arrive in Finland.
At the Frankfurt Motor Show , Kia introduced two new models , the new Sportage and the Optima .
The most important of these two innovations is certainly the new fourth generation Sportage, with which Kia intends to take a bigger hand in the ever-growing market for off-road vehicles.
The new Sportage, designed by European design director Gregory Guillaume, is more round than before.
The axle spacing and the outer dimensions have been increased by an inch here and an inch there, and the car is clearing the air more efficiently.
The engine range is essentially the same, but with the addition of a 1.6-litre turbo engine producing 177 horsepower.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet established the exact amount of the aid.
We're gonna have to wait a little longer, because we're getting a new Sportage in the spring of 2016.
Before the turn of the year, we'll have the new Kia Optimus in our country.
At first glance, the novelty doesn't seem to have changed, but it's a brand-new car.
Kia intends to win the hearts of upper-middle-class buyers with even better driving characteristics, lower noise levels and higher-end equipment.
Optima will be available with a 1.7-litre turbodiesel and a 2.0-litre petrol engine.
Next summer, the pace will pick up when the 2.0-litre Optima GT comes alongside them.
At the same time as its arrival, the Optima Farmer will be on sale.
Chisu returned to the stage, and he was in a bold suit.
The singer Chisu is in the "Life for a Child" concert with other local stars.
The light blue suit has a conspicuous open neck hole.
The costume is a beautiful display of the singer's chubby waist.
The whole thing is crowned with a gold metal belt and red lipstick.
During her three-year hiatus, the singer-turned-mother has shed the extra pounds with light exercise and yoga.
Chisu's daughter is about to turn one.
The singer released her first single from her new album in August.
I'm not really excited about getting back on stage and getting in front of a big crowd after a long break.
"I've missed everything music-related", says the singer.
Chisu will release his new album in a couple of weeks, and his fourth album, called Polaris.
I've been inspired to write new songs because of my new life.
At this point, I'm wondering if people will find my new album, Chisu wonders.
Kim Kardashian 's mothering style is stunning again . Now you can see her breasts .
Reality TV beauty Kim Kardashian is making headlines one after another.
She's been showing off her pregnancy belly and breasts in a wildly sexy outfit, most recently last night at 1:00 AM EST, when she walked out of a show with her sister Kourtney Kardashian and husband Kanye West.
The black maternity dress is transparent from the breasts.
It's a flash of lightning that reveals the leathery bras underneath the dress.
The last time Kardashian wore an Amazon-style maternity suit was when she visited a friend at a dinner party in New York just a few days ago.
The black high-heeled boots highlighted the outfit.
The third special maternity suit is as fresh as last Friday night when the show was on maternity.
The hard laws of modeling: no home, lonely, competition is fierce.
Top model Manon Leloup wanted to challenge the notion that the modeling world is a pure glamour and champagne party.
She made her own documentary, Speaking Dolls, in which Leloup and her colleagues speak out about the modeling business.
Harpeer's Bazaar magazine compiled six harsh truths about Leloup from behind the scenes.
Every season starts from scratch.
Even if you posed in top-notch designer outfits last season, the new season starts with casting again.
And every season, there are new, fresh faces in the business, competing for jobs with the tough guys.
Models rarely have a place to call home.
The work is a constant journey, and it can last for years, with the model staying in a hotel room or apartment.
If you are very young and your mother cannot travel with you, loneliness can be unbearably difficult.
New York and Paris are desirable places to work, but they're the most stressful.
There's not just one kind of thinness.
You know, an agent in New York might ask you to lose weight, but in Paris, they'll say you're too thin.
Getting a job is always a gamble.
At fashion weeks, models and designers are together all the time, and they act as a support network.
When the fashion weeks are over, the breakup is a pain.
Models are attracted to the industry because of the opportunities it offers, but they are plagued by the idea that everyone thinks the job is just a showcase.
Models like to have their own personalities.
It makes models feel like they're actors with a role.
But you can also express yourself in the work of a model.
The models at the Tory Burch show last night.
New York City is currently hosting Fashion Week, where designers will reveal their lineup for next year.
Roope Salminen , who has changed his style , plays the most unknown of the ApuLanta musicians .
Roope Salminen plays Antti Lautala, a founding member of the band, in the film based on the early years of the band.
Lautala formed Apulanna in 1991 with Toni Wirtas, but left the band in 1994.
I mean, this is a pretty big challenge for me because I'm a rap artist who's about to turn 26, and in this movie, I'm playing a 16-year-old guitarist, Salmine Laughs.
I've always been reluctant to meet the real Ant before the shoot because I want to make him my interpreter.
Antti is obviously more unfamiliar to people than that group, so I think it's okay to just learn his playing style from video.
I don't want to make an imitation of a human.
A man who trusts the empty Roope Salminen and the Dogs will not be cast.
Punk manners come naturally to a man.
I'm sure many of you saw a preview of the punk era of Stars, Stars, and if you've ever been to one of our shows, you've seen a preview.
We've never been a little show, but we always go full.
The cast of the film "You made us beautiful" directed by Tuukka Temese, who played bass in the band from 1993 to 2004, was announced today.
The core of the band, which has become familiar to the public, is performed by young actors who are still relatively unknown to the general public.
Drummer Sipe Santapukkia is played by Teppo Manner, singer Toni Wirtsa Tatu Sinisalo and bassist Tuukka Temosta Iiro Panula.
Roope Salminen gave a hint of her upcoming bust last night when she shared on Snapchat that she was mysteriously preparing for the most important day of her career.
Roope posted a picture of his new look on Instagram yesterday, which he had to implement for the film.
Roope, seen earlier with a mustache and chin chin, has shaved his face silky and dyed his brown hair black.
Psychologist advises: This is how you tell your children about refugees
In recent days, many parents have had to wonder how to tell their children about the situation of refugees trying to reach Europe.
Or is it worth telling at all?
There is no need to force the issue, advises psychologist Ferdinand Garoff, a member of the SPR crisis team.
Younger children should be protected, for example, by not letting them watch the news alone.
Young children may not always understand what they see, and it can be a memory and a source of anxiety, he says.
However, if a child has seen news reports about refugees on television or has heard about them elsewhere, it is worth discussing.
It is good to talk about the child's points of view and to listen carefully to what he asks.
A child's fears can be surprising.
They may not be the ones that a parent imagines he fears.
You don't want to scare a child for no reason, even if it's scary and scary.
A younger child closely observes the behavior of his parents.
If the parents themselves remain calm during the discussion, the child will feel safe too.
Older children are more likely to encounter discussions about refugees at school, with friends, or online.
If the child is concerned, parents do well to discuss the matter with them.
The fact is, not all people in the world are doing well.
Parents and children can discuss how our family will handle this.
But in the end, do we feel that the world is a safe place or an unsafe place?
Parents may also have different parenting views - some may want to protect their children from anxiety where possible.
On the other hand, if difficult matters are discussed in the family, the child will have a model for dealing with the challenges of life ahead.
This could be useful to him in the future.
Social psychologist Janne Viljamaa: "Teach your children to help the weak"
Your own power at the end?
You can still be a good parent to your child
The ball of smoke that hits Vermillion is hard to contain
The North Pole was able to finish the attack of the Apilan Ball Ice in mid-summer.
It was racking up wins and second places until it collapsed at the end of July at the Tampere rave.
When the stallion froze to the bottom, the trainer suspected something was wrong and ordered his protégé a time with the vet.
The explanation for the blackout came up during surveillance.
The horse had strep throat.
The disease was not a mild one, but it required two courses of medication to conquer it.
Since Apilan Balloslama had to be lightly exercised, Pohjola says that she was positively surprised by the horse's last run.
It was the second SE strike in Turku in record time after Taruntuli.
The Apilan Balloslama was under a lot of pressure after a break, having been able to run normally for only a few weeks.
Given these things, the slight slump at the end was understandable, says Pohjola.
Coach assumes a good competition gave the stallions a kick in the pants.
The horse's gait must have gone on, and hopefully it would have evened out.
The Apilans have been the so-called horses of humour.
If he's not entertained, he could have been fat without getting sick.
On a good day, however, the bulls have been struck by lightning that has amazed their opponents.
At low speed, the rivals cannot match the Ball-Slam, which even warm-blooded riders can ride.
The North's hopes are in Vermont for a peasants' run.
But it's a different matter how the Apilans' Ball-Slam agrees to it.
It's kind of hard when you're leaving and you might even get stuck under the bumper of the car and stuff.
I hope the stallion is calmer than when Turku left.
Apilan Balloslama, when he's fit, can also come from the bow, and we're going to drive it to win, the coach promises.
This is why you can 't get rid of useless iPhone apps .
It's the CEO of Apple, Tim Cook.
At least some of the apps that come with Apple's iPhones may be removed at some point in the future - but not all of them.
Apple may be planning to remove some of its own apps from iPhone phones in the future, CEO Tim Cook told Buzzfeed.
Apple's iPhone has a number of applications that are relatively unused: FaceTime calls, newsstands, Health, Stock Exchange, Podcasts and Vinkes come to mind.
The latest addition to these programs is the Apple Watch, which came as a mandatory update for iPhones, although it is only necessary for Apple smartwatch owners.
Cook says removing Apple's software is more complicated than it looks.
Some of the apps are linked to something else on the iPhone.
If they are removed, it could cause problems elsewhere on the phone, Cook tells Buzzfeed.
Cook did not mention which of Apple's iPhone apps work seamlessly with other applications.
There are other programs that don't work like this.
So over time, I think we can develop a way to let the user delete them, Cook added.
Cook says Apple is investigating the matter because it doesn't want to waste memory on people's iPhones.
Inflation in the euro area fell to 0.1% in August
Consumer prices in the euro area rose only marginally in August, by 0.1% year on year, the EU statistical office Eurostat reported today.
The price increases were driven down by the fall in energy prices.
Eurostat thus revised slightly downwards its forecast of 0.2% a few weeks ago.
In July, the inflation rate was 0.2%.
So-called core inflation fell to 0.9% in August from 1.0% in July.
Eurostat forecast for underlying inflation was 1.0%.
Energy prices in the euro area were 7.2% cheaper last month than a year ago.
In all 28 EU countries, average inflation was zero in August.
In July, the increase was 0.1%.
The highest increase in consumer prices in the euro area was recorded in Malta in August, at 1.4%.
The lowest inflation rate in the price downturn was 1.9% in Cyprus.
In Finland, inflation was negative 0.2% according to the EU harmonised price index.
Euro area inflation remains firmly behind the European Central Bank's (ECB) target of a moderate rise in prices of 2%.
The ECB forecasts inflation in the euro area to average 0.1% this year.
The rise will pick up to 1.1% next year, the central bank forecast in its new inflation forecast published in early September.
The Fed is now trying to tighten monetary policy.
The next recession in the United States will begin at its fastest in less than a year, but more likely in three years, after the Fed raises interest rates for the first time in a long time.
And the downturn in the financial markets starts before the next recession.
The Fed has hinted that it will start raising rates possibly as early as this week and no later than the end of the year.
So the next recession could hit at its fastest by next autumn and the financial markets before that.
Or at least that's what will happen if the world's largest economy and financial market continues to operate as it has been doing and if it reacts to the Fed's blackmail of money-sharks as it has in the past.
This is the conclusion reached by market research strategists Jim Reid, Nick Burns and Seb Barker of Deutsche Bank in London in their extensive study of long-term market and economic cycles.
The bank distributed a 60-page Long-Term Asset Return Study to its international large clients last week.
The strategists who produced the study and report do not believe they know exactly when the Fed will raise rates or what will happen to the economy and markets afterwards.
Instead, they use the cold facts and calculations of economic statistics to show how the economy and markets have behaved in the past, during and after the Fed rate hikes.
In addition to historical observations, they look at what key economic and financial market variables are now in the same or different patterns as during previous rate hikes - and what the possible consequences are.
It is clear that both the economy and financial markets are now in a better position to withstand rising interest rates than at any time since the 1950s.
The recession may not even begin in a year.
Throughout the summer and early autumn, the Fed's monetary policy and adjustment leaders have been signaling that the time is ripe for interest rates to rise.
The first interest rate hike in over nine years could be this week.
The matter will be resolved between Wednesday and Thursday when the Fed's so-called Open Market Committee meets to decide at its two-day meeting.
The Fed last raised its so-called Fed funds rate in June 2006.
This was the end of a series of relatively regular but small 0.25 percentage point rate hikes over two years, with the Fed raising its interest rate from 1.25 to 5.25 percent.
The financial market syndrome began in 2007 with the problems of the most risky housing finance in the United States, and a year later the financial crisis erupted into a global doomsday nightmare.
The Great Recession hit in 2009.
The last time the serious setbacks in financial markets and the real economy started were slower than has typically happened since the previous Fed rate hikes.
Accordingly, the trials were then more severe and severe than at any time since the depression of the 1930's.
Deutsche strategists have screened the ups and downs of the world's largest economies and the financial market ups and downs since 1950 and in some places since the early 19th century.
They've been talking about Fed interest rate hikes and their economic and financial implications since the 1950s.
The fastest time since the first rate hike to the onset of recession has been less than a year, most often less than three years and on average less than three and a half years.
The rise in the price of the financial markets has ended within a year or two of the beginning of the Fed's interest rate hikes.
The Fed has raised and lowered its policy rate in successive cycles since the early 1950s.
Each time has varied somewhat and the rates are relatively low, so that no definitive conclusions can be drawn from them on the effects of subsequent interest rate increases.
As the strategists remind us, this time around, many things are different.
And not just better.
Interest rates too low for too long
Decades of research may not be enough to uncover the root causes of the financial crisis and the culprits.
But three things about the causes of the crisis and its destructive power are probably fairly clear:
1) The Fed, the euro area ECB and the other major central banks of the world kept their key interest rates too low for too long in the 21st century.
They were patching up the tech bubble while growing the next one.
(2) The already excessive debt accumulation over decades in the various sectors of the financial and real economies was exacerbated by the impact of monetary policy on central bank surpluses.
The biggest debt bubble in economic history was born.
3) The almost unrestrained inflow of cheap debt financing into the financial economy in particular led to the biggest price bubbles in the history of most financial markets, from stocks to real estate, bonds and commodities.
It is hardly hard to argue that the financial markets, which had soared to new heights on the back of ever more complex debt levers, were in an unusually dangerous and volatile situation when the Fed and other central banks last raised rates.
The valuation bubbles, which were based on leveraged financial structures, only lasted after interest rates had started to rise and the cost of debt financing had started to rise.
The risks were realised in the financial crisis, which was followed by a major recession.
Bigger bubble and more debt
Deutschen strategists do not predict what will happen next, but give reason for speculation by mentioning, for example, the following:
1) The Fed and other major central banks have now kept monetary policy in a more relaxed alignment for even longer than before the financial crisis.
If before the crisis interest rates were too low for too long, they have now been lower for even longer.
(2) For a long time, borrowing has not been as cheap as it was ten years ago, but now at its lowest, it is literally cheaper than paying off debt.
Thus, the debt burden on the financial and real economies has not been eased but is now much higher in different sectors than at any time before or since the financial crisis.
(3) The liquidity from central banks, which has become more liquid and cheaper, has remained for the most part in financial markets, pushing the key asset classes to their highest levels since the pre-crisis peak or ever.
Not only do strategists ease the mood with warning signs from financial markets but they also point out that even the U.S. economy has not yet recovered from the financial crisis and the worst recession in decades to the extent that it has in the past.
The euro area economy has barely recovered.
The real economy is in unusually weak shape, but accordingly financial market pressures and risks are far greater than before the financial crisis, as the Fed tighten its monetary policy next.
Perhaps the future picture of Albert Edwards, strategist at the French bank Société Générale, is not as strange as it may suddenly seem.
He has been training the Bank's international investment clients for a long time on the following full-time Fed roles:
First the Fed raises rates, then the financial bubbles burst, and soon it's time for the Fed to rush to put out the financial bubbles with even bigger strikes of QE.
Hewlett-Packard (HP), a computer and printer company, plans to cut as many as 33,000 jobs.
Most of the reductions are for HP's corporate services business, the company said.
In November, HP will split into Hewlett Packard Enterprises, a company focused on corporate sales, and HP Inc., a company focused on consumer PCs and printers.
HP's workforce peaked in 2011 when it had 350000 employees.
In October last year, the staff was reduced to 302,000.
The company records a one-off cost of USD 2.7 billion (approximately EUR 2.4 billion) for the arrangements.
Hewlett Packard Enterprises is cutting 25,000 to 30,000 jobs.
The consumer deductions will remain at 3300 over three years.
HP intends to move its operations to low-cost countries so that 60% of its workforce will be in low-cost countries by 2018.
The company claims that it has already balanced its business so that no longer any of its customers accounts for more than 10% of its operating profit.
In the second year, its three largest customers accounted for 65 percent of its revenue.
iOS 9: how to get the new operating system on iPhone after Apple releases the update
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, clicking General, and then selecting Software Update.
If the update is ready, the phone will give you the option to download and then install it.
Some users have had problems after this installation with the error message "Software update failed".
To avoid this, it is recommended that users either wait for the worst of the traffic to pass or try updating via iTunes.
The phone guides the user through the final process.
This may include removing apps to get space, but Apple has reduced this possibility by reducing the size of the update and also facilitated the process with a new tool that suggests apps to be removed and then re-installs them when the update is complete.
Make sure that your phone is charged or near the charger during the upgrade to avoid running out of battery.
If the charging rate is too low, Apple will not allow the update to proceed, as if the battery runs out in the middle, it may lead to a failure of the update.

You should also make sure you've reviewed our list of all the things you need to do before you charge to make sure things don't go wrong, and how you can protect yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, such as a much smarter personal assistant and a host of new productivity features for iPad, as well as improvements to speed up and fix the operating system.
General: Minister Berner has served on the board of a tax haven company
The Commission has also adopted a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
According to Yle, the company's operations are linked to so-called tax planning.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the contested tax ruling is compatible with the internal market.
According to the Luxembourg Trade Register, Berner remains officially a member of the Board.
Berner himself says he resigned in May.
I checked it out, and all I have to do is leave a notice of termination.
It is almost impossible to manage and control that the registration chains happen on the agreed schedule, Berner says in an interview with Yle.
Membership after merger
The Luxembourg company manages the holdings of the Swedish company Kährs.
Kährs is a parquet manufacturer that merged with Finnish parquet manufacturer Karelia-Upofloor in 2012.
Berner served on the board of Karelia-Upofloor from 2010 to 2013 and, after the merger, on the board of Kährs and the Luxembourg company.
According to Yle, Kährs' holdings in Luxembourg are managed through a multi-tiered ownership structure.
Berner tells Ylle that he accepted a board membership in the Luxembourg company at the request of the second largest owner of Kährs.
This is owned by Hartwall Capital.
I've been on the board of Karelia-Upofloor, owned by Hartwall Capital.
The company was looking for a partner, and they found him in Sweden.
This company was owned by a private investor with a company in Luxembourg.
I felt that my job was to ensure that the interests of the Finnish family company's capital were realised.
It is important that we ensure that the capital gains of our Finnish companies are taxed in Finland and that starting point was secured in this context, says Berner.
Berner tells Ylee that Hartwall Capital's holdings in the company are not tax-planned.
According to Berner, the complex ownership structure of the tax havens is due to the fact that the largest owner of Kährs, the Triton capital fund, already had a Luxembourg holding company ready for the holdings.
Espoo opens a company-run reception centre
Espoo Otaniemi opens the first company-run reception centre for adult asylum seekers.
The reception centre is ready to take in the first 100 residents starting tonight at 6pm.
The number of seats can grow to 300-400 people within a week.
The Immigration Service is setting up a reception centre on the former Salvation College property.
The activities are carried out by Luona Oy, which is mainly engaged in the provision of healthcare and nursing services.
The City of Espoo, the Immigration Service and Luona Oy agree together on security arrangements for the centre.
The SPC prepares an alternative workplace extortion package
The SPCA is preparing an alternative package to the government's blackmail of working people.
The organisation also wants other employee centres to join.
According to the chairman, Antti Palola, the focus is on Friday's demonstration.
Alternative means of reducing the cost of labour are then reviewed.
"Everyone understands that life goes on after Friday", Palola told reporters during a break from the organization's board meeting.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of education and training.
The economists at STTK have calculated that the change protection provided by the government's competitiveness package will cost the employer an estimated EUR 30 million, while the other half of the package is EUR 2 700 million.
I don't know if there's a huge enthusiasm on either side to have a conversation when there's a one-to-one ratio on the other side.
Palola: Negotiating contacts were constructive
The Commission has also been asked to provide a list of the Member States which are to be included in the new programme.
Palola did not comment on whether the timetable was realistic.
Palola said that there is a dialogue with the government and that it has always been constructive.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
The organization requires the government to withdraw from mandatory legislation, which would be implementing some of the extortion.
According to Palola, the STTK is not keen on the preparation of an alternative package with the SDP, which raised the issue.
Employees will gather in Helsinki on Friday to protest the government's blackmail package for working life.
The package includes cutting first-day sick pay, halving overtime pay, reducing Sunday pay to 75% and shortening holidays.
The STC emphasises that the central organisations have invited employees to demonstrate and that the strike was not intended.
Fjäder of Akavan thanks you

We want immigration and working-time banks.
Akava said on Wednesday it had been preparing its own proposal for a long time, in which it was ready to negotiate the government's goal of 5% competitiveness as an alternative to cuts.
The Akva has always been open to negotiation and we have been writing alternative models for the government's proposals for a long time.
We're prepared to consider the terms of your employment as part of the contract.
In return, we want change protection and working time banks, says President Sture Fjäder.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of energy.
Without the SAK, the package is not strong enough.
We are now working together to produce a model that will be useful to the government and employers", says Fjäder.
The Aqaba Working Committee will meet on Thursday at 3 p.m. to decide on the possible content of the agreement.
"Same boat, coal, houses" playing bingo with the Sparrow talking tonight
Green Left at the University of Tampere
The green left of the University of Tampere, Viva bingo ticket for the evening.
Prime Ministers have previously made extraordinary speeches during the Mäntsälä rebellion and wars.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä will speak to the nation on the state of the Finnish economy on Yle channels on Wednesday evening at 21.05.
To find a similar speech by a previous prime minister, one must go back to 1932, when Pehr Evind Svinhufvud was prime minister and delivered the famous radio speech that marked the beginning of the end of the Mäntsälä rebellion.
After that, the president and ministers made several radio speeches during the Winter and postwar years.
In the 1990s, Esko Aho gave a New Year's speech instead of President Mauno Koivisto, but it was more of a ceremony.
In the autumn of 1976, President Urho Kekkonen ended the strike of the railway workers with a televised speech.
A private call, monarchist thoughts.
Sparrow's speech has been a source of criticism and speculation all day about what's to come.
The chairman of the Left Alliance, Paavo Arhinmäki, said on Twitter that "Sipilä could make his State of the Nation speech in parliament as a prime minister's announcement, which would also allow for discussion".
The Green Party's Ville Niinistö said: "The one-on-one has already been seen.
Leadership is about dialogue, about listening to people.
SDP's Erkki Hakim condemned on Facebook that "monarchist thinking: the prime minister tells the people what is best for them".
The European Parliament has also voted to approve the Commission's proposal to increase the number of EU citizens in the EU.
Not a single appearance by the Prime Minister in the media with the opposition.
I tried to.
What is @leaderspin afraid of?
Public service
According to the Cabinet Office, Sipilä's speech is pre-recorded and lasts about 15 minutes.
According to the SAK, the report was commented on live by the SAK's chairman, Lauri Lyly, and the EC's CEO, Jyri Häkämies.
The General Assembly has been criticized for the speech of Sipila.
We considered the matter and concluded that it was part of the public service's duty to promote publicity throughout Finland", says Ismo Silvo, Director of Publications at Yle.
♪ Like we were in the time of the Tammeloos ♪
The speech has also been ridiculed.
When evening comes, dinner is enjoyed in good time, children are combed and dressed in their best.
Mommy puts on a nicer headdress and Dad fits a tie around her neck.
At nine o'clock, the TV is silenced like in the old days of We the Tammeloids", writes blogger Saku Timonen.
"Does Prime Minister Sipilä also explain in his speech why the Finnish government is full of millionaires hiding their capital in tax havens, who draft amnesty laws for their fellow tax evaders and at the same time tell the people that they have to cut when the government runs out of money?" asks Pia Lohikoski.
One guess about what Sipilä says is that the green leftist Viva of Tampere University is doing it.
He's posted a Facebook post about the bingo game.
Tonight, we're gonna hear about the same boat, the same coal, living in debt and the same team spirit.
Coupons and pens ready, at 21:05 it starts and the channels are TV1, Radio Finlandia and Yle Arena.
Ahtisaari in the Guardian: Western countries reject Russian proposal to remove al-Assad
More than three years ago, the West rejected a Russian offer to force Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down, President Martti Ahtisaari told the Guardian.
According to the Ahtisaari, the Russian ambassador to the UN proposed a plan to remove Assad from power in style after a while.
The Western countries, however, did not accept the proposal because they believed that al-Assad would fall in a matter of weeks anyway.
In 2012, the Republic of Azerbaijan discussed the Syrian crisis with the five permanent members of the UN Security Council.
According to the report, the Russian ambassador, Vitali Tshurkin, outlined a three-point plan for the two-way conversation: the opposition must not be armed, the opposition and Assad must be able to talk immediately, and Assad's abdication must be carried out in a restrained manner.
I know Tshurkin.
We may not always agree on everything, but we can have an open discussion.
I told him what I was doing there and he said, "Sit down, Marty, and I'll tell you what we need to do", Ahtisaari recalls in an interview with the Guardian.
Diplomats are not commenting .
The archipelago says it has passed on Tshurkin's message to the United States, Britain and France, but nothing has happened.
Tshurkin did not confirm the content of the conversation, but Ahtisaari said it was not a two-word conversation.
UN diplomats also declined to comment on Ahtisaari's claims, but said that al-Assad's forces had already committed several massacres by that time and that key opposition groups rejected any agreements that would have allowed him to remain in power.
The European Union is also calling on the United States to take a more active role in the fight against terrorism.
Officially, Russia has been supporting al-Assad throughout the war.
The weakest point in Ahtisaari's claim is that Tshurkin spoke on behalf of Moscow.
If he had told me about the speech by Mr Tshurkin, I would have said that I wanted to hear the same from President Vladimir Putin so that I could take it seriously.
Jenkins said he would have suspected that Putin's trick was to keep power in the hands of some al-Assad supporter.
The flood of refugees is our own doing.
The European Union is also calling for a comprehensive reform of the internal market.
The UN estimates that the death toll exceeded 220,000 at the beginning of this year.
More than 11 million people have been forced to flee their homes because of war.
We should have prevented this disaster.
The flow of refugees into Europe is our own doing.
I see no choice but to take good care of these poor people.
"We are now paying a bill that we ourselves have caused", Ahtisaari tells the newspaper.
Asylum seekers' centre on the move to Tornio
The Asylum Seeker's Centre planned by the Government for Northern Finland is likely to be established in Tornio.
The centre would be set up in the centre of the city in an empty building in the Tornio community centre.
The Ministry of the Interior has been looking for a suitable location to better control the flow of refugees across the Swedish border.
Helsinki's Sanomat reported on Tuesday that the city council had already decided to submit a school building as a replacement for the ministry.
According to Sauli Hyöppinen (left), vice-chairman of the Tornio city council, this is not true.
"We have to make sure that the people who are in charge of the project are aware of the importance of the project and that they are aware of the importance of the project", he said.
The debate was attended by 36 of the 43 delegates.
The 13 delegates from the Planning Centre opposed the proposal.
On that basis, one might expect the decision to be positive, says Hyöppinen.
According to Mayor Timo Nousiainen, the city was notified on Monday and the matter was quickly resolved.
The EU could accommodate around 500 asylum seekers at a time.
An expert has been to check that it could be used for this purpose.
The location is a few hundred meters from the border, so it would work in that sense too, says Nousiainen.
The European Union is still hoping for an alternative to blackmail
According to Prime Minister Juha Sipilän (center), halving the public holiday pay would only cover part of the government's aim to lower the price of work.
He also said that the government would welcome an alternative package if the social partners could agree on it.
The Commission has also been asked to submit a proposal for a directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to ionising radiation.
He also did not know how seriously the organizations were looking for alternatives to the government-reported blackmail of working people.
If such an agreement is reached, we will certainly welcome it as part of the overall package.
In Sipilä's view, halving holiday allowances would be a viable option, since it would affect almost all employees, unlike, for example, the government's planned cut in Sunday lunches.
The labour market organisations could agree on a reduction in holiday pay because it is written into collective agreements rather than law.
The government will present these prospects to parliament next Wednesday in a Cabinet statement on the workplace blackmail.
The Sparrow says the proposals of the organizations should be known before this.
This is not the final backstop either.
The legislative work then starts, the train is in motion and it gets harder and harder.
It's a good time.
It doesn't take long for things like this to happen if you have the will.
The list published by the government last week includes the conversion of the weekend and the Thursday into unpaid holidays without reducing annual working time.
In addition, first-day sick pay will be cut, overtime pay will be halved, Sunday pay will be cut to 75 percent and holidays will be shortened.
The reforms are being implemented as mandatory legislation bypassing trade unions, which has attracted strong criticism.
The workers' organizations are organizing a protest on Friday in response to the measures, and several unions have declared political strikes.
The Tohma lake council approved the expansion of the hops warehouse
The council of Tohmajärvi approved the expansion of the Nordic Koivu Oy's warehouse, or hops hall, which was unanimously but slightly grumpy.
The criticism was that the project was larger and more expensive than originally discussed.
I'm also a little busy.
It was a little surprising that the need for space was not known a year ago when the decision was taken on the previous extension.
At this stage, the expansion of the warehouse by 400-450 square metres was approved in the investment programme, but the amount will be decided later in the interim report.
The agenda still mentioned an investment of EUR 150 000-200 000 but at the meeting the technical director Erkki Ikonen said that the estimated cost would be EUR 300 000.
The investment was supported on the basis that it would bring jobs and tax revenue to the local community.
The municipality is not at risk, as the company pays the investment as rent, Vesa Väistö (PS.) argued.
The Karelian language has a place in the River Danube
The city government softened its previously tough stance to bring street signs in the Karyansk language into downtown Joensuu.
The new decision is important and right in terms of preserving the cattle tradition throughout the province.
The river river is not declared the capital of the Kareli language because it has no historical basis and the Kareli language is not an inherent part of the identity of the region.
The language spoken in the Rijksregion has been more of an Eastern Savoy dialect.
Even after the new decision, there will be no street signs in the city center in the Krei-Futan language.
However, the city of Joensuu is also prepared to use the Karelian language, for example, in information boards and tourism marketing.
The same approach is recommended by the city to all other operators.
Although Joensuu is officially a monolingual municipality, it is also worth taking a more open-minded approach to the use of the Karelian language now that multiculturalism is alive and changing strongly in North Karelia.
The language of Karelia is still a feature of the province, as is the image of Joensuus as the forest capital of all Finland.
Both can be put to good use in the province's various marketing activities.
The closure of the railway lines is cutting the province's vitality.
The cuts to the railroad are a major blow to the province's vitality.
The transport links have a direct impact on the economy and competitiveness of the province.
And that will affect whether it is even possible to live and work here, wonders Joensuu Mayor Kari Karjalainen.
He also mentions air transport, which has also been the subject of several reports.
It is important for the whole province that our ability to cope is not diminished by government measures, as is happening now.
The Commission is also proposing to increase the number of EU-funded projects in the field of energy.
The deterioration of transport links poses an additional challenge to the University of Eastern Finland in terms of attractiveness.
Of course, the better the services here, such as transport links and housing, the easier it is to get students and workers, says Jukka Mönkkönen, rector of the University of Eastern Finland.
He points out that poor transport links also affect the research staff, who are highly mobile and travel extensively for research.
The recruitment manager, Marko Junkkarinen, says that it is already difficult to market the university in western Finland because of poor transit links in the transverse direction.
Currently, about half of the students at the University of Eastern Finland come from outside Eastern Finland.
Some 10-20% of them are from the New World, partly because of the direct train connection.
From the river , I 've become one of the voice of the Sioux War .
The view of the Rijksmuseum about the Siun Sotte project is apparently unanimous, but there is one voice among the voices.
City councillor Pentti Keskisalo (Sd., pictured) proposed abandoning the entire project at a council meeting on Monday, but his proposal was rejected as unprofitable.
The Council approved the proposal for a decision by Mayor Kari Karjalainen, which will be reviewed in early October before the meeting of the City Council, which will give its final opinion on the project at the same time as all other municipalities.
One train from the Eagle to Kouvola will be out next year .
Passenger trains will continue to run from the city of Orkney to Kouvola, although at a reduced number of stops.
Passenger train services between the Eagle and Kouvola will be changed in March.
One train pair is left out, but still five times a day from the Eagle to Kouvola and vice versa.
The contractions are due to government austerity measures.
The Ministry of Transport and Communications' purchase allocation for rail transport for the next four years will be reduced by EUR 12,3 million.
The quietest routes will be completely cut off.
The VC will draw up new timetables by the end of the year.
They shall enter into force on 27 March 2016.
The boys climbed up on the roof, one couldn't get down, the guys slipped out.
The rescue team let a 12-year-old climb onto the roof from a spire, but he couldn't get off on his own.
The incident occurred on Tornion Mountain Ketot Road at approximately 6:30 on Tuesday night.
There is an old two-story wooden house with no ladder to the roof.
That did not stop a group of boys from climbing up the roof of the house over the amateur radio mast next to it.
The other boys got down the same route, but one didn't.
As a result, the others slipped away, and passersby alerted the rescue team to help lift the last one on the roof safely back to the surface.
FedEx operating profit doubled, lowering its 2016 fiscal year outlook
FedEx reported disappointing results for its latest quarter and the delivery giant cut its full-year earnings forecast, driven by weaker demand for freight services and higher costs for its ground services.
The company also said that it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
This time last year, FedEx announced it was hiring 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
Its shares fell about 2.5% in the opening auction 45 minutes before the opening clock on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. says it expects a fiscal year ending next May to be between $10.40 and $10.90, down 20 cents from its previous forecast.
Analysts were expecting $10.84, according to a FactSet survey.
The lower outlook came despite price increases of 4.9% on average, which will take effect on 4 January, and despite higher additional charges for heavy or large parcels inland transport since November.
The company said it expects operating profit to continue to grow from the previous year as they have cut costs, turnover has increased and e-commerce is growing.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company was performing steadily in the face of weaker than expected economic conditions, particularly in production and global trade.
The holiday pay plans were announced a day after competitor UPS said it planned to hire 90-95,000 extra workers, about the same as it hired last year.
For the quarter ended August 31, FedEx's revenue was $692 million, up 6 percent from a year ago.
Earnings per share came in at $2.42 down from the $2.44 average forecast, according to a survey of 12 analysts conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Revenue increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
In Zacks's survey, six analysts were expecting $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a decline in international priority transportation, which has halted the development of its Express business.
However, the rise in online sales has improved FedEx Ground's results.
In the last quarter, the turnover of the land unit increased by 29%, but the revenues from the operations remained essentially the same due to the high costs of larger packages and private insurance.
The Express unit's income was better due to higher basic charges, while the operating profit in the freight business was reduced by higher labour costs.
In the opening auction, about an hour before the opening clock, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
FedEx closed Tuesday with an 11 percent decline for the year and 17 percent below its record high of June 11.
The central bankers will sit around a giant mahogany table for two days this week at a long-awaited meeting to decide whether it's time to raise interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade.
At the other end of the central bank's ornate two-story conference room is a mural of the United States.
The map is a reminder that the president of the central bank, Janet L. Yellen, and her colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all else.
Congress has placed a twofold responsibility on the central bank to maximize U.S. employment and keep prices stable.
But since the Great Depression, central bankers have accepted that there is a third unwritten mandate: financial stability.
This third requirement may be the decisive factor in a decision to be published on Thursday, which is so strict that it cannot even be predicted, to decide whether the US economy is ready to unwind from the record stimulus provided by short-term interest rates, which have remained near zero since the end of 2008.
While most reports indicate that the economy is growing steadily, the recent upheaval in global financial markets may have made central bank officials who were already wary of further instability even more fearful of the impact of raising the federal funds rate by even a quarter of a percentage point.
Understandably, labour markets and inflation are the first and most important factors to be monitored, says Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
However, I believe that if they are looking for a justification for keeping interest rates the increased uncertainty in world markets is a good enough reason to wait further, he says.
The decision of the central bank has not been agreed, which is already causing economic nervousness.
According to a recent Bloomberg survey, about half of economists predict that interest rates will rise this week.
The financial markets expect the central bank to delay the increase, as the key indicator shows a growth potential of only around 30%.
This indicates a decline in the stock market if the central bank raises the level, unless decision-makers then manage to soften the blow by promising that the next increase will not happen anytime soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4 percent, to a new high of 16,599.85.
The recovery was driven by expectations that the central bank will maintain the level this week, says John Lonski, a senior economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
It is surprising if the central bank raises rates right now, he says.
If policy-makers raise rates, they will have to work hard to support their policies in order to keep financial markets from panicking.
Other experts claim that an increased level would calm financial markets by removing uncertainty about when the central bank will act.
Just a month ago, it looked as if the central bank would raise interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point this month, taking the first small step towards a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would confirm the stability of the US recovery.
The Commission has already made a number of recommendations on the use of the euro.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth has been stable this year.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in seven years and close to what the central bank considers the threshold for full employment.
The increase in wages has shown signs of improvement.
Although inflation remains below the central bank's annual 2% target, central bank officials say the main reason for this is the temporary impact of the substantial drop in oil prices.
The economy is getting on with higher interest rates and needs them in light of the difficult labour market situation, says Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world were rocked last week when China deregulated its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell as much as 16 percent from its May high as investors feared that the slowing Chinese economy would also slow global growth.
Markets have recovered somewhat this month, and the Dow is now nearly 10 percent below its May peak.
For central bankers, market turmoil is an additional factor in a complex equation that tells them when to raise interest rates.
Without these financial market events and the recent news of the weakness of the Chinese economy, decision-makers would be tightening the bar at this meeting, says Stephen D. Oliner, a senior fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former central bank official.
Now he predicts that policymakers will wait at least a month to get a better sense of the impact.
The potential impact on the US economy is still very unclear and they have little information on the consequences of events in China, says Oliner.
The welfare of the international economy is not a central bank's main concern and should therefore not, in principle, influence decision-making.
In practice, however, the Federal Reserve has become the world's monetary authority.
In recent years, the central bank's influence has been enormous.
In 2013, the suggestion by then-chairman Ben S. Bernanke that the central bank could "rapidly increase the supply of money" caused a revolution in markets around the world.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, central bank officials are expected not only to follow developments elsewhere but also to consult other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the world economy.
Central bank decisionmaking is more art than science, says Zachary Karabell, head of global strategy at wealth management firm Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, remarked this month that the central bank has overreacted in the past to financial market movements that have seemed detached from the fundamentals of the economy.
The Federal Open Market Committee, which makes the decisions, has called for an interest rate increase, and Lacker, a voting member of the committee, cites the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis caused the central bank to cut its benchmark by 0.75 percentage points over three meetings despite its limited, identifiable impact on US economic growth, says Lacker.
A year later, the central bank reversed these cuts.
The central bank should only prioritize financial stability during a major crisis, such as the 2008 market crash, says Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The latest riot is nowhere near that level, Posen says.
Nobody wants to be in a situation where the fear of raising interest rates is caused by market turmoil, says Posen, chairman of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains a double requirement and makes no mention of financial stability.
You miss the great Thai shop?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yeah, in Chinatown.
This store/warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C, often referred to as Thai-Costco, is a Thai wholesale business that also sells to private individuals.
Yeah, it's in Chinatown, not Thai Town.
The store/warehouse is a one-stop shop offering a dizzying range of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchenware, furniture, and religious and festive decorations.
The store even has a car department if you need motor oil.
It's a huge store, and it takes over an hour to walk through all the hallways.
If the store makes you hungry, you can eat at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The food court (good, cheap) inside the store is near the checkout counter and offers several options for pick-up.
What's in the store, do you need anything, anything, Thai?
LAX-C probably sells it.
The products are reasonably priced and a large proportion of the products are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruits and other products.
The meat dish is large, as is the fish dish, and the staff behind the counter will clean and filet the fish and, if you wish, roast it for you.
Much of the store is devoted to a huge freezer where you can find frozen curry leaves, cucumber and galangal, whole ducks, fish, beef and veal, pork rind, fish noodles, local sausages, snacks, and more.
Who goes to the store: Restaurant owners and chefs, but also individual families and individuals.
The corridors are wide enough for both shopping carts and trucks.
Fresh monthong duriot next to the register.
Location: The store is in a Los Angeles factory complex near Chinatown and downtown, just blocks from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking area, which it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although the store may be busy, parking is usually easy to find.
Brazil's pediatric health organization in Rio Grande promotes a healthy diet for breastfeeding
The Brazilian Society of Pediatrics (SPRS) has devised a shocking way to try to make women understand the importance of good nutrition during breast-feeding by publishing pictures of babies suckling on breasts painted with images of unhealthy food.
Breast milk is made up of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to develop a strong immune system.
Pregnant women and new mothers need extra energy, so they are advised to add about 500 calories to their daily calories.
However, a new study suggests that increasing calorie intake is not the only dietary change mothers should make.
A recent study led by Professor Robert Waterland of Baylor College of Medicine in Texas revealed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genetic expression of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet was found to have a negative effect on the child's immune system.
Channel Seven's Sunrise is a favorite with viewers despite Nine's attempts to cover the executive's reveal on the Today Show.
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson's rush to Canberra to cover the aftermath of the Liberal Party leadership exposé failed to boost Today's ratings.
The Channel Nine morning show was broadcast from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbull ousted Tony Abbott.
The rival Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was stuck in London as part of a week-long international broadcast series that also covered Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
The long-distance burden did not seem to bother Australian television viewers, as Sunrise averaged 397,000 viewers in five state capitals, compared with Today's 339,000.
The average was slightly higher than on Monday (317 000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but still lower than last Thursday (343 000).
Today has been catching up with Sunrise for the past few months.
In August, Today's average was 318,000 and Sunrisen's was 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000 viewers.
So far, during September, Sunrise averages 349,000 viewers, while Today has 314,000.
This is the most interesting event of the morning.
The winds of change are blowing this morning outside Parliament!
Karl and Lisa are fine, thank you for asking!
Published by TODAY on Monday, September 14, 2015
The big news for Channel Seven was the 800 Words series featuring former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson, an amazing debut.
The new drama series, which garnered a very impressive average of 1.219 million viewers, tells the story of a recently widowed father who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children.
Critics have questioned whether Thomson is a force to be reckoned with in the popular series on her own without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
Last night's results gave this one real certainty.
The X Factor was a strong favourite with 1.136 million viewers, easily beating The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Channel Seven had a double fate on the second night of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour of the new programme, presented by Andrew OKeefe, averaged 446 000 viewers (17-17:30).
The second half hour, 5:30 to 6:00, was watched by 623,000 people, which was small enough to beat Eddie McGuire's Hot Seat show by 613,000.
On Monday night, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia averaged 520,000 viewers, and the second half-hour averaged a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat's average was 620,000.
The Chase Australia's second-night ratings drop gives Channel Nine confidence that Hot Seat will eventually become the top-rated show at 5:30.
The Chase Australia replaced Million Dollar Minute, which failed to reduce viewership of McGuire's show.

The final three dads all agree that Sam Wood is the perfect guy, but who will he pick?
The secret is out?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have accidentally revealed the winner of The Bachelor.
The identity of the woman who Sam Wood ends up meeting on The Bachelor is kept top secret.
The three girls who stayed behind are definitely not gonna miss who got the last rose.
However, in our conversation with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, they may have inadvertently given us a clue as to the winner's identity.
Sam Wood 's lips are sealed before Thursday 's final .
All three women threw themselves into poetry as they described Wood as the perfect man, citing his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positivity as reasons why they would want to be his partner.
However, when asked, "If Wood's last rose isn't for you, who should it go to?" their answers may have offered a revelation as to who won the bachelor's heart.
Both the Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski were quick to point to Mackay as the best option for Wood after themselves.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have been perfectly united since day one.
"From the moment I walked into the house, [Sarah's] energy and Sam's energy felt quite compatible, and that thought was on my mind throughout the series", Jeavons-Fellows said.
Sarah is very down to earth, she's a lot of fun to be around, Markoski added.
I've seen them together, and they have chemistry.
They seem to be having a nice, relaxed time together.
Sarah Mackay thinks she and Sam Wood would be a good match.
Mackay said that last week's home visiting meetings made him realize that Wood might be the one.
When I saw him with my friends and family, I realised that this was clearly not just a game - I am now fully involved in this, she said.
When asked who Wood should choose if not him, Mackay was puzzled.
"I don't know if I can say it", he said.
I like the other girls just as much, so it's a tie between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor airs Wednesdays at 7:30 on Ten.

Jarryd Hayne has a lot of options for where to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle were both very interested in him after he moved to the States, and many other teams have asked about him since his impressive open practice day late last year.
However, Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to have been a wise decision.
Some coaches would have left Hayne on the bench for the remainder of the game after the Australian rugby league switch-hitter dropped the ball on his first pass return in a 20-3 win over Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula trusted her husband and let Hayne return the next fly ball and took him to the running game after Reggie Bush was injured.
Tomsula's true nature was also revealed in the dressing room after the game.
Rather than berating the newcomers in front of the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly supported Hayne at the post-game press conference.
49ers special teams reporter Cam Inman reports that Hayne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget about the ball dropped and worry about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne drops a pass that the Minnesota Vikings catch in the first quarter.
This was certainly not the start Hayne and his numerous Australian fans had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne was seen swearing on his way off the field after the fall, and later told Australian radio duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM on 104.1 that he could not have imagined a worse start to his NFL career.
"It was just one of those things, you just have to think about the next game and that's it", Hayne said.
Hayne compared his tackling to his 2007 Origin debut when a serve from his own goal area led to a Queensland goal.
All in all, it was still a great experience for this 27-year-old.
After the game, Hayne posed on her Instagram account to post a photo with fans holding the Australian flag.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, Russia's richest man, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was arrested at gunpoint on a Siberian airstrip.
Khodorkovsky had openly questioned President Vladimir Putin, so he was convicted, his oil company Yukos was seized and his efforts to support democracy were curtailed.
Four dead after police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the country's new constitution, officials said on Wednesday.
Violence broke out on Tuesday night in the Rupandeh area about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, a senior official in the area, said that more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside the police station, some throwing stones and firebombs.
Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, known to kill but traditionally used as a less dangerous alternative, appeared to cause so many deaths.
The summit was the latest in a series of violent protests in recent weeks across southern Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say the new provinces created under the proposed new constitution are weakening their political influence.
There have also been protests in western Nepal as the Tharus group demands a separate state.
Since 10 August, at least 40 people have been killed in violent clashes, 11 of them police officers.
At that time, the four main parties signed an agreement dividing the country into provinces - a major step towards a new constitution, but a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which has had a central government for centuries.
A new constitution has been in the works since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after a devastating earthquake in April killed thousands.
Lawmakers have voted on the provisions of the draft constitution in Kathmandu this week, and authorities have said that a new constitution could be approved by Sunday.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center says there's a 60 percent chance of a hurricane in southern Cape Verde
A broad low-pressure front about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost tip of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
Another extreme low-pressure front, located midway between the Cape Verde Islands and the Lesser Antilles, also has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone over the next two days, the Miami-based weather service added.
Google is launching a fundraising campaign to raise $11 million for refugees.
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has launched a fundraising campaign to raise $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees fleeing war and poverty in Europe.
Google had an exceptionally personal approach when it launched the fundraising campaign on its blog.
Instead of being reported by the CEO, Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family at the age of seven, wrote about her own personal experience.
"Our journey included many dark train and bus journeys, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and darkness", he wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and immigration crisis in Europe has escalated, people like my family are desperate to help.
The donations go to four nonprofit organizations that help refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would match the same amount for every donation made globally on google.com/refugeerelief up to $5.5 million, bringing the total goal to $11 million.
Europe is experiencing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War, mainly due to the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many also flee the ravages of war in Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, and Libya.

Weight loss surgery may help mildly obese diabetics
A new study suggests that the benefits of weight-loss surgery for mildly obese people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years.
However, it is still too early to tell whether these mildly obese diabetics live longer after weight-loss surgery than those treated by other means.
"It takes a long time to get the death toll", says Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight-loss surgeon who wrote an editorial for a new study in JAMA Surgery.
Bariatric surgery uses a variety of techniques to reduce the size of the abdominal wall.
They reduce hunger and limit food absorption.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the subjects in the study were obese and had a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
A BMI of between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal.
If a BMI is over 25, it indicates that a person is overweight, and if a person's BMI is over 30, he or she is considered overweight.
You can calculate your own BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For this new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery, gastric bypass surgery and gastric reduction, with the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people who were mildly obese.
The study showed that the average BMI of the surgical subjects dropped from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year.
At the same time, the BMI of those treated by non-surgical means remained largely the same at 29.
Of those who had surgery, 36 percent had a complete and 28 percent a partial recovery.
By comparison, in the medically treated group, diabetes improved completely by only 1 percent and partially by about 2 percent.
In addition, blood pressure, triglycerides and LDL cholesterol were generally better in the surgery group, the authors noted.
The researchers also monitored the patients' blood haemoglobin A1c levels, which reflect long-term blood sugar levels.
Hemoglobin A1c should be kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
The post-operative haemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
However, in the drug-treated group, it remained stable at about 8%.
However, this improved glycemic control, as demonstrated by improved hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce mortality over five years, say lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The study team also compared the average results between the two types of surgery.
At year five, compared with the gastric bypass group, the gastric bypass group had lost more weight (18.7 and 14.2 kg), had a greater decrease in body mass index (7.4 and 5.1), a greater decrease in haemoglobin A1c (3.1 and 2.1%) and was more likely to achieve complete diabetes remission (46.9 and 16.7%).
Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine-Phoenix says that while the study shows no survival or surgical success after five years, there are studies from Sweden where surgery led to longer lives for overweight people.
A Swedish study found that overweight people who had weight-loss surgery were 29 percent less likely to die over a 15-year period than those who had tried more traditional treatments.
Although the new study does not show improvement in survival for surgical patients, Blackstone says that the results are encouraging for those with a BMI of less than 35 who are interested in surgery.
The results are crucial precisely because they show that the surgery is safe for the lower-weight group and does not involve an increased risk of death or kidney disease, he says.
Blackstone adds that both patients and their doctors should take weight very seriously when a patient's BMI is between 27 and 30.
I think we've been waiting too long to take this seriously, he says.
I think that when a person has accumulated these genetic changes that permanently prepare their body for obesity and diabetes, it's very difficult to reverse the situation.
Not everyone can come to Europe - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama has said that Europe cannot take in all refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The head of Tibetan Buddhism has called for an end to violence in the refugee homelands.
The Dalai Lama addressed the ongoing refugee crisis in a speech at the opening of the Oxford-based Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion, a centre dedicated to ethics research, at the start of his ten-day visit to Britain.
The Dalai Lama argued that in the present situation the needs of all mankind should be put before the needs of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis was admirable, it was also inadequate.
'Not everyone can come to Europe,' he said in his speech.
The Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to resolve the crisis, but stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
It is wonderful to take care of several thousand refugees, but in the meantime we must think about long-term solutions: how to bring about real peace and real development in these Muslim countries, mainly through education.
The last thing we need to think about is how we can reduce the killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the force.
He added that the use of force has never solved these problems.
In taking a stand on the issue of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, claiming that the US violent response caused a chain of violent events.
After 9/11, I wrote to President Bush to express my condolences and to tell him that the solution to this problem was nonviolence.
I know his motives were good, but he used force and it had unexpected consequences", the Dalai Lama said.
In the last four years, swallowing childhood hand sanitizer has quadrupled
Poison control centers across the United States have reported a nearly 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 swallowing a strongly alcoholic hand sanitizer since 2010, according to the Georgia Poison Control Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Information Center, the number of cases of children under 12 years of age reported to the Poison Information Center for ingestion of disinfectants increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
Children are becoming more interested in these products and unfortunately a certain percentage of them end up in the emergency pool, Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink disinfectant on purpose, while others do so to impress their friends or to answer a challenge on social media.
There are videos on YouTube of teenagers drinking disinfectant to get a cheap erection.
Reports indicate that teenagers have mixed disinfectant with alcoholic mouthwash to produce a stronger drink.
The pleasant scents of the disinfectant may attract younger children.
"The child doesn't think this is bad for him", Lopez said.
Many of the more interesting (handcuffs) are ones with added scent.
There are strawberry, grape, and orange-scented disinfectants that children find very appealing.
Hand sanitizer can contain anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, alcohol poisoning requires only a few injections.
"It's really concentrated alcohol", said Stephen Thornton, medical director of the University of Kansas Hospital's toxicology center, to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
So you wouldn't leave a whiskey bottle lying around on the table, but the hand sanitizer is left in plain sight, and if the kids are interested, it's a quick way to drink a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell is a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed just four syringes of strawberry-scented hand sanitizer at school and was taken to the emergency room.
Her blood alcohol level was .179, more than twice the adult limit for drunk driving, says emergency room physician Chris Ritchey, who treated the girl at Gwinnet Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah was speechless and unable to walk when the ambulance arrived.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children's hospital for possible brain damage, as alcohol caused her to fall and hit her head, Ritchey said.
"It was really scary", Nhai's mother Ortoria Scott told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my baby.
Lopez has recommended that parents and teachers use nonalcoholic products or disinfectant towels and keep disinfectants out of the reach of children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting hand sanitizer containing a toxic, unreported ingredient.
The health authorities suspect that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, which was declared as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-graders in upstate New York planned to poison their "fierce" teacher by spraying a germ poison into the classroom, says a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to hand sanitizer and banned it from her class.
The police must dismiss the plan as "a fool's errand" and leave disciplinary action to the school district.
Rumor has it that Celtic has no conflicts .
Griffiths dismisses the Celtic controversy, and Deila admits Hoops is in a tight spot, but he can turn it around.
Hearts are fighting the Scottish Football Association over Neilson's charges and Warburton are wary of January recruitments that could disrupt the team's unity.
The Dons extend their lead over the Celtics by five points.
Adam Rooney's penalty kick in the first half gave Aberdeen a narrow victory over Hamilton at Pittodrie Stadium, giving the team a chance to increase their lead over Celtic by five points.
Griffiths is downplaying the contradictions .
There have been rumors of internal conflicts at Celtic, but Griffiths quickly brushed them aside, claiming that he and his teammates have no sense of working under closer scrutiny as the team prepares to face the Dutch champion.
I don't think we're under any pressure. I think the players are looking forward to the game.
The Dutch are tired of the Scots not having a champion.
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic because they have no competition for the championship with Rangers.
The current Ajax ambassador, de Boer, said: "The highlights of Celtic's games are no longer shown in the Netherlands and why?"
Because the Rangers aren't in it.
People around here can't stand to talk about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the Old Firm teams.
They're talking about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There is a lot of excitement in these teams' games and people outside Scotland also want to watch them.
Deila vows to turn the tide .
Ronny Deila has admitted that Celtic are in trouble, but the Norwegian boss has vowed to turn the tide.
The loss to Malmö and the resulting relegation from the Champions League was quickly followed by a 10-man defeat to Aberdeen, who are now five points clear at the top of the table.
But Deila said: "Celtic have had bad seasons before, and we will rise again".
Right now, we just want to get out of this situation as quickly as possible.
I know this is frustrating and that a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what's happening.
So are we, but we have to keep going.
We really need supporters because it improves player performance.
It's important we stick together now.
Warburton is on the alert for January player moves .
Despite Rangers boss Mark Warburton's comments just a few weeks ago about potential January transfer options, he's wary of the draft pick, assuring that he doesn't want to upset the consensus of the team.
The former Brentford boss said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window".
For players coming in the summer, there's a period of adjustment that goes all the way through, which is reflected in our squad this season.
The team is doing really well.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players can cause more trouble.
The Celtic interest in Michu suggests retirement
Swansea forward Michu, whose name has been linked with a move to Celtic, has hinted he may retire once his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been suffering from ankle problems for two years and has not been able to find a new partner outside Wales over the summer.
Hearts are ready to fight the Scottish Football Association over Neilson 's comments .
Hearts led 2-1 with Paterson out and the team then lost 3-2.[1] The defender's red card was later revoked, the third red card Collum had been awarded in the last eight months.
Neilson stands by his words, saying: I did not question the honesty, I did not comment on the performance.
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle .
A loyal Hibernian player was reprimanded after admitting to singing an offensive song about former Hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident took place in a pub in Roseburn, Edinburgh, before the Edinburgh derby at Tynecastle Stadium in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was a momentary moment of excitement", the striker said, adding: "It's probably safe to say I won't be returning to Tynecastle unless I then move to Celtic".
The Tannadice government has confidence in the leadership of Dundee United.
Simon Donnelly claims that the Dundee United board still has faith in the management's ability to turn the tide, but admits that the deterioration of the players must stop.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We're going to get the boys back on their feet, says Donnelly.
McInnes happy to win the Hamilton game
Derek McInnes admits that his team, Aberdeen, hung in desperately in the game against Hamilton Accies, but a penalty kick from Adam Rooney in the first half helped them to their seventh successive league title, putting them five points clear at the top of the table.
McInnes says: "There is not a team that has won anything, be it a cup or a league, that has not won games in this way".
Unemployment in Scotland will remain unchanged as the UK population grows
Unemployment in Scotland remained at 164 000 between May and July, while unemployment in the whole of the UK rose by 10 000 to 1.82 million.
The unemployment rate in Scotland is 5.9% higher than the UK's 5.5%, figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show.
At the same time, unemployment in Scotland fell by 12 000 over a three-month period and the number of people in work is now 2 612 000.
The employment rate in Scotland fell to 74% in the quarter, higher than the UK average of 73.5%.
The Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell, commented on these latest figures: "The long-term plan of the Government is to build the foundations for a stronger economy".
It has been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
During this 12 months, the labour market in Scotland has improved, employment has increased and unemployment has fallen.
Why I 'm witnessing an execution in Oklahoma .
Unless there is some sort of legal intervention, later today I will watch the man be executed.
If that happens, and I hope not, I'll be sitting in the audience at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary watching Richard Glossip be executed by lethal injection.
He's asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
I received the invitation in January through his best friend, and although I was shocked, I accepted.
I've been dreading this day as it approaches.
So why did I say yes?
I said yes because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It would provide a unique perspective.
Of course, reporters have the opportunity to cover executions in America, and because applications often outnumber vacancies, participants are selected by a gruesome draw.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for the media from 12 to 15.
Whoever gets elected, they're gonna be looking at this cool.
I can't do that.
I will be sitting next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, and I have also established my own connection with him through phone calls over the months and one two-and-a-half hour visit.
I like the man.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
Prison officials say I cannot be a witness and a reporter at the same time, so I must not have a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A reporter from Oklahoma tweeted that I've been compromising my neutrality.
Here's the lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it told, and you'll be a part of it.
I complained to the reporter.
The Court acknowledged that the honourable Member could have put his words better, but still feels that what I am doing is wrong.
Richard Glossip has disagreed with some of the things I've said and written.
He doesn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't do it if he did.
I've told him he can remove me from the witness list at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to cover the story.
If Glossip dies, he believes the publicity will help the anti-death penalty movement.
I have Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, standing next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, you can listen to the podcast I did on the show.
I'm not going through all the details again.
I can't say with any certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after Barry Van Treese's murder would make him guilty of aiding and abetting anyway.
But I think there's a very strong possibility that he didn't commit murder.
I'm sure there wasn't enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think it's wrong to execute him.
And so this is the perspective from which I see him die.
I can't claim to be completely neutral.
There'll be other reporters on the ground to take care of it.
I'll give you a description of what it's like to watch a man I care about die needlessly.
A man was lured out of the Canning River after a police water chase.
Officer Canning Valen stayed dry while he lured the man out of the Canning River.
A Perth man's attempt to distract the police from his trail went awry when he found himself in shallow, muddy water just metres away from a policeman who tried to "lure him gently back to the beach".
Canning Valley Police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday for trespassing.
When they spotted the suspect, he tried to distract them by pointing them to the Canning River.
But he didn't get very far.
"He was standing in the water saying, 'I'm not coming out, come get me,'" senior sergeant Shandell Castledine said.
Officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want his uniform to get wet, so he used a safer tactic:
Sometimes people do funny things when they try to escape, said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Football champion Ben Cousins is a striking example.
In 2006, Cousins abandoned his car to avoid a blowout and tried to swim across the Swan River.
He failed in his attempt, but he inspired the locals to start designing a playful Ben Cousins Biathlon.
Peter Moody claims that the media tried to spy on him and he's threatening to drop out of the race.
Peter Moody has claimed that Racing Victoria's newsroom tried to infiltrate his stables last year, and is threatening to stop racing immediately.
He blames the management and the integrity department of Racing Victoria for a personal campaign against him, saying that Wednesday's late rejection of Lady Tata for a medical procedure on race day was the final straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that his goal has always been to do what's best for the competition and that he's been in a difficult position since the unexplained positive cobalt test on Lidar.
He's kept his tongue in check against allegations of espionage for a year and a half, and he didn't want it to look like jealousy.
"I wasn't going to say anything about it, and I've been quiet about it for a long time, but sometimes it gets so frustrating that it all comes out at once", Moody said.
They knew the situation was continuing.
Sometimes you just have to react and live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I've said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm going to sleep well.
I want to walk with my head up, and I want the owners to think I'm doing the best I can for them.
When they start thinking differently, that's when I should stop coaching.
Then I'd have to consider what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody dropped a bombshell in an interview with racing.com, where he revealed that the integrity department had tried to spy on his barn.
A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - I'll name him when asked - and offered him a job in my stable if he would pass on information about what I was doing there.
They clearly think I'm a fraud.
If that's the case, then I think they should fire their lawyer, because they failed to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of Racing Victoria, David Moodie, current Chairman of Racing Victoria, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of Racing Victoria, were all aware of this at the time and are aware of it today.
Am I supposed to start thinking this is getting personal?
Has Victoria Racing finally decided to step up and perhaps shift responsibility for what happens in the industry to someone other than the coaches?
Am I a threat to the industry?
Am I that bad for the industry?
Maybe that's what people think.
Perhaps they will have to take away my license and push me aside, and I have no doubt that the things I am about to say will possibly make them think that.
But I'm at the point now where I don't care anymore, and it makes me sad.
It really makes me sad.
I'm pushing them to make a decision that's their responsibility.
I have my family's support, and I can turn my back on this.
The coach's frustration has grown with the long-running Lidar cobalt investigation, and the late rejection has led him to conclude that he could be "thrown off the table" as a licensed drug user.
Moody, best known for coaching the undefeated champion Black Caviar, has called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a mud or clay hood is placed on the horse's legs, which is against the rules.
It's against the rules of the competition.
I must take full responsibility for that", he said.
One of my employees accidentally put mud on his leg.
It could have had a grave last night.
It could have been yesterday, like it was.
He had it on race day.
Moody's could face a three-month ban on competition for the racing day graveyard treatment that the operators have initiated an investigation into.
It's a joke, you know?
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
'We all understand the need for rules, but this has gone too far,' Moody's said.
In Cobram , a driver convicted of a traffic violation has been arrested .
Police have arrested a man who was found guilty of a traffic offense after colliding with a cyclist over the weekend in Cobram.
The cyclist was airlifted to the Royal Melbourne Hospital after suffering serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police said the driver drove away and did not stop to help the injured cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia turned himself in to police in Shepparton.
He will be charged with failing to stop at the scene of an accident, failing to provide assistance and other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, is still in hospital and in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy attacks his rivals in a fight-or-flighty.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has criticized claims from two NRL Rugby League Championships that his team's tackles were part of the "lineup".
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the umpires allowed the Storm to push on their side when they surprisingly won the final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett barely managed to hide his reference to the Storm after they beat the North Queensland Cowboys in the final on Saturday night, calling the game a "window into rugby league" and saying that the two Queensland teams were not "very excited" about the win.
Bellamy defended his team's tackles, saying they only focus on "contact" when they're tackling.
Bellamy added that his confidence was boosted by the two head coaches' criticism of Storm, as it means they fear losing to the team.
"This is always a topic - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talk about the game when we lost to them 24-2", Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee you we haven't changed anything in our defensive systems or techniques all year, but for the past six weeks, we've been focusing on contact in tackles, and that's what's made us successful.
Trent's been on the team for three years, and he obviously has a great team to coach, so he's probably not used to losing, so this was a bit of a shock for him.
Funny how this always comes up this time of year.
Bellamy challenged Bennett's idea of an "exciting rugby world" by reminding his mentor that Bennett's St George Illawarra Dragons won the 2010 championship by playing "excitingly".
Wayne's talking about the excitement of rugby.
He thought it was important to compare his Saturday night game to our Friday night game and tell us how exciting their game was, Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 when St George were often criticised for being a boring team and Wayne said he couldn't care less.
But now he has a team that can play the kind of rugby we find exciting, especially when he has fast young guys.
That's the kind of game you want to play when you have that kind of player.
He brought that side up in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his style of rugby - not every team has guys like Anthony Milford or Ben Hunt so they can play that way.
I get more confident when they say things like that because they're a little bit worried about playing us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think of us as the opposite of the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm-Roosters game was more scattered than the Broncos-Cowboys game.
I'm sure the Broncos game was a good one, I haven't watched it yet, but how did it end?
We were 20-18 so we had two more goals, but is it exciting rugby?
Or does it make it exciting to break the defensive line and miss a goal?
For me, this is about the lines.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we can play them.
The Storm have the weekend off because they've already won the right to play either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks in the semi-finals next Saturday night at AAMI Park, with tickets going on sale next Tuesday morning.
$200,000 bail for a Serbian man on a drug charge .
A man facing life in prison for attempting to possess 40 kilos of cocaine smuggled into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, is one of five men arrested last month after federal police traced 100 kilos of drugs to a Solay boat that came to South America via Vanuatu and docked in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting with other defendants at the marina all morning, and then meeting them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe, where police found 40 kilos of drugs in a Toyota Echo.
Although Maksimovic faces a possible life sentence for attempting to possess a quantity of cocaine intended for business purposes, his lawyer argued that there was no evidence that Maksimovic was trying to possess the entire quantity and that he might have been in the cafe for entirely innocent reasons.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan was concerned that Maksimovic might try to escape.
He has close ties to Serbia.
He travels to Serbia often, he told the court on Wednesday.
In the criminal case, Maksimovic lied to the police about where he lived.
Maximovic's mother and stepfather had jointly offered $200,000 in bail to secure his release.
"After reading the affidavits of both persons, it is clear that the $200,000 bail is a real financial burden on them", said Judge Flanagan.
But that alone was not enough to prevent him from appearing in court, he warned.
Maksimovic was granted bail on the condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, report to the police daily, and abide by his 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took this phone while the girl was sleeping and then logged into a social networking site where Hogg received numerous indecent pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later, realized the phone was missing, and found it sleeping in Hogg's hand.
The girl searched her phone and found the disturbing messages, and she immediately told her mother.
On arrival, the police saw five images, searched the computers on the premises, and found a "worrying" web search for pornography of children.
Hogg then claimed to the police that he had done this "to lure pedophiles" onto the internet before "pretending to be a cop to scare them".
The Deputy Fiscal Eilidh Robertson told Dundee Sheriff Court: He said it was an addiction - that he was addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that he had done the searches on a computer but said that they were only done because he wanted to pretend to be a policeman so that he could scare pedophiles.
He was asked about conversations with the unknown person who sent him the photos, and about Hogg asking the person to send him additional photos.
Hogg said he only did this for the purpose of feeding.
He said he'd get sick in the head from drinking and he wanted to watch pictures of rapes and murders.
Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she yelled at her mother, trembled and cried.
The mother saw the indecent images on her phone and then confronted the accused.
The girl was interviewed, and she said that the accused had used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked younger than her.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to one count of making or taking indecent images of children on June 14 last year, violated his bail on January 25 of this year and failed to appear in court on March 24 of this year.
Defence counsel Gregor Sim requested that Hogg not be entered on the sex offender register, as it could be argued that his offence did not contain a 'significant sexual element'.
Sheriff Alistair Carmicheal has postponed the sentencing until October to give Social Services time to prepare background reports.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but in the other cases he's been held in pre-trial detention.
He was added to the sex offender registry before sentencing.
Zimbabwe 's Robert Mugabe made a false speech to parliament
Africa's oldest leader, Mugabe, fell down the steps leading to the speaker's chair earlier this year.
He was uninjured, but the video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of the Parliament was also marred by opposition lawmakers' claims that they had received anonymous death threats warning them not to boo Mugabe during his speech.
Last month, they booed and interrupted him with intermission shouts while he was giving a State of the Union address to Parliament, which he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the group disciplinary officer for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians had received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
The number from which the message was sent is not responding, but the message is titled death, Gonese told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
The message warned the Members concerned that their immunity would end in Parliament and that when they left, their immunity would not be in force.
The group's disciplinary watchdog said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai is "concerned" about threats against its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting up to 30,000 jobs .
Hewlett-Packard has prepared to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting efforts in the corporate services business.
Later this year, HP will split into two publicly traded companies, separating its computer and printer businesses from its faster-growing hardware and services businesses.
The expected job cuts will cost about $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said in a press release.
These restructuring measures will allow a more competitive and sustainable spending structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise, said Meg Whitman, HP's chairman and chief executive, who will lead the division after the split.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today, and we will have a broad and deep range of services to help companies transition to new business models, said Whitman.
As a standalone company, we are better able than ever to respond to the evolving needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprises will have annual sales of more than $50 billion and will focus on providing unparalleled integrated technology solutions for businesses, the company said in a statement.
The split will dissolve a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment in a Palo Alto garage known as the birthplace of Silicon Valley.
HP has been through a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional computers to mobile devices.
HP is the world's second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the United States, and its split is the latest in a trend based on the belief that tightly-bound companies do better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must support injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dinamo Zagreb's draw
Wenger has also stressed to Wilshere that it's only September and assuming his rehabilitation goes as planned, there's no reason why he shouldn't be back playing by Christmas.
Even in this best-case scenario, Wilshere will miss at least four of England's next four games and, given his background, it is uncertain whether he will play in the European Championships next summer.
The biggest pity about this latest problem is that Wilshere's season ended strongly after a single ankle injury, and he was recalling his old sharpness before the season started.
"An injury like this is not a career threat", Wenger said.
It's a bone that didn't heal properly.
It's not that strange.
It was just an accident.
It's not related to his ankles or any previous injuries he's had.
This may be true from a medical perspective, but as Wenger admitted, when a player tries to come back mid-table, there is always the risk of further injury.
There's also an uncomfortable pattern that's emerging.
Research by Premier Injuries Ltd. shows that Wilshere has sustained 23 different injuries since his debut six years ago.
And in the last five seasons, he's played in just 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games.
Looking at Arsenal as a whole since the 2007-08 season, for six of the eight seasons they have been one of the teams in the Football League with the most days lost due to injury.
Wenger admits to the possibility of a draw, but Arsenal believe their improvement from last season in their injury record will continue.
"Sometimes when you're recovering from an injury, you can be vulnerable to a period where you need to strengthen your body and get competitive", Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to get over it.
I hope his body stabilizes, I'm sure it will, and he gets to make a career that he deserves.
Wenger is preparing to re-engineer his squad as Arsenal kick off their Champions League game against Dinamo Zagreb on Wednesday night, followed by a game against Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not travelled to Croatia, which means Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to be in the starting lineup.
Wenger can also put Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud in place of Nacho Montreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give breathing space to the players who need it", Wenger said.
While Arsenal are the clear favourites to advance to the F-block, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is the most fearsome in Europe.
Dinamo have also not lost 41 games since they produced their own "Invincible" campaign last season.
The stadium was rocked Tuesday night by an earthquake measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the tenth in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal have learned from last season's Champions League defeat to Monaco and is still motivated by the distant dream of leading the team to its first European Cup victory.
"This motivation is enormous", Wenger said.
Arsenal have never achieved that.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I can be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: A comedy show that taught us some serious lessons about male friendship.
It is striking how similar descriptions are lacking in the series, especially when one considers that men's need to open up is more desperate than ever, and the suicide rates of young men are higher than in fifteen years.
In 2013, suicide was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in Britain, and it is three times more common in men than in women.
In an effort to address this problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) declared 2015 the Year of Men, a year to challenge a culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of meeting this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school and college students with symptoms of depression found that a person's chances of recovery doubled when a high enough percentage of his friends were "mentally healthy".
Similarly, those who were not depressed were half as likely to develop mental health problems if they had healthy friends in mind.
But for friendship to work, it has to be available.
In this age of social media communication, style overrides content, and the immediacy of a response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, happy and successful, even when in reality isolation rules.
This superficial success is driven by what psychologists call outer values: money, image, social status, all at the expense of inner values -- the inner desire for personal growth and friendship -- which have a deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a billionaire video game developer recently explained, money certainly does not bring greater happiness.
The great thing about Friends was that it turned this focus on its head.
None of the characters defined their work, but rather their personalities, which were clearly distinguished in their interaction as friends.
The numerous hugs from Joey and Chandler, the moments in comfortable chairs watching football, Ross missing Rachel - their humor came from the knowledge that yes, men can relate to all of this, even though they often hesitate to fully explore their feelings.
As a volunteer at the Samaritans explained to me: ...listening to people who are depressed and suicidal, I really understand how even a small interaction with a friend can make you feel better.
Often, men who contact us feel they cannot talk to their friends.
The old idea of getting ahead is strong, as is the feeling that if you open up about your problems, you will be seen as weak.
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term survival strategies.
It highlighted the little moments of friendship between men.
While my neutral, out-of-the-box position on the other end of the line helps people in moments of desperation, the long-term support comes from a close, personal network of family and friends.
And so if you're attending Comedy Central's FriendsFest this weekend, and all the filming locations have been redesigned in honor of the party, why don't you take your friends for coffee to Central Perk?
Or, what's even better, if you see someone lonely at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You never know how much your friendship can mean.
Friends is on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, join #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores and helps PSG to knock out Malmö .
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavan for the goals against Malmö.
Angel Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut, helping PSG to overtake Swedish side Malmö on Tuesday.
Below is the game report and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani were on the right line as Paris Saint-Germain opened their Champions League game with a comfortable 2-0 win over Malmö at Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored on his Champions League debut in less than four minutes to clear the way for the French champions, but the team missed several chances before finally adding to their lead with Cavan scoring in the 61st minute.
Paris, who are in the same A-League as Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk, needed a strong start against the Swedish champions, as the game was not only about a place in the second round but also about improving their quarter-final games in the last three rounds.
But even if PSG scored, it was not a classic game, as Zlatan Ibrahimovic of Laurent Blanc's team lost his place in front of goal and was later traded out of the field.
"It is not easy to win the Champions League at home or away, so a 2-0 win is a problem for the opponent and looks good in the statistics, and it is a good start, although there are things we have to correct this season", Blanc said.
This is a good omen.
We wanted to win and we won, although I regret that we didn't manage to score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned to the Parisians after an injury in one of three changes made after the team were held to a 2-2 draw at home to Bordeaux in Ligue 1 at the weekend, but he was left in the fourth minute in Di Maria's shadow.
When he moved from Manchester United last month, the Argentine midfielder was named the man to take PSG to a new level in Europe, and he proved why when he caught Marco Verratt's pass running behind Malmö's defensive line and then hit a beautiful final pass past Johan Wiland into the back of the net.
But if anyone expected PSG to make a big, easy profit, he was disappointed.
Malmö were a tough opponent, they beat Celtic in the final to get to this level, they have nine international players and five-man defence in their opening game and two players in the deep centre.
But the team offered little in the attack side except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic in the 34th minute, which went just short of Kevin Trapp's goal post.
However, PSG were sometimes in trouble due to missed innings and poor finishing, especially from Ibrahimovic, who failed in a total of five attempts in the first half alone and then was disappointed when Cavani put the ball in by Ibrahimovic's touch at the very beginning of the second half.
However, he was much more effective in his preliminary work for his teammates, and it was from Ibrahimovic's pass that Di Maria sent off a spin kick that tilted around Wilandi's goal post at the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after an hour of play by Uruguay's Cavan, who scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had flashed forward from Maxwell's cross left.
That ended Malmo's hopes of getting back in the game, and only Wilandi's brilliant shot back from David Luiz's straight kept the score low before Ezequiel Lavezz's substitute goal was abandoned at the very end of the game.
Malmö manager Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were one level above his team.
Since then, we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
It's not enough to fight.
I'll raise my hat to Paris.
They were great at this game.
Glencore is raising $ 2.5 billion from the sale of its stock.
Swiss mining giant Glencore, which has been hit by a slump in commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion on Wednesday by selling shares as part of its massive debt-cutting plan.
Glencore, listed on the London Stock Exchange, said in a statement that it had sold some £1.6 billion worth of new shares to reduce its debt.
The company, which lost 57% of its market value this year, is struggling with collapsed commodity prices as the slowdown in China weighs on demand and wreaks havoc across markets.
The re-labelling pushed Glencore's shares to the top of the London Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning.
Shares rose by 2.77 per cent to 131.60p in the FTSE 100 Index, which opened 0.69 per cent higher.
Glencore had disclosed a $2.5 billion stock market offering last week as part of a broader plan to cut its $30 billion debt load by about a third.
The company sold new share capital at 125 pence a share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on Tuesday's closing price.
The company sold 1.3 billion shares, representing a total value of 9.99% of the combined company.
The Commission also noted that the Chinese imports of the product concerned from the PRC were not dumped in the Union during the RIP.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping 's visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will pay a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement released on Tuesday.
Xi's first official visit to Washington will be on September 25 and is a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The President and First Lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, will host a dinner for X and her husband, Peng Liyuan, after the leaders have held bilateral talks.
The visit of President Xi will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the United States and China on a wide range of global, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, while providing an opportunity for President Obama and President X to engage in constructive discussions on issues of disagreement, the resolution added.
The visit, first announced in February, is also expected to take Xin away from Seattle on his way to Washington to meet with several US technology leaders before heading to New York City and the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss a number of contentious topics, including Washington's concerns over alleged Chinese cyber espionage and the country's increased unconditionality in the disputed waters of the South China Sea.
Matt Damon underestimates the differences in the film industry.
Matt Damon met with African-American filmmaker Effie Brown as they discussed differences, which Damon says are not needed behind the scenes.
On HBO's Sunday night episode of Project Greenlight, the veteran actor interrupted Brown when he stressed the need for different perspectives on the dark-skinned protagonist of the project's script.
"When we talk about diversity, it's what counts in casting a movie, not a show", Damon argued.
Shocked, Brown reacted with disbelief, commenting "Ooh! Wow. Okay", while the comments of the actor from The Martian were left hanging in the air.
Other producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers joined Damon and Brown to discuss the finalists for the series.
"I want to encourage people to think about how they treat Harmony's character, whoever the director is", Brown said at the beginning.
The only dark character is a whore being beaten by her white pimp.
The producer of The Dear White People demanded the film rights for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio; Damon responded rudely that their directing "could end up giving us something we don't want".
After the conversation was aired, social media exploded with condemnation of Damon's comments.
Twitter user MrPooni expressed his anger at the film's plot, writing: Matt Damon talking to the only black person in the room and explaining the difference to him is BOLD as it hurts.
The tweet has since garnered over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments come at a time when the media's racially precise portrayal of race is at the forefront of social debate.
After the killing of teenager Michael Brown by white police in 2014, The Black Lives Matter movement spread nationwide, calling on lawmakers and authorities to end discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, Prince made a reference to the movement when he introduced the Grammy Award nominees for Album of the Year.
"The albums still matter", he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still matter.
Black Lives Matter leaders recently released a statement in response to a question from Fox News television personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group should be considered a hate group.
"The Black Lives Matter Network is a charity", the leaders said.
Recently, it was reported that Damon is among the entertainers, producers and media moguls invited to the Pope's home to discuss the Catholic Church's image in the West.
It's not clear if he accepted the invitation or if he's already met with the Pope.
The first American Ninja Warrior champion crowned
Professional basketball player and disc jockey Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior competition on Monday, earning a million-dollar grand prize.
The programme, which has just completed its seventh season, has never had a competitor survive all the stages of the programme.
In the final episode of the series, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, made it to the final round.
The last task required climbing a 50-foot-long rope in 30 seconds.
Britten climbed first and completed the challenge in time, becoming the first athlete ever to complete the grueling 4th installment of American Ninja Warrior.
Caldiero was interviewed by E!News after his hard-won victory and still in shock about winning the million-dollar grand prize.
So it's great to think about this, when I've never earned or lived on more than $10,000 a year, Isaac told E! after his big raise.
So all of a sudden... I mean, I can't even imagine what this is going to be like... the future is unknown.
Production manager Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the finale and why Britten is not getting more prize money, even though he is the first contestant in history to have made it across the finish line.
The rules say the fastest person gets the money.
"If more people pass, the money goes to the one with the fastest time", Weed said.
Although money is a great prize and a life-changing experience, it brings him great satisfaction.
I don't think he's gonna hold a grudge against me for that.
He's just so happy that he got to do what he did.
His fans have been praising him.
He's a great guy and a good family man.
He's a hero to his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, "If someone had to beat me, I'm glad it was Isaac".
And I think Isaac would have felt the same way if this had gone the other way.
American Ninja Warrior returns for an eighth season, which will begin filming in spring 2016.
The Detroit Tigers have sneaked past the Minnesota Twins .
The second half of the season hasn't been very fun for the Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers used to be one of the top teams in baseball, but now they're last in the American League Central.
The Tigers played their role of the spoiler perfectly on Tuesday when they beat the Minnesota Twins 5-4 at Target Field.
The Twins lost their chance to advance the Houston Astros by half a game in a race for the second wild card spot in the American League.
For Detroit, the game was a return, at least for one night, to the six-letter "H" that had been very hard to come by for most of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they're won", said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon continued his early offensive drive as Detroit scored three runs in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and once more in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and gave up three runs.
This was only his third quality start in his last nine games.
"I just want a strong end to this year", Simon said.
It's hard for a quarterback to pitch every game, so I want to go deep.
Tigers' backup Victor Martinez hit three home runs and drove in two runs, his first runs batted in since mid-August.
This was Martinez's first three-hit night since hitting a home run against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He waved the bat well", Ausmus said.
He looked good (in practice), looked considerably better in practice and continued the same pattern in the game.
The Twins were three runs behind in the second half of the seventh inning, and that was their best chance to get back in the game.
Center Byron Buxton opened the inning with two outs on the left field line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks hit a home run with a single, and Simon was able to burn right-handed second baseman Brian Dozier before Simon was traded to left-hander Blaine Hardy.
Hardy walked Mauer, the only player he faced, ahead of starting second baseman Miguel Sano, who was rushing for two bases on the left from right-hander Drew VerHagen.
With two running backs on the field and a tiebreaker on second base, VerHagen got a home run off third baseman Trevor Plouff to tie the game at two.
It was a major league record, the 27th time this season Plouffe hit a double.
After Detroit had secured a run in the ninth inning, Mauer hit a two-run homer against Tigers quarterback Bruce Rondon, making it 5-4.
However, the right-hander burned Sano in three innings on his fifth save.
Detroit was using the rusty Phil Hughes to start with.
The Tigers have three runs in the first two innings against a veteran right-hander who was placed on injured reserve before the game after being out for over a month with a lower back infection.
"Obviously, I didn't want this to be the start", Hughes said, "but as the game progressed I felt more comfortable and I felt I could make some nice shots in the third set".
After Hughes caught the starting pitcher on first base, he allowed second baseman Ian Kinsler to advance by one.
A right-handed walk by J.D. Martinez in the two-run situation brought in Victor Martinez, who took a walk-off home run to center field and drove in the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez cut his 0-21 pipe with the runners in good running positions.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos continued to hit right and make a run for it, but the threatening situation ended when Victor Martinez was passed out trying to advance to third base.
The Tigers continued into the second period and got one hit, two-run homer by catcher James McCann and two hits, one-run homer by center Anthony Goss, to make it 3-0.
"It was a big hit", said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He didn't hit it very well, but it went right in the right spot.
Hughes started to count and pitched a scoreless third inning, after which he was replaced by right-handed pitcher A.J. Achter.
Hughes was credited with three runs on six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTE: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez was ruled out with a torn ACL in his right shoulder.
He's being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated on Sanchez's shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez has been on the injured list since mid-August with a shoulder injury, but he was scheduled to return Wednesday.
With Sanchez out, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will be coming off the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris is 1-1 in four starts for the Tigers since being traded to left-handed pitcher David Price on July 30.
Norris has been out since August 20th with a right-lateral abdominal muscle strain.
The Tigers and Twins are in a three-game series that ends Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) is up against right-handed pitcher Ervin Santana of Minnesota (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi urges wider opening of economy to the world
The economy must open more to the outside world to promote growth, President Xi Jinping told a group tasked with guiding reform on Tuesday.
China should commit to attracting foreign finance and expertise and develop transparency policies, he said, speaking at the 16th meeting of the Group of the Leadership on Deepening Reform.
Supporting openness while pushing forward reforms will give new momentum and vitality and create new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Management Board adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list restricting market access, relaxation of border controls, encouragement of state-owned enterprises to access private capital and revision of the resident registration system.
The opinion states that a negative list is to be drawn up listing sectors and undertakings in which investment is not allowed.
The system will be gradually tested and improved through pilot programmes.
The change is significant as it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a legal business environment and makes the market more transparent, the opinion says.
The government is also loosening its control over the power it distributes to businesses, thus ensuring that businesses decide for themselves how they conduct their business.
The opinion also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms for the development of regional growth.
The opening of government-controlled sectors to private investors will open up more sectors.
The government will not change its policy on foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded enterprises and provide them with better services, the statement said.
In addition, the application process for foreign permanent resident permits, green cards, will be facilitated by optimising requirements and simplifying the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the right to practise by lawyers and the support for professional judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Premier Li Keqiang, senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement issued after the meeting.
