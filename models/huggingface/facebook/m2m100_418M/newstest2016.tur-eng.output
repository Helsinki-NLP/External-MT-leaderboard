Professor Calls 911 To Confess That He Killed His Girlfriend
University Professor Shannon Lamb, who called 911, told the police that he shot his girlfriend with a gun and the police's voice that the houses should come just a bit vibrantly.
Lamb said the "love dog" was alive and probably sad, and the family's phones could be found on the woman's mobile phone.
The police found Amy Prentiss's immortal body at home and a handwritten note on a white notebook: "I'm very sorry, I wish I could get everything back, I loved Amy so much and she was the only woman to love me so far."
There was no evidence that Lamb, who gave two online lessons to the Delta State University in Mississippi, Cleveland, had already gone 300 miles to the school campus where the police’s beloved history professor Ethan Scmidt believed to have been shot and killed by Lamb in front of his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university officials heard a shot at 10:18.
The Lamb’s 911 call was made shortly after that.
At the end of the day, another death occurred: Lamb committed suicide as the police approached him.
One day after the school shooting caused students and professors to hide behind the closed doors, officials were still investigating what pushed Lamb to do so.
On both sides of the state, the investigative officers, as well as the students and staff who know him, drawn the details of a talented but probably problematic teacher's picture.
The students said they were looking forward to entering his class.
A police officer in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said Lamb had no criminal and judicial records.
Even Schmidt described Lamb as one of the "beautiful people" he shared his academic life in his book.
Both did lessons at the Department of Social Sciences and History, where 17 faculty members were listed, and many students took lessons from both.
However, there were also signs that there were mental problems.
Brandon Beavers, one of the students who spoke about Lamb with praise, said he was also an anxious and nervous person and he seemed to have "a problem."
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said that Lamb had been stressed at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Lamb previously said he had some health problems and had requested a medical permit from Delta State University.
This year, there were two lessons on the Internet.
Changes recently made in the university’s employment policies did not guarantee that, despite the doctorate degree that Lamb worked hard to earn, he would automatically be a staff member.
University Dean William LaForge said he didn’t know there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but it was clear that “Lamb had some things in his mind.”
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After the campus was empty, the police followed the Lamb's journey from Arkansas to Mississippi.
Washington County Justice Investigation Director Methel Johnson said his family had committed suicide with a 38-caliber gun in the back garden of a house about 1.5 km away from his home in the Mississippi, Greenville suburbs before his arrest.
Lamb's car was found working on the highway.
Although it is not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house, Johnson said he believed that Lamb knew the people living in this house.
Lamb grew up in this area.
Lamb started working at the 3,500 students of the town of about 12,000 inhabitants in 2009 and offered geography and educational courses.
He received his doctorate in the field of education in the spring.
One of Lamb's former friends described him as a smart, charismatic and fun person.
When Carla Hairston met through her fellow friends, she said she was 15, and Lamb was 20 years old.
Carla and his friends were in high school, and Lamb was a great friend of himself, trying to teach him to play guitar for several years.
He was the one who throwed his hearts quickly.
Hairston, who is now 40 years old and lives in Brandon’s Jackson suburbs, told Lamb, “All the girls wiped away when she came.”
Lamb and Prentiss had been together for a long time.
In the 911 call, Lamb said "I killed my wife," but there is no official record of their marriage.
There was a dog named Lightning living with them in a rubber house on the edge of a river in Gautier.
The police said the dog was in good condition.
Prentiss' former husband Shawn O'Steen said they were divorced 15 years ago but they were always friends with Prentiss and now they have a 19-year-old daughter.
O'Steen also said his daughter was completely destroyed.
He and his mother were great friends.
O'Steen says he has never met Lamb but he has heard his daughter Abigail’s Lamb interested in music and playing blues.
Lamb and Prentiss met three years ago when Lamb and Abigail came to the stage at a summer festival.
Then Lamb and Abigail stole together in general demonstrations.
O'Steen said his daughter's music was written and spoken by herself.
Prentiss was a nurse working in various online companies.
Mike Shaffer, who is barmeness and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a loose bar near Gautier, said Lamb and Prentiss were seen last night on September 5 after Lamb finished playing guitar and music to a small number of spectators.
There was no sign that there was a problem.
He said they were a happy couple.
Sometimes we cut off and throw a line on each other.
Both of them had a great joke.
Don Allan Mitchell, a professor of English at the same university, said that the murdered professor Schmidt managed the first-class seminar program and was an expert in American indigenous and colonial history.
She was married and had three young children.
He graduated from Emporia State University in Kansas and was also the chairman of a student solidarity group he founded himself.
On Tuesday night, approximately 900 people at the Delta State University campus in Cleveland took part in the candle-setting ceremony, including academics, university staff, students and visitors from the local community.
The commemoration ceremony in which the university coro spoke the songs "The Bright Morning Star" and "The Great Charity" was also attended by Schmidt's wife Liz and her brother Jeff Schmidt.
Classes continue on Wednesday.
LaForge said, “We are trying to bring our students back.”
The crisis ended.
It is time to remove the wounds.
Amy and Rogelio Solis from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus (Greenville, Mississippi) and Rebecca Santana (New Orleans) contributed to this news.
The news text was corrected in a way that would reflect that the police indicated that Lamb was calling 911 after the murder of Schmidt and that, although Lamb mentioned Prentiss as "wife" in the 911 call, there was no official evidence that the two were married.
Toys R Us plans to get fewer holiday season members
Toys R Us has announced that it will not hire more holiday season members this year than last year, but the toy and baby products manufacturer said the company will give more opportunities to existing employees and seasonal workers.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers across the country, this figure was 45,000 in the 2014 holiday season.
Most of the work will be half-time.
The company said the interviews with candidates will begin this month and the number of staff will increase from October to December.
Although the holiday season is over months, the holiday shopping season is approaching and companies are preparing to hire temporary employees to equip their stores and help them sell, send and distribute products.
Michael J. Fox made jokes about her relationship with Princess Diana
The film "Return to the Future" was a very important moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was very important for personal reasons.
In the film Back in Time, he said, “We were waiting for the members of the Royal Family who were sitting in the cinema and suddenly I realized that the seat next to me was empty and I realized that Princess Diana would sit next to me.
The film began and I realized that coming out with the Princess of Wales was a false stretch and a hand-trip distance for me.
A documentary on the film Back in Time, Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as interviews with the director Robert Zemeckis and the practitioner producer Steven Spielberg.
The Return to the Future was seen for the first time 30 years ago.
Spielberg said, “This is the most exciting time travel film I’ve ever filmed for me.”
Back in Time VOD and DVD formats will also be displayed in some outstanding movies.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
About Russia’s increasing military support to Syria, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said the Syrian issue, which lasted five years, will “not be solved by military intervention” and more weapons will only be more violence and suffering for millions of people.
The Secretary-General of the United Nations also invited all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to gather together in order to find a political solution to the problem and to conduct constructive talks.
In a press conference on Wednesday, Ban said that five permanent members of the UN General Assembly are planning to meet with U.S., China, Russia, Britain and France’s foreign ministers on Syria.
He said he was deeply regretted that the division between the council members and the people of Syria has "made the problem unresolved" by regional forces.
Ban has invited five permanent members to join in the Iranian nuclear deal as well as in the Syrian crisis.
8 Survey Numbers Showing Donald Trump Is Serious
Some attempted to label it as a firewall.
Others seemed as if they laughed.
And some support for internal explosion.
Although some Republicans tried to pull Donald Trump down in the surveys, it didn’t work yet.
The latest 11 national surveys showed him Donald Trump’s leadership in double numbers, and some of them are starting to seriously question the possibility of the real estate emperor to be a candidate.
Of course, it is too early for the election cycle.
None of these does not mean that Trump could win the Republican candidate race.
Experts say that the rise of Rick Perry during these periods in 2011 led to the rise for Herman Cain, both of which did not win the nomination process even in a single state.
There are a lot of reasons why the general election is going to be difficult.
But external groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC group and the Growth Club, the economic conservative group, realize Trump’s permanent power and begin to spend their dollars to overthrow it.
Here are some recent survey results that show the real estate emperor is not just coming or temporarily:
Trump's preference rates changed 180 degrees.
A survey conducted at Monmouth University just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June showed that two of the 10 Republicans had a positive opinion for the real estate emperor.
In mid-July this rate was 40 percent.
It was 52 percent at the beginning of August.
Now six of the 10 Republicans have a positive opinion about Donald Trump.
Three out of 10 have a negative opinion.
And these numbers look up in early stages.
Last week Iowa, a Quinnipiac survey showed that 60 percent of the Republicans there prefer Donald Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters may be pleased with Trump's candidacy.
In a CNN/ORC survey last week, 67 percent of Republicans said if Trump was a candidate, they would be “coached” or “satisfied”.
Only two of the 10 people said that if he was the candidate, they would be disappointed.
Only I create the same level of enthusiasm as Carson Trump (this rate for Trump is 40 percent while 43 percent said they’ll be “enthusiastic”).
The closest person to enthusiasm?
Only 21 percent for Marco Rubio.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say that if the institution's favourite Jeb Bush is a candidate, they will "not be satisfied" or "we're disappointed".
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s humor as a problem.
While Donald Trump is criticized for his outstanding language and humiliation, according to Monday ABC News/Washington Post survey, 52 percent of the Republicans who were questioned believed the real estate emperor had the right mood to become president.
The same figure applies in Iowa, where the country’s first party assembly will be held, where according to Quinnipac last week, 52 percent of the Republicans believe that he will be the leader.
44 percent still believe that he has no personality to serve effectively, and six out of ten independent people say that his humor does not fit the White House.
Republican voters are getting used to this.
When political experts wear their hat, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
According to a CNN/ORC survey last week, four out of ten people who were asked who was the best candidate to win the GOP candidacy said Trump was the best.
Four out of 10 people deposited their money in Jeb Bush by the end of July.
Full disclosure: In the past, the crystal globe of the GOP voters was not very clear.
At that time, in the last election cycle, four of the 10 Republicans thought Rick Perry would be a candidate, while only 28 percent chose Mitt Romney, who was finally a candidate.
It still seems that the majority of the GOP voters find Trump’s election campaign mindful.
Even if the Republicans meet around another candidate, Trump still defeats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the distorted area may also contribute to Trump’s appearance, and it is a fact that the anti-Trump support is distributed among more than a dozen candidates.
But a Monmouth University survey conducted at the beginning of September shows that in the event of a possible match between Trump and many Republican candidates, Trump gets the majority’s support every time.
Carly passes Fiorina with 13 points, Marco Rubio with 14 points, Walker with 15 points, Jeb Bush with 19 points and Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie with 33 points.
With Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to win?
In the event of a possible defeat, Ben Carson passes the businessman with 19 points.
The vast majority of Donald Trump’s supporters say they made their decisions.
A new CBS/NYT survey, published Tuesday, shows that more than half of voters who supported Trump said they locked their votes.
Clearly, a lot of things can happen to change it, and no one can really say that he will not change his mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to change.
Trump’s biggest rival is brain surgeon Ben Carson but voters who say they’ve made their decisions are twice closer to voting for Trump.
Six Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Two months ago, in his campaign announcement speech, since Donald Trump called migrants from Mexico a "migrant" at the beginning and in the center of his 2016 talks, the topic was immigration.
Some believe that Trump’s long speech will remove important Spanish voters from the Republican Party and damage their re-marking efforts.
According to a new ABC/Post survey on Monday, six of the 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on migration issues.
As long as the issue of immigration remains on the agenda, Trump seems to be on the agenda.
The anger of the government is rising to new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson get almost half of the Republican votes due to their outer circumstances.
In a new ABC/Post survey on Monday, six of every 10 Republicans say they want one from the outside instead of one with government experience.
They are angry with Washington.
Two weeks ago, a Des Moines Register/Bloomberg survey in Iowa showed that three of every four Republicans in Iowa were angry with the Republicans at Congress, 54 percent were "not satisfied" and 21 percent were "extremely angry".
For the first time, Prime Minister Jeremy Corbyn will be asked.
Mr. Corbyn has been enthusiastically expected to take part in the Prime Minister's Questions Program since his election.
The new Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will appear in Prime Minister's Questions for the first time after David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will ask six questions shortly afternoon, and his performance seems to be closely studied by the media and Labour Party Members.
In the weekly show, he called for "fewer theatre and more reality."
He also said that some sessions could jump by leaving his colleagues.
This meeting will be Mr. Corbyn’s leadership’s first parliamentary test, followed by the appointment of the Shadow Cabinet and his speech at the TUC’s annual congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the leader of the Labour Party's silence during the reading of the national marathon at the commemoration ceremony to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the British War on Tuesday was also criticized by some Tory Members and focused on the front page news in the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision to accompany the national march was noticeable
A spokesman on behalf of Mr. Corbyn said he stood in a "respectful silence" and appreciated "the heroicity of the Royal Air Force in the British War".
But Mr. Corbyn's one of the shadow cabinet members, Owen Smith, told the BBC's News Night show that he would advise the Labour Party leader to say a national sign "independent" from his belief in the abolition of the monarchy.
As a result of differences in economic, defence and foreign relations, a dozen shadow ministers refused to serve Mr. Corbyn's top team, while less than one in six in the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
The BBC political reporter Robin Brant says that political differences within the Workers' Party have also begun to "accumulate" and that these are issues of Mr. Corbyn's assignment to the position in the European Union and the government's implementation of the upper limit for aid.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party proposed new changes regarding the full removal of the top limit.
Hours after the shadow work and retirement minister Mr. Smith said that the party was just against the government’s down to £26,000 maximum limit to £23,000 and that it was “very clear” about this.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth leader of the Labour Party to meet at the headquarters of the Chamber of Deputies since David Cameron was the leader of the conservative Party.
The Labour Party leader promised a different approach to politics and said he received "people's source" and more than 30,000 advice to ask Mr. Cameron.
Islington North MP Prime Minister's Questions program is very front-to-face and will focus on poverty, inequality and challenges faced by young people instead of making an injectable speech exchange with "responsive training".
Mr. Corbyn said when Mr. Cameron traveled abroad, for example, in the time he was not, he would be represented by the shadow trade minister Angela Eagle in the Prime Minister's Questions program.
He even occasionally suggested that his other colleagues would go to the board, and said he was calling for the House of Representatives spokesman John Bercow to discuss the issue.
When he was the leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron often said he wanted to get away from politics with the style of "Game of Frogs", often linked to the Prime Minister's Questions program, but a few years later he acknowledged he failed in this matter.
Since its first publication in 1990, the Prime Minister's Questions program has been used as a key measurement point to measure the decision-making capabilities of the leaders, their dominance in the House of Representatives and their positions between the Members of the House of Representatives; some critics, on the contrary, stated that it was cartooned and that a broad reform was needed.
'Treatened in Joburg': Homeless Youths Get Photography Training
The city centre of Johannesburg is a challenging place for the homeless.
But a group of old street children found a way to gain a new talent and provide their survival.
I’ve been withdrawn in Joburg, a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people to take pictures of their neighborhoods and get income from them.
BBC News went to meet one of the first graduates of the project.

Pounds rise as wages rise in the UK
Following the data that showed the rise of wages in the UK, a rapid rise was seen in the pound, while the FTSE 100 index also rose after the purchase offer for SABMiller.
In the United Kingdom, wages except premium increased by 2.9% between May and July compared to the same period of the previous year.
This rate, which represents the fastest rise since 2009, is also seen as one of the leading indicators for possible interest rise.
The pound gained more than 1% value against the U.S. dollar to $15505 and the euro gained 0.84%, up to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6.229.21 points with an increase of 1.49%.
The most remarkable company in this rise was SABMiller, which recorded a 20% increase with the attractive purchase offer that the competitor received from the EU InBev.
This offer will combine the world’s two largest beer companies and famous brands like Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch will meet under the same roof.
Burberry shares rose by 0.9 percent due to positive profit news from the competitive luxury retail group Richemont.
Richemont’s current sales figures also showed that sales in China, one of the key markets for Burberry, began to rise again.
The stock of the mining giant Glencore rose by 5 percent after the company announced it had earned $2.5 billion from its allocated stock sales in the framework of its debt reduction strategy.
Packaging and paper group Mondi’s shares were among the most valuable shares after Goldman Sachs lowered its offer for the company to “Sat” with a value loss of 4.3 percent.
JD Sports’ shares rose by 3.1 percent after it announced that the company’s six-month pre-tax profits rose to £46.6 million with an increase of 83%
JD Sports boss says higher wages could damage the expansion
JD Sports Board Chairman Peter Cowgill said that higher minimum wages for workers in the UK could mean "more spending power in the pockets of potential consumers".
However, he said that the expenditure power would not exceed the high costs of the employees in his company.
He added that the expenses will affect JD Sports’ expansion plans and that it could mean less extra work.
Metcash has launched a popular campaign to fight the Aldi invasion
Metcash is trying to protect IGA stores in South Australia and West Australia from an Aldi attack.
Market wholesale Metcash has launched a popular campaign to defend its retail stores in South Australia and West Australia against the $700 million Aldi invasion.
Aldi is preparing to open the first of two distribution centers in South Australia and West Australia at the beginning of next year and its stores will reach 120, while Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relations with local food suppliers and are trying to create the IGA brand with its mainstream and social media marketing and events such as the Adelaide exhibition.
The IGA suppliers and suppliers also contribute with brands such as Dunsborough-based ice cream manufacturer Simmo, which offers taste tests in the IGA stores, and with stores that sell South Australia Football League tickets with discounts to their loyal customers.
The food, beverage and equipment wholesale Metcash is expected to provide more details about its defense strategy while improving the annual Investor Strategy Day on September 29.
The risk is high, as South Australia and West Australia represent 30% of Metcash’s IGA stores and produce higher profit margins than the IGA network in the eastern states of Metcash.
The shops owners in South Australia and West Australia enjoy a much stronger market share than IGA retailers in NSW, Victoria and Queensland; 30% more in Nazaran’s East states in GA and 24% more in BA.
But analysts like Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will occupy approximately 5% of the market market within the next 12 months after opening its first stores in these two states, the sales will be taken from the hands of the existing players but generally independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath predicted IGA retailers would lose $360 million in a year and Metcash would lose $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the forecast that Aldi will open 25 stores in GA and 30 stores in BA next year and will get $500 million and $600 million sales in each market.
Mr Kierath pointed out that the loss of food and market sales and Metcash’s high fixed cost base volumes could cost Metcash interest and pre-tax profits of about $13 million.
Also, despite the recent Roy Morgan research that reveals that IGA customers are the most loyal customers, Metcash is mainly losing its market share in the eastern states, including Aldi and Coles.
According to Morgan Stanley, Metcash’s food and market sales will decrease by 3.8 per cent in 2016, 4.1 per cent in 2017 and 2.1 per cent in 2018, reducing its market share from 14 per cent in 2015 to 10.3 per cent in 2020.
Last week, Magellan Financial Group founder, leading fund manager Hamish Douglass, said at a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash "will probably be deleted in ten years."
Metcash refused to answer Mr. Douglass's comments.
But it seems that a Metcash board member contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
The IGA’s market share has dropped from 18% to 14% since 2010 and Metcash’s revenue from food and market business, which supplies about 1,200 IGA retailers, has dropped by 43% since 2012, a indicator of a decrease in the rate of business lifting as sales and margins are under pressure.
But the wholesaler is resisting, investing more than $150 million a year for the matching rack prices in the wholesale products every week in Coles and Woolworths, helping IGA retailers to renew their stores, adding faster growing fresh foods and opening a better specific marked market series to the public.
Metcash Executive Board Chairman Ian Morrice says the price matching and store renewal programs have begun to result, and it is expected that the wholesale will return to basic profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Tennis Australia chairman Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves much praise than criticism for his behavior.
Tennis Australia chairman Steve Healy said Thanasi Kokkinakis' friend, Nick Kyrgios, was accidentally injured in the last storm and deserved more than criticism.
Kokkinakis, a young member of the talented two, commonly referred to as "Special K", found himself under the spot lights that were unacceptable because Kyrgios crushed Stan Wawrinka in the Montreal Masters.
In the challenging elimination match played in the afternoon at Cincinnati, Kokkinakis and his rival Ryan Harrison were separated twice by the file judge, while Harrison said: "Wawrinka came over Kyrgios and I should go over that child."
Kokkinakis, who was seen crushing his rocket in the latest US Open potentially to escape Richard Gasquet's enjoyment, was faithfully defended by Healy.
The young player is currently competing with Sam Groth in Glasgow for the second single role behind Bernard Tomic against Britain in the Davis Cup semi-final.
Healy said, “What I feel so enthusiasticly is that I think that Thanasi is pulled into discussion.”
In the U.S. he broke his rocket when he was closed and lost but he was not the first player to break the rocket because he was disappointed, and I know that Thanasi is well aware that he should not be proud of it.
But in fact in the United States, Harrison and others managed himself quite well under extremely provocative conditions and I think he deserves a full praise.
We have a great team around, a great family, and I think it went a little too much.
Although he is 19 years old, he’s extremely mature, he’s working hard and adapts to the team, he doesn’t have any problems with the other players, he’s welcomed with great respect in the dressing room, he’s doing hard workouts, he’s a very balanced and mature young man and I think he deserves to be judged in his own shortcomings.
Healy also supported the decision to welcome Kyrgios for a significant cohesion; from Friday, he began to declare that what is right for everyone is to "do mutual decisions" but to support Canberran to return to the team as a long-term steel.
Healy said, “We want the team to focus the game completely, not on the disputes around [Kyrgios].”
And in my opinion, as people like Nick, Federer, and Murray also pointed out, the child rose very quickly, grows in front of the public and made some terrible mistakes and deserves all the criticism he received, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the results of his actions, and sometimes when he’s not under the spot lights, he deeply thinks that my thought is appropriate, that it’s the best for the team and himself.
European migration crisis: Hungary declared emergency, closed borders and monitored migrants
Hungary closed the southern border with Serbia by declaring an emergency on Tuesday in order to stop the flow of immigrants and looked at those trying to enter the country illegally.
With the accumulation of hundreds of immigrants in the neutral area, chaos was created at the border and the Serbian authorities moved with anger.
Immigrants who escaped from violence in their own countries set tents on the side of the road for an uncertain time between the control points of the two countries and settled in these tents.
But their anger increased.
As a police helicopter passed up, immigrants cried “Open the border!” and insulted the Hungarian force police.
Some refused to give them water and food as a protest.
The Minister of Foreign Affairs of Serbia said that the return of migrants from Macedonia and Greece is "unacceptable" while the flow of migrants from Macedonia and Greece continues.
(Serbia) wants to be a part of the solution, not to be damaged by this process.
In the coming days, negotiations with Brussels and other countries will need to be held,” Ivica Dacic Pragda said.
This tension on the Hungarian-Serbian border occurred just a day after the 28 national bloc failed to agree on a joint immigration policy at the meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 migrants attacking Greece and Italy and hoped that the agreement will be reached by the end of the next month or year to accept another 120,000 migrants, including those coming from Hungary, into the EU countries.
German Prime Minister Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a EU summit next week to discuss the migration crisis that the continent faces.
Hungary, however, is not very hopeful that Brussels or its neighbors will take any concrete steps on the matter.
The emergency call on Tuesday in the two southern regions gives the authorities broad powers in combating the crisis, including closing roads if necessary and accelerating the cases relating to refugees.
On the other hand, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said he planned to withdraw along the border with Romania to stop the flow of migrants from the country after the barrier that the country pulled to the border with Serbia.
CBS News reporter Charlie D'Agata has announced that even prison prison prisoners have been sentenced to the work of dragging the wire between Hungary and Serbia.
In the last few months, Hungary has become an important narrow passage and transition point to the European Union countries, and the majority of these migrants are refugees who flee from wars in Syria and other Middle East countries.
Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that the majority of the coming immigrants are "economic immigrants" who try to move to Europe for a better life rather than innocent people who come to escape the war - this idea is completely contrary to the views of other EU countries including Germany.
The laws in Hungary, which entered into force at midnight, bring harder penalties to human traffickers as well as making it a crime to transcend or damage the 4 meters (13 feet) length of the barrel on the border with Serbia.
In a statement to journalists in the southern city of Szeged, government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs said: "The Hungarian government has declared a state of emergency due to the situation caused by mass migration."
We have a very clear opinion on one thing: it is a crime to cross the border illegally.
Although the military displacement is still required to be approved by the parliament, Associated Press reporters in the region say they have seen dogs and vehicles equipped with heavy weapons here for days.
Orban’s domestic security adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said the authorities had arrested 15 people who had crossed the border with 45 people trying to cross the border.
They have passed by damaging the roofs, now they are accused of committing crimes under the police’s custody and new laws.
The authorities are rapidly repairing the roofs.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossing points with Serbia on Tuesday morning, while they used a train wagon covered with wheels to close one of the crossing points.
As Hungarians activated a small metal container where people were filled with a click-to-click to make the transactions, the chaos also reflected the main border crossing point near Roszke.
20 people were able to enter, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants said they would not accept food and water aid until they were allowed to enter Hungary by closing the highway that connects Serbia and Hungary.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton's superiority over Bernie Sanders decreased by half in national elections
Former Foreign Minister Hillary Clinton continues to lead two-number in the Democratic race for national candidacy but Sen. Bernie Sanders reaches him.
Clinton currently receives 47% of the Democratic votes (down from 58%) while Sanders is second with 27% (down from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet stated whether he is in the presidential race, gets 15% of the democratic votes.
More than five months before the main races began, most Democratic voters said it was still too early to decide which candidate they would support.
But Clinton’s supporters have stronger ideas about their own elections than other candidates.
Since last month CBS News, Clinton has lost the ground between a series of demographic groups, and Sanders has some gains on the other hand.
Clinton is ahead with a big difference between women and moderate men, but that difference is closing.
The support between men has fallen considerably, and Sanders follows him only 5 points behind.
Clinton’s Democratic voter’s advantage under the age of 50 has been evaporated and he and Sanders are now in equal position.
But Clinton has a big difference in terms of the elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sander with two scores among the liberals, but now Sanders is 5 points ahead in this group.
Approximately half of the Democratic voters on a national level say they will support Clinton with passion if the party is a candidate.
A quarter will support with certain conditions while another 15 percent will support him only if he is a candidate.
One hundred percent don’t support Clinton.
Per not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters tend to support him especially with passion.
The views among those who don’t support Clinton at the moment are even more confused – only a quarter can support him with passion.
48 percent of Democrats say they’re going to support Clinton with passion, while less Republican lead candidates talk about Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton’s supporters are asked open end questions about why they want Clinton to be a candidate, the first-range answers are that they have the right experience (16 percent), now the idea is that it’s time for a woman to choose a president (13 percent) and that she’s the best candidate for business (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also expressed their relationship with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
To be consensual in the issues and to be selected among the criteria specified.
As a vice president with the potential for the presidency, 57 percent of Democratic voters may want to see him be in the race, but a third of the unity does not think that way.
When the Democratic voters are asked what the second candidate election for the party is, Biden is in the top.
More than half of Clinton’s supporters, according to Sander, say Biden could have a second election with an open interchange.
If Biden doesn’t enter the Democratic Candidate race, Hillary Clinton’s superiority over Sanders increases; the level of 20 points in a race in which Biden was ranked up to 30 points in a race where Biden was not ranked.
Fifty-five percent of Democrats see Clinton as the best candidate to win general elections, but this figure dropped from 78 percent last month to this level.
Although Biden was the second in this regard, it was a lot behind, but the percentage of those who saw him as the most eligible candidate showed an increase.
Again, when asked what’s the most important thing in a candidate, Democrats hold the issues ahead of eligibility.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or candidate appears unacceptable as a candidate for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates or candidates show good performance in some of the main characteristics among the primary voters of their own parties.
The majority sees Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and reliable, as well as people with strong leadership qualities.
Biden is the first among the three in terms of honesty while Clinton is strong in terms of leadership.
According to thirty percent of Democratic voters, Clinton is not honest and reliable, while half of them say the same for Sanders (15 percent), while 27 percent don’t have any idea about it.
Democratic voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders and Biden in the same direction as their own ideology.
In all measures, the Democratic voter’s quarter has no idea of Sanders.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs continues with questions about the use of its personal e-mail address and server while most Democratic voters find the statement about the issue satisfying and say their views about it are not affected.
But this is a different story in the general American public.
Half of Americans are no longer satisfied with his statements, but only one-third finds it satisfied.
The opinions of the public on this matter divided in March, shortly after the problem was taken under the mark.
Most Americans say their e-mail disputes do not affect their general opinions about Clinton, on the other hand, their negative opinions have increased compared to 36 percent.
These are generally Republicans, and more than six out of 10 people say their views about Clinton are distorted.
Although Clinton is seen as honest and reliable by the voters of his party, it remains a problem among registered voters in general: only 32% of voters see him honest and reliable, this figure dropped by eight points compared to last month and 15 points since May.
Twenty-six percent of registered voters don’t find him honest and reliable.
At the same time, 55 percent of all registered voters in the country don’t think Trump is honest and reliable.
However, both Clinton and Trump get good notes on the leadership.
Among the six candidates who participated in the test, Biden, Carson and Bush received the best scores in honesty.
Moreover, Sanders is often found honest, but as it is in Carson, most people don’t have any idea of him.
The error margin in the samples received from 351 Democrats is 6% points.
Ben Carson is right behind Donald Trump in national surveys
According to the latest CBS News/New York Times survey, Ben Carson is running close behind Donald Trump
The new survey shows that about half of the two candidates match the game, and the other candidates have no chance.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, with 23% of the support in the last CBS survey before the discussion on Fox News last month rising to 27% in the survey on Tuesday.
But support for Carson increased from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The survey also found that Carson went well in the demographic groups, and that the support among Republican voters from college graduates was much higher than Trump.
The remaining, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, declined to now 2 percent from the 10 percent last month.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third with 6%.
The latest survey with 376 people elected among Republican voters made the error margin of 6% and the survey was conducted in September.
The latest CNN/ORC survey published last week showed Carson’s support among the Republicans to 19 percent, right behind Trump’s 32 percent support.
The latest survey by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump seriously in front of Carson.
Trump, who was faced with Carson's rise last week, apologized for questioning Carson Trump's belief, but continued to rush randomly to a retired brain surgeon.
At a campaign station in Iowa on Saturday, Trump said “We need energy.”
Five brotherhood members are accused of the death of a first-class student at Baruch College
During the ceremony of acceptance to a brotherhood in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, five people were charged with murder almost two years after a college student was killed.
The New York City Baruch College Pi Delta Psi brotherhood in a launch ceremony in September 2013 violently attacked Chun "Michael" Deng and, according to the police, contributed to his death by delaying taking him to the hospital.
The officials that his eyes were closed, a back bag of 30 pounds full of sand was stuck on his back, and that he was constantly stuck while trying to walk toward the goal in a frozen field.
Mr. Deng complained that he had a headache over time and later lost consciousness.
Pi Delta Psi brotherhood members did not call the 911 after Deng was killed and, according to the police, they waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital.
However, police commissioner Chris Wagner, who spoke in a press conference, said that they changed Deng’s clothes, searched for his symptoms on Google and asked for advice by contacting Brotherhood’s national chairman Andy Meng.
Commissioner Wagner said at this point the members began to hide their personal assets and highlight the goodness of brotherhood from Michael Deng.
He was unable to recover and lost his life the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng formed trauma caused by repeated crashes with a body that was not sharp in the head, body and neck.
Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng’s family, said in a statement that many families were destroyed as a result of the Brotherhood Admission Ceremony, and since 1970 at least one student has died every year at the Admission Ceremony.
Brotherhood and members should be held responsible for this and the steps taken by the authorities are very important.
Monroe City’s major jury recommended the first five members to be prosecuted for third-degree murder charges.
Thirty-two members of the brotherhood, including Mr Meng, will also be charged with the reception ceremony for the attack and punishment.
Wagner said on a press conference on Tuesday, we will hold them responsible not only for the people involved in the business, but if any organization officially or informally confirms it.
Baruch College banned brotherhood and the national brotherhood also ended its relationship with this local unit.
What happens when the Fed increases its interest rates?
With the rise of the interest rates, the bear market turns up and bond revenues rise, and the economy is in decline.
We know that.
What we don’t know is how long this will happen and how long it will continue.
History, especially in the economy, provides very little information about timing.
The decline has also lasted as long as 86 months, as the decline occurred shortly as 11 months after the first interest rate rise.
The US Central Bank’s aggression in raising the interest rates, though not constant, has often been decisive in the reaction of the economy and financial assets.
This is why U.S. central bank officials strongly emphasize investors should focus on how long the normalization process will last, not when the interest rates will begin to rise.
It is a fact that there are various variables.
But the result, market participants may think that the interest rise anxiety is exaggerated.
Capital Economics Global Chief Economist Julian Jessop said in a note to customers, “It is inevitable that the Fed’s first rate increase since the global financial crisis is interpreted as indicating by some that the ‘ cheap money’ period has come to an end.”
On the contrary, we do not expect the U.S. interest rates to slowly return to normal, but the levels that are still low appear to be a seismic blow that most are afraid of.
We cannot say that there will be no effects.
Based on past trends, the reaction that some areas of the economy can give is as follows:
As seen in the market in the past months, waiting for a rise in interest rates can disbalance some things for a while.
When the interest is increased, the effect is not so clear.
In a new study of what will happen after the Fed rise, Deutsche Bank analysts said, “Self-source returns are seen as a stop trend 12-24 months after the first interest rate rise, which may reflect the stop in monetary policy.”
According to a recent analysis by Bob Doll from Nuveen Asset Management, Barron's, the market more often recorded sharp rises over the last 35 years – about 14 percent – and after 250 days it progressed on a straight line towards the interest rate increase (medium 2.6 percent increase) and after 500 days it returned to normal and achieved an average return of 14.4 percent in the last six cycles.
Deutsche said the impact on shares became more evident in the subsequent stages of the interest rate cycle and the revenue was faced to disappear.
Reductions are a fact of economic life, but interest increases also help them.
The Fed is facing some situations that are not previously present in the current situation and will accelerate the recession.
The most remarkable is that the non-clean domestic yield is at the lowest level ever for the Fed’s interest rate increase.
According to the Deutsche Bank, in the 118 interest rate increase since 1950, the non-pure domestic revenue from the nominal year to the year fell only twice below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 occurred at a level of 3.6 per cent, the Atlanta Fed estimates that this will be permanent by very few, and the third quarter is at a level of 1.5 per cent.
According to Deutsche, raising interest rates in such a sensitive economic environment can be risky and can lead to the question "will it be different this time".
The attention of the market participants who have been waiting for Fed’s interest rate rise for a year this week at the Federal Open Market Committee meeting, which will end on Thursday.
Although most strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could confirm an increase in this meeting, deadline trade indicates only 25 percent chance.
According to the report, "in the research we have done since 1950, all the growth cycles that have occurred until today are within a super-rise trend cycle and rapidly reach the peak of non-clean domestic revenue, starting recovery after decline."
On the contrary, this was an unprecedented slow recovery from the worst retreat that occurred in an example period.
The current cycle was the longest cycle that the Fed has expected since the last recession – the longest cycle in the record was 35 months and the cycle we are in is in the 74th month and is still ongoing.
With the expectation of a rate increase in the market, the fixed income has become unstable, and the order looks like a bit of self-source.
The main difference is that when the Fed’s policy changes its course, the effect is seen faster than it is in shares.
When the first increase/down of the cycle comes, the bond returns do not change the direction immediately.
At the end of the rate increase cycle, bond returns are falling immediately," Deutsche said.
According to strategists Charles Schwab, the rise in interest rates will raise the curve by approaching the returns between longer and shorter-term bonds.
Kathy Jones from Schwab analysts, who said that high-revenue bonds often perform better in such a environment in the analysis, said, but "we are still cautious about revenue."
Interestingly, Jones believes that the markets are already adapted to Fed’s policy expectations.
"In addition to the decline in the dollar's strength and inflation expectations, there are various signs that the market is regulated according to a stricter monetary policy," he wrote.
The short-term interest rates are rising, the yield curve is correct, the credit spreads have expanded and the volatility has increased - all the features that will be seen on the market when the Fed strangles the policy.
In a broad perspective, companies doing most of their business in the U.S. will win because interest rates will rise and local products will be more attractive.
The situation of multinational companies with a lot of debt will be worse, as increasing dollar products will make the global market more expensive and their debt will be even more expensive.
Goldman Sachs analysts in a report prepared for their customers said, “History shows that ‘quality’ shares may experience a low performance at the beginning of such a rise.”
Companies with strong balance sheets exceeded those with poor balance sheets by an average of 5 per cent following the rates increased in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low-volatility shares also overcome their low-quality competitors (percentage) with an average of 4 to (percentage) 3.
The debt will become a big issue.
According to Goldman, companies with high wave rate debt are the most likely to suffer damage.
Apart from the net stock exchange game, consumers are also expected to benefit from the rising dollar.
Although experts have different opinions about how fast they will keep, savings can also get profitable from high profits.
Andrew Bingham says a copy of BBC Radio 3 Classic FM
Conservative parliamentary Andrew Bingham accuses the station of 'disintegrating'
Radio says it becomes increasingly different from its commercial competitors
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards and accused him of scratching the British Awards.
Deputy friend Damien Collins accuses The Voice of not being original
A advanced representative pressed the publisher to show the difference between the BBC Radio 3 and the other commercial stations by saying that the BBC Radio 3 is "reversing" to the Classic FM.
Conservative deputy Andrew Bingham also said that the radio channel that provides public services to the BBC bosses is "enlarging" and is increasingly distinctive from its commercial rivals.
“I don’t like to use this feature, but Radio 3 is “enlarged,” it’s becoming Classic FM.”
The BBC Music Awards were held in December.
The BBC Music Awards, which was launched last year, is another version of the British Music Awards.
Bingham said, “So if you’re trying to do something different, these are the first two examples I think, while you’re holding and copying the same thing that’s already on the market.”
The BBC’s chief executive rejected the accusations and claimed that the BBC Radio 3 is clearly in front of commercial competitors in the field of public education, even if it needs live music.
If I’m learning from Radio 3, I’m not going to learn anything about classical music elsewhere.
And this is a commitment to live music, and making music cannot be compared to anything else.
He also said that I think that Radio 3’s effort to discover new music and promote its works is also very important.
BBC Radio 3 director Alan Davey claimed that radio needs to work more than ever before to reach more audience earlier this year, as the British are less educated in the field of classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only component holding the ball because the BBC's commercial competitors struck the hole at the election committee meeting of Culture, Media and Sports.
Deputy Tory Damien Collins de O Ses - the BBC's Netherlands producing company Talpa Media's 22 million pounds of music talent competition - was awarded.
Do you not see why the program brings so much sound, because it is not original and there is no particular difference?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 Show, which was the jury of Paloma Faith and Boy George, was made "with a BBC-specific style".
He said the institution wanted him to "find a hit from his own blood" before making the entertainment program again.
Nevertheless, he did not accept the idea that in the future more O Audio program would be blocked or the amount spent on the license fee would be spent on other formats.
Why is Black Friday the lowest online sales in history in August?
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7 percent.
Last month recorded the lowest growth since 2000 when records began to break.
Three years before mobile devices began to be used in shops, Internet sales exploded.
Experts say that Black Friday in November may be the reason for spending cuts
Online shopping has been explosive for more than a decade and has transformed the most vibrant shopping streets in Britain into a ghost city.
Following the figures that showed that online sales only increased by seven per cent in the first three months of 2015, experts say that online sales show more and more signs of weakening.
The total spending in August was only a fifth-percent increase compared to last year and the lowest growth since the year 2000 when the records began to break.
Following the figures that showed that online sales only increased by seven per cent in the first three months of 2015, experts say that online sales show more and more signs of weakening.
IMRG sales index editor Andy Mulcahy told the Guardian, “If you look at the growth levels of the previous years, and especially the 2000s, you’ll actually see everything returns to normal over time.”
Three years before consumers started using their mobile phones to buy products, the internet sales recorded a huge increase.
This means that more people could shop even when they were sitting on the seat.
But now it is going horizontally, you can see (growing) down.
The Black Friday phenomenon, a concept taken from America, is shown as one of the reasons for sales slowing.
Experts say that consumers may be waiting for this event held on the last Friday of November to buy something.
The event last year, when five times more consumers attacked the companies’ websites to get cheap products compared to the previous year, many companies’ sites collapsed.
Experts say that Black Cuman’s shoppers, showing that the shoppers are struggling for discounts, may have been “until now” distracted.
A study published by the British Retail Association found that every 5 pounds spent on shopping, 1 pound was spent on the purchase of products on the internet.
A third of some products, such as TV and washing machines, are now purchased from online stores.
More than a quarter of people also buy clothes and shoes on the internet instead of luxurious and spectacular shopping streets.
With bin Laden's family found guilty, Muslims congratulate those who lost their lives in the crash in Mecca on their last trips
29 people killed after the first funeral in Mecca were moved to the streets by Muslims.
Saudi Arabia has held the construction giant Saudi Binladin group responsible for the crash
The Ministry of Health that a total of 394 people were injured after the fall of Vincin.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered to carry the wings of 29 people who died in the fall of a vincin to the mosque of Haram.
Most of the crowds in the white closed the roads to congratulate their first funerals on their last trips at the Muaysim Cemetery in Mecca.
The painful crowd passed through the holy place where a Vincin mosque's roof was destroyed a few days ago and the catastrophe was overwhelmed.
In the incident, 394 people were also injured, after the Saudi kingdom’s building holding owner Binladin’s family was held responsible, the dead’s seeds were brought to burial.
29 soldiers who lost their lives by a vincin falling into the mosque of Haram moved on their shoulders along the road
Among the dead was November Akram, the father of four children from the Bolton district of Manchester.
Mr. Akram came to Mosque with his mother and father at the beginning of the year’s Haj’s worship.
Saudi leaders announced that Haccin will continue with the participation of thousands of militants on the way to Mecca.
In his statement today, King Salman announced that Binladin Holding Group should not leave the Vincin arm open when it is out of use.
In the Arabic version of the farm, which was prepared by the Saudi Press Agency operated by the state, the only party to be accused of the incident was the Binladin Group.
The news agency's English service did not pass this detail, but the company's officials were informed that it was forbidden to travel abroad.
At the beginning of the week, Salman, Vincin, promised that at the end of the month, hundreds of thousands of Muslims who came to Hajj will find the reason to be devoted to the garden of the Mosque of Haram.
The Binladin group did not make any statements about the overthrowed wing and their representatives were not allowed to comment.
The royal firm accused the group of not taking current security measures and not cooperating with the meteorological authorities.
The Mosque of Mekka is surrounded by dozens of wings, the majority of these buildings are continued under the direction of the group of Binladin.
Binladin’s family has been in close ties with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is the head of most construction projects.
Al-Qaeda’s last leader, Osama bin Laden, was also a foolish son whom the family banned from childhood.
The accident occurred just a few days before millions flowed to the Hague, where every adult Muslim must visit at least once in his life, during a time of heavy wind and rain.
Authorities that 158 people are still being treated in the hospital.
The authorities ordered the families of the dead and the survivors with permanent disabilities to pay 1 million Riyals (174,000 pounds).
The other injured will receive half of this amount.
The boss of B&Q says that behind this trend are Eastern European craftsmen working cheaply
Veronique Laury says the British are employing more and more stalls
Behind this increase lies the number of Eastern European master craftsmen
As a result, more than 200 new Screwfix stores are opened targeting craftsmen.
Kingfisher also closes 60 B&Q stores across the country
Written by Rupert Steiner, Daily Mail City Chief Reporter
It is said that the British began to hire skilled Eastern European craftsmen to do the work in their homes instead of leaving their stripes and paint brushes in their hands.
If you are skilled in drawing or painting walls, you are a minority in these days.
Because, according to the company’s boss behind B&Q, the British are employing more and more masters to do DIY jobs in their homes.
Veronique Laury, the new chief executive of Kingfisher, owner of the home healing chain, said that there was a huge increase in the number of Eastern-European skilled craftsmen offering low-cost services behind this trend.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 new Screwfix stores for craftsmen while closing its 60 B&Q stores.
Mrs. Laury said she wanted more women to be hired in the B&Q stores because eight of the ten purchasing decisions in the stores were given by women.
The majority of staff are now men.
She said that the single woman’s home, which has more home healing than in the past, has a need to meet the emerging demographic trends.
Mrs. Laury said: “The majority of men still work in our stores.
We need to build more balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women and 80 percent of decisions about the purchased products are made by women.
Women play a major role in decision making.
Mrs. Laury, one of the five women at the head of the FTSE100 UK’s leading companies index, also reorganized its top team to consist of equal number of men and women’s executives.
Kingfisher, including chief executive and financial director, has a total of 50 percent of the team’s staff made up of women almost alone in this field.
Mrs. Laury said: "This was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here.
It was not difficult to find good women to get to our board.
After the group charged the costs of closed stores, Kingfisher announced that there was a decline in both submonth profits and sales.
Kingfisher, the owner of Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Time to decide the US Central Bank to raise interest rates for the Fed
The two-day meetings of the U.S. Central Bank on Wednesday and Thursday are being monitored by the whole world, and the decision is expected to be made about whether the interest rates will be raised or not over a decade.
In a Reuters survey, more than half of 80 economists said the Fed would implement this decision last week, while now they think it will suspend and keep the rates between 0-0,25 percent.
Seven years have passed since the Fed dropped its rates to zero, this is a historic event.
Angel Ubide, senior researcher at the Peterson International Institute of Economy, said: “For the first time, we will see a large central bank out of the zero point and start the process of normalizing interest rates.”
The U.S. economy is performing relatively well and adds trillions of dollars to the balance sheet during the recovery process and creates a small amount of inflation.
But the Fed cannot ignore the global picture that is less hopeful.
Markets have warned against a rise but there are signs that they believe that the situation will not allow such a rise.
The decision will be announced on Thursday at 20.00 p.m.
The victim of the murder at Delta State University left a letter of apology
According to the officials on Tuesday, Shannon Lamb left a note saying he was "fortunate" for the first murder after killing his girlfriend with a gun on Monday morning in Mississippi and in the same day's advance hours before killing his worker, and with a desire "I can get back".
The Mississippi Gautier police said Lamb, a geographical and social science educator at Delta State University, was calling 911 at 10 p.m.
He said on Monday he was shot and killed by a gun.
Lamb said he had to send the police to the officer on the phone.
"I killed my wife yesterday night," Lamb also said that there was "a sweet dog that didn't harm anyone" in the house and that he was probably sad.
When the police asked his name, he didn’t say his name.
Lamb has not made any statements about the murder.
When the police went to the scene, the dead body of the 41-year-old Amy Prentiss and a 45-year-old Lamb wrote: "I'm very sorry, I wish I could get the time back.
I loved Amy so much, and she was the only one who loved me so far.
After writing this note, Lamb took his car to the Delta State, 300 miles away, and killed history professor Ethan Schmidt, and then committed suicide when the police struck him.
University Dean William LaForge noted that there was a problem between Lamb and Schmidt, but that "Lamb's mind was clear that there were some things."
Despite Monday’s reports that Lamb believes that her girlfriend Prentiss has an emotional relationship with Schmidt, officials said on Tuesday that he had “no information or evidence” that it was a “love triangle”.
Shawn O'Steen, who has been married to Prentiss for about seven years, describes Prentiss as "a good one".
The couple divorced 15 years ago, but their friendship continued.
O'Steen said that Prentiss and a 19-year-old daughter were found and that the girl was "destroyed".
O'Steen also pointed out that Prentiss and her daughter are "surely the best friends of each other".
According to Linsday Knowless, Sun Herald described Parentiss as a close friend, Prentiss was working on the internet from home.
Knowles says Prentiss, who owns a hunting dog named Lightning, has been with Lamb for about 3 years.
Knowles said, “He always loved helping others.”
The police told Lamb on Monday, calling his relatives, “I’m not going to get imprisoned.”
The same night, when police approached him well on Highway 1 near Greenville, Lamb pulled off, jumped as a pedestrian, ran to the forest area, and shot himself with a gun and committed suicide.
According to its CV published on the University’s website, Lamb was awarded the doctorate degree in education at Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
The Stars Who Lost Their Old Attraction
The actor (left) seen with his son Redmond (right) spent quite stressful several years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia, and in 2009 his life partner Farrah Fawcett died of cancer.
The actor, allegedly struggling with drugs, was arrested in 2008 for taking drugs.
Of course, all of this hurt him a lot.
Manchester United's Luke Shaw is out for several months with double break.
Luke Shaw's right leg suffered from two breaks in the match Manchester United defeated PSV Eindhoven in the Champions League.
The defense player's tears will leave him away for at least six months, while Louis van Gaal Shaw is hopeful that he will be able to return to the field this season.
The break has led to the 20-year-old Shaw's unsuccessful intrusion with Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute of the match where he fell as a bomb on the matchfield.
He was interfered in the field for nine minutes and then it was necessary to give oxygen before he was sent to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He was suddenly broken in his bed and is now in the hospital."
Today or a day later, he may be transferred and operated in Manchester.
A bad situation - a young man who is transferred to Manchester at the age of 18, first passes difficult times, then makes a great game, and then let that happen.
He had an oxygen mask on his face.
He was crying.
I’m not a doctor, but if you’re broken from a double place, that means at least six months and that means you won’t be able to play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky to get rid of the red card and the penalty shot.
Judge Nicola Rizzoli has not punished the Mexican.
Van Gaal said the Italian authorities had made a mistake.
When I say that it is a penalty and a red card, you can judge yourself.
It was a bad fight with two legs.
Shaw tweeted: "Thank you all for your messages, there are no words enough to tell me how disappointed I'm, my way to heal is now beginning, I'm going back with strength."
Manchester United is shocked by Luke Shaw's disability in PSV defeat
The Champions League, which will be held in France in July, will be moral for the healing of the British defense player.
PSV’s technical director, Phillip Cocu, said: “It’s a very bad injury.”
If such a injury happens to any player, everyone will regret it.
The goal of our players is never to hurt the opponent.
Moreno had a broken leg while Van Gaal played against the Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
Cocu finds this situation very difficult because his intention was never to hurt his opponent and it wasn’t good after he heard that it was a very bad break, he said.
I couldn’t see that moment in my mind.
The only thing I could see was the ball going in a different direction, as if Moreno had touched him but I couldn't see Luke's roll.
Moreno said in SBS 6: "I know what a feeling it is, I know how hard it can be.
I feel very bad about it and I am very sorry.
He was taken to the hospital as a result of his struggle with Chris Smalling at PSV's Andrés Guardado.
David Cameron knows the Lorax better.
This is something that every parent soon learns: when your child loves a book, you know that it will not take you too much time to learn it almost to remember.
It seems that you are not David Cameron.
When asked what was his favorite children's book by a vacation programming provider for child care, Prime Minister The Lorax chose Dr. Seuss's Environmental Tale from 1971.
Cameron continues in a message posted on SuperCamps’ website that it’s a difficult decision: “This book, which is a funny, impressive, creative and powerful message, contains an image or message we’ve always jumped on, I love reading to my children.”
So far, everything went well, to the paragraph in which Cameron wrote something about the content of the book but actually added new characters and details to flourish the content of the original story text in the 2012 film version of the book.
A child named Ted in the town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature is destroyed, even the weather is made of walls, writes that he wants to realize his real desire to see a tree to win the heart of his dream girl Audrey, the real name Theodor Seuss Geisel and the story includes a love story that Dr. Seuss, who died in 1991, does not know.
If this doesn’t seem doubtful enough to you, Cameron’s text is very similar to the short summary of the film The Lora in the Internet Film Archive, which begins as follows: “In the city of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the weather is a matter of walls, a child named Ted wants to win the heart of Audrey’s dream girl.”
Having regard to the claims that he’s a well-known parent, it seems unlikely that Cameron, despite the objections of the local surroundings of an unnamed young child named Lorax and the creature “speaking in the name of the trees,” he heard of the main topic of the book how it was destroyed by the foolish, cutting the trees, and the foolish Once.
Most likely, such a weak Public Relations work was transferred to an order servant that he also seemed to have not read The Lorax to a child art twenty times in a row.
A spokeswoman from the presidency said the text was believed to have come from Cameron's election office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was provided from Cameron's staff, but no other comment was made.
Adam Lyth was clearly under the risk of Britain’s expulsion but was still overwhelming.
Playing with Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task but I think there is no repeat of the 3-0 test series defeats that happened last time after seeing the British team chosen for the tour.
However, I don’t miss the possibility of a victory.
Alastair Cook's team may be less experienced than three years ago, but they have players that turn well on the hit line and the collective game understanding is also strong; they don't heal the wounds of 2012, they only provide a little youth-based optimism.
In the wholesale game, Moeen Ali is developing as a game reversal and Adil Rashid represents an attack option, even if its quality is unknown at the Test level.
Related: Adam Lyth leaves the English Test Team and Alex Hales is replaced
The decision to remove Adam Lyth was a difficult decision to analyze for me as the chief coach in Yorkshire.
The seven trials were opposed to two good attacks in difficult circumstances, and the simple but inevitable fact is that the cricketers are judged according to the conclusion.
For example, there was no question sign about Joe Root, because the announcement had to be made - as I said before - the players were their best choices.
After a few fifty-series, Lyth could see that his career was extended, but he determined his own fate.
If you work more for Yorkshire, I hope you’ll take another opportunity.
England's chief coach Trevor Bayliss praised the player's attitude, though he didn't show his best performance, that didn't surprise me; first of all, he was a team man.
It is difficult to answer the question how long it will take to get a test shooter's note.
Lyth - like his previous Sam Robson - took seven cups, and Nick Compton took nine.
Only Compton took the chance of the match.
The only pain you may feel for Jonathan Trott may be that the UK will go to the Caribbean first - while Lyth's shape is at the top - but this missed opportunity is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes and I think he is a high-level shooter.
A X-factor character cricketer, and we saw it in Yorkshire, when he made 236 points against us on the Trent Bridge stage at the beginning of this season.
At least it should be taken for the same opportunity as it was before, but this of course depends on the formation of the team in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea that Moeen was doing an opening blow alongside Cook so that it would make it possible to get an additional game reversal while holding four quicks and I’m not against it.
I don’t understand why a shooter can’t shoot here, and this left holder has already shown how good it is as a cricketer.
Moeen could not do his job for the city of Worcestershire but he saw a number 3 for them and there was no much difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test in the first fall before his release began in 2001.
He took three hundred series immediately and didn’t look back.
Zafar Ansari comes to the team as a reversal game and surprised me as an impressive young man in the limited conversations I made with him.
People can see the raw statistics - the average of 31 in a blow and the average of 35 in a ball - and they can think that it is a decay but there is not a lot of the game that lifts up their hands and the player choices are made on the side of the young.
You will learn a lot in this tour.
Far from the team, it seems that Britain has made a few intelligent add-ons to its coach team.
The appointment of Sri Lanka shooter Mahela Jayawardene as a consultant for the Test matches could be a skillful measure.
It is one of the most loving men in the game; it will bring you a full experience acquired against all attacks in any circumstances.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball foot and gives both the energy and the game order a cruel series.
I’ve always thought he was born for the international cricket world, whether he’s a player or a coach, and there’s a sense that he can be guided like Mahela.
Sometimes new sounds in the dressing room, even if the previously said messages are transmitted, can bring an innovation to the team.
Colly's teammate from Durham, I Stokes is resting for a day-to-day games, Root has been given a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it.
Although not everyone agrees, plans, coaches and players are not made by those who choose.
And you should not forget that like the players, their work also depends on the results.
Such decisions are never made easily.
If the economy is stable until 2017, Brexit could win camp
David Cameron's semi-cooked re-deal strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting worse every day, and this is the case despite Jeremy's "Yes or Not?" election of Corbyn to the Labour Party, or the TUC's outbreak on Tuesday on Europe.
Expatriates also have Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
Recently, a European diplomatic grandfather said that some member states, in the EU, which have been immersed in crises of a kind that they do not want most of them, are tired of the agenda of Britain’s merely self-thinking divisive privileges and transgressive treaty changes.
TUC decided not to do so if it damaged social protection at its annual meeting in Brighton.
We can even call it Dave and George’s own agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor participate in summits or bilateral meetings in the foreign capitals and draw their own pictures in front of the famous monuments there, and then say they have returned to their countries and gathered allies for reform.
This is completely related to me.
When Berlin says "Don't leave us alone with France," my European friend, who is looking for an outward Britain within the EU tabernacle, said that in some capitals, more and more short-looking ministers and officials have come to a point where we are no longer concerned about whether we stay.
Germany’s cautious and wise leader, Angela Merkel, is a ally, with which she has been in power for 10 years, and she wants to leave the power without worsening as in the examples of Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
François Hollande faces a re-election or power change in France in 2017.
It is a leftist power.
In Poland there will be a nationalist government of the right and in Spain a left government of the right.
It is unlikely for the Selfie British that these countries will make an effort to prevent Scotland from leaving the United Kingdom because they don’t want it too because most of them have separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers, in the style of the Scottish National Party, may plan to accelerate the Brexit process by making intentional statements that will not benefit from this situation during the UK’s 2017 referendum campaign; my friend says that.
“The negotiations would not come out again,” and “the UK did not get anything to benefit from the negotiations again.”
The Europeans, from their previous experiences, know how exploitative, oligarchic press barons of Fleet Street are against the EU because they were not so at the time of Tony Benn, they were the source of inspiration for the 1975 referendum, which approved our initiative in 1973.
In the early 90s, the Brussels journalist, Boris Johnson, the leading Euro-portunist, was named the "EU straight bananas" in the early 90s.
In addition to all his stupidity, Ed Miliband knew who the enemies were.
Among them were anti-tax fools, foreigners listening to illegal telephones, and so-called foreign residents who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair was often thinking the same thing about it, and he realized that when a gorilla was stuck in a cage, he had to give him the attention by giving him the bananas in the lunch and the tea hour, so that he could not eat.
In fact, Miliband was also Blair's opposition to Cameron's bright referendum idea, as Blair agreed with the principle on the EU constitution, which was abolished in 2005 by the French and Dutch voters who gave him the output card.
The press has never forgiven him.
But it seems that Jeremy Corbyn, who wiped my friendly back on Monday at Westminster – I told him he no longer has time to lose me – is at risk of re-adopting Neil Kinnock’s 80-year-old Murdoch’s boycott strategy, which was then and now a mistake.
Although it will take time, he needs to develop a consistent strategy to communicate with Andrew Marr, who left the BBC seat on Sunday, not with me, but with the media.
I express Corbyn’s official position in Europe as gently developing.
He says he wants us to stay in an EU that has passed the reform.
The majority of the people who remain outside the hostile tendency of Ukip and the fierce supporters of the Conservative Little Britannia say yes.
That’s what Hilary Benn said on radio and television this week, “that’s a Benn but not a Bennite,” because he naively forced himself not to admit that it’s a bad idea to appoint John McDonnell as a shadow fate.
This reminded me in the 1970s of his father’s television struggle for unfaithfulness to his friends in the working cabin, that he did not go further and that he lost his office in the cabin.
Hilary’s struggle was more attractive.
But "Benn's statement - fighting to stay "under any circumstances" was not the same as what McDonnell said or what JC told the lords to their parliaments at a special meeting held on Monday night.
Considering that it also touches me, from the details that Corbyn tries to transmit to the general, the yearly image continues to preserve the importance of message discipline in the 7/24 TV age, and in particular in the social media entrance, which is a paranoia and a bed of betrayal.
As McDonnell said, it is quite reasonable to challenge Europe, which allows Cameron to guarantee the support of the Labour Party in the referendum.
Simon Jenkins definitely thinks so.
But McDonnell’s and Corbyn’s approaches to EU membership in line with the Bennite circular economy and anti-capitalist history are no longer just a particular debate among the left-wing opponents, which are the basics of narcissism’s teaching aspirations.
As in his transition on NATO - Tom Watson is determined that the JC will not campaign to leave - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to get a man from them for their masters in their countries.
Why do they lose political capital on the benefits to Britain, where Paris or Berlin, while they have doubtful voters?
As I was told at the opening of the UK Impact Security Forum on Monday, the US is already disappointed by the poor minimum performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, despite the cost-reducing Conservative Party government in power.
Experts criticize UK public health e-cigarette research
The researchers said in a meeting of 12 people with people associated with the tobacco industry, a government-funded agency claimed that e-cigarettes were 95% less harmful than smoking.
Experts in the British Journal of Medicine (BMJ) joined Lancet in criticism of the evidence used by the British Public Health (PHE) in the e-cigarette report.
PHE published its report last month, which it described as “a turnpoint” as “the detailed examination of evidence.”
But some researchers questioned the solidity of the data and attracted the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
Last month’s headline of the Lancet medical magazine targeted the “extraordinary corrupt foundation” based on the PHE’s main outcome.
The other two researchers, which wrote in the BMJ, asked whether the claims were "built on a stone or stone."
Martin McKee, European public health professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “The basic principle of public health is that policies are based on evidence of effectiveness.”
The public said that the claims of PHE on “approximately 95% less harmful than e-cigarette according to the best current estimates” would be expected to be based on a detailed review of the evidence and modeling.
In fact, this comes from a 12-person meeting gathered together to develop a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) model to create a synthesis of their views on the harm about the various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a research article.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting, the CEO, was a company called EuroSwiss Health, which was previously to have funded from British American Tobacco for an independent research.
He also said that in a sustainability report he also confirmed the public health promotion certificate of BAT.
One of the 12 people at the meeting said they received funds from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but it was not previously to have received funds from the Philip Morris International cigarette company.
No information was given about how the panel members were selected but some of them included some known giants of the e-cigarette that they the industrial fund in the article.
Some other persons prepared for the meeting are not recognized for their expertise in tobacco control.
The person responsible for tobacco at PHE also attended the meeting.
McKee and Capewell wrote that the group’s research paper “effectively” acknowledged that “the lack of concrete evidence of the damage of most products according to many criteria.”
However, no of these links or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
MCKee and Capewell said it’s too early to claim that “there’s no evidence that e-cigarette is a transition to smoking for children or non-smokers.”
Prof Kevin Fenton, Head of Health and Wellbeing at PHE, said the claims at BMJ were answered in advance.
He said, “E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking.”
One in two people who have been smoking a lifetime dies from this addiction.
All evidence indicates that the health risks caused by e-cigarettes are small compared to those caused by e-cigarettes, but we should continue to examine their long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty: to inform the public of what the evidence shows and does not show, in a period with a lot of confusion about its harm when compared with tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people per year die from a cigarette-related disease and smoking costs £2 billion per year to NHS.
We fulfill our national responsibility by clearly revealing the existing evidence - that e-cigarettes carry only a small portion of the damage caused by smoking, although they are not risky.
Previous Channel 4 chief says BBC should leave EastEnders
Previous Channel 4 chairman Luke Johnson said BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice, and said advertising competitors could “give their right arms” for hit programs like Albert Square series.
Johnson said the license fee should only be used to make programs that are not made by other British publishers.
He criticized the BBC for placing public service programs on channels like BBC4, which are likely to be watched by a smaller group of viewers, against their competitors’ most-rating field programs in valuable intervals.
After BBC’s chief executive Tony Hall said the agency wanted to cooperate more with other organizations; Johnson said it was failed to try it for six years at his time on Channel 4 to build a connection with BBC.
Johnson told the Lord's Chamber Communications Committee during a BBC's future query, "I'm struggling with the idea that the BBC will clearly order and publish programs that can be shown by non-subsidious competitors."
If you continue to apply the license fee I’m not sure that it’s a good idea in the medium or long term, the output should be reduced at least to programs that others don’t do or do not order.
The Voice is broadcast in the primetime range because they want to provide as broad support as possible in the future.
The main idea here is based on the idea that no one else will publish that is ridiculous and obviously foolish.
Johnson said: "I don't understand why programs that can be funded without assistance should be funded with a reduced tax rate.
The Voice is one, and EastEnders is another, and it is actually made within the company.
To be honest, the other channels give their right arm for this.
I’m looking forward to seeing how public services are.
I don’t think that’s going to be the BBC.
Johnson, a series of entrepreneurs who managed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused him of pursuing the BBC’s ranking “for the awareness of people working here and because these employees see this approach as the best way to guarantee long-term support.”
BBC's comments on the most popular programs repeat the comments of former Sky manager Tony Ball, who used the MacTaggart course in Edinburgh in 2003 to offer BBC to sell its programs like EastEnders.
Johnson said BBC's more suitable public service programs went to BBC4 and there will not be a viewing measurement here but they will receive tax forgiveness and they will be able to discuss to continue their demonstrated religious tasks on providing ground for £4 billion in the license income, adding: "We are, of course, doing all these silic programs that no one has watched."
They put them in a vacuum that no one will ever see.
About the license fee, Johnson said to the committee: “I invite you to find a more regressive system for those who benefit best from it.
Of course, you all think, we all think, 150 pounds per year is a big value, but I wonder if the reason they do so is for people with 150 pounds a big money that they don’t watch too much on the BBC.
David Elstein, the former Sky and Channel 5 manager, who presented evidence to the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should review the Reithian mission to “information, training and entertainment”.
He said that some of the BBC’s output is now officially classified as education – that’s 1% of the TV output and 0.1% of the radio output – and that public service broadcasts in Australia and Canada should be the forefront of it and that it should be changed to “information, illumination and training”.
As for partnerships, Elstein said that the BBC should do something about a few prom showed on TV and cooperate with advertising publishers to ensure that all of them are watched online.
"Sonogenetic" allows brain cells to be controlled by sound waves
In the video, you can see how the thread wolves change their direction as soon as they are shot with sound vibrations.
Scientists have grown wolves with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by sound wave explosions.
The small thread wolves change their direction as soon as they are shot with sound vibrations in the darkness that people can’t hear.
The vibrations are operated by activating genetically modified motor nerve cells to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasonic waves.
Researchers read and write brain activity with light
The researchers said wolves proved the strength of a new procedure called Sonogenetics, so that an ultrasound can be used to activate a series of brain, heart and muscle cells from outside the body.
A researcher from the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian Sreekanth Chalasani that this procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, which is an intervening procedure that gives electrical vibrations into the brain of people to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.
The slang wolves often do not react beyond the sound, but Chalasani found that they react when they were surrounded by a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
The bubbles they find strengthens the ultrasonic waves and thus enables wolves to pass through.
Fortified ultrasonic waves affect structures found in the membranes of some wolf cells and called TRP-4 ion channels.
According to a report published in Nature Communications, sound waves allow these ion channels to open and activate the cells to which they are connected.
In order to create trans-sound-controlled thread wolves, Chalasani genetically modified the wolves in such a way that some motor neurons can carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When it is applied to altered creatures over-audio, the sound waves are reinforced by micro-bags and transmitted into the wolves and also running motor neurons that are altered here.
This procedure is similar to optogenetics, which is an outbreaking instrument that allows scientists to run and close the neurons with light vibrations.
But Chalasani says that sonogenetics may have some advantages against this technique.
Unlike the light that needs to be sent along an optical fiber to the desired point within the brain, low-frequency cross-waves can easily pass through the tissue and thus be sent into the brain through the cap.
Chalasani "we believe that using genotherapy and a therapeutic virus, human neurons targeted in the clinical environment for certain neurological treatments can be temporarily made sensitive to trans-audio signals," he said.
He also added that other applications may focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells.
Unlawful torture equipment – at your full door!
Advertisements Disrupt Britain's Weapons Trade
Watch the video of the International Amnesty International’s anti-armament exhibition.
The terrible drone killer!
Those who break their legs!
Parts of bombs!
And the electric shock cops that cause severe pain but leave no trace!
The fine audio and cartoon images produced for the International Amnesty International, prepared to emphasize the British government’s desire to sell weapons to the oppressive regimes through the Defense and Security Equipment International at the ExCel Center in London, do not leave any doubt that the world’s largest weapons exhibition is a sharp fraud.

But a different campaign also continues with the posters on bus stops and metro trains and requires to look twice.
In one, using the fonts and the brand of the London Metro, the DLR line is converted into a tank, saying, "An important announcement, will you travel in the DLR between 15-18 September?"
This September, a crowd of weapons sellers will attack the DLR... Customers are asked to help stop this weapons exhibition.
300 poster from the artists exhibiting works at Bansky's Dismaland's Museum of Evil Designs.
A collective, called the Private Circuit Group, helped it to be distributed using the “Ad-Shock Packages” which amounted to £6 and claimed that “the world’s bus stop advertising sites have accessed about one-third of them.”
Transport to London was not satisfied with this poster's "vandalism".
One of the Advertisements was created by the Special Devriye Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, the curator of Malign Designs and professor at Essex University, artists are becoming more questionable every day and are looking for ways to bring political work to the crowds outside the galleries.
Many artists move together with activists in protest movements and begin to realize that their art needs to come out to the real world to have an impact on society.
Another anti-arm trade poster is also facing those travelling in the subway.
The Amnesty International’s video was viewed by more than 100,000 people on Facebook within 24 hours and was created by the free-working VCCP advertising agency, and the graphic designer and audio artist were also free of charge.
VCCP's creative director Matt Lever was very surprised by the silence against the weapons exhibitions ads - with empty space in the ExCel calendar - and thought: "Let's present them a campaign they try to escape."
They played with the idea of making a more realistic, intelligent corporate advertising, but "they were decorated with bright colors and animation, it became more remarkable."
Tom Davies, from the Amnesty International, said: “They helped us greatly to create concerns about the sale of illegal torture equipment at the Forum.”
Now we need the British government to take action to prevent the illegal sale of torture equipment in front of our door.
Per the most creative art at the weapon exhibition comes from the interior ExCeL, where exhibitors sell fantastic covered products.
In a press release, Saab showed the order of the U.S. army of "the AT4CS RS launched from the armor".
In it there is "a single-shaped and targeted battle head, which strikes a big blow through the arms."
Whatever it does, it will not be nice.
Eight Golden Rules of Living in Student Houses
It’s been 11 years that I’ve moved to my student home as an uninterested 19-year-old, and I’m still believing in the barrel and moral proportionality, but now I remember the stunning smile of what I’m disturbing – and the countless long-term complaints about others.
Most of what I learned can be damaged in eight golden rules.
Moving home can be seen from nervous discomfort to completely scary.
The excitement of humility: where people are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are, where they are.
Take a breath.
And let the others take one - ask questions and show excitement.
This will guide the conversation and help you separate what you like from the people you don’t talk, even if your worms are burned and they’re burning the firefighter.
Leave a little space to people.
People’s rooms are often converted into drinking receptions, cinema nightspaces, and public settings, but these are also places where people wear and place their indoor clothes.
Interested: Do not even think of starting a relationship to the university
They are badly treated at the university.
Your room may be a place of insiva, but many domestic corridors develop the intercourse culture and this is friendly, social and open to lifelong friendship.
This could be hell for someone trying to store energy.
Nothing in culture will allow you to say, “I like you and I want our friendship to continue, but I need you to go a little so that I can put on the energy I’ve spent while communicating with you.”
Try to realize that a friend is tired of socializing and maybe send a message instead of stealing the door.
When the door is stolen, do it.
A friend in the student’s home had acquired a policy as if the door was not locked, he was invited to enter.
He saw a lot of things.
Do not make friends through cooking.
Since you started to university at the heights of the madness of the food competition, it will be less strange to introduce yourself by stealing people’s doors with a plate brownie and less than the 1950s “Welcome to our neighborhood, I’ve cooked something for you, now I’ll smile when you ask personal questions.”
Providing home-made gifts to people is a great way to get friends.
Home friends will feel compelled to talk and may associate your face with a sweet surprise.
Of course, this is about being a skilled chef.
A well unmixed bulk bulk, sugar and oil, will cause people to make the imitation of sleeping when you shout the door.
Theft of food is a common crime in students’ homes.
Obviously it’s a steal to steal someone’s chicken but it’s a steal to get a few drops of milk for your tea.
Check the owner twice.
Even if you are swimming in, it will tell you to look at your own remedy.
It is very uncomfortable that someone steals their stuff and I understand you—but try to deal with it more mature than my cousin.
He is now in prison.
Do not make noise to prevent people from sleeping or studying.
This doesn’t just mean to be a right person, but because you’re insans in glass houses.
A girl in my corridor pressed the neighbor on the side and said it was the 3rd of the night because it was the hour of the night and she was the morning exam.
The responses were more open.
Finally, when they closed at 5 a.m. the girl gently allowed them to sleep for two hours before they went to their three-hour exam, opening their own music and closing the door.
Would it not be romantic to move your future wife to the same corridor with you?
In the contrary, is it not so strange that you misunderstand a corridory friend and think you’re your future wife, and you’re forced to sit down, leave and see her every day, and you’re forced to watch your fellow friends get imprisoned?
Of course, that’s good, but if your hot corridor neighbor is definitely not your future spouse, at least talk to a little and advise the wisdom.
When in a joyful moment you realize that someone has left the keys inside without locking the door, know that the line between joking and persecution to someone is thinner than you thought.
A good joke is fun but it will take time to go back.
You can give someone a valuable and fun lesson about safety by hiding their stuff – but never contaminate someone’s room with shampoo and toothpaste.
Close your doors and put your keys in a glass of water in the freezer but don’t stick your items more than twice on the roof.
Chairman of the National Assembly of Immigrants to the Netherlands
Arib, who won the highest vote in the fourth round of the parliament, became the first immigrant parliamentary chairman of the Netherlands.
Arib, who also has Moroccan citizenship, will take this task until 2017.
Arib has been a member of the parliament since 1998, but has not been elected as president in 2012.
A surprise to the cloud!
G.SARAY's supporters did not peace the star and the last offer to Hope Cloud, who has a moral disorder due to the protests of the tribunes in the last matches, came from Eskişehirspor.
He lost this position, he wanted to leave the game!
In the transfer period of Ryan Donk made his last step for the national goalkeeper in which Kasimpaşa also wanted to join the team.
However, the red black people were given a negative response by the G.Saray administration.
The heart stopped when it was beautiful.
The mother of two children living in RIO DA JANEIRO, Raquel Santos (28), went to an aesthetic doctor on Monday to remove the traces caused by laughter on the edges of the mouth.
The woman injected the filling material in her face, after a while, has accelerated her heartbeat and breathing.
After the heart stopped, he lost his life.
Police are investigating whether the drug "Potenay" that the woman uses daily has played a role in the death.
The true cause of death will be revealed after the autopsy.
The model's closest friend, Debora Azevedo, told the Brazilian press in a statement that Santos, one of his seven and two 13-year-old sons, was engaged in aesthetic surgery.
Santos was the second to participate in the most important beauty competition in Brazil in December to Musa do Brazil.
Oil companies officially collapse.
Since 2014, when oil prices began to fall, some $400 billion investment has been delayed until the end of last year, the deepwater oil search projects have been suspended.
According to research by consulting company Wood Mackenzie, low oil prices have led to the suspension of a $380 billion project in oil and gas search/production, while millions of barrels of production have been delayed from the Gulf of Mexico to Africa, in a wide geography.
As the biggest reason for the cost cuts, the oil prices dropped to the lowest level in 12 years in the summer of 2014 at the level of $115 and lost a value of 70 per cent in 1.5 years, according to the report, “the company’s budgets have dramatically cut down.”
$400 billion in cash
The price of crude oil has made new surprises every day, and it has last dropped below $30 seeing its lowest level in the last 12 years.
"Is Petroleum Falling to $15?"; "Is Petroleum Now Cheap Than Water" discussions are burning today, the research published by energy consulting company Wood Mackenzie shows how the industry is affected by the falling prices.
Lastly, in a report published in July, Wood Mackenzie, who revealed that the falling oil prices led to the suspension of $200 billion’s 46 major energy investments, in his new research reveals where this figure was reached by the end of 2015.
According to this, 22 major projects have been delayed in the last six months of 2015, while a total of 68 major projects have been suspended since 2014 when the crash began.
The value of these projects is approximately $400 billion.
2.9 million barrels per day
The study stressed that the impact of low oil prices on the company’s plans was “acustic” and that the most affected projects were deep sea development projects.
The suspended projects amount to a total of 27 billion barrels of raw oil equivalent, while the daily production of 2.9 million barrels by 2025 is thus delayed.
According to the study, the final investment decision of most of these projects is delayed after 2017 and after, while the first production targets are recorded between 2020 and 2023.
Among the 68 project delayed, the report emphasizes the potential investment of $170 billion expected to be made in the next 5 years, "the majority of $170 billion are deep sea projects."
This is because the price of the investment is very high.
“70 percent of deep sea spending is primarily oil-focused projects in Nigeria, Angola and the U.S. in the Gulf of Mexico.”
According to the study, the countries with the most delayed oil project stocks are Canada, Angola, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, Norway and the United States.
These six countries have 90 percent of the delayed liquid (petrol) reserves.
The countries with the highest amount of delayed gas reserves, Mozambique, Australia, Malaysia and Indonesia, together, make up 85 percent of the total.
While the majority of the natural gas that awaits its output is located in the deep sea, it requires complex and expensive development solutions, such as building a zero-fluidized natural gas (LNG) facility.
The most dangerous companies are the deep sea, the Canadian oil sand and the Khazarian oil giants, while the companies are trying to adapt to the “longer and lower” oil prices scenario.
The eyes in Iran
Nearly four years ago there was the following picture: the United States and Europe had brought embargo on Iran's oil to stop Tehran's nuclear program, the barrel price of oil was about $110 and it was discussed how to limit Iran's oil exports without causing a sudden jump in prices.
When we go back this week, we see a different scenario.
For the first time since 2004, oil prices saw $30 gold, the main reason for this was the U.S. production explosion and the embargo on Iran is being lifted.
The eyes are on Iran.
If Iran increases its oil exports, more oil will flow to the oil market, which is already quite saturated.
This could cause prices to fall below the levels that surprised us today.
Some analysts say that Saudi Arabia, which does not want to make a market share to Iran, will pump more oil and that there could be a price war between Iran and Saudi Arabia.
It is noted that the main target of Iran is Asia’s fast-growing oil market India and its former partners in Europe.
In their previous statements, Iranian officials said they intended to increase exports by 500 thousand barrels a day in the first stage and to market a lot more after a while.
According to Reuters' map information, 22 very large crude oil carriers (VLCCs) are waiting in Iran, while at least 13 of them are full or large amounts.
Iran is the fourth largest in the world with proven oil reserves.
Thanks to the Exceptions, Iran still exports approximately 1 million barrels of crude oil to some countries including Turkey.
Earlier, Iran’s daily oil exports amounted to 3 million barrels per day.
Aysun Göksu, a research expert in support values, responds to the question whether oil will fall below $20: “China-based global growth concerns raise downward pressure on commodity prices while deepening the loss in oil prices.”
China, the world’s largest oil importer, is concerned that oil demand will decrease in parallel with economic slowdown, and we see that oil losses have reached 20 percent since Christmas.
In addition, due to the global value gain of the dollar and the problem of global supply excess, we may see prices below $30 in the coming days.
Unless we see permanent prices above the $32-33 levels, the rise movement in oil may remain limited and downward pressure may increase.
At this point, it can be said that closures below the critical $30 level have a key role in continuing downs.
In such a case, it should not be surprising to see relaxations lasting until 23.30-25.60 support zone on the bottom side.
Isham Sardouk: “The angel’s age is over!”
While taking the mission of trend creativity at Victoria's Secret and WGSN, which determines the world's fashion flows, why did you turn the route to Turkey?
I always take care of change.
I was born in Paris, I lived in London, then I went to New York.
I took important positions there.
During this time, I have started giving advice to Koton over the past two years.
Then I saw the potential in this geography and in the Koton brand.
I realized that in the world age there was everything necessary to be a store chain.
I am here to do this now.
Will you succeed in a short time?
of course.
Although it is a young brand, it is already sold in 50 countries.
We issue 50 collections per year, there are 15 separate sections.
There is everything a shop chain needs to have.
From Dubai to Moscow, we can meet the needs of consumers in different regions.
We are now opening a store in Paris in March, which is the beginning of a new and exciting period.
Do you need to open a store in Paris?
and yes.
It’s not because Europe’s economic situation is great.
But you open some stores for the image.
You will be a store in fashion capitals like Paris, London, and you will make money from the Middle East.
One adds prestige to the brand, the other adds money, both are necessary for a brand that plays globality.
Let’s talk about the trends...
There is a very romantic and elegant season.
Flying shiphon clothes, soft tones, pink, white, red.
The drawings...
We are going through very difficult and cruel times, and the fashion world is also trying to add a bit of happiness to life in these difficult times, always bringing stylish interior designs to the podium.
This is what we do as well.
That’s why the new season is coming back.
Let’s go back to Victoria’s Secret.
Who was the most legendary angel?
I’m not just talking about her wonderful physics: she’s so positive, so good girl!
When I was working, he was sitting next to me, “My dear, you’re hungry.”
He was so sweet.
You know why I’m talking about it, and I’ve searched and interviewed all the Victoria’s Secret models.
How beautiful is Caroline, right?
But Adriana Lima has impressed me with her beauty.
Yes, that is the sound.
That speech, that tune...
You say to the man after a while, "Sitting on one side and look beautiful, do nothing else!"
It brings nerve.
That is the shock that is happening.
I had an interview with Candice Swanepoel.
She was the most beautiful girl I’ve seen in my life, but I was scared in the face of her emptiness.
Most are so now.
The new angels are not the same as before.
I remember the time of Gisele.
Working with him was too difficult.
He went to the hall and smoked like a beef.
Not because it is Tirana.
No one can drink, only one can drink.
Make a “diva” fee.
The Victoria's Secret show, released two months ago, got the lowest rating in history.
Why do you think?
As I said, the time of the beautiful angels is over.
Who is Gigi Hadid?
What is beautiful?
Kendall Jenner is like a tree.
There is nothing, there is nothing.
Kate Moss's curves are also zero but it became the biggest name in the fashion industry.
But how beautiful his face was.
I want to use my right of objection.
I made an interview last year, his face was a lot broken.
- So much to smoke, drink, now it has become ugly, of course.
He had a beautiful face in the nine.
His lips were like Brigitte Bardot.
It was the end of the supermodel period.
Linda Evangelista, Naomi Campbell and Christy Turlington.
Christy was my side neighbor and I saw it without makeup every morning.
That kind of beauty, that kind of beauty cannot be.
What about Cara Delevingne?
He loses himself.
There is no place in every campaign.
People are tired.
There is no hunger for famous models, celebrity, like before.
People like themselves, want to see real faces in the campaigns.
We will go on it too.
This is the trend.
Letter from 25 Turkish writers
According to the BBC Turkey, the International Writers’ Association (PEN) presidents in Britain, Wales and Scotland, including writers, said that threats and physical attacks targeting their colleagues, journalists and publishers in Turkey have become a normal part of life.
In the letter, two attacks targeting the Hürriyet newspaper in Turkey, with the pressure of the Koza group and the arrest of Vice News journalists, the investigations and the arrest of journalists were also among the worrying developments.
Mother's right to half work
Turkish-Business "We believe that mothers are given half-working right to regain rental labour."
"This may be a truva horse," TISK said, "We are worried if this arrangement will be in favour of women will prevent women from working."
The new rights planned to be brought after birth or childbirth to officials and workers women workers passed through the commission with full-day talks.
6 months after birth, part-time work or free leave, the regulations that bring the possibility of part-time work until the child goes to the primary school age, the most common issue in the commission talks was "leasing labor".
If the child goes to primary school, the part of the work is correct, but some concerns are experienced by the CHP Izmir MP Musa Çam said, "If you bring the rental labor arrangement behind this, we will be against it until the end."
Enis Bağdadioğlu, who participated in the talks on behalf of the Turkish-Business Commission, also expressed similar concerns, "We have doubts about how the place of the female worker will be filled in half-time work."
Bagdadioğlu said that new problems will occur if the rental work is re-established with this occasion, "we will therefore watch the developments related to the private employment offices with concern."
The TISK Secretary-General Bülent Pirler said that the law brought partial work for a period of five years, "There is no such long-term partial work in other countries."
Look at the event as well.
"Where there are 1 or 2 employees, we need to consider the results of this application."
TOBB client Ahmet Şağar also said that if the application passes to life, there will be trouble finding workers.
She said that there is no legislation on the rules to be applied in part-time work, "the regulation on the private employment offices must be made, the agreement between the worker and the employer."
Feyzoğlu: We don’t support
Feyzioğlu said: "We do not agree with this statement, we cannot join and support it."
There is no criticism of the PKK.
You could not say anything negative to the PKK, even a phrase to the divisive terrorist organization, you didn’t put the dust on it.
Only and only the heavy statements imposed on the state, we do not consider seriously and do not find sincere, taking into account those who impose them.
We are lawyers, we are lawyers.
If the representatives of the state, the public officials, the security forces in this framework behave unlawfully, we will follow it.
When we say "Don't destroy the state" to the remains of the romantic conflict that look to the divisors or divisors with sympathy, they attack us as "divide, fascist".
“This state must act according to the law, it must always keep the law above,” they say, “You are dividing.”
We are a bridge.
We are always obliged to say the truth.

Who is Bergen?
He was born in Mersin on July 16, 1960.
With the divorce of her mother and father, she settled in 1966 in Ankara with her mother Sebahat Çakır.
After Yenimahalle Yunus Emre Primary School, Ankara State Conservatory entered the piano department but left because of financial difficulties and fascinated his age and worked in PTT for a while.
In 1979 he accepted the offer he received for his work after he came to the stage at the Feyman Night Club where he went to have fun with his friends.
In the Feyman Night Club, together with the Group Lokomotive Orchestra, he performed with repertoires consisting of Turkish Art Music, Turkish Light Music and the fashion of the time.
Bergen went to Adana for business after Ankara, where he met Halis Serbes and married a year later.
In 1982, he released the first longplay of Atlas Plak, "I have a complaint."
Bergen, who was unable to tolerate the violence of his husband while his outcome in the art life continued, fled his wife many times.
In October 1982, when he worked in Izmir, his husband was shot in his face.
Bergen, who lost his one eye in this attack and burned a large part of his body, was convinced by the composer of the song "Who Can?" who celebrated Kibariye after treatment, Cengiz Özşeker, and brought him to the stage.
Until 1985, the artist who took the stage in Izmir Pırlanta Pavyon, which was owned by Özşeker, together with his boss prepared a demo record called "Brother's Fate" and sent it to Yaşar Kekeva.
Kekeva, who liked Bergen, invited the artist to Istanbul.
The artist who released the first professional longplay on the Istanbul music market, "Insan Severse" under the music directory of Burhan Bayar, became famous with "The Woman of the Suffers" in late 1986.
The album was awarded in April 1987 with the title "1986's album Most Selling Arabic Woman Artist" with the Golden Plak and Golden Caset.

He was buried in Mersin.
Bergen has a short life of 29 years with 5 longplay and 129 songs in 11 recordings and a video film.

They will be removed by bicycle.
However, as there is no deal between the two countries, most Syrian refugees will be forced to return to Russia by turning pedals at less than 20 degrees this time.
Because it was safer and cheaper in the summer, a group of refugees went to Russia by plane and passed from Murmansk to Norway.
As the agreement between the two countries did not allow migrants to cross the border as pedestrian, they crossed the border by bicycle.
Norway has now decided to return these refugees.
The Norwegian security agency has ordered repairs of missing bicycles when they crossed the border.
The EU crisis "three billion euros to Turkey"
Turkey is in the crisis of 3 billion euros committed to refugees.
European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has criticized Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s blocking the fund to be transferred to Turkey.
Juncker pointed out that the mood between Italy and the rest of Europe is not good, and pointed out that the EU must find 3 billion euros.
Juncker said, “This money is not for Turkey, but for Syrian refugees in Turkey.”
We have not yet reached 3 billion.
“It’s a matter of the EU’s reliability, so it’s important.”
Juncker said he expected the money to be completed until January 26, which is the date previously given.
Italy is among the countries with a positive attitude when it comes to Turkey.
Diplomatic sources believe that Rome’s position on the financial package is not a move directly towards Turkey and is linked to the problems between Italy and the EU Commission and some EU countries.
There have been tensions between Italy and the EU for a long time.
At and after the last EU summit on energy, banking and migrants, Renzi continued to criticize Germany’s Prime Minister Angela Merkel and the EU in a strong language.
Juncker, who criticized Renzi’s attitude at a press conference yesterday, said “Renzi should stop accusing the EU.”
"Renzi, who I love him very much, is wrong to humiliate the EU Commission at every opportunity."
Juncker indicated that Renzi was playing for the internal public.
The €1 billion of the €3 billion promised to Turkey will be covered by the EU budget.
2 billion Euros will be made from the Member States’ budgets.
Germany will contribute at least 427 million euros.
The Rom Government, which has announced that it will not transfer money to Turkey for political reasons, has agreed to transfer its share of €2.3 million to the EU budget for support to Jordan and Lebanon.
The resource is expected to be used in the period 2016-2017.
I was crying when I saw the Chalie Hebdo cartoon.
Father Abdullah Kurdi, who spoke to the Russian official news agency Sputnik, reacted strongly and said, "If you want the truth, I was crying for this cartoon."
“I felt very bad.”
Father Kurdi, who said he expected positive things from the French magazine Charlie Hebdo, which became a symbol of freedom of expression after the armed attack, said:
They made a bad cartoon.
Everyone was very sad about this cartoon.
She was a two-year-old boy and died.
Aylan, I and my family had to be respected by Charlie Hebdo, but it was the opposite.
The children who died in this magazine must respect people.
The Prophet published an unrespectful cartoon about our Lord.
They made publications on God.
It is a little thing done to my child before God and the Prophet.
The Kurdish, who lived in Erbil, said: “I call all the world and the magazine of humor, all the children who died should be respected.”
Their families should not suffer from their suffering.
Aylan Kurdi's hall living in Canada, Tima Kurdi, was also one of the reactors to the cartoon.
Laurent 'Riss' Sourisseau has the imagery that when the 3-year-old Syrian Aylan Kurdi, who shot his dead body on the Bodrum coast, grows up, he may be 'one of the tortureers in Germany'.
The French humor magazine Charlie Hebdo, who was attacked by a radical religious killing of 12 people due to the publication of Muhammad's cartoons last year, was again the center of the discussions because of the cartoons on Aylan Kurdi.
In the cartoon, mainly in the German city of Cologne, as in the women’s harassment during Christmas celebrations, the pig faces that pursue women and the harassers calling immigrants were painted.
The cartoon that causes different reactions on social media is actually part of a 4 square column.
On the column it writes "This is not France" and according to many readings, the increasing hostility of refugees is criticized along with the other lost values of France.
On the other hand, the cartoon has nevertheless caused many people to accuse Charlie Hebdo of racism.
The Charlie Hebdo magazine criticized the unwilling attitude of France to open the doors to migrants while overcoming Germany, which was also agreed to receive 800,000 refugees in a number published last year.
The cartoon said "He was very close to his goal," while the advertising poster wrote "Two children's menu at a price."
Autopsy of the Germans who died in Sultanahmet
According to the weekly Der Spiegel magazine’s website, the German Federal Prosecutor’s Office has decided to bring 10 people who died in the attack to Germany.
The funeral of the dead will be welcomed by an aircraft of the German Air Force today or tomorrow in the country and in the airport.
In Germany, experts from the Identification Commission associated with the Federal Criminal Office (BKA), which is responsible for judicial medical procedures, are going to the countries where the incident occurred for German citizens who died in accidents or attacks in normal conditions, identifying and autopsing there.
But the Der Spiegel magazine said this time the situation would be different.
According to the journal, officials from the Federal Criminal Office appealed to the Turkish authorities for the identification and autopsy of the dead in Istanbul but the Turkish authorities did not accept this proposal.
The Federal Criminal Office sent four experts to Istanbul after the attack in Istanbul.
Seven German tourists injured in the attack are being hospitalized.
Ellen Meiksins Wood has died.
Meiksins Wood, a well-known political theorist and socialist historian, was in mind with his important work on the origins of capitalism.
Meiksins Wood, born in New York in 1942, also published in Turkish: Escape from the Class -- The Archaeological Culture of Capitalism -- Capitalism Against Democracy -- Origin of Capitalism -- Capital Empire -- Return to Marx.
Prohibition of swimming pool for refugees
According to the German press, the municipality will remove the ban if it is informed that the message of the ban is understood by refugees.
In a statement to the WDR, social apartment officer Markus Schnapka noted that the municipality did not want to punish the innocent because of the behavior of several people, said they informed the residents in three languages about the values of importance in Germany.
Schnapka noted that they do not discuss the value of gender equality that Germany is concerned, adding that the municipality will punish any kind of attack and harassment.
On the other hand, the Carnival Trail in Rheinberg was cancelled due to the possibility of abuse scandals in Cologne in the upcoming carnival passes.
The municipality announced that the carnival pass was cancelled because there was no guarantee that the torture events would not occur.
What are the benefits of cooking in steam?
The cooking technique, which is a technique that does not kill the vitamins and minerals in the foods, is becoming increasingly popular.
For centuries, steam cooking, one of the most popular cooking techniques in the Far East, strengthens metabolism and facilitates digestion.
With this method that completely eliminates problems such as independence, the bacteria and microbes in the food are also completely dead.
Substances in the diet, such as protein, cellulose, and niches, are completely diluted with this technique, making the food softer.
Cooking in steam at low pressure; it is performed in the pot with the help of steam containers or steam machine.
When cooking at high pressure, the amount of water used and the cooking time are short.
This can be shown as the best example of cooking in a bottle.
In particular, to cook foods such as vegetables in the diet menus, you should first wash the vegetables thoroughly and then put them in the shell and wait for them to be smooth.
A deep pot is filled with water in a third percentage and the steam is placed in the pot.
The mouth is left half closed.
This makes it easy to get the steam out of the tank.
The January fire is first brought to the highest level and the water is boiled, then the January fire is brought to a lower level and a fixed heat is obtained.
The vegetables and foods cooked in the steam for about 10 to 15 minutes, after well cooked, are controlled with the help of the steam.
The cooked vegetables are taken from the oven and served by placing them in tables.
In the steam cooking technique, the appearance, color and smell of the food does not change, so this method is healthy.
The taste of the food remains the same.
The quality and taste of the food will not be damaged.
In cooking in steam, which is also one of the most economical cooking methods, nutrition loss is also kept at the lowest level.
The vegetables cooked in steam also offer a satisfying party to the eating with their more vibrant and vibrant appearance.
This method is often preferred, especially because it is lightweight.
David Bowie - Blackstar: The Alien's Last Album
Knowing that you’re going to die; making that last album without saying it to anyone, making the death bed, an artistic expression area in the clip you’re drawing...
Things like this; we may seem too "in the air" for worldwide fans.
I say the world fan because I am among those who are deeply believing that the man who does this is both immortal and alien.
He had come to our world from another corner of the universe; now he has returned to his homeland; this is what is happening.
It came because there was an inspiration to be given to all the world artists, not only to Kiss, Marilyn Manson or Lady Gaga.
He completed his task well.
David Bowie, Blackstar, iTunes Price: $9.99 5/5
He was probably fed from Warhol, Kubrick, who was from the same planet with him.
When Apollo 11 landed on the moon, he decided to say, “Is that something I’m an alien?” and interfered with us by saying, “Space Oddity.”
It wasn’t really mistaken; it always went a few steps ahead.
Many people found the ways they lost.
The musician and the listener.
If we leave his interest in plastic arts, his acting at some point, it’s unfair to say “It’s just music” for his music.
The characters that flow from the song to the song and personally created; their sendings, innovation, tabudevireness and discography represent an artistic integrity for me.
I can't mention himself as the glam rock's father or the punk's cousin.
If so, what will happen to those avant-garde electronic movements, which have been hidden as love in them since childhood?
David Bowie reminded us of what the word meant until the years we swallowed the icon in our mouth.
It was not a man, it was not a woman, it was not a man.
It was a body.
It appeared to us for a time due to a mission.
The body left this world two days after the 26th studio album "Blackstar" was released.
He tried to practice us with "Blackstar" and "Lazarus" we heard before the album was released.
We thought, “It’s old now, it’s talking about death,” he was aware of everything.
Another last game...
The album's messaging and emotional burden, except for the amazing "Blackstar" and "Lazarus", was released far earlier, but the recorded "Sue (Or In A Season Of Crime)", "Tis A Pity She Was A Whore" and the number of songs we know was fourth when the album was released.
The rest, “Girl Loves Me”, “I Can’t Give Everything Away” and “Dollar Days” are also very good songs.
When we look at it in full, it is built on a very strong musical structure but a so honest, instant sensations like "Blackstar".
Neither death nor an album of “conting with the past”.
It’s just a real “first” album.
From the beginning to the end of the music life.
Turkey attacked Sultanahmet
The head of the German Federal Security Office, Holger Münch, said in a program on the first German channel ARD on Tuesday about the attack on the Sultanahmet Square that killed 10 German citizens.
Munich said the target of the attack was not German citizens, but Turkey.
400 people in the sight.
But Munch said the Sultanahmet attack did not change the threat of terrorism in Germany, "We are still under a threat to be taken seriously."
Munich noted that the number of people from Germany to Syria to join ISIS was a decline, and that a large number of people returned from war zones.
Munch said, “There are 400 dangerous people that we should not keep under surveillance at the moment.”
Munich has called for improved coordination and closer communication between police officers in Europe.
Turkish officials said the live bomb organizing the Sultanahmet attack was a Syrian citizen and a member of ISIS, while German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the identity of the attacker was not yet identified.
Sezen Aksu says goodbye to the scenes
Sezen Aksu, who decorated his 40th year with a concert series, fascinated his lovers with his "Sezen's Years" concert on the Volkswagen Arena yesterday night.
The first episode, the last round of the concert series held in July, took place at the Volkswagen Arena on 15-16 January.
Aksu brought all the audience to a 40-year journey from yesterday to today.
In addition to his love songs that touched our personal lives, Aksu spoke his songs on social issues that closely concern our country and our world.
After making the concerts he promised he would say goodbye to the stage life, Aksu regretted his fans.
In the "Sezenli Years" concert, Sezen Aksu appeared in front of the lovers who filled the Volkswagen Arena with a separate story in each piece.
Each story, show, light and stage show took the viewers to different periods.
In the last part of the unforgettable concert, a video show was also made with the paintings of Revolution Erbil in Istanbul.
Aksu also visited them for the first time on the stage by placing the videos their fans previously recorded.
In Ankara and Istanbul, the bread increased by £25
In Ankara, from yesterday, 250 grams of bread increased by 25 pounds, starting to be sold from 1 TL.
Before the new year, especially in December, on the rumors about the "future increase in the bread" the Minister of Food, Agriculture and Animals Faruk Steel and the Minister of Customs and Trade Bülent Tüfenkci made statements in the form of "No time".
However, in the capital Ankara, 250 grams of bread were sold for 1 TL yesterday.
The President of the Turkish Federation of Frogs, Halil Ibrahim Balcı, on the increase of 25 pounds from the bread, said: "Zam was not done, 2 years ago the tariff decision began to apply," and added:
“This was a decision taken two years ago.”
The Association of Commercial Rooms established this tariff two years ago.
This is a price applied throughout Turkey.
There is a new rise and there is no rise in price.
But due to the competition, the trade in some regions of Ankara was sold for 75 pounds.
In some areas, it was already sold for 1 TL.
The price of the bread was not lowered, but the price of the bread was not lowered, because of the competition they had to apply 1 TL.
There is no increase or increase.
They apply the unapplicated price.
"In the first half of 2016 the price of a kilogram of bread will definitely not exceed 5 TL and if we don't experience a very big trouble, we'll finish the year with this price."
In some areas of Istanbul, bread was sold for 1.25 TL.
This time, Burkina Faso was killed by terrorists.
Attack on a luxury hotel in Burkina Faso, West Africa, which is known to be preferred by foreigners and UN officials, killed 23 people from 18 different countries.
The attack was carried out by the north African arm of al-Qaeda.
The attack in Burkina Faso took place four days after the terrorist attack in the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta, the world’s most crowded Muslim country with a population of 250 million.
Foreign embassy, luxury hotels and shops in a working street at a Starbucks branch and police station during the day-to-day bombing and armed attacks killed a Canadian and an Indonesian.
Indonesian officials said the attackers were inspired by the November 13 Paris massacre.
The BBC’s security reporter, Frank Garner, also noted that this act is part of a terrible trend that has emerged in many cities around the world in recent times.
The U.S. was recently killed by terrorist attacks.
Earlier this month, 14 people were killed in a gun attack in San Bernardino, California.
The U.S. attack on San Bernardino
After the live bombing in which 10 German tourists were killed in Sultanahmet, German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere also reminded that there were terror attacks in many parts of the world, "We experienced two major attacks in Paris."
If we say that, then terror will win.
We used the phrase “without going back”.
ISIS leaves Whatsapp and speaks with Alrawi app
According to a new report, the terrorist organization is taking advantage of its own chat tool to communicate independently from chat apps such as ISIS, WhatsApp and Telegram.
According to the Defense One report, the organization is taking advantage of a new messaging application to communicate with each other.
This Android app called "Alrawi" is distributed and installed through an APK file.
The application allows the organization to communicate and share the media in a encrypted way.
Flash Movement in Iraq
The app’s functionality, according to Ghost Security Group, remains “principal” against popular apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram.
It is not yet known how powerful the encryption used is.
The Islamic State had previously performed all the communications through the Telegram app that allowed to send messages through a encrypted connection.
But Telegram revealed the channels that ISIS members spoke about.
In addition, the U.S. government is asking app developers to put back doors on their applications.
That’s why the organization is now starting to use its own solutions instead of relying on the encryption of WhatsApp and Telegram.

How to evaluate semester holidays?
How should students evaluate their semester holidays? the question was asked by the educational specialist-student coach Murat Aydın.
Semester holidays should not only be considered for students; rest, entertainment, spending time in front of television and computer.
Semester holidays are a very important opportunity to prepare for a new period of education and review the past period.
Semester holidays, called free time, are also an important opportunity for personality development, knowledge, skills and hobbies.
Make a semestral evaluation list.
Write everything you are planning and try to do it.
You’ll be sure you’ll enjoy it and spend a very efficient semester.
Now let’s talk about how it should be an efficient master’s period for students who are primarily preparing YGS-LYS.
Because the questions that most come to us from the friends preparing for the YGS-LYS exam are: "How should we evaluate this period, how should we solve a lot of questions or have we missing issues, how should we solve them?"
In order to respond to both these and to spend an efficient period, let us first give advice to friends who are prepared for the exam.
The exam preparation process should be a process that starts from 9th grade under normal conditions, while we are trying to complete it more in the last 1 year, which for us makes the last year more effective, more efficient and more efficient.
The final class student, in addition to the preparation for the exam, also has to conduct the school's written work together.
The graduate student who has completed the school has entered and experienced the exam at least once (YGS-LYS), but the year in which he will be prepared for the exam again as a graduate student is critical for him.
Because most graduate students and their family see the 'O' year as the last chance, and this also causes a greater stress.
Teaching is the work that the student does, not enjoys, just because he feels compulsory, and therefore usually always ends up, but for the students who do it regularly, becoming a habit, it is completely a task and what is always within a plan when to be done.
Now we have a semester vacation in front of us and we have to evaluate it in the best way.
We must have a plan to manage our time well.
Study in a semester vacation:
Everyone should first make a plan in accordance with his own situation.
What is fixed, what is missing, the day, the week and the 15 day time should be scheduled.
During this period, there must be repeated questions and solutions.
At the same time, students who don’t miss a lot can also solve an average of 1-2 trial exam.
Research shows that people forget 75% of what they learn in a week, 66% in a day, and 54% in an hour.
The best and most effective way to eliminate forgetfulness is to repeat it.
In particular, students who make too many mistakes than previous subjects should give general weight to their work again.
Identify your missing topics first and plan the day, put the topics every day and definitely deal with them.
This planning will relax you both academically and psychically.
Be sure that the topics are the topics you make the most mistakes when placing them in your plan.
You will not have such a long vacation time.
Solution of Questions:
It is important to solve questions as much as to repeat them.
Because we can see how much we understand the work we do only through the questions we get through.
Do not forget to put a certain number of questions every day.
The number of questions you’re going to solve may vary according to the work you’re going to do that day; you may not be able to solve a lot of questions in a day you’re going to work on the subject but yet at least we have to do a certain amount of question-solving work in order to see how much we’ve learned about that day.
Resolve the exam:
Another work you will do in a half-year vacation is to solve the exam.
Although all of the subjects are not completed, you can at least make the lesson trial exam solutions.
Let’s say, you’ve done a lot of Turkish lessons; you’ll be able to solve the 40 question-prepared Turkish lessons.
And make it work for time while you do it.
If you can solve the question in 60 minutes at first, your next goal should be solved in a few minutes less if possible.
Vacation and Hobby:
Vacation, of course, does not mean just learning; you have to spend a few days on your vacation, rest and hobbies.
A vacation period that will only be spent with the lesson will prevent you from being dischargeed and resting.
Therefore, you should also have special times to dedicate to yourself within your plans.
Reading books, watching television, surfing on the internet can be within your plans, most importantly, how much time you will spend on.
I will also have a little advice to the friends who have not been able to spend the first time efficiently.
If; my first period didn’t go very well, I couldn’t work a lot and you say that I miss a lot, this semester holiday is a great opportunity for you too.
But first of all, you need to decide and believe it.
In the 2009-2010 season, the top goals were scored between the 76th and 90th minutes.
Now you answer the question you ask yourself, the game is over and you’re going to the dressing room, or the game is still on and there’s a lot of minutes you’re going to score?
I think no one wants to say a defeated football team coach or a classic comment that players use, "We'll look at the next matches now."
The only thing you have to do now is to leave the past and look before you, not to walk.
If we’re gathering what we say:
First, make a semester vacation plan.
2) Repeat through the things you know.
3) Resolve your missing issues.
4) Resolve the question by solving the question.
5) Solve the exam.
Read the book,
7) Set new goals for the new period,
8) Spend time for yourself, for your hobbies and for what you enjoy.
Spend time to your family and friends.
10) Spend time on social and cultural activities (film, sports, theatre, concerts, trips, picnic, etc.)
“Kervan” is on a long way.
With an average of 1,000 square meters of 45 stores, the founder of Kervan, Shinasi Demirel, one of the largest 'home' stores in Turkey, and his son, Hasan, added Home Sweet Home, which has 17 stores abroad, 25 stores abroad, to Kervan.
With the operations that have recently completed trading records, Kervan has also owned 17 Home Sweet Home stores abroad.
Shinasi Demirel said that there is still no Kervan store abroad, "Now we will continue the smaller store with the large store Kervan, the smaller store with Home Sweet Home."
“The car will also be opened abroad.”

The total area of sale of Kervan, located in 35 provinces with 45 stores, is 45 thousand square meters.
The 25 stores belong to the main company.
There are approximately 500 jobs in Kervan.
Home Sweet Home has 17 shops in 25 countries and has a total sales area of 6 thousand 500 square meters and employee number of 320 people.
Home Sweet Home Board Chairman Kadir Kalaycıoğlu, who produces, exports and stores with his partner Alev Pakten, said that they are very pleased with the association with Kervan, "We are married and we entered this sector in 1998.
From the beginning, we made a brand with the support of the Shinasi gentlemen.
Mr. Shinasi is the 'TRT' of this sector.
We learned a lot from him.
We even started our first step to the store with his central store.
We worked with Kervan as a competitor, not as a strategic partner.
"Today, there will be a very serious synergy with this unification."
Kalaycıoğlu announced that the weight of Home Sweet Home currently has 17 shops abroad, including in the Middle East, and that they have started exporting to China last month.
He said, “We opened our first corner in Shanghai.”
We agreed with a chain of 200 stores.
“After that we will develop a large store abroad as Kervan, a small store with Home Sweet Home,” he said.
Poroshenko sells its factory in Russia
Roshen CEO Vyacheslav Moskalevsky, who interviewed Liga.net, said the factory was sold for $200 million.
Moskalevsky, “Yes, we sold the factory.”
“When it comes to sale, all real buyers are suddenly disappeared,” he said.
When it comes to the price of the company’s factory in the Russian city of Lipetsk, Moskalevsky said, “We’ve fixed it as about $200 million.”
Roshen, which produces 450,000 tons of chocolate and sugar per year, is one of the world’s largest producers and belongs to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko.
Star Holding has become a Pladis abroad
Star Holding joined global companies operating in the biscuit and chocolate sectors it purchased under the name "Pladis".
With the combination of De Met's, Godiva, United Biscuits and Country brands, a $5.2 billion new food giant was born where 26,000 people worked.
Speaking at the meeting on the unification of global companies within Star Holding, Star Holding Board Chairman Murat Ülker said, "To be a global company has been our goal since the beginning," and added:
Murat Ülker has sold £335 million live from Periscope
This company, founded 72 years ago, is now under the name of Star Holding and is advancing to become a global brand, global company in the world’s biscuit chocolate sugar business.
During this period, we developed from retail to packaging, personal care and in various branches of the industry.
We have 77 factories operating in 14 countries, 300 brands and thousands of points of sale.
All Star Holding says it forms "a family of more than 50 thousand people," the country said, "Now as we look at the possibilities in our family, we want to go back and focus on cake chocolate, our main business and be global in this field; for that we are reorganized," and said the new construction as follows:
The story of the father of Mr. Sabri
We are reorganizing our company and we are reorganizing it.
We divide the world into regions.
And we shared these areas with our CEOs.
Mehmet, Muhammad and Jeff will be our regional CEOs.
Mehmet Tütüncü is responsible for the Turkish Republics of the Middle East, K. Africa and Turkey.
Mohamed Elsarky is a member of our global Godiva business as well as from the American continent and Japan.
Jeff van der Eems will be responsible for Britain, Continental Europe and Africa.
As I can call the quality and innovation teacher, Ali Ülker is taking over the global profession in his own field, Cem Karakaş will also help me in the management of the business.
China, Russia will be partly the regions of Southeast Asia that we will newly establish and develop.
Murat Country sold shares in SAF GYO
Murat Ülker, who continues to say, "We promise happiness to the whole world in every bit," said, "Our global company is named Pladis to this."
"While you say where you invented Pladis, it really doesn't have any special meaning for this name," he said and added:
They call it Maya.
Japanese Subaru, Pervin in Iran.
In Arabic, Suriah, we were inspired by the name of the Pleiades team star, which is composed of seven stars in Latin that means Country.
We translated the world into the world.
Star Holding Board Deputy Chairman Ali Ülker also emphasized that, in cooperation with laboratories in different countries, "we began to create synergies in innovation" and added:
We have very valuable AR-GE teams, bringing these teams together, we have achieved certain synergies in work on an AR-GE platform so far.
Under Pladis we have 27 R-GE centers.
The biggest of these are in Turkey and England.
There are more than 300 AR-GE experts working here.
The synergies began to give results.
The Digestives drage (Nibbles), which is produced in the country and will start exporting to the UK, is produced in Silivri in the country’s chocolate factory.
Another example of synergy: Brands are different but the products are the same.
A kraker technology developed in the UK, namely the Jacob's Crinklys product, soon adapted to Turkey, we gave our country a nice taste under the name of Country Krispi Tırtıklı.
Laviva, which we all know closely, met today with consumers in America.
Call of Duty has exceeded 250 million.
This series, which Activision, Infinity Ward, Treyarch and Sledgehammer Games harvested their names in the game world with golden letters, seems to be unforgettable for many years.
Especially the newly revealed sales numbers are all the evidence of how legendary we need to find.
Activision, which holds the licensing rights of the series, showed 250 million copies in its sales at the end of the year.
The company, which shared the total sales of the series in the beginning of last year, has since sold 75 million Call of Duty games.
There is no doubt that Black Ops 3 is a game that we do not make a mistake.
Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was elected President again.
At the Ordinary Assembly, Kemal Kılıçdaroğlu was re-elected President.
Kılıçdaroğlu, who played 990 of the thousand 238 delegates voting, became the new president.
248 of the votes used were invalid.
After the results were revealed, the parties showed joy.
The CHP had a total of a thousand 275 delegates.
He finished his work on Sunday at 10 p.m.
In the sword, he said:
We wanted to play games here, Turks were told.
But the point we come is not open.
There is an uncontrollable Turkey.
The atmosphere shines all of this.
The reason for the crash is the people who govern the country.
As the CHPs, wherever terror comes, wherever it comes, we are opposed.
Terrorism is a crime of humanity and terrorists should never be forgiven.
The fight against terror is done with wisdom, it is done with knowledge, it is done with irfan.
But we do not want anyone to get blood in the nose.
What's the difference from the photos in Syria, in Lebanon, from the photos in the Southeast?
While sitting on the table, they made serious mistakes.
The power is responsible for the blood, the tears, and all the dead.
In 2002 they surrendered the country with zero terror, and today there is a Turkey that returns to the blood lake.
Who is responsible for this?
Do you have a taxi driver in the city?
What is the price of Turkey?
We will participate sincerely in meetings on the change of the coup laws, we will transmit our opinions.
We will not allow a country to be built on anyone’s personal views.
“Let’s change the spirit.”
In the morning, the houses are pressed and arrested because the country’s bright people have revealed their thoughts.
We also have aspects that we do not agree with, but people should be able to express their thoughts freely.
This dictatorship disgrace says, “the one who eats the bread of the state and hosts the state.”
I also want to ask him, why didn’t those who ate the bread of the state and took advantage of all the possibilities of the state think when they steal the state?
CHP is the party that brings the biggest changes to this country.
We will all be preparing for the fourth great revolution.
Whatever the cost, we will definitely bring free democracy to this country.
They can arrest us, they can arrest us, whatever they do, no matter how heavy the cost, the freedom will be brought to this country by the CHP.
I am calling you clearly, David.
Hidden behind the coup law, the hidden man has not thrown his coup mentality out of his head.
You gave the great service medal to the man who gave you.
Which strike are you talking about?
All of the people are deceived.
The party officials ranked the other three revolutions as follows: the first major revolution ended the sovereignty and the establishment of the Republic; the second major revolution went to the multi-party period from the one-party period in the time of the Innocent; the third revolution went to social democracy with Bülent Ecevit.
The President has his functions and qualifications.
In Article 103, the President has a swear.
We know how important the concept of namus and honour is in this society.
If a man comes out and gives this promise, he will fulfill it to his death.
Namus and honour are not discussed for us.
The man who is the dictatorship corrupt, what honor and namus means for you.
What do you understand in namus and honour, why did you make this swear?
What does namus and honor mean for you?
I want to learn this.
In the religious man, the concept of namus and honour is the main crown.
Their intention is not to revoke the coup law, but to judge the coup law.
They do not want a presidential system.
How is the chairman; the chairman’s system.
Why do you deny the Ottoman parliamentary system?
One man will order everyone to do what he needs.
Are Parliamentarians Working Healthy?
No does not work.
If we bring free democracy, the system works.
They called a coup, but they strengthened the coup law.
Izmir deputy Mustafa Balbay, who announced his candidacy for the general presidency, failed to participate in the competition because he could not collect the signatures of the 128 delegates needed for the candidacy.
Balbay, who was able to collect 92 signatures, said, "I can't be a candidate in the current conditions."
In the Kurultay Hall there are places allocated to the parliamentary parliament (PM), the central executive council (MYK) and members of the honorary council, while the former CHP leader Deniz Baykal's meeting with the parties was noted.
Stanbul deputy Gülay Yedekçi instead of sitting in the place for his parliamentary members, came early and sat next to the place left to General President Kılıçdaroğlu.
The meeting of the Yalova deputy Muharrem İnce with Kılıçdaroğlu was one of the topics discussed in the Kurultay kulis.
He said he did not accept that he was offered a PM membership.
But from the general center sources came the claim that the request for a meeting came from Ince and that the PM membership was not proposed.
Ince said on Twitter, “No one can learn about these general center sources, the content of the interview from the Istanbul parliamentary Ali Özcan.”
He said, “How can I get to know the two people.”
“It’s enough to say we’ve met.”
The sword boy often praised the press.
On the first day of the ordinary "Democracy, Change and Brotherhood Council" the party parliament (PM) struck the mark.
The Sworddaroğlu began to work for the PM list at his house after the Kurultay speech.
When Kılıçdaroğlu prepares the key list of 100 people, the current member of MYK said he will be on the list by telephone calling 13 member of MYK except Seyhan Erdoğdu, who did not apply to PM by explaining that he did not want to participate in the management, Yakup Akkaya, Sencer Ayata, Ercan Karakaş and 13 member of MYK who did not apply to PM.
It is said that Kılıçdaroğlu will be able to mark the PM key list of 100 persons as well as another shortened list.
The 21 article result statement, unanimously adopted by the CHP Council, called for the removal of the charges on the European Local Governance Charter, which was discussed by the DTK’s autonomy discussions, to increase the local power sharing.
The declaration also included the objectives of "to end the party state order", "to establish a fair and accountable law state".
Kurultay AK Party's Vice-President General Selçuk Özdağ, HDP's Idris Baluken, MHP's Ruhsar Demirel followed.
AK Party Özdağ and AK Party delegation left the hall after Kılıçdaroğlu strongly criticized President Erdoğan.
He said, “I saw the criticism missing the dose, I couldn’t accept it.”
The prisoners in the hall included the photographs of Can Dündar and Erdem Gül with a pancard written "If you don't burn I don't burn how the darkness comes to light" with the Kurdish, Turkish and English "Peace" pancard attracted attention.
The meeting began in the morning with group comments and Ahmet Kaya's songs.
The message sent to the council by the wife of Diyarbakır Baro President Tahir Elçi, Turkan Elçi, who died in the armed attack, received great praise.
Berkin Elvan's mother Smile and father Sami Elvan also joined the assembly.
The part where Kılıçdaroğlu said they would possess democracy "to death" no matter what the price to pay was the most praised part of the speech.
So far, the CHP, which has gathered 52 assemblies, including 34 ordinary, 18 extraordinary, has gathered its 53th major assembly in Ankara Arena yesterday.
Participation was high.
There were more than 15,000 CHPs in the 12 thousand seats hall.
However, there was no enthusiasm that the crowd gave the right.
The most exciting moment was the memory that Kılıçdaroğlu entered the hall with his wife Selvi Kılıçdaroğlu.
The excitement continued while the Swordardaroğlu couple greeted the hall.
There was no discipline in the Hall of Fame.
Even when the Swordardaroğlu spoke, there was a great movement in the field of the Arena.
Obviously, the CHP members who wanted to enter the Parliament preferred to seek support by telling themselves to the party leaders and journalists.
One CHP managers tried to say, “It’s better that figuring parties, like party meetings in Korea or the Soviet Union, sit down like a slope,” saying that this is not a bad thing.
There is a difference between the CHP and the AK Party and the MHP.
Only the presidents are speaking in these parties.
In the CHP, the establishment becomes a platform where party issues are discussed.
When the number of parties who wanted to speak at the meeting of yesterday increased, the Divan President Murat Karayalç's time arrangement was difficult.
In the faces and languages there was a distance against the expression "The country is going bad" but there was a distance against the comments "You're changing the way with the picture to get out of this hall now."
All the CHP members said "there is something to do" but there was no consistent and strong answer to the question "What to do".
It was great that there will be no elections in the next four years.
When the Sworddaroğlu came out to the box, we also waited for what the journalists would answer the question "What to do".
The Swordman first answered the question "What's happening."
The question of the detained journalists, what was done to the academics because of the statement, what is happening in the Southeast, the outcome of foreign policy.
The "Anadolu legends" about the CHP have long responded to its party, such as "the party is non-religious", "the party supports the strikes" and "the party of the elites".
When it comes to the "what to do" phase, instead of talking about concrete steps, he tried to show up a "strategy".
He emphasized that all these problems could be overcome with a stronger democracy with more justice.
He also made a promise on behalf of the CHP and “we’ll work whatever the price is until we bring democracy.”
“We will fight to death for democracy.”
One last note is that it must be remembered that the CHP has resolved the "organization" issue as of the 53th assembly, and now it is capable of collecting assembly without problems.
Meanwhile, the card was printed for 900 journalists who were said to follow the board, but the participation of journalists in the hall was not at that level.
The representatives of the media organizations of Ankara were not as willing to follow the assembly as in the AK Party assembly.
Requested for self-government
The claim prepared by the Deputy Prosecutor's Office of the Republic of Diyarbakır on 3 detainees, 7 accused, was approved by the 4th Heavy Criminal Court.
In the claim, on the instructions and calls of the senior managers of the PKK/KCK terrorist organization in Diyarbakır, Istanbul, Şırnak, Mardin, Muş, Hakkari, Siirt, Bitlis, Batman, Van and Ağrı's some districts and districts under the name of "özyadministration" were stated.
In the claim that the organization’s leaders and youth and women’s organizations were called for illegal action, it was noted that Diyarbakır’s Sur, Bağlar, Silvan, Bismil, Lice, Dicle and Hazro districts have increased bombing, long-term weapons and rocket attacks against security forces, public institutions and organizations, citizens’ homes, workplaces and vehicles.
We are fighting, our offices are shot.
The conflict between the Syrian Dudan, the Black Mosque and the Black Bridge Village, in the face of the Yavuzlu Village of Kilis, and the Fatih Army, which is formed together by opposition groups, continues to intensify in recent days.
The voice of the weapons and arms shot during the conflicts between ISIS and the opposition near the border is also heard by Turkey.
The smoke rise from the areas where the explosions occurred often was seen by Turkey with the naked eye, while security forces on the border line took intense measures with armed vehicles.
On the other hand, a mass shooting was opened to the Sheikh Mehmet Border Station near the Yavuzlu Village of Kilis from the Bıgıddın Village under the control of ISIS militants.
In the framework of the commitment rules, the soldiers responded with gun and heavy weapons to the area where the torture was opened.
According to the allegations, Russian aircraft attacked the village of Hameyin, 17 kilometers from the border with Turkey.
Six Syrians injured in the air bombing were brought to Kilis State Hospital for treatment by their relatives.
The lottery wealthy got their checks.
The Robinson couple, who lived in a small house worth $150,000 in Munford, Tennessee, preferred to get a single payment of $328 million (about $1 billion) instead of receiving a total of $528.8 million ($1.6 billion) in a period of 29 years.
The couple said, “In any case, there is no guarantee for tomorrow.”
John Robinson, who worked in a store chain, and his wife Lisa, who worked as an assistant with a dermatologist, said they would start their business on Monday, though they are now a millionaire.
The couple intend to pay the home loan debt with the money they earn and to help their relatives.
The great prize was divided into three.

FedEx's revenue is mixed, the financial outlook will fall in 2016
FedEx has disappointing results for the past three months, and the cargo giant has reduced its profit forecast throughout the year due to the decrease in demand for cargo services and the increase in costs for ground services.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
Last year, at this time, FedEx announced that it will receive 50,000 seasonal workers for holidays.
On Wednesday, the opening gong dropped about 2.5 per cent in the pre-open transactions 45 minutes before.
FedEx Corp. said it is expected to make a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 per financial year that ends in May, which is 20 cents less than previous estimates.
Analysts expected $10.84 based on research by FactSet.
It appears that the average 4.9% increase that will be in force on January 4 and the high loads that will begin in November in heavy or large packages on land are likely to decline.
According to the company, cost cuts, higher revenue and e-commerce growth gains are expected to remain higher than the previous year.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company "has shown a strong performance despite weak economic conditions, in manufacturing and global trade than expected."
The vacation employment plans were announced a day after the competitive company UPS, according to which UPS said it planned to hire the same number as last year, 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers.
During the three-month period ending August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, increasing its revenue by 6% compared to the previous year.
The profit per share occurred at the $2.42 level, remaining behind $2.44 of the 12 analyst’s estimates discussed by Zacks Investment Research.
Income increased by 5% to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts discussed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx hit the decline in international priority shipping last year, which led to revenue stagnation in the Express unit.
But the explosion in the online shopping has raised the results of the FedEx Land Services.
In the last quarter, land service revenue increased by 29%, but business revenue was basically stopped due to large packages and high costs in internal insurance.
In the high labour costs, the revenue in the cargo business fell while the express unit saw high revenue due to the high base rates.
In the pre-open transactions approximately an hour before the opening gong, FedEx shares fell to $150,15 with a $3.85 or 2.5% drop.
They closed Tuesday with a decline of 11% for the year and 17% below the record level in June 11.
In the most anticipated meetings for years, Federal Reserve politicians decided that it was time to raise the interest rate once with almost a decade, spending two days around the table this week, spending 27 square Honduras mauna.
The two-storey meeting room, located on one wing of the central bank, will be a wall picture of the United States.
The map is a reminder of the Fed’s female chairman Janet L. Yellen and colleagues that the country’s economic interests are above everything else.
The central bank has two tasks taken from Congress: to raise U.S. employment to a maximum level and to keep prices stable here.
But since the Great Storm, the Fed leaders have admitted that there is a third unwritten council: the financial balance.
And this third defect may be X factor in an unpredictable close decision on whether the U.S. economy’s unique alarming support from the near-zero short-term interest rate that will be announced on Thursday since the end of 2008 is ready to start cutting.
Although most data indicate that the economy is steadily growing, the recent flooding situation in the global financial markets can now make cautious Fed officials worried about adding vulnerability by raising federal fund interest rates – even less than a quarter of one percent.
“Of course, the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important thing they follow,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"But I think if they are looking for an excuse to not increase the rate, the increasing uncertainty surrounding the global market will give them enough reason to wait a little longer," he said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, and this in itself leads to fluctuations in the financial markets.
Half of the economists that Bloomberg recently discussed expected a rate increase this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to remain in expectation with the main indicator, which is only about 30% likely to increase.
This could indicate a decline in the stock market if the Fed increases the rate, and if the policy makers do not relieve the impact by promising that another increase may be on the way.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Index average rose to 16,599.85 points, with an increase of 228.89 points or 1.4%.
Moody's Capital Markets Research Group chief economist John Lonski said, "The growth rate was driven by the expectation that the Fed's policy makers will keep it stable this week."
“It would be surprising that the Fed would raise rates right now,” he said.
If the Fed leaders had decided in this direction, "there would have to take a long year to calm the financial markets so that they don't panic."
Other experts suggested that a rise in the rate could calm the financial markets due to the rise of the silk curtain on when the Fed will take action.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on the way to increase its rate by 0.25 per cent this month, which would be a small step in the way to slowly shrinking monetary conditions, strengthening the US recovery.
Yellen said, despite the liberals’ complaints about the need for a more economic process, he expected this year’s rate increase in the spring months and early summer.
Although the rate of business creation decreased in August, the growth in the labour market was stable this year.
Last month, the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1%, the lowest level in seven years, and it approached the level of full employment estimated by the Fed.
The salary increases showed signs of improvement.
And although inflation continues to look below the central bank’s annual 2% target, Fed politicians say the sharp decline in oil prices is a major reason for the temporary impact.
Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the economy "can deal with higher rates and the labour market needs it despite the narrowness."
However, the world’s financial markets began to shock after China devaluated the currency at the end of last month.
The Dow Jones Industrial Index average fell below the record level of 16% in May due to the fear of investors that a slowing Chinese economy will slow down global growth.
The market somehow jumped back when Dow was now below almost 10% of the high level in May.
For the Fed policy makers, market flooding makes it even more complicated to calculate the time when the interest rate will be raised.
Stephen D. Oliner, senior research partner at UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former Fed official, said: “They may have been slightly shrinking at this meeting in the past few weeks, with the unknown fact that the financial markets in the Chinese economy are the largest and the lack of news about economic weakening.”
Now they predict that they will wait at least a month more to better manage these effects.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what the impacts on the U.S. economy will be, and there’s almost no data in the hands to link China’s developments to the advanced date,” Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the primary concerns of the Fed, so it should not be a technical factor in the recovery processes.
But in fact, the Fed has become the world’s financial authority.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been very large.
Until then, the only clue from President Ben S. Bernanke was that in 2013 the Fed could “minimize” the monetary expansion caused by global market shocks.
In a world in which markets and economies are increasingly floating, it can be expected that Fed officials not only follow the developments elsewhere but also consult with other central bank managers and experts to better learn the global economy.
Asset management company Envestnet Inc.’s global strategy chief Zachary Karabell said that the decision-making process was “more than a talent than science.”
Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Vice-President Jeffrey Lacker noted this month that "Fed has been excessively reacting in the past to the unseen financial market movements linked to economic fundamentals."
The policy maker, Lacker, a member with the right of vote of the Federal Open Market Committee and who pushed for the rise of rates, for example referred to the 1998-99 decisions.
Lacker said, "in spite of limited identifiable recommendations for U.S. growth, the financial crisis in Asia has caused the Fed to cut the index rate by 0.75% during the three meetings."
A year later, the Fed officials recovered these cuts.
Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate determination committee of the British Central Bank, said: "The Fed should put its financial balance concerns in the forefront only during major crises, as it was during the 2008 market erosion."
He said he was not approaching this level.
You really don’t want to stay in a state of fear of going to a rate rise because the markets are narrow, said President of the International Economic Institute of Peterson Posen.
The Central Bank Act still has two powers and does not talk about the financial balance and I don’t think they should take a move in this direction until this changes.

Brazil's Rio Grande Pediatric Society promotes healthy nutrition during breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS applied a shocking method by placing milk children's pictures with unhealthy nutritional images to try and tell women the importance of healthy nutrition in breastfeeding processes.
Human milk is made up of many proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that provide babies with all the nutrients they need to develop a healthy immune system.
Because of their excess energy needs, pregnant women and new mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake to about 500 calories.
However, new research shows that the food supplement that mothers should take is not limited to their calorie intake.
According to a new study conducted by Professor Robert Waterland at Baylor Medical College in Texas, healthy nutrition in pregnant women protects them from tumor development by influencing their baby’s genetic expression.
Unfortunately, it has been found that unhealthy eating affects the child’s immune system negatively.
Seven's Sunrise, despite Nine's efforts to gain leadership in Today Show, continues to survive in rankings
The movements by Karl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra in order to overthrow the leadership of the Liberal did not succeed in providing a rating increase for Today.
After Tony Abbott's fall of Malcolm Turnbull, Nine's breakfast show was shown in the national capital.
The Rival Sunrise, hosted in London by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was trapped among weekly international series including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
As the issue of distance does not make much difference for Australian spectators, Sunrise has an average of 397,000 spectators in five capitals, compared to Today’s 339,000 numbers.
Today on Monday (317,000) compared to last Tuesday (283,000) recorded a slight increase in ratings but the figure was still behind last Thursday (343,000)
Today is closing with Sunrise in recent months.
Today’s average in August was 318,000, compared to Sunrise’s 330,000 numbers.
In the beginning of the year, the difference was between 40,000 and 50,000.
The Sunrise average is 349,000 compared to Today’s 314,000 numbers until September.
This is the most interesting thing that happened in the morning.
The winds of change affect the parliament much this morning!
Karl and Lisa are good, thank you for asking!

The big news for Seven was the beginning of the 800 Words breaking of the former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a new widow's father and his two children decided to move to the coast of the sea in New Zealand reached an impressive average of 1.219 million.
The critics questioned whether Thomson could perform a solo show without Rafters' star Rebecca Gibney.
The answer was “yes” the result of yesterday’s night.
Seven's X Factor retained its power with 1,136 million viewers, easily defeated Block (838,000) and TBL families (726,000).
Seven followers mixed their night goods with Austria.
Andrew O'Keefe's first half of the new information competition hosted (17:00-17:30) reached an average of 446,000 spectators.
In the second half of the hour (17:30-18:00) the figure jumped to 623,000 spectators - it was enough for a small victory against Eddie Mc Guire's Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday night, the first half of Australia reached an average of 520,000 viewers, while in the second half this figure rose to 720,000.
The hot seat had an average of 620,000.
Following Australian's second-night rating drop suggested that the Hot Seat will give Nine a superiority at 5.30 a.m.
Following Australia was a change that was fulfilled by the Million Dollar Minute that didn’t get to Mc Guire’s show.
Originally Today was published in the form of Sunrise comes superior as it remains local
The last three people think Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose?
Is the secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have revealed who will win the single without realizing.
The woman that Sam Wood would choose at the end of the Single program was kept in great confidentiality.
And the remaining three girls do their best to not tell who the last rose area is.
But the day before the three falls into two, if we check Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski, they may have given a clue without knowing who the winner will be.
Sam Wood closed his mouth until Thursday's final.
Three women also told them in a lyrical language why Wood was perfect; they told them why they wanted to be his partner, emphasizing his humor, ambition, family values and positive attitudes.
But the answers to the question "Who should get Wood's last rose if not you?" may contain information about who will win The Bachelor's heart.
Both Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski quickly named Mackay as the best candidate for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood are very close since the first day.
Jeavons-Fellows: “From the moment I came home, I felt they were fit with each other by reading (Sarah’s) energy and Sam’s energy, and I thought so throughout the program.”
Markoski added, “Sarah is a very practical person, it’s very fun to be around her.”
I saw them together and there was a chemistry between them.
They feel very comfortable and comfortable while standing alongside each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood will be a very good couple.
Mackay said his home visit dates last week suggested that he was "the right person" for Wood.
"When I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that it was definitely not just a game - I'm now completely connected to him."
When asked who Woods could choose without him, it was mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say that.”
“I love the other girls equally – Snezana and Lana are equal.”
The Bachelor will be broadcast on the Ten Channel on Wednesday at 19.30.
First post: Is Sarah the best choice for Sam Wood?
Jarryd Hayne has several options in terms of where he will start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed a lot of interest to him after he moved to the United States, and many other teams approached him after the impressive open training day last year.
But Hayne has chosen San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula, and this seems to be a very wise decision.
Some coaches set Hayne back on Tuesday because of his loss in performance in the Australian rugby league, as it was in the 20-3 win against Minnesota on Tuesday.
But Tomsula believed in this man and gave Hayne another chance and took part in a game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula continued to show her real color to the dressing room after the game.
He gave them the courage, instead of humiliating them in front of the whole team.
Tomsula also clearly supported Hayne in the press conference after the match.
49ers team reporter Cam Inman said that Hayne also got the courage from the special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey and was advised to forget that drop and think about the next game.
Jarryd Hayne caused the Minnesoa Vikings to make numbers in the first quarter and dropped the ball
This was not what Hayne and his broad Australian fans had dreamed of for the first match in the NFL.
Hayne was seen as unbelieving while leaving the field after he dropped the ball and later told the Australian radio twins Hamish and Andy that he could not think of a worse start for his NFL career at 2DayFM 104.1.
Hayne said, “This was just one of those things, you’ll be sad for the next game, and that’s what.”
Hayne also reminded the first match of 2007 Origin with a number back to Queensland.
It was a great experience for the 27-year-old player.
Hayne posted the post taken while holding an Australian flag with fans after the game on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
In 2003, the wealthiest man of Russia, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, was forced to be arrested on a pass in Siberia.
Khodorkovsky, who clearly opposed President Vladimir Putin, was sentenced to prison, the oil company was taken over to Yukos, and the pro-democracy efforts were shortly interrupted.
Police in Nepal killed four people as a result of plastic shooting to protesters
On Wednesday, a official that four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed as a result of a police shooting on a crowd protesting against the new constitution proposed in the country.
The incident occurred on Tuesday night in the city of Rupandehi, 175 miles west of the capital Katmandu.
District Chief Bishnu Prasad Dhakal said more than 1,000 phase protesters gathered outside a police station and some threw stone and fire bombs.
Mr. Dhakal said the police used pepper gas and shot in the air before using plastic shots.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It is unclear why the plastic bullets that are known to kill but are usually less fatal as an alternative, result in such a high mortality.
The conflict was the last of week-long violent protests throughout the southern squares of Nepal, where Madhesi ethnic group members claim that the new constitution proposed regions will see their own political influence.
The ethnic group Tharus, who wants to establish their own states, is also holding protests in western Nepal.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have died in violent conflicts that have been ongoing since 10 August.
At this time, four major political parties had agreed to divide the country into regions – a significant but unreliable step for the preparation of a new constitution in Nepal, which has been ruled by the central state for centuries.
The work on a new constitution has been ongoing since 2008, but lawmakers have accelerated this process after the devastating earthquake that occurred in April and caused thousands of deaths.
The lawmakers worked on the draft constitutional provisions in Katmandu this week and officials said the new text will be arranged until Sunday.
NHC says it has 60 percent chance of a hurricane in the south of Cape Verde Islands
The U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday that a large low pressure system located about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern edge of the Cape Verde Islands is 60 percent likely to turn into a tropical hurricane within the next 48 hours.
Another well-defined low pressure system was also seen between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles, and the Miami weather forecast center said it was 60 percent likely to develop a tropical storm in the next two days.
Google launched a donation matching campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc. (GOOGL.O) has announced a donation-combination campaign aimed at collecting $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help thousands of refugees flee to Europe from the wounded and poor countries.
Google announced its donation initiative on its blog with an unexpected personal approach.
Instead of a manager making this statement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled from Kabul with her family when she was seven years old, wrote her personal experience.
“In our journey, in addition to hunger, thirst, cold and fear, there were a lot of dark buses and train trips.”
I was lucky.
But because the refugee and immigrant crisis in Europe is growing, many families like my family need help.
Donations will go to four non-profit organizations that provide aid to refugees and migrants: Unlimited Doctors, International Rescue Committee, Children's Rescue and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it will match the first $5.5 million donation at google.com/refugeerelief until it gathers $11 million.
Europe is faced with the worst refugee crisis since World War II, the biggest reason for which is the four-year Syrian Civil War, which destroyed more than 4 million people this year.
As a result of many wars, Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya are also fleeing.

Weight Loss Surgery Can Help Diabetic Patients with Average Obesity
According to a new study, the benefits of obesity surgery may take at least five years to be observed in middle-degree obesity patients with type 2 diabetes.
However, it is still early to tell patients with middle obesity that they have lived longer than those who have not undergone surgery after obesity surgery.
According to Dr. Robin Blackstone, who has written an article in a new study on JAMA surgery and an expert on obesity surgery, "there takes a long time to determine the death rates."
Weight loss surgery, otherwise called bariatric surgery, uses a variety of methods to reduce the diameter of the stomach.
These reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to digest food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been proven to be effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most of the research was done on advanced obese people with body mass index (BMI) 35 or above.
The BMI, which is measured by the length ratio of the kilogram, is considered normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A person with a BMI of 25 or more has an overweight and a person with a BMI of 30 or more has an overweight.
BMI can be calculated by the following link: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
In a new study, Taiwan’s full-fledged Min-Sheng Hospital has used data from the experiment they compared two types of bariatric surgery used in the treatment of middle-degree obesity patients with type 2 diabetes since 2007.
From the end of the fifth year of the study, the average BMI of those with surgery dropped from 31 to 24.5.
The BMI of those who have been treated with non-chirurgical diabetes is fixed at around 29.
Diabetes is partially dissolved in 36% of the surgeons and in 28% of the surgeons.
In the medical treatment group, diabetes has only been partially dissolved in 1% and in 2% compared.
Also, according to the authors, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol, “in the group under surgery” were usually better.
The researchers have also demonstrated blood levels of A1c hemoglobin, which reflects blood sugar levels in patients over time.
According to researchers, it is best to keep A1c hemoglobin below 7%.
After surgery, A1c hemoglobin decreased from an average of 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the treatment group, it remained fixed by about 8 percent.
But with the refined A1c hemoglobin levels, this better "glycemic control", according to Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and his team colleagues conducting the research, did not lower the mortality rate in these five years.
The research team compared the findings with these two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the group, which had a tube abdominal surgery, had increased weight loss (18.7 to 14.2 kg), BMI (7.4 to 5.1) and as well as A1c hemoglobin (3.1 to 2.1) had higher decreases, with a higher likelihood of a total decline in diabetes (46.9 to 16.7).
Although the study did not indicate a clear benefit of survival after surgery at the end of the fifth year, Dr. Blackstone from the Arizona Medical College-Phoenix said that there were valid data that the surgery extended the lifetime, according to a study conducted in more weighted patients in Sweden.
The Swedish study found that obese patients who had been under bariatric surgery were 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years than the other group who had received more traditional treatment.
Although this new study has not shown the benefits of survival for surgical patients, Blackstone says it is related to the issue and this situation is confident for people with BMI below 35.
The most vibrant part of the article is here, because the group with low BMI says that this surgery is safe, there is no increase in risk of death or kidney disorders, he said.
Blackstone added that people and doctors should begin to take the problem of weight loss seriously with the patient’s BMI falling below 27 to 30.
I think we’ve been waiting enough for people to take this matter seriously.
I think it is really difficult to reverse it after collecting these genetic changes in their bodies that make their bodies associated with obesity and diabetes.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
The Dalai Lama said that Europe will not be able to host all the refugees, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the cessation of violence in their countries.
At the beginning of his 10-day visit to Britain, Dalai Lama addressed the continuing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Charity Center in Oxford, which will work on ethics.
Under the current circumstances, he claimed that the interests of countries or continents should be placed in the forefront of humanity.
At the same time, although appreciated, he also stressed that the responses of the countries in Western Europe to the refugee crisis are insufficient in this regard.
In his speech, he said, “It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe.”
Although he appreciates Germany and Austria’s efforts to tackle the crisis, Dalai Lama said it was only a temporary solution.
“To take care of a few thousand refugees is great, but you must also think of long-term solutions; you must think of how you can bring lasting peace and lasting development to these Muslim countries, primarily through education.”
We need to think about how to reduce deaths in our country.
We need to reduce the use of power.
Power use has never been a solution to problems.”
Talking on the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also pointed to what George Bush did after the September 11 attacks and said the U.S. violent responses launched a chain of uncontrollable events.
In my letter to President Bush on September 11, I sent my health wishes and stated that the way to solve this problem is through non-violent methods.
I know that his guides were of good intention, but he himself used power and caused unexpected consequences," Dalai Lama said.
The number of hands-on antiseptics in children has increased 4 times over the last 4 years.
The toxic control centers in the U.S. have an increase of almost 400 percent in high alcohol-containing wet pants in children under the age of 12 since 2010.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Toxic Center, the cases of hand antiseptic swallow in children under the age of 12 were to the center, from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
Lopez told CNN, “Children have been more disappointed with this kind of products, and unfortunately there are those among them who are in the ratio to be removed urgently.”
Some children say they consciously drink hands-on antiseptics, while some say they do it in influencing their friends or claiming a social media.
YouTube videos show adolescents drinking antiseptics for cheap drunkeness.
Some adolescents have been to mix the antiseptic mixture with oral water containing alcohol to get a harder intestine.
Small children can get into attractive antiseptic smells.
Lopez said, “The child doesn’t think that’s a bad thing.”
And most of them are more sensitive than those who are more sensitive.
There are hand antiseptics with grapes, grapes and orange aroma that are extremely attractive to children.
The hand antiseptics contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, only a few storms can cause alcohol poisoning.
According to a statement by Dr. Stephen Thornton, head of the Kansas University Hospital’s poisoning center, Kansas City Fox 4 is “a highly concentrated alcohol.”
You don’t leave a few glasses of whisky around, but people leave these hand antiseptics in the middle, which is a easy way for children to get quite a lot of alcohol.
Recently, the six-year-old Nhaijah Russell, who was just swallowing a furnace-smelled hand antiseptic in his school, was urgently removed to see treatment.
The alcohol rate in his blood was 0.179, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, the emergency doctor in Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta, this rate was twice the legal alcohol limit accepted in an adult person.
Nhaijah was unable to pronounce the words and was unable to walk when he came to the emergency room.
According to Rithey, because alcohol caused the little girl to fall and hit her head, doctors kept her under the shelter throughout the night in a separate child’s hospital, despite any signs of brain trauma.
Anne Ortoria Scott told CNN that she was “very scary.”
It could be deadly for my child.
Lopez advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or shorten the contact with the skin of antiseptic pants and take them up to places where children can’t reach.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some antiseptics were found to be associated with death cases.
In 2013, two women in Ontario were killed due to sweating a hand antiseptic containing a toxic substance not named.
Health officials claimed that the substance could be methyl alcohol, not ethyl alcohol, but methyl alcohol with a fatal effect, as indicated in the list.
In January, three fourth-class students from northern New York had prepared a conspiracy in order to poison their "bad-hearted" teachers, according to police reports, "to put antibacterial products around the classroom."
The teacher was highly allergic to hand antiseptics and banned it from being used in class.
The police proposed a disciplinary punishment to the school administration by describing this plan as "a missing attempt".

Saudi Arabia did not give up TÜBİTAK
The Ministry of Science, Industry and Technology Fikri Işık, the Turkish Scientific and Technical Research Institute (TÜBİTAK) developed the Balistic Image Analysis and Identification System (BALISTIKA) to Saudi Arabia, stating that a new deal for second party sale was made, "The number of BALISTIKA that will serve in Saudi Arabia with an agreement covering the development and installation of the additional 8 systems will rise from 6 to 14."
The light was found in the explanations about BALISTIKA developed by the TÜBİTAK Space Technology Research Institute.
The system says that the ballistic examinations of the weapons, gun nuclei and coats captured in the events make it possible to compare with the data found in the central database, so the ballistic experts said the problems they encounter during the examination of the coats and coats were eliminated.
Light stated that the data obtained from different geographical locations and the accompanying information, thanks to BALISTICA, can be questioned and stored together.
Considering that one of the most important features of BALISTICA is the ability to obtain and display three-dimensional data that give more details and fewer errors, Light stressed that thanks to the system’s innovations, the decisions that the ballistic expert will make can be made quickly and the success has increased significantly.
In the framework of the "SUBA-1 Project" BALISTIKA was exported
Işık noted that BALISTIKA meets all the criteria in its success standards and has received a full note from the Security General Directorate, the system established in 10 separate regions, including Ankara mainly, covers all of Turkey.
As a result of the system's success, Işık said it was opened abroad, reminded that the "SUBA-1 Project" carried out with Saudi Arabia was exported and in 2013 the installation in 6 regions was successfully completed.
Light said that a new deal for the sale of the BALISTICA to Saudi Arabia was made, the SUBA-2 was signed as a continuation of the SUBA-1, and the number of BALISTICA that will serve in Saudi Arabia with an agreement covering the development and installation of the additional 8 systems will rise from 6 to 14.
Fossil in the bus size
It is that the pre-historic timber has a length of 10 meters and a weight of 3 tons.
The length of the neck only was measured to 1.6 meters.
The researchers named the species "Machimosaurus rex" and published the findings in the magazine Cretaceous Research.
Federico Fanti, the author of the article, from the University of Bologna, said the fossil, which appears to be 130 million years old, is "approximately a bus size."
Fanti, speaking to the Washington Post, said that the huge size of salt water sheet was "at least in a certain region at the top of the food chain in that period."
Paleontologists have revealed that M. rex, which is believed to be the greatest sheep living in the sea, was hunted in the lagoon.
It is believed to be the largest freshwater shell in history, the "Sarcosuchus emperor", who lived in Africa and South America 110 million years ago and could reach 12 meters long and weigh 8 tons.
Everyone’s heads are very confused.
Ece Temelkuran's first 1996 book 'All Women's Head is Mixed', was adapted to the theater by Aysa Production Theatre with the same name.
The game in which Sea Çakır, Zeynep Kankonde, Silk Turktan Kaynak, Kadir Çermik and Şebnem Sönmez played the role is directed by Selen Uçer.
The game where the first time Uçer has experienced text writing and directory experience, which is still ongoing with the games 'Poz' and 'Dry Hard', is questioning the confusion in the women's heads.
The game met with the audience last week at the Trump Exhibition Center.
The game begins with the radio.
In the dark, a sound that takes us to the past years.
Then the curtain opens.
A woman standing on the edge of the window, hoping down.
It is clear who he was and why he sought suicide, with his neighbors interfering.
A letter is coming
The film “Ebru Uysal” by Sea Çakır is a popular writer.
She was abandoned by her husband, but that’s not the only reason.
There are things that have been accumulated since childhood.
The fact that the father did not taste his love, the exclusion in the student life, his lonely childhood, his wrong relationships, his thought that he was uncomprehensible, brought him to this point.
He left a letter behind and decided to commit suicide, but he couldn’t jump out of the window.
For the vicinity and pure cleaner 'Aysel' (Zeynep Kankonde) and the mysterious woman 'Perran' (Şebnem Sönmez) sitting in the opposite apartment, keeps her crazy.
They come to a normal, normal process.
The woman is even more tired and cannot concentrate and jump.
The conversation between the three, when the famous singer 'Meltem Kaya' who cleaned his house joins (Silk Turktan Kaynak) the event turns back to curcuma.
“Meltem, who approaches the situation in its own naive and intimate style, can’t be able to sing when he sees the crowd below.
This interesting suicide attempt gains a different dimension by entering the girl's house with a spare key by the real estate owner 'Murat' (Kadir Çermik).
The singer 'Meltem' gives the press false information to the work.
In the game is also used Nazan Preliminary's 'Street Girl' song.
I am laughing
For the first time in the game, he has been able to keep the speed and fluency of the game.
The comedy load of the game is drawn from Silk Turkey with Zeynep Kankonde.
The cartoon types played by the two; the need mimics, the need replices, succeed in laughing the audience.
While Sheebnem Sönmez translates the experience of the years to the stage very well, Mariz Çakır also shows a convincing performance in reflecting the depressive mood of 'Ebru Uysal'.
Kadir Çermik, who tells his name with the award-winning film "Sarmaşık" of Tolga Steel, accompanies these four women successfully.
The only curtain game, described as a comedy, promises to laugh without confusing the head.
Most of the words that come out of the mouth of the Perran, which is played by Sheebnem Sönmez, are the words that are left in mind as follows: I read the book, I read the book, I read the book, I read the book, I read the book, I read the book, I read the book.
All children have thought to die once to punish their mothers and fathers, and they have always been crying for a reason.
The woman is hanged in the air as an ununderstood joke.
A woman is always looking for a funny story where she forgets her most important place.
In fact, every story begins with a kind of abandonment.
Sometimes I have to put my hands in my pocket; I can’t tolerate handless things.
People wonder where they put their hands.
As we are surprised, our hands are multiplied.
People speak behind what they don’t understand, they invent and they invent.
A misunderstanding is true.
Every woman's head is confused because it's confused.
If you are unable to die, you have a chance to live.

Letters from Small Students
A letter from children in the West for moral purposes came to the police and soldiers who conducted terrorist operations in the region, including the central Sur district of Diyarbakır.
First of all, the 75th.
The year Republic Primary School of Istanbul West Ataşehir Natural Sciences High School and Eskişehir Ataçağ High School students began to work in coordination.
As a result of these studies, students in schools pressed the choreography that they formed the form of a moon star on the chocolate, and then made a thousand letters of poems and paintings.
The children subsequently sent their work to the Security Directorate.
The Diyarbakır Security Directorate established an exhibition table on the work of the children in the West as coordinated.
In the new building of the Security Directorate, the exhibition was placed on the work of the students.
The exhibition was first visited by police and citizens who served in the Security Directorate building.
It inspired the readers of the letters and poems with meaningful writings.
A student who wrote a letter about the operations that are ongoing in the Central Sur district said in a letter: "Dear police, we are grateful to you for the sacrifice you made to protect innocent people in Diyarbakır."
It was announced that the show will last until the next week.
She named her daughter Angela Merkel.
German Prime Minister Angela Merkel, who was criticized from time to time because of its policy on refugees, was given the name to a refugee baby.
The 26-year-old Memun El Hamza, who escaped from the war in Syria and managed to reach the city of Duisburg in Germany, and his 21-year-old wife Tema El Havar, gave their first children the name "Angela Merkel".
Theme El Havar, speaking to the German press, "We are grateful for being here.

Putin says he has spotted.
Russia is preparing to recognize the status of "can do business with Russia" to Turkish companies if it cannot meet the services offered by Turkey otherwise, while the Russian Tour Operators Association has also stated that "Russian citizens do not give up with Turkey".
The Russian Ministry of Economic Development, which estimates that the breakdown of existing economic ties with Turkey will bring additional costs to Russia, has prepared and published a new draft "extraordinary circumstances" with regard to Turkey to the Russian government.
According to the draft regulations published in the Russian Federation, even if it is necessary to enter the sanctions area, Turkish companies and companies are expected to be allowed to do business with Russia.
According to the draft, it is impossible to provide from other sources outside of Turkey or in cases where domestic production in Russia will bring serious additional costs, the products and services of Turkish companies and companies will be exploited.
Which of the goods and services of Turkish origin will be included in this category will be determined by the Russian Ministry of Economic Development in partnership with other relevant ministries.
Thus, the decision will be made by the bureaucrates who will decide which Turkish company can work with Russia.
According to the same document, government agencies and private companies in Russia will need to prove to the Commission that the work they will do with Turkish partners is not agreed.
If the draft bill is approved by the Russian government and enters into force, a register of privileged Turkish companies will also be created in Russia.
The Russian Tour Operators Association also said in a statement that Russian citizens did not leave Turkey.
“In spite of the tour prohibition and the advice of the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs not to go to Turkey, our citizens began looking for a formula to organize their holidays alone.”
The number of posts on social networks entitled 'The most practical and cheap way to make a vacation in Turkey' is growing as a bit.
The most common suggestion is to book a hotel on the internet and fly with THY.
Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev has described the oil price down below $30 as a "dramatic" development for Russia.
Medvedev said, “It was a very bad surprise for our government, as no one thought that oil would fall to $30.
It seems that the budget will not be able to be fulfilled as it is now."
The last month of 2015 we left behind.
After the crises, Russian President Vladimir Putin has announced that economic sanctions will deepen.
In those days, our businessmen trying to go in the usual order to Russia, our THY staff are officially pulling cracks at the border doors.
Turkish goods are carried out in customs and are subject to unreasonable controls.
It's not a long time ago, and it's not a long time ago, and it's not a long time ago, and it's not a long time ago, and it's not a long time ago, and it's not a long time ago.
This or that is a mild thing.
But why?
The reason is very simple.
In a time in which the economy is so globalized a century ago, you are closing the border doors with the methods of a century ago, and your effort to turn political conflicts into economic war is no longer out of it.
We continue to write news about how the economic embargo that has been imposed over the years has been overwhelmed.
The two neighboring countries that seem like Russia and Turkey have a lot of friends, but in essence not so much, are actually in need of each other.
Technically it is not possible to break these two countries with the entrepreneur, the tourist, the entrepreneur, and the customer in such a night.
If you close the doors, the people of these two countries will enter each other’s country by the way.
It is best to make political discussion on the table without creating the new Reza Zarrabs (Rıza Sarraf) and count there.
Without contaminating the economy.

Previous Post:There’s no disagreement in Celtic
Deila acknowledges that the Hoops are in the bad place and will overcome it, while Griffith doesn’t care about the words of incompatibility in Celtic.

Leader Don's scored the score difference with Celtic
ADAM Rooney's penalty in the first half brought Aberdeen a fair victory against Hamilton in Pittodrie, and gave Don the opportunity to create a five-point difference between themselves and Celtic.
Griffith doesn't care about the words of incompatibility
In Celtic, the rumors of incompatibility are driven by Griffith's opposite hand, saying that he and his team members are not in any way challenged under an increased feeling of observation while preparing to meet the Leader of the Netherlands League.
I don’t think we feel under pressure, I think the players are desperate for it.
The Netherlands is unhappy with the Netherlands and the Netherlands is unhappy with the Netherlands.
The former midfield player of Rangers and former international famous player of Dutch football, Ronald de Boer, says Dutch football enthusiasts have lost their interest in Celtic because they have no competition with Rangers.
De Boer, who is already an Ajax ambassador, said: "They no longer give the summaries of Celtic matches in the Netherlands, why?"
The Rangers are no longer there.
People don’t just talk about the return of Rangers.
They talk about the old team.
They talk together while talking about the teams, they are interested in it.
The tensions were high in the old team's matches and those who wanted to watch those matches were not just Scots.
I swear I am going to fix it.
RONNY Deila Celtic admitted that he was fighting, but the Norwegian boss said the move would return.
After the defeat against Malmö and immediately after the Champions League weddings, he followed the defeated match against Aberdeen, who was in the top position with a five-point difference in the scoring table.
But Deila said, “Celtic has experienced bad days in the past and we’ll go back again.”
Now we want to show ourselves as soon as possible.
I know that the situation is very disappointing and that many people are angry or sad about what happened.
We are in the same situation - but we have to continue.
We really need Celtic’s support because it makes these players feel much better.
It is so important to stay together.

Although just a week or two ago some comments stated the January transfer targets, Rangers' boss Mark Warburton is afraid of the signature, insisting that Ibrox doesn't want to break the team unity.
Former Brentford teacher said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer window."
For players coming in summer, there is a pre-season period that you’ll get used to, we’ve seen it in our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes adding unnecessary players to what you really need is more harmful.
Celtic is targeting Michu on retirement
From Swansea forts, Michu connected with Celtic in the transfer window and lost the forecasts that he could retire when his contract with the Dogs ended.
When he was 29 years old, he experienced unbearable pain from a problematic leg for two years and did not find a way to leave Wales in the summer.
Hearts are preparing for the SFA battle on Neilson's comments
When Paterson was thrown out of the game, the Hearts were 2-1 ahead and then they lost 3-2, after the defense player's red card turned everything back - Collum's third red card to be canceled in eight months.
Neilson doesn’t give up what he said, he continues to insist: “I’ve never questioned the union, I’ve not commented on the performance.”
Griffiths tried to prevent Tynecastle
The obsessed Hibee was disappointed when he spoke a song containing aggressive words about former Heart Actor Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in March 2014 at a bar in the Roseburn district of Edinburgh before the Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle.
"It was a derby match and there was the heat of that moment," the attack player said, adding, "I can definitely say that from now on I will not go to Tynecastle except playing with Celtic.
Tannadice council trusts Dundee United administration - Donnelly
Simon Donnelly is still confident that the management team of the Dundee United board will improve the work - but they agree that the fall in the field should end.
I think Stephen Thompson trusts us.
We’ll make the kids ready to go back,” Donnely said.
Mclness is pleased with the "dirty win" against Hamilton
Derek Mclness acknowledges that Aberdeen's team, thanks to Adam Rooney's penalty in the first half, had to be desperate against Hamilton Accies to see Celtic's upper seventh consecutive victory, which brought them to the top of five points in the league.
Mclnnes said: "There is no team winning anything without winning a match in this way, whether it's cups or leagues."
Unemployment rates in the UK remained the same.
The number of unemployed in Scotland between May and July remained unchanged by 164,000, while the number of unemployed in the UK increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million.
According to the National Bureau of Statistics (ONS), the unemployment rate in Scotland was 5.9 percent higher than 5.5 percent in the UK.
On the other hand, the employment in Scotland dropped 12,000 in three months, and the current number of employees remains 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74,0 percent - this figure is above the average of 73.5 percent in the UK.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: "The long-term plan of the government has put the foundation of a stronger economy."
It has been almost a full year since the date that Scotland decided to remain part of Britain.
In these 12 months we saw developments in the Scottish labour market with increased employment and decreased unemployment.
Why I'm a Testimony of a Death in Oklahoma
Today I will watch the murder of a man due to a late legal intervention in the coming hours.
I hope not, but if that happens, I’ll sit in the watch gallery of the death room in the Oklahoma State Prison while Richard Glossip is executed with a deadly injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses of his death.
The invitation was first made through my best friend in January and I accepted, no matter how shocked I was.
As the day approached, I began to fear it.
So why am I doing that?
I accepted it because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story about a death penalty.
It will provide a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to watch the executions in the United States, and since there is more practice than the existing places, a terrible point appears when deciding who to be chosen.
Oklahoma has lowered its media seats from 12 to 5.
Whoever is chosen, he will follow his feelings.
I cannot do that.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friends and have developed a relationship with him as a result of telephone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit over the past months.
I love that man.
We laugh often when we talk.
The prison officials said I couldn’t be both a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be given a pen and a book to record what I saw.
I will try to remember all the details.
A Oklahoma journalist accused me of dismissing my neutrality via Twitter.
This is the lesson.
Tell the story of the prisoner as he likes, get access.
I complained to him.
He also acknowledged that he could say it better, but he still believes that what I did was wrong.
Richard Glossip does not agree with me in some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what I’m going to write, and if he did, I’t accept it.
I told him that he could get me out of the list of witnesses when he wanted.
But an international journalist is there and wants them to write.
If he dies, he believes that this spread to the public will help the anti-death action.
A Huffington Post reporter, Kim Bellware, will be with me.
If you want more information about this, please listen to the podcast series I’ve prepared.
I will not repeat all the details here.
I have no idea that Richard Glossip is innocent.
What they do after Barry Van Treese's death is enough to make him a criminal partner.
I believe he is not guilty of the murder.
I believe there is absolutely no sufficient evidence to legitimize a death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
I will see his death from this perspective.
I can’t say I’m really objective.
You can look at the other journalists there.
The impressions you will get from me will be the impressions you will get from the sight of the death of a man who is unnecessarily killed.
The man was persuaded from the river Canning after a violent police pursuit.
The Canning Vale police officer was dry while convincing him to get out of the Canning River.
The claim to escape from the police car behind a Perth man ended with the attempt of a police officer to "convince himself to gently return to the coast" in a thin and stumble water.
Canning Vale police were called to Beckenham on Tuesday due to the incident of unauthorized entry.
When they saw the suspect, the man entered the Canning River and tried to escape from the police.
But he didn’t get far away.
“High Deputy Commissioner Shandell Castledine, he himself stood in the water and said, ‘I’m not going out, ‘Come me’.”
Police officer Lachlan Perhavec didn't want to wet his uniform and used a safer tactic - "good police negotiations".
Senior Deputy Commissioner Castledine said, “Sometimes people try funny things to try to escape.”
Football champion Ben Cousins provides a permanent example in mind.
In 2006, a police cousin left his car to escape alcohol control and tried to swim through the Swan River.
Their efforts failed, but it became a source of inspiration for local people’s joking Ben Cousins biathlon planning.
Peter Moody has claimed that he had been spy and threatened to leave the race.
Peter Moody claimed that the Racing Victoria rays were trying to make a trick in their hills last year and threatened him to leave the race immediately.
Racing Victoria targeted the fighters and the unit department and said they had a personal campaign against her to leave Lady Tatai out of the race in their last meal for the race on Wednesday before the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he’s always trying to do the best in the races and said the business to Lidari that he found himself in the power conditions he couldn’t explain when the kobalta gave a positive result.
In front of the spy claims, he said he didn’t want to “look like a bright grape” that he bite his tongue for 18 months.
"I't say this and I've closed it for a long time but sometimes you're very angry and everything happens suddenly," Moody said.
They know that it continues.
Sometimes you show a reaction and you will tolerate its consequences and I will tolerate the consequences of what I say.
When I go home this night I will sleep calmly.
I want to go straight and my bosses know that I’m trying to do my best for them.
When they begin to think I don’t do that, I should no longer be an employer.
I would think what I would do with my license.
Previously, Moody had exploded a bomb in an interview with racing.com, accusing the unity department of being in a spy effort in its oven.
"Eight months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart were sitting in a room with a man - I'll call him if asked - and they offered him to work in my garden in return for telling them what I've done in my gardens," Moody told Racing.com.
They clearly believe that I am a triangular.
If that was the case, they all had to return their brownies because they were not talented enough to catch me.
RVL’s former chairman Robert Roulston, RVL’s new chairman David Moodie and RVL’s current chief executive knew that at the time and now.
Should that make me feel that I started to be personal?
RVL has a series of balls and wants to make people outside operators responsible for what’s going on in the industry?
Is it bad for the industry?
Is it so bad for the industry?
Maybe people outside think that’s the way.
Maybe they need to get my license and throw me out, but I have no doubt what I say will think of them.
But I don’t see anything at the point I’m coming, and that’s sad for me.
This really afflicts me.
I will put pressure on them, and I will put responsibility on them to make decisions.
I have the support of my family and I walk.
The long-lasting kobalt investigation and the disappointment he experienced due to the subsequent crash caused him to say, “Let my license go to the opposite end of the table.”
The not-defeated champion, who was famous for preparing the Black Havyar, called the race day care rule "smiling" and said that the throat of a straw or flare on the foot of the horse was contrary to the rule.
This is contrary to the rules of the race.
I have to take all my responsibility for this.”
One of my men accidentally threw the straw on his foot.
He could take it yesterday night.
It could have happened yesterday, and it could have happened.
took the race day.
Moody may be sentenced to a three-month penalty for the use of sheets on the day of the race as a result of the investigation that the managers opened.
This is a joke.
Those who do these rules do not know anything about the horse.
“We understand that we need the rules, but that’s going very forward,” Moody said.
A driver who fled at Cobram was arrested.
The police arrested a man who was hit by a bicycle in Cobram on a weekend.
A cyclist was transported from the air to the Royal Melbourne Hospital on Saturday morning after a car hit him on the Murray Valley Highway due to serious injuries.
Police said the driver had escaped from the scene without helping the injured.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia was surrendered to the police station in Shepparton.
Not to stop in an accident, not to help and other traffic crimes are expected to be accused.
A 40-year-old cyclist is still stable in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm Trainer Craig Bellamy Reacted Hard To The Requirements Of The Competition
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called criticisms targeting his team as an effort to "create agenda" for NRL's two favorite priorities.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said on Friday night in the semi-final in Sydney in the match where Storm was stumbled, the judges allowed them to "match" with their own team.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett, after the semi-final match that the team won against North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, made a very unfinished message to Storm, quoted that match as a "happy" match for the rugby league and said the two Oueensland were not "very big" in the match.
Bellamy defended the team’s struggle and said they were focusing only on “temas” while fighting.
Bellamy said it was powered by criticism from the two leading coaches to the team because it meant that they were worried that Storm would defeat them.
This arrival continues - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talks about the match when they defeated us 24-2, Bellamy said on Wednesday.
Over the course of the year, I guarantee that we have not changed anything in our defense systems or techniques, we have only made a real emphasis on our fighting contacts in the last six weeks and this has been a turning point for us.
Trent has been there for three years and obviously there is a big team that has been tracking and is probably not used to losing with a little shock for himself.
It’s funny that this happened at this time of the year.
Bellamy opposed the idea of Bennett's "thinking football", reminding Bennett's 2010 St. George-Illawarra Dragons primacy to the winning coach by playing "thinking" football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared our Friday night match with his own matches on Saturday night and how exciting their match was," Bellamy said.
I remember St George was criticized in 2010 because he was a boring team and Wayne said he would not even give the mouse hole.
But now we have a team to play football that we can call exciting football and especially the young half with their speeds.
This is the football you want to play when you have this type of players.
He put this point in 2010, now everyone wants to play football in this way - every team has no half (two) like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so it's not possible to play in this way.
This gives me more confidence because they even talk like that because they’re a bit afraid of playing.
When they went to the big matches six weeks ago they probably didn’t bring us to mind.
Bellamy also pointed out that the Storm and Roosters match had a higher score than the Broncos and Cowboys match.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven’t seen it yet, but what was the score? 16-12?
Our match is 20 - 18, the score of both sides in our match is more but exciting football is this?
Or is it exciting to cut the attacks but not to do the score-leading attacks?
I think this is my day.
If they talk about us, that means that we will meet them here in a future stage.
Storm, North Queensland Cowboys or Cronulla Sharks's tickets are not available this weekend because they won the right to host at AAMI Park on Saturday night in the first final match to be sold on Tuesday.
Serbian man released $200,000 for drug crime
The man who was caught over 40 kilograms of cocaine in Queensland and suffered a possible life imprisonment was released for $200,000.
29-year-old Marko Maksimovic was one of five people captured last month by the federal police, who was tracking 100 kg of drugs from the Solay ship, which came from South America through Vanuatu and was dropped to the port in Coomera in August.
Maximovic was seen at a marine meeting with his criminal partners throughout the morning and then met with them at the Coomera Roadhouse cafe where the police found 40 pounds of the drug inside a Toyota Echo.
Despite the possibility of a potential perpetual punishment due to the commercial quantity of cocaine, Maksimovic's lawyer said there was no evidence that he was trying to possess all the drugs and that he could be in the cafe for an innocent purpose.
The Supreme Court Judge Peter Flanagan was worried that Maksimovic was at risk of escape.
It has open links to Serbia.
He travels frequently to Serbia,” he said on Wednesday at the court.
He lie to the police about the place he was in the case.
Maximovic's mother and grandfather offered $200,000 for his release.
Judge Flanagan said, "It is clear that the $200,000 fault price, after both people read their sweeping statements, is a real financial burden on them."
But he warned that this alone was not enough to prevent him from entering the case.
Maximovic was freed in return for delivering his passports to both Australia and Serbia, and for the prohibition to go to the police every day and to go to the street between 6 and 6 in the evening.
Stevan Hogg used the girl's phone to attract pedophiles to send images
A pedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to ask for images of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, logging in an online messaging service and provided her with a series of unsuitable children's visual messages sent to her by another user.
The girl then woke up and noticed that she had no phone and found her phone in the hands of the sleeping Hogg.
She looked at her and noticed the annoying messages immediately before warning her mother.
Police were interested and saw five images, then analyzed the computers on the address and discovered "related" web searches made using terms aimed at finding unsuitable children's images.
Hogg later claimed to the officials that the reason for doing this was to “manage the pedophiles on the internet” and “bear as a police and scare them.”
Financial adviser Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: "He said that it was a addiction - that it was a addiction that scared people.
He admitted that the searches were carried out by the computer, but he said he did it to behave like a police officer to scare pedophiles.
Questions were asked about the conversations with the unknown person who sent the pictures to him and who wanted to send more pictures than them.
He said he did it to attract them.
When he was drunk, he said he was stuck with sick ideas and wanted to watch images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on her phone, she cried and called to her mother and was turning and crying.
My mother saw the inappropriate pictures on the phone and the accusations came after.
She was interviewed with the girl and she said she used the computer and PlayStation to look younger than the accused.
The 23-year-old Hogg, who lives in Ward Road, Dundee, was found guilty of taking or producing unsuitable children's pictures on June 14 last year, infringing misery on January 25 this year, and not attending court on March 24 this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim said that Hogg was not included in the category of sexual crimes as it could be discussed that there was no "specific sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has delayed the case to October when the social history study report will be released.
Hogg was unfortunately released in this case but was held in eye prison for other unusual cases.
Sexual offences were recorded before the date of sentence.
Robert Mugabe made a false speech in Zimbabwe
Mr. Mugabe, the oldest leader in Africa, fell from the stairs when he went down from a podium earlier this year.
He was not injured but the video of the crash went viral on social media.
The opening of the parliament was marked by the claims of the opposition members that they had received an unnamed death threat in the event of Mr. Mugabe's speech.
In his speech to the nation he spoke in the parliament last month, they had swallowed him and constantly cut his speech - he repeated the same speech on Tuesday.
Democratic Change Movement (MDC) leader Innocent Gonese has announced that seven opposition politicians have received messages to their mobile phones so that they don’t bother him during Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
“After Mr. Mugabe’s speech is over, the message comes to journalists from an invisible number but the title is ‘Death’,” he said.
He tells the members that their non-touch is valid within the parliament and that when they leave the parliament, the non-touch does not work.
The spokesman said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "disrupted" because of threats to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard will terminate 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in terms of rebuilding and cost-reduction efforts in corporate service business.
HP will be divided into two companies listed at the time of this year; it will separate the computer and printer business from the firm’s hardware and service operations that grow faster.
In a statement, HP that the expected dismissal would result in a cost of approximately $2.7 billion at the beginning of the fourth quarter.
Meg Whitman, chairman and executive chairman of HP after the departure, said: “These rebuilding activities will provide a more competitive and sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Company.”
"Whitman,Hewlett Packard Company will be smaller and more focused than today's HP, and we will have a wide and deep portfolio that will help companies move to a new business style," he said.
As a separate company, we are much better than ever to meet the growing needs of our customers worldwide.
According to a statement by the company, Hewlett Packard’s annual revenue will exceed $50 billion and will focus on “providing unconcurrently integrated technology solutions for companies.”
The garage in Palo Alto divides the company, called the "Silikon Valley's birthplace" and founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electric equipment.
HP is going through a major reorganization to deal with the transition from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world’s largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is one of the latest moves in the industry in the belief that firm focuses on better performance.
Arsenal Captain Mikel Arteta says his team members have problems with Wilshere's injury before the match in Dinamo Zagreb
Wenger emphasized that Wilshere's disability occurred in September and that his treatment was planned and there was no reason he could not play in the Christmas rows.
The best scenario already means that Wilshere will definitely miss at least four matches in England, and it seems unclear to the extent that he will participate in the European Championship in the coming summer when he looks into his past.
The most shameful side of the last problem is that Wilshere has finished the last season strongly after a separate leg injury and then has searched for his old pre-season sharpness.
This kind of disability career is not threatening, Wenger said.
This is an unhealthy bone.
Not a big thing.
It was just an accident.
It has no connection with your arms or previous injuries.
From a medical perspective, this may be true, but as Wenger accepts, there is also the risk of a player returning in the middle of the season to get further injured.
There is also an uncomfortable pattern that develops.
According to a study conducted by Promier Injury Ltd, Wilshere has had 23 different disorders recorded since the beginning six years ago.
In the last five seasons he played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league matches.
In the big picture, Arsenal is one of two Premier League teams who lost mostly due to disabilities in six of eight seasons since 2007-08.
Wenger acknowledges the potential of a scratch cycle, but he believes Arsenal will continue to recover in the last season’s disability record.
"Sometimes you experience a period open to injury while you get back from a disability, it's a process you want to strengthen your body and win the fight," Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to get out of it.
I hope his body is stable, I trust it and I believe that he will do the career he deserves.
The Champions League matches will be played on Saturday before Arsenal, which will start on Wednesday night against Dinamo Zagreb, and Tottenham Hotspur matches will be played on Wednesday, Wenger’s team is preparing for them.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey didn’t go to Croatia, it makes sense that he would play with Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta.
Wenger can start with Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott instead of Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud.
“I’m trying to maintain the balance and give players the breath they need,” Wenger said.
Although Arsenal is one of the open favourites of the F Group, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is among the most scared stadiums in Europe.
Dinamo has won 41 matches after producing his own "Namağlup" campaign last season.
The stadium was struck by a 3.2 magnitude earthquake on Tuesday night, according to Richter scale.
This is the 10th shock in Zagreb this year.
Wenger believes Arsenal has received the necessary lesson from the defeat against Monaco in the Champions League last season and continues to be motivated by the distant goal of bringing the first European Cup victory to the club.
“This motivation is enormous,” Wenger says.
This has never happened in Arsenal.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand I have enough experience to be realistic.
We are passionate, but we are not dreaming.
FriendsFest: a comedy program that gives us serious lessons about men's friendship
The absence of similar ports in the programs is remarkable; especially in such a period when men need more to open up and when the suicide rates among young men are at the top of 15 years.
In 2013, this was the largest cause of male deaths between the ages of 20-45; and it was three times more in men than in women.
To draw attention to this problem, the Anti-Life Campaign (CALM) has announced 2015 as the Men's Year and aims to counter the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
There is friendship at the center of the struggle to accomplish this difficult task.
A study conducted among more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms showed that a person suffering from this disorder has doubled his chances of recovery if he has a high number of "healthy" friends.
In the same way, a circle of mentally healthy friends for non-depressed people will decrease mental difficulties that may arise by half.
But, of course, it is necessary to be accessible first for friendship to work.
In this age in which social media focuses on communication, it makes priority for urgent response rather than meaningful communication with a focus on style rather than content.
Our digital life has doubled the need to look like strong, entertaining, and successful people; even if in fact everything is the head of isolation.
The concepts that psychologists call externally-driven values are under the domination of money, image, social status; the inner values that have a deeper impact on our mental health - our inner desire for personal development and friendship - are pursuing them.
As a billionaire video game creator recently revealed, money doesn’t buy more happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was to turn this focus down the head.
The characters were defined not by their works but by their personalities; and they showed it by their interactions with their friends.
The frequent hugs of Joey and Chandler, the minutes they watch football on comfortable chairs, the relationships of Ross with Rachel all came from the knowledge that they could actually relate to them, even if they were back-planned to describe the men’s feelings exactly.
One helpful employee told me, “When I listened to people who tend to depression and suicide, I saw how even the smallest interactions between friends could make a difference.”
Most of the men who communicate with us don’t talk to their friends.
A feeling like “passing and going” is very strong, and the idea is that being open to others is a sign of weakness.”
When I suggest long-term handling mechanisms, one of the programs I think is the Friends series.
He emphasized the little moments of his friendship.
According to my goal, a foreign status on the phone helps people at times when they are in difficulty; but long-term support comes from family and friends with close personal networks.
And if you join the FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, why not take your friends to Central Perk for a drink in this beautiful environment where the scenes are re-designed for celebration?
Or, better, if you see someone alone at Starbucks, smile and say hello.
You don’t know how your friendship will make a difference.
Friends, from the beginning to the end in Comedy Central - all 236 episodes - are released for #FriendsFest
Di Maria made it easy for PSG to defeat Malmö
Angel Di Maria made a celebration with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his goal to Malmö.
Angel Di Maria made it easy for the PSG's goalkeeper to pass the Swedish team to Malmö on Tuesday at the start of the Champions League.
Here is the match report and the match reactions.
In the match targeted by Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani, Paris Saint-Germain started the Champions League match with a 2-0 final victory against Malmö on Tuesday at Parc des Princes Stadium.
Di Maria was the PSG player who allowed the French champion to continue his way in the Champions League before four minutes, but in the 61st minute they couldn't evaluate the chances to the second goal that Cavani had thrown with his head.
Paris, along with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, needed to make a strong start against the Swedish champion, not only to get out of the elimination groups, but also to improve the quarter-final performance in the last three championships.
But the game they played when they got the points was not the best game of the time for Laurent Blanc's team, Zlatan Ibrahimovic spent a lot of positions around the penalty field and with him in 1999 he was later removed against the country's team where he began his glorious career.
"It's not easy to win either inside or outside in the Champions League, so winning 2-0 will create problems for our competitors, and even though there are some things we need to improve in the season, it's a good start to give a comfortable picture behind," Blanc said.
This is a good sign.
We wanted to win, though I was amazed that we didn’t score one or two more goals, and we wanted to win.
After the injury, Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team with one of the three changes in the 2-2 match played in the 1st League with Bordeaux at the end of the week, but in the fourth minute he remained in the shadow of Di Maria.
The Argentine wing player was seen as a player to bring the PSG to a higher level in Europe when transferred from Manchester United last month, and Marco Veratti showed that it was unrighteous for those who thinks that it was unrighteous when the Malmö defendant ran behind and sent Johan Wiland from a distant corner with a beautiful blow.
However, everyone was disappointed to expect PSG to win a big victory.
Malmö was set to the field with nine international players who defeated Celtic in the play off to pass this tour, with a five-man defense and two players in the mid-field depth, a heavy remaining rival.
In the 34th minute, Nikola Djurdjic made very few attacks, except the shut that scattered the roof of the corner that Kevin Trapp protected.
On the other hand, PSG gave them the opportunity to slow down the game with unnecessary passes and inefficient final hits, Ibrahimovic did not make a final move in at least five attacks in the first half, and when the second half began, he caused disappointment by failing to stick to Cavani's game.
However, when he came to organize his co-workers, he showed that he was more skillful, and Ibrahimovic gave the pass of the false blow that Di Maria sent to the castle of Wiland in the 52nd minute.
The second goal came thanks to Cavani after a full hour, the Uruguayan player recorded his sixth goal in the season with the head that Maxwell revealed from the left wing after Ibrahimovic's break.
The idea that Malmö would return to the match was exhausted and after the unreliable goal that Ezequiel Lavezzi, who later entered the game, scored in an unreliable manner, Wiland perfectly saved David Luiz's shut in the empty position and did not allow the score to change .
Later Malmö coach Age Hareide admitted that PSG was a class superior to his team, the Norwegian said: "Our last Champions League match was in December last year."
Since that date we have only played the ball in the Swedish League that is not at the same level as him.
The teams are not enough.
The hat was taken to Paris.
It was a great match for them.
Glencore earnings $2.5 billion from stock sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore hit the fall in processed goods prices and earned $2.5 billion by selling its shares on Wednesday within the plan to divide its debt.
Glencore, listed in London, has announced that it has sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay its debt.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, was seriously affected by its falling goods prices due to China’s economic slowdown that led to demand rise and market confusion.
The rights issue led to Glencore’s stock prices to rise at the London Stock Exchange early on Wednesday morning.
The shares in the FTSE 100 index jumped up 0.69 per cent higher, up 2.77 per cent to 131.60 penny.
Glencore last week announced its $2.5 billion stock sales plan, which was part of its plans to reduce the $30 billion debt volume to one-third.
The company sold its new shares for 125 pounds per share and this figure was 2.4 percent discount compared to Tuesday closing.
The group sold 1.3 billion shares equal to 9.99 percent.
China’s long-lasting growth concerns have cut the price of iron rubber almost by half; coal, copper and other goods have fallen between 20 and 40 percent.
White House confirms Xi Jinping’s visit to Washington
The White House on Tuesday confirmed that Chinese President Xi Jinping will be on an official visit to the United States by the end of the month.
The first official visit of Xi to Washington will take place on September 25 and is a return visit to Barack Obama who arrived in Beijing last November.
Following the two presidents' bilateral talks, the US President and First Lady Michelle Obama will give a dinner in honor of Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan.
“President Xi’s visit will expand the U.S.-China cooperation in regional and global matters as well as the relations between the two countries, and will enable President Obama and President Xi to deal constructively with disputed matters.”
The visit was announced for the first time in February, and it is expected that Xi will visit Seattle before Washington and meet with some U.S. technology leaders, and then move to New York to attend the United Nations General Assembly in September.
It is expected that Obama and Xi will also discuss Washington’s concerns about the allegations that China is conducting cyber spy activities and some controversial issues, including China’s claim of sovereignty in the South China Sea.

Matt Damon opposed African-American filmmaker Effie Brown, saying it is not necessary to be behind the camera during a discussion of interest in diversity.
In the Project Greenlight Sunday Night episode published on HBO, Brown cuts the word of an experienced actor while emphasizing the need for alternative perspectives on the black main character in the project's chosen script.
Damon, when we talk about diversity, claimed that you do this in the show’s actor’s role, not in the film’s actor’s role.
Brown, shocked, reacted that he was opposed to the comments of the actor of the Marseille film while continuing with statements like "Hey!
Damon and Brown were gathered together by the brothers Ben Affleck and Farrelly to discuss the finalists of the show.
Brown previously said, "I wanted to tell people how they will behave with the character of Compatibility, no matter who the director is."
The only black character is a prostitute shot by a white chat tape.
Dear White People’s publisher insisted on the rights to direct the film and demanded the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio. Damon replied their assignments in the form of “can end as we don’t want”.
After the debate was posted, there was an explosion of dissatisfaction against Damon's comments on social media.
MrPooni, a Twitter user, wrote: “Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room, and he can explain his diversity about this person as it suffers by the White Isis.”
After the tweet was posted, it received 5,000 retweet and 4,000 likes.
Damon’s comments came at the time that the correct expression of race in the media was in the forefront of social discussions.
After being murdered by a young white police officer named Michael Brown in 2014, the Black Life is Important movement effectively encouraged lawmakers and authorities across the country to stop discrimination against colourful people.
In February, singer Prince spoke off the movement closely when the nominations for the Year's Album were presented at the Grammy Awards.
The albums are important.
Albums like books and black lives are still important.
Recently, the leadership of the movement has published a statement in response to the question of Elisabeth Hasselbeck, an important figure in Fox News, whether the group should be considered a hatred group.
Leaders said the Black Life is Important Network is a group of love.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in the list of show artists, producers and media bosses invited to visit the Pope to discuss the identification of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not yet clear whether he has accepted the invitation or whether he has met with the Pope.
American Ninja Warrior wins his first champion
The professional rock climber and comedian Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to receive a $1 million prize by winning the American Ninja Warrior program on Monday night.
This competition in the seventh season had never seen a competitor who was able to complete all the stages in the obstacles track before.
In the final season, Caldiero and Geoff Britten managed to stay in the final round.
The last mission was to climb a row of about 20 meters in 30 seconds.
Britten was the first to complete this trail in time, and so he managed to be the first athlete to complete the challenging 4th stage of the American Ninja Warrior; but Caldiero won by completing this trail three seconds before him.
After this challenging victory, Caldiero spoke to E!News with the shock of winning a $1 million big prize.
Isaac told E! a huge increase in his salary, “I think it’s great to think about it, I’ve never earned or spent more than $10,000 a year.”
So it happened at a moment...I can’t even imagine how it will be...the future is unknown.
The producer Kent Weed de discussed the final with The Hollywood Reporter and explained why he would not be awarded any prizes, although he was the first competitor to finish the track.
According to the rules, the money is delivered as quickly as possible.
Weed said, "If one who finishes more than one, he wins the award that makes it the fastest."
Though money was a great reward and life changed, it also won a great reward.
I don’t think you have a bad idea about it.
I am so happy that he did what he did.
He received a lot of praise from his fans.
A great man and a family father.
He is a hero for his children and his wife.
Geoff said to me, “If someone defeats me, I’m glad that it’s Isaac.”
I think if the roles had changed, Isaac would think the same thing.
The American Ninja Warrior has renewed its contract for the eighth season and the shooting will begin in Spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers Miss Minnesota Twins
Minneapolis -- The second half of the season was not very pleasant for Detroit Tigers.
The Tigers, once one of the best of baseball, is now in the final of the American Central League.
The Tigers, who dropped the game into a disturbance, was able to defeat Minnesota Twins 5-4 on Target Field on Tuesday, making a perfect game.
The Twins lost the chance to rise to the Wild Card of the United States League by overcoming the half-point difference between Houston Astros.
For Detroit, even if it was a night, it was a return to a good game in most of the second half of the season.
The manager of Tigers, Brad Ausmus, said, “All victories are pleasant, whatever way they are.”
Tiger's ball shooter Alfredo Simon managed to get one number in the sixth and ninth shots, showing early attack support with Detroit's three-fold numbering in the first two shots.
Simon (13-9) made six 3/1 shots in a row, three of which were running.
This was only the third quality start in the last nine rounds.
“I just want to close the year strongly,” Simon said.
It’s hard to waste every game for backups, so I also wanted to go deep into the game.
The Tigers' selected shooter, Victor Martinez, made three hits and two were running, which was the first RBI he won since mid-August.
This was the first three-touch night on this side of the four battles Martinez won against Seattle Mariners on 6 July.
“He hardly swallowed the sand,” Ausmus said.
It looked good (in the shooting training), it was already clearly better in the BP that it continued in the game.
At the end of the seventh hit row, Twins, who captured the right to run three, got the best chance to enter the game again.
The middle-field player Byron Buxton has started the hit order by making a double on the left-field line.
The right-field player Aaron Hicks could only make a slow blow and Simon captured BrianDozier to make a blow while shooting before he lifts to the left for BlaineHardy.
Mauer moved forward with courage with the only player who was able to oppose the shooter Miguel Sano, who passed the right wing player Drew VerHagen in the run.
In the second binding run, VerHagen with a pair of runners managed to pull the third cast Trevor Plouffe into the double game.
Plouffe's blow to the DP this season was the 27th time in the big league.
After dealing with the race to guarantee Detroit's ninth, Mauer passed the RBI and opened the interface with the Tigers and made 5-4 and approached Bruce Rondon.
However, he was captured in three shots to Sano for the right fifth rescue.
Detroit gained advantage with the early departure of Phil Hughes who lost his form.
The Tigers won three runs in the first two shootings against an experienced right-fifty player who was away from the field for more than a month due to their back burning and just came out of the disability.
“Of course, that’s not the game I want to play,” Hughes said, “but I felt more comfortable in the continuation and I managed to make quite good shots in the third shot.”
When he made a successful shot in the first, Hushes took Ian Kinsler out of the game.
The right-wing player J.D. Martinez's two-time departure left Victor Martinez alone in the first run of the match.
Victor Martinez competed with the runners to cross the 0-21 band in the numbering position.
The third castler Nick Castellanos watched to the right with one shot, the other won a run but Victor Martinez was thrown while he wanted to do the third, so the threats ended.
The Tiger added in the second, with an outer pair from the captive James McCann and an outer pair from the middle-field player Anthony Gose, they made the situation 3-0.
Twin's manager Paul Molitor said it was "a big blow."
He didn't get a good shot but he threw it in the right place.
Hughes, who counted the shots, made three shots that didn’t get a number until he was replaced with the right fifty rescue A.J. Achter.
Hughes was accused of three runs in six shots and four untouched shots.
NOTE: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez was out of play due to pain in the shoulder he used to throw.
He will be examined by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez's shoulder surgery in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the list of injuries due to shoulder pain since mid-August, is scheduled to start studies on Wednesday.
In the absence of Sanchez, the Twins will start with LHP Daniel Norris DL.
Since the match held on July 30 for David Price transfer, Norris and Tiger are 1-1 in four matches.
He has not been playing since August 20 due to pain on the right side.
Tiger and Twin will finish their three matches on Wednesday at Target Field.
Norris (2-2, 4.43 ERA) will fight Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73 ERA).
Xi wants to open the economy to the world more
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a group responsible for managing the reforms that the economy needs to be more open to the outside to accelerate growth.
At the 16th Central Lead Group Meeting to Strengthen General Reforms, the President said, "China should develop its opening policies by attracting foreign investment expertise."
Xi said, while encouraging opening up, making new reforms will create a new space for economic growth, bringing a new energy and vitality.
The lead group adopted a series of recommendations such as a negative list of regulating market access, a relaxation in border control policies, encouraging the government’s organizations to add private capital (SOE) and a review of the registering system of settlements.
According to the statement, a negative list of sectors and branches that are prohibited for investment will be prepared.
The system will be gradually tested and developed with experimental programs.
This is an important move, as it will play a greater role in allocating resources to the market and will make the market more open by providing a law-based business environment.
The government will also relieve its control over companies, allowing companies to carry out their own business.
The statement also states that China will examine new models of cross-border economic cooperation in the border areas and that new mechanisms will be implemented to encourage regional growth.
More areas will be opened to private investments to open the sectors controlled by the state.
The statement said, “the government will not change its foreign investment policy, and will provide better services to them by protecting the interests of foreign funded companies.”
In addition, the requirements for foreigners to obtain permanent residence permits or "green card" will be optimized and the application processes will be facilitated.
The guarantee of the practical rights of lawyers and the training of professional judges and prosecutors were also discussed in the meeting.
According to a statement released after the meeting, Prime Minister Li Keqiang and senior leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli also attended the meeting.
The miniature bag is now very fashion-time newspaper
In the fashion world, the roads turn around and come to the bags.
One of the most recent events in the world is the Minecraft...
It is also possible to say that small bags attached to the big ones attract attention.
Everything that is small is beautiful.
This point of view also applies to bags.
While he was almost unable to pass the streets with bags of the bag size, suddenly the wind began to rise in the opposite direction and the bags began to be smaller.
There were small bags already, but this time they came to us with the small shorts of big hand bags.
These small bags can only fit your phone, credit card and key.
The stream started with Céline and Hermès, spread with Prada.
The admiration of the bag becomes a miniature curiosity has also influenced the newly emerging models.
Loewe presented the fun bags that he prepared this season in two sizes.
The panda, the polar bear and the elephant-shaped bags are the most elephant-looking ones.
The mini-lengths of big bags offered by luxury brands with phenomenal names appear to have again attracted the most red carpet celebrity.
The "Birkin" bag that Hermes prepared for Jane Birkin was one of the most popular.
Although Jane Birkin said she didn't want her name to be mentioned in a bag in a press statement, it's now in her memories.
The weekly fashion has made the mini bag flow massive.
There are also mini baggage in front.
It is not possible to put them in your arms because they are pretty small.
They can be used with long tracks.
But in the podiums we saw those long hangs, more as wrapped in the arms of the models.
Fendi is the one who carries the mini bag position to a point forward.
There’s a recommendation for those who don’t fit in the small bag but don’t give up.
A small small bag with big bags.
How to?
Converting mini bags into a bag decoration that can be attached to the big ones.
The show that appears in the podiums has quickly found its reward in the street.
Let’s see what we’ll see more!
Change in the test
Turkey will compete with the world's brands in the field of denim.
This experience in production is now enriched with design.
Loft is one of them.
We see that some black models, which were previously a few, are now starting to take their place on the roofs every season.
During this season, the black men found their closest friend.
The skin pieces and skin detailed designs stand out as a gentle friend of the denim.
Generally, the closed short models called "motorbike" are on the agenda.
The strong air of the skin is again filled with black pieces; the syphon long blues, bright sweats give a sporty elegant look.
In the past, young people were dressed and wanted to disappear in the crowd.
It was thought to save the day.
Now the young people want to move a piece that emphasizes the elegance as comfortable as well.
From this point of view, it is possible to say that Loft is correctly understanding the target audience with the collections and complementary pieces prepared.
A small step for Banksy, a big step for "global"
The world premiere of the collection "The Art of Banksy", which brings together the works of the mysterious street artist Banksy, was held in Istanbul.
The exhibition, which is the product of the artist’s 15 years of work and the 85 original works first gathered together, is the first exhibition of the Global Karaköy building.
The first exhibition of the mysterious street artist Bansky in Istanbul was opened the day before at the Global Karaköy (Rıhtım Caddesi).
The world-famous artist who hidden his identity and used mysterious names, of course, was not at the opening.
We don’t know if they’re going to Istanbul.
But the exhibition co-chairman Steve Lazaridas said Bansky was not even aware of the exhibition.
There is no need for permission from him.
Because the way of Bansky and Lazaridas, the former friends, separated after 12 years.
Some of the exhibited works were collected from Lazaridas, and some from collectors.
But there are things that Bansky followers are concerned about.
What did Banksy think of the exhibition “The Art of Banksy” where 85 works were gathered together?
For example, how would it be to receive the entrance to the exhibition with a ticket (35 TL)? what would it be if you saw the small store created at the end of the 800 square meters gallery area?
The Red Balloon Girl, the Cleaner, the Rose Now like the world’s wounds, the works that draw attention to the subjects, would sound that their work was printed on the rubber bags, on the wallets, the collars were made?
The fact that the exhibition of an artist with an anarchist spirit hiding his identity becomes such a consumer material is a disappointment for Banksy's followers.
Not Banksy’s style.
But you still get a limited number of tickets without exhausting!
The big exhibition for the small, globalized world for Banksy "The Art of Banksy" can be seen until April.
They are humble and unjust.
If they go, they go.
President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan continued his reaction to the academics who signed the statement.
He said, “These are unrighteous, these are humble.”
For those who are with the unrighteous are unrighteous.
“They have committed the same crime because they were with those who committed the massacre.”
Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who left the carnival instead of the explosion in Sultanahmet, said: "In this action in the Sultanahmet Square, which is a fairly peaceful square of history and civilization, especially near the German Fountain, I shared our regrets for the death of 10 of our German friends in such a region with the German President and the German Chancellor.
I want to express my greetings to all the people of Germany, first of all, to the families of the dead.”
“Our fight against terror will continue with determination.”
Erdogan, who continued to react to the scholars who signed the statement, said: "I repeatedly condemn, especially, the scholars who stood up against all these terror events and published a covered statement and put the signature under those massacres, and I strongly condemn."
It does not make it clear that our people understand who they are much closer, that is, that the professor is not a professor in front of them.
These are dark people.
These are unjust, and they are low.
They committed the same crime because they were with the murderers.
This is the case in Chinar, where will those dogs, the three-year-old Mevlüde, who was a martyr with his father, be put to this dark academic place?
How do they shelter their conscience to sit next to their murders?
I invite all the judicial authorities, the senates of the universities to take office because of these movements that are contrary to our constitution and our laws.
I said yesterday that the steps to be taken should be taken quickly.
Whatever they do, they will do there.
Those who want to make politics should make politics in parliament.
But if they can’t do it in parliament, let them go and go to the hills or go to the mountains.
I speak so clearly and clearly.

Celine Dion has lost her wife.
Canadian singer Celine Dion's wife, René Angélil, has died.
Angélil discovered Dion's talent when he was 12 years old and married in 1994 in Montreal.
In 1999, after being diagnosed with cancer, Celine Dion stopped her career.

Mete Gümürhan's second documentary "Young Pehlivans", 66.
The Berlin Film Festival (11-21 February) was the first Turkish documentary to be selected for the "Generation Lplus" section.
Gümürhan, which was originally Edirneli but a manufacturing company in the Netherlands, told him why and how he captured the documentary he completed in the summer of 2014.
The "Young Pehlivans" documentary, which tells the story of the Amasian six-in-school student who aims to become the world champion in the competition, will compete in the "Generation Kplus" section of the Berlin Film Festival.
The Young Pehlivaners, the first Turkish documentary to be selected for this section, is one of the candidates for the Crystal Moon Award.
Although birth growth is Dutch, it is actually an Edirneli director Mete Gümürhan.
When he was a child, he arrived in the summer holidays in Turkey, he listened to his grandfather’s oil racing stories and watched the matches.
“There are no political problems in Turkey.
I wanted to tell the world what else was happening in Anatolia.
"For example, the race from our horse sports is unfortunately unknown," he thought he wanted to meet with 6 directors and prepare a documentary project.
This project remains unsuccessful, but one day the magazine news he read on the plane opens the door of another project to Gümürhan.
We stayed in a sugar factory.
The 10-11 year old fighter, Mete Gümürhan, who follows the story of two little brothers, goes to Samsun where the family lives.
The father of the children is not allowed to be photographed for the documentary.
Gümürhan tells me how he overcome this difficulty: "I thought what I could do throughout the day.
The support of the Ministry of Culture could be withdrawn.”
The father talked about a school in Amasya where the children would go.
My thought came to go there.
I met 26 children who were interested in competing at school while looking for two children.
We started the shooting preparations in a week and finished the licenses.
We had no place to stay.
“We stayed in the sugar factory’s bedroom.
The recording was the biggest challenge that the documentary, completed in three weeks, brought to the director.
Gümürhan, a foreign image director and speaker who says that three different languages are spoken in the set where he works, "I didn't know what I would encounter when drawing."
“They didn’t know Turkey.”
The young Pehlivan focuses on the story of six of the 26 children fighters.
Baran, grown up by his grandfather and suffering from a weight problem, Harun, who cannot participate in the training because he broke his arm, the ambitious but health problems of Beytullah, the school's sweet child Hope, the smallest champion Ahmet and the group of Muhammad who keeps together.
Mete Gümürhan tells his work with the children as follows: "I left them completely natural."
I just tried to use Muhammad everywhere.
I took the first week and a half of my training.
I wanted the kids to act as if they had no camera.
They quickly get used to it.”
The election to Berlin was a surprise.
Mete Gümürhan said he didn’t expect the young Pehlivans to be elected to the Berlin Film Festival, “We had a pleasure but we were surprised to be elected to Berlin.”
Young Pehlivan isn’t a sports documentary, it’s a work that tells the children’s struggles and cuts from their lives.
"I wanted to put the stories in the forefront of children with family problems trying to identify and deal with their problems," he said.
Support for academics from the world of art
After the announcement of the "Academic Initiative for Peace" the storm broke to the opening of the investigation and arrest of the academics yesterday, on the one hand, the support statements come afterwards.
The first support came from literaries, among them many famous names.
The previous day the filmmakers, yesterday the theaters, announced their support.
In a statement signed by the 138 theaters, “We stand next to this honorable meeting of the Academics who are calling for peace as artists working in the field of theatre and theatre-gostery arts, and declaring that we are next to freedom of expression, equality, the right to life and unconditional peace.”
“With our support and all our hearts, we add our voice to the call for negotiation and peace of the academics.”
Among them are Deniz Türkali, Atilla Özdemiroğlu, Nadir Sarıbacak, Özcan Alper, Serra Yılmaz, Honur Ünlü, Yeşim Ustaoğlu, Pelin Esmer, Tolga Karaçelik and more than 400 filmmakers.
But without but without you: "We will not be a partner of this crime!"
Academics for Peace Initiative, “We are with the Academics” was supported.
The Film Writers’ Association (SYYAD) also made a statement saying, “We are at the side of the academics who have become the target of the Lynch campaign.”
The Academic Initiative for Peace, on January 11th, with the simultaneous statements they held in Ankara and Istanbul, called for peace and negotiations to the government, published a statement entitled "We are not a partner of this crime".
The text was signed by 1128 academics at 89 universities as well as theories and books and world-renowned thinkers such as Noam Chomsky, David Harvey, Immanuel Wallerstein, Judith Butler, Etienne Balibar.
President Erdoğan and Prime Minister Davutoglu criticized the statement of the academics in the form of "terrorist support" and called on the institutions to "do their right".
After this call, while some universities ended the work of academics, the prosecutor's office began a serious investigation.
Many academics were arrested yesterday.
My fans, please help me.
Hürrem Sultan's red hair, Beren's nose, Justin's hair...
While trying to look like celebrity is normal to some extent, it is seen as a psychological disorder after the point it starts to affect life completely.
‘Celebrity worship syndrome’, the other ‘signature worship syndrome’, is a topic that has already become an academic topic in the world, and in us it is newly discussed.
It can be normal to somewhere to run the ladies with famous photographs.
But we must not forget the 'Hurrem Sultan' year in which all adolescents walked in Ireland with red hair.
It was that in the 2015’s aesthetic operations we left behind the head of the ‘Beren nose’ had already been.
The situation on the front is not very different.
He was dressed like a Polat Alemdar.
And now, the opposite is a wind that turns around.
Justin Bieber's copy was filled with boys and stone around us.
As far as this unnecessary information we quote has been read thousands of times on the internet: “First, when you go to the barber, cut the side of your hair, the top of your ear and the surrounding side, to the top of your head.”
Only the sides will be short.
After the cutting process is completed, you should shape your hair with light water.
After the shape process is finished, fix your hair with the help of the spray.
"Justin needs to shape when it is moist to get hair."
All of this has already become an academic topic in the world, and the newly spoken ‘Celebrity worship syndrome’, which is called the other ‘signature worship syndrome’.
The fans of the celebrities are seen as a love foam in us.
The artists are proud of their number of fans, how much they have influenced them.
Fortunately, the psychological situation is not so simple.
In particular, it is discussed that teenagers decide what to eat and drink, what to listen, what to wear according to celebrity.
Excessive devotion to the names presented as inaccessible is defined as mental discomfort to take a role model.
Specialist psychologist Sümeyye Demir acknowledges that Turkey is behind in the studies in this field.
But he does not ignore that families are gradually awareness: "One of the fundamental issues of psychology science is that man is peaceful with himself, that he captures peace in his own identity."
At first the children's room was filled with sheets, one was not taken very seriously to dress up.
Now that is changing.
Parents feel the need to interfere.
“The passion and devotion to someone is a sign that something goes wrong in the youth’s life.”
Fans of Emotional Speed Train
The interest of celebrity is dangerous, provided that it is not exaggerated.
Iron suggests not to want her to get married, jealous of her wife, prefering her clothes.
We are talking about famous people on their name.
It is normal to worry about them, to be concerned with their lives.
But, according to the expert psychologist, the young people who escaped the ball of the cranberry are mostly: "When there are no names to represent the kind in the family or in the surrounding area, the emptiness is definitely filled."
There are not always good examples.
“The negative ones are copied, boy.”
When we consult how to get closer to them, Sumeye Iron begins to speak with reminding that the fame passion syndrome is more seen in adolescence.
If it is considered that adolescents may be insecure in themselves, the problem becomes more comfortable.
On the one hand, when we complain about their family’s limitations, on the other hand, we face young people waiting for support and compassion: “We are forced to take into account their emotional declines.”
New research shows that they are difficult due to changes that occur in their brains.
“The connection of a young man to a emotional speed train with caution must also be naturally welcomed, softly approached.”
It is possible to change behavior.
Specialist psychologist Sümeyye Demir reminds the parents’ tasks to overcome the celebrity worship syndrome:
Recognize his emotional discomfort, make sure you’re calm before you get into the matter.
Never let them suppress your emotions.
Note that you respect his admiration to promote independence.
Instead of teaching by reducing, show a good example, discuss the names that will be a role model for him.
Try to deal with the place of famous people in our daily lives together.
It will be useful to read the books that tell the real world of famous people.
Turn your communication into an adult form.
Remember that addiction and motivation use the same ways in the brain.
Share with your child that errors are an opportunity to change, accept it as it is.
Get specialized support on fancy.
Whoever is angry is admired.
The foundation of the slave worship syndrome is the need for medet umma and help from someone else.
Uninterrupted love is actually a call for help.
Unfortunately, it is not so perceived.
Moreover, this problem is so widespread that it is impossible to limit it to a country or continent.
Dr. Recai Yahyaoğlu notes that there are certain names engaged in television in each country.
The syndrome manifests itself more by linking to these celebrities: “They are unusual.”
The majority does not have their ability.
Those who have, do not behave like them.
Whether they don’t, or they don’t dare.
“But those who don’t have the possibility, the possibility, and the nerve that cannot live like them, continue to follow.”
Whoever is angry or nervous is not different.
Both are deeply admired.
They make money without trouble, they are on the agenda of the magazine.
It is enough to know that to increase the strength.
Another advice by the expert Psychologist Sumayye Iron is to question the reality of those lives at this point.
It is not to be overlooked that artificial life is concerned.
The support of the people who are passionate about the fame, is here.
But the person acknowledges that the famous person is like him.

Should I have an operation? - Family - Health News - Time Newspaper
Dr. Fevzi Özgönül is answering questions in the corner of the Square Newspaper.
I have a stone in my yellow cut and every morning when I wake up, I go to the toilet with stomach pain 2 or more times a day after meals.
Can this prevent me from losing weight?
I have started using alkaline now, but I don’t want to eat, I can’t lose weight at all.
So since my childhood.
What should I do?
Do you think I need to be surgery?
Answer: The stone of the gallbladder is often accompanied by an infection.
The pain of the stomach that develops immediately after a meal is also a sign that when you eat it, the gallbladder is swallowed and the inflammatory safra is empty into the intestines.
The intestines that are discomforted due to the inflammatory yellow quickly try to throw out this safray.
This is why you often go to the toilet.
Because you often go to the toilet, what you eat is not digested and you lose weight slowly.
I think you need to treat this situation.
If you go to a Gastro enterologist and the condition I said is detected, you can get rid of this with antibiotics.
You may also need to have an end-to-end surgery.
Alkaline probiotics can slightly reduce your complaints but do not tolerate them.
No matter what happens, continue to use alkali probiotics.
Because the greatest help to lose weight is this probiotic powder.
I eat a lot when stressed.
My teacher gives me to food when I am stressful and nervous and I gain weight.
How can I deal with it?
Answer: Excessive food desire actually means that energy needs are not fully satisfied.
This may be due to being less eaten or hoping out of morning and lunch.
Another reason is that you can’t eat the food you eat.
This requires a healthy functioning of your digestive system.
If you don’t have ulcers, reflux or a similar problem, the easiest way is to use a good probiotic medicine.
You will see the benefits too much.
I don’t lose weight, doctors don’t know why.
In your corner, there is often information about weakness.
I think it’s a good thing for me, but my situation is a bit different.
I don’t get some weight.
And most importantly, I don’t know why.
Doctors don’t say anything.
Answer: The techniques we use are not only aimed at weakening, but to restore the physiological work of the body to its ideal dimensions.
Obesity and weakness are the same type of discomfort.
Unable to lose weight in obesity and unable to lose weight in weakness is treated by the same technique.
You also get weaker when you eat sweet and sweet foods.
I think you have understood it so far.
You can also be stimulated with carboxylus and gain weight with a healthy diet.
So you’ve gone away from your ideal body.
The other patients were also removed from their ideal bodies.
You will get to your ideal body by weighting, and they will get to your ideal body by weighting.
If the system problem disappears, you gain weight, and they lose weight.
First of all, the system needs to work properly.

The child who feels invaluable is in hatred.
There are some feelings that are born in the human world.
Fear, sadness, happiness, disappointment, anger, anxiety...
But feelings like hatred, hatred, revenge appear in children over time and as a result of some wrong attitudes.
Every person needs to be an individual, including childhood.
That is, you want to respect the decisions of your parents or the social environment, to be asked about the issues that interest you and to feel valuable.
This is the basis for building a healthy personality.
For example, behaviors such as deciding instead of the child (what to wear, what to eat), not taking care of the child’s desires and directing his own truths instead of him (sending the child to the instrumental course) mean not respecting the child’s personality.
As a child who is not respected for himself and his existence loses the freedom of being himself, the defense mechanism reveals a sense of anger and hatred to protect him.
"Because it is actually the opposite of accepting anger and hatred," says psychologist Hilal Arslan, who says that the child does not accept what is done to him by hatred, and is trying to tell him that he is valuable, both to himself and to his surroundings.
The psychologist says that the child does not accept the situation and react in this way is a positive development in terms of his personality development, "Hate here means 'I am also', it serves the purpose of protecting the child's respect for himself."
“If a child is allowed to be individual, hatred disappears.”
The child tries to protect himself by escaping from anger and hatred.
At the young age, both physically and spiritually in the most defensive times, the parents of the children, the environment, the exposure to oral and emotional violence can cause negative emotions in the child, Arslan says, with negligence, the child will experience the feeling that the presence is unnoticed, invisible.
Arslan continues: “This can sometimes be the only way that their needs are not satisfied in an emotional sense (no hair, embrace, kiss, school or other needs), and sometimes their physical needs are not satisfied (such as food, drink, accommodation, school needs, etc.).”
This is an educational attitude that opens the door to anger.
In emotional and verbal violence, there are behaviors such as humiliation, insulting, humiliation, insulting, giving unnecessary and severe punishments, feeling invaluable, crying.
These behaviors are deeply touched because they are directed towards the child’s personality.
“The child either loses his self-respect by accepting them and spends his life struggling with the feeling that he is invaluable, not worthy of being loved and insufficient, or tries to protect himself by refugeing from anger and hatred.”
