The Prime Ministers of India and Japan met in Tokyo.
India’s new Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting with his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Toko on his first major foreign visit since his election victory in May to discuss economic and security relations.
Mr. Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world’s third-largest economic nation.
Plans for stronger nuclear-technical cooperation are at the top of the agenda.
According to reports, India also hopes for a treaty on defence cooperation between the two nations.
Karratha police arrest 20-year-old for fast motorcycle hunt
A motorcycle was seized after the driver drove it at 125 km/h in a 70 km/h zone and through Buschland to escape police in Bilbara.
Traffic policemen in Karratha tried to stop a blue motorcycle this morning after seeing it leaving a gas station on Bathdate Road at 125 km/h.
Police report that the driver then ignored the stop signals and continued driving on Burgess Road before bowing down to the Buschland, where officials lost sight of it.
The motorcycle and a person that matched the driver’s description were later seen at a house on the Walcott Way in Bulgarra.
Police in Karratha accuse a 20-year-old man of failing to observe a stop signal and careless driving.
He will appear before the district court in Karratha on September 23.
The motorcycle was seized and confiscated for three months.
George Webster accused of hotel rape in Naim and Pitlochry
A man has been charged with raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, read the charge at a hearing by the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He is accused of raping a woman at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire, on June 7, 2013.
The accusation is that Webster attacked her while she "was unconscious, slept, and could not signal consent."
Webster is also accused of raping a second woman at the Golf View Hotel in Naim, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae set the hearing date for November 17 at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh.
Return to the very American ideal of labor rights as human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have introduced a bill to establish the organization of trade unions as a citizen’s right.
“Just as unions die, middle-class jobs die,” said Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat and deputy chairman of the Progressive Caucus in Congress.
Therefore, I am proud to present the Employee Empowerment Act together with the civil rights icon John Lewis.
This groundbreaking law gives workers the same legal opportunities for discrimination on the basis of trade union organization as it does for other forms of discrimination – thus stopping anti-union forces.
Complementing the national labour law to provide an opportunity for workers exposed to discrimination to organize a trade union representation, to seek justice before a civil court – and to obtain damages or fines – is a meaningful and necessary initiative.
But it is not a radical initiative – at least not according to American standards.
In fact, the best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and the other sponsors of their bill are proposing is to link back to a very American idea.
Despite the downturns faced by trade unions in recent years — in Wisconsin, Michigan, and other states across the country — Americans have once encouraged countries around the world to recognize, expand, and uphold labor rights.
There was a time millions of Americans still remember when this country called democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to associate in one breath.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas Mac Arthur and his staff encouraged the country to pass a constitution to ensure that the militarized autocracy of Hedki Tojos was replaced by democracy.
Fully aware that workers and their trade unions would play a role in creating a new Japan, they used a language that explicitly recognized that “the rights of workers to associate and jointly negotiate and act are guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his staff pressured the Germans to write a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler's fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
Recognizing the fact that workers would have to organize themselves and raise their voices in the new nation, the Germans added a clause that explicitly stated: “The right to form associations to secure and improve working and economic conditions is guaranteed to every individual and every profession or profession.
Agreements that restrict or aim to diminish this right are null and void; measures aimed at it are unlawful.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which drafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global agreement, Roosevelt and the other authors added a guarantee that "everyone has the right to form unions to protect their interests or join them."
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
As this country advises other countries on how to shape civil and democratic societies, Americans stated that the right to form a trade union – and that that trade union can then participate in collective bargaining as an equal partner with and government agencies – must be protected.
After these rights were attacked in America, it is indeed very wise to reconsider the American ideal that the working people must have the right to unite and be heard in a free and open society.
As Martin Luther King Jr. said 50 years ago:
History is a great teacher.
Now everyone knows that the workers’ movement did not limit the strength of the nation, but enlarged it.
By raising the standard of living of millions of people, labour has miraculously created a market for industry and raised the entire nation to unimaginable levels of production.
Those who attack work forget these simple truths, but history preserves them.
History remembers, and we should do so.
The formal recognition of labour rights as human rights – and the expansion of the protection of civil rights as protection against discrimination in the creation of workers’ representations – has long been out of date.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that made America great in the past and fulfilled the promise of democracy.
Judge temporarily stops law that could force all abortion clinics in Louisiana to close
A U.S. federal judge on Sunday temporarily halted the enforcement of a law in Louisiana, which lawyers say is likely to have led to the closure of all five abortion clinics in the state.
This measure, introduced by Bobby Jindal, Governor of Louisiana, to the law in June and to come into effect on September 1, would force doctors performing abortions to acquire a patient reception right at a hospital within a radius of 30 miles around their practice.
However, the judge’s decision means that doctors can provisionally continue to legally perform abortions while applying for such a right.
"The applicants can continue to work in accordance with the law while striving to obtain these rights," Federal Judge John deGravelles wrote in his ruling.
A hearing for the judge is scheduled within a month to bring about a more lasting decision for the law.
Abortion advocates welcomed the decision, the most recent in a series of judgments against similar measures, and said doctors would thus gain more time to obtain hospital admission rights.
“Today’s decision means women in Louisiana are escaping a crippling law that wants to take away their health and rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and chairman of the Center for Reproductive Rights, which had complained on behalf of three of the state’s five clinics to stop the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the judgment also extended to the doctors from the two clinics who did not join the lawsuit and had also applied for admission rights.
Louisiana is one of 11 states that have passed similar laws, with courts recently declaring such measures unconstitutional in Alabama and Mississippi.
Key points of a law in Texas that would have forced most of the remaining clinics in the state to close were stopped by a federal judge on Friday.
Abortion advocates and the American College of Ostretricians and Gynecologists, as well as the American Medical Association, agree that appointment rights require unnecessary restrictions from doctors.
Opponents of abortion are opposed to the fact that the measures serve to protect women’s health, although some have also welcomed the effects of closing clinics.
Only one doctor who performs abortions in Louisiana has patient registration rights, the Center for Reproductive Rights said.
If all the other doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions anymore, that doctor would no longer perform the operation for fear of his safety, the group said.
In their argument against the verdict, Louisiana state officials said they would not punish doctors for performing abortions, while their applications for patient registration rights would still be pending.
Delayed diagnoses and lack of access to the best treatment options lead to higher rates of ovarian cancer deaths in rural areas.
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video tribute to their mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural areas of Australia are at higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than women in cities.
Researchers analyzed medical data from more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 25 percent were alive five years after the diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that for those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality during the study was 20 percent higher than for those in urban areas.
Small Study: New Drugs Could Slow Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers studied the medical care of women over seven years.
Dr. Jordan said that a woman’s age at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, existing pre-existing diseases, and social and economic status also influenced the chances of survival.
For older women and those whose cancer was already advanced at the time of diagnosis, the survival rate was the lowest.
For those living in rural and remote regions of the state, the risk of mortality was 20 percent higher during the study than for those in urban areas.
Although the study did not examine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan suspects late diagnosis and lack of access to the best treatment centers as possible factors for this.
“This disease is best treated by gynecological oncologists, and these are most often found in larger cities,” she said.
Despite improving telemedicine services to somewhat counter the distances, as a possible remedy, she suggested strengthening the service of in-flight doctors to give specialists the opportunity to care for women closer to their place of residence, as well as treatment programs for people outside their region.
Dr. Jordan said the study, regardless of geographical status, revealed a poor long-term survival rate among women in ovarian cancer, and stressed the need for better treatment and prevention strategies.
The study, funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer Cancer, will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2013, Elisha Neave, a young 33-year-old mother from Gold Coast, learned that she had an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Garden centers regret declining number of homeowners
The decline, coupled with an increased decline in the number of homeowners under the age of 35, could cause garden centers to lose tens of thousands of pounds a year if today’s young consumers reach the “core age group for garden products,” according to a study by HTA, as in the Financial Times.
The report states that tenants spend on average 55 percent of the amount people with a home spend on their garden.
The rise of people living in highly urbanized areas without gardens, the popular method of paving out yards for park purposes, and the declining garden size are other factors threatening the industry, which is estimated to be implemented in sales of £5 billion annually.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homeowners has fallen from 61 percent to 43 percent over a six-year period, the lowest spending on gardening products per household is.
The HTA and the Royal Horticultural Society point out that housing for rent or small gardens doesn’t mean people can’t harvest plants.
Guy Barter, chief garden consultant for the RHS, said: “Container gardening, for example, is very popular with tenants because they can take their plants with them when moving.”
The HTA report identified the period between 1997 and 2005 as the "golden age" of garden retail due to rising homeowners' numbers and economic prosperity from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted an improved market situation for this year due to the better weather following unfriendly weather conditions in March and April last year.
The protest movement in Pakistan led by opposition politician Imran Khan and cleric Tahirul Qadri continues.
In the capital of Islamabad, about 1,000 protesters stormed the state television channel PTV.
Information Minister Pervaiz Rashid said soldiers could have pushed the protesters out of PTV buildings.
The station stopped operating for about 40 minutes, but is now broadcasting again.
At the same time, about 3,000 protesters tried to enter the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
About a kilometer away, they were equipped with sticks and stones for collisions with security forces.
The police used tear gas.
The protesters demanded Sharif’s resignation, but he rejects it.
Meanwhile, the country’s military urged a political solution to the conflict, “without wasting time and without using force.”
After a meeting at the headquarters on Sunday evening, the military said: "The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state."
The military plays an important role in Pakistan and has already pushed more frequently.
Opposition politician Imran Khan accuses Prime Minister Sharif of cheating in the parliamentary elections last May.
The protests escalated over the weekend after Khan and Qadri called on their supporters to enter Sharif’s residence.
Three people were killed.
Turkey Recruits U.S. Diplomat for Spy Report
The Turkish Foreign Ministry has commissioned the country’s oldest serving U.S. diplomat for information on a report on U.S. and British espionage in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bülent said U.S. embassy business officials and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
The German magazine Der Spiegel and the online magazine The Intercept that the report by former U.S. National Security Agency analyst Edward Snowden showed that Turkey was a major area of activity for the U.S. and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish news agencies, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the importance of the report, saying that all major countries were spying on each other.
An earlier report that also targeted Germany’s most important intelligence service, Ankara, caused a much more upsetting reaction from the Turkish government.
Warning strike: bus drivers threaten with consequences for pendlers
The statewide warning strike of locomotive drivers on Monday night could also affect passenger traffic in NRW.
The suspension announced for 18:00 to 21:00 will affect all transport companies across the country, including long-distance, regional and subway transport.
The main target of the strike is freight transport.

The head of the German Lokomotive Drivers Union (GDL), Sven Schmitte, said in Düsseldorf.
We expect significant failures.
There are no regional priorities.
The main focus of the strike was freight traffic.
Deutsche Bahn in NRW announced that it will do everything to keep the impact as low as possible.
However, the GDL did not say where it intends to strike, so it is difficult to predict the consequences.
Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
On Friday, the prosecutors presented to the office of the prosecutor of Mallorca evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià.
The chief of the Calvià Police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after allegations of corruption by businessmen and bar owners at the notorious binge drinking hotspot Magaluf.
Chief Commissioner José Antonio Navarro was arrested on corruption charges against him by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf’s bars and nightclubs are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the prosecutors presented evidence of blackmail by police officers and employees of the city of Calvià to the Office of the Prosecutor for Anti-Corruption of Mallorca on Friday.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish Guardia Civil in connection with the allegations of corruption and are being questioned together with Navarro by a judge.
The Spanish national daily ABC that the upset nightclub owners stated that the government’s cousin’s economy has had a serious impact on their.
"It's no longer about earning money, it's about surviving," one of the businessmen told the court.
Let our life base out of the game.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf made international headlines this summer due to a viral YouTube video showing an 18-year-old British tourist performing Fellatio on 24 men during a sauce tour.
The island authorities have since tried to stop the irregular behavior of alcoholic holidaymakers in Magaluf by minimizing the number of participants on the notorious alcoholic pub tours.
The Playhouse Club, where the fallout took place, was forced to close for a year, while Playhouse and the pub tour organizer Carnage jointly had to pay a fine of €55,000 ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is especially popular with young British holidaymakers, is also known for several accidents under the influence of alcohol, including the trend of "balconing", in which people jump from one balcony to another or from one balcony into the hotel pool.
The first day of spring with wet and stormy weather affects flights from Adelaide Airport
Spring has given South Australia a winter surprise, with heavy rains and strong winds disrupting flights from Adelaide Airport.
In the evening until 21:00, another 5mm of rain fell on the city, after 6.6mm, which had already fallen in the night to Sunday.
The last rainfall was the result of a series of short, stormy rains, including a casting that began just before 8 p.m. and caused 4mm of rainfall in about 10 minutes.
After last week’s winter brought an early dose of spring, temperatures in the city fell again to a peak of just 15.8°C on Monday.
The harsh weather has likely led to the late landing of a Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was supposed to land shortly after 7:30 p.m., but was hit by a heavy wind—a sudden change in wind speed or direction over a short distance—and had to take off.
Winds reached about 50 km/h at the ground at Adelaide Airport at that time.
The flight data showed that the aircraft also had to take off on a second landing and finally set off around 8:40.
The flight delay resulted in delays on several other flights, including one Emirates flight from Dubai and one Quantas flight from Sydney.
For Adelaide, a maximum temperature of 16°C is forecast on Tuesday, with possible rains.
Matthies says it’s time for big networking
In the face of the galoping technological progress that threatens to transform our comfortable home into high-tech switching power plants, our columnist Bernd Matthies comforts himself with an extremely familiar electronic accessory.
As I write this, I look at the spiral cable that connects the headset to the phone, and I think, Boah, how retro is that?
But there's a reasoning behind it: If the cable wasn't, in a short time all the listeners would fly around the house, and that would be even more retro.
This applies to the electronic (electronic) system.
No, typing error: electronic) sector rule that the world novelty of today is the electrical junk of tomorrow, bought - outdated.
And whoever, for example, still has a tube TV in the living room today, simply says that he basically rejects television.
Why these considerations?
Because the tension of the IFA at the radio tower this week again shows us our absolute incompetence in matters of electronics.
The laity, who once blindly mastered the washing machine and CD player, today does not even understand the purpose of the devices, which are spread before him with unimaginably futile expert speech: "Connected Home, Wearables, Health Care and Urban Technologies" promises us the press office.
Is it still going?
What should we talk about with people who seem to spread such quark voluntarily?
In fact, for about 20 years, it has been mainly about connecting our home.
In order for the yogurt to re-order itself, so that the fire detector will tell us on holiday in the Maldives that it is burning in the office.
Wouldn’t it be wonderful if we left the air conditioner from the office on our soon arrival?
This requires an air conditioning system.
But a dream will soon come true: we pick up our wristwatch, say to you loudly “Sugging!” – and at home the vacuum cleaner is running.
It is wrong.
Everything runs out to nothing less than a revolution: "The boundaries between white and brown goods are blurred," a industry expert runs around, you can connect the washing machine with a headphone, the steam garner sends the weather report and the data glasses show how long the pizza in the oven will still take, which is useless because we are in a congestion.
From daily practice we also know: If a new-fashioned device is really urgently needed, the battery is guaranteed to be empty.
What’s another reason is that the spiral cable on the phone will survive even the next radio shows.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from the areas near the Gaza Strip returned to schools on Monday after spending the summer in air shelters as rocket and mortar shots hit their communities during the 50-day war between Israel and Hamas and schools in Gaza remained closed as the area recovered from fighting.
The start of school brought a sense of joy and expectation to the communities in southern Israel drawn by missile smells, but the signs of fighting are still fresh.
In the southern city of Ashdod, employees of the "Pashosh" kindergarten, which was hit by a rocket, before the arrival of the students removed grenades from the walls and sliding walls.
“We’re a little scared, but excited,” said Ronit Bart, a local resident at Kibbutz Saad and English teacher there.
Many children in our area urgently need to return to a routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart said it feels "a little strange" to suddenly go back to school.
“These were difficult times, and we didn’t leave the house at all,” she said.
President Reuven Rivlin visited the Kibbutz near the Gaza border to offer his support.
Until a ceasefire broke the war last week, thousands of residents of border communities like Saad remained in their homes or left their homes to move to safer areas further away from Gaza and escape the rocket and mortar fire.
Many residents of Nahal Oz, a community near the Gaza border where a 4-year-old boy was killed by a Palestinian mortar grenade, are still hesitant to return.
The Ministry of Education said about a dozen families have not yet returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in other schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attended a school in Sderot, a border town with Gaza severely hit by Palestinian bombing.
He appealed to the children to learn a lot and said, “We will make sure you acquire knowledge and provide you with security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on an indefinite ceasefire on Tuesday.
The ceasefire brought an immediate end to the fighting, but important issues remain unresolved, such as Hamas’ demands for the lifting of the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and the reopening of Gaza’s airports and seaports.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the surrender of the bodies of two Israeli soldiers killed in the fighting.
A new round of indirect talks is expected to begin in Egypt this month.
More than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of them civilians, and at least 494 children, according to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN.
Israel denies these reports and estimates that at least half of the killed are fighters, but did not provide concrete evidence for this information.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other fighters in Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and mortar grenades during the fighting on Israeli cities, most in the south of the country.
Meanwhile, the Israeli military carried out more than 5,000 air and other attacks.
The Israeli attacks damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in the Gaza Strip and about 250,000 people sought refuge in more than 100 UN schools converted into temporary shelters.
While tens of thousands of people continue to live in shelters and fighting continues, education authorities postponed the start of the school year last week.
"I hope the school will soon be reopened so we can continue to learn, just like the children in the world and the Jewish children," said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy who currently lives in a school in Gaza City.
After elections in Saxony: CDU Deputy Strobl challenges NPD ban procedure
In the face of the vote losses of the NPD in Saxony, CDU deputy Thomas Strobl has voted for an end to the ongoing NPD ban procedure before the Federal Constitutional Court.
According to CDU deputy Thomas Strobl, the ongoing prohibition proceedings against the NPD should end before the Federal Constitutional Court.
"The NPD is performing worse than last time," Strobl, who is also the CDU country leader in Baden-Württemberg, told the "Leipziger Volkszeitung".
This is a pleasant development in the right direction and a development that leads me to the conclusion that the NPD is being fought politically and not before the Constitutional Court.
The NPD failed at the five-percent barrier in the vote on Sunday.
A first attempt to ban the far-right party failed in 2003 because the constitutional protection had informants at the NPD’s head at the time.
In December 2013, the Federal Council submitted a new proposal in Karlsruhe.
The German government and the Bundestag did not agree.
Harburg: Tents for new refugees
At the Neuländer Platz, refugees are now housed in tents.
The first refugee shelter in Harburg is breaking out of all seams.
Now the Interior Authority has set up three Red Cross tents next to it.
The district politicians were informed only shortly before - they are not enthusiastic.
“These hauruck actions continue to arouse citizens’ reservations and do not give district politicians the opportunity to participate constructively in the human accommodation of refugees,” says Britta Herrmann, the leader of the Greens group in the Harbour District Assembly.
Their party demands that the Harburg district administration provide currently unused houses for accommodation.
96 refugees can be accommodated in the three tents.
Reasons for the overcrowding in the first admission are the rush of help seekers - and the fact that the authorities cannot provide enough seats in follow-up facilities.
Many refugees are therefore staying longer than the regular three months.
Home prices have experienced the strongest winter rise in seven years, a widely observed index shows.
The RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic Home Value Index for homes in the Australian capital rose 1.1 percent in August, according to the RP data from Monday.
This increases the total increase in June, July and August by 4.2 percent, the largest increase in the winter months since 2007.
The annual price increase was 10.9 percent, more than double the increase in the 12 months up to August 2013, but the increases were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data’s research director, Tim Lawless, said that Sydney and Melbourne are driving a two-part market.
The figures from RP Data show that home prices rose 16.1 percent in Sydney last year, compared with 11.7 percent in Melbourne.
The following markets are Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, where prices rose on average by five and six percent.
At the other end of the scale is Canberra, which has been hit hard by cuts in government spending and where prices have risen by only 1.4 percent over the year.
Mr. Lawless further said that with the onset of spring, there would now be an increase in properties for sale for the coming months, which would undergo the market “a real test.”
"If you look at the persistently high rate of auction prices, a generally fast sales rate, and the persistently low interest rate environment, it's likely that home prices will continue to rise in the next three months," he said.
In a statement to the Neue Presse, he contradicts the statements of CEO Peer Medau and attests that he poses "like a captain".
This is not the style of the university, it says in the communication.
The Medau family was informed about the university’s initiation by mouth in mid-June.
The statement that the plans were announced only in July is definitely false," Pötzl said.
At the same time, he points out that the plans are not “pre-setting or even decisions,” but there are “preferences.”
Even the expansion of the narrow road up to the castle, necessary for access, is less dramatic than feared by the medails.
There was and is no mention of a nine-metre-wide road.
At the current level, it goes by 5.50 meters, which is one meter wider than before,” explains Pötzl.
The argument of the Medau operators that their free and school-owned parking spaces will in the future only be used by students of the university, Pötzl does not want to apply.
Parking is not used at all, because it can now be solved intelligently, as with other public parking spaces.
Think of the residents
The Kinderkrippe Bergwichtel, which is located on the site and in front of which the front door would lead along the access to the parking deck, according to the university president "will not be affected".
Rather, he suggests that "it is not just about the children's crib, but also about the inhabitants at the mouth of the Friedrich-Streib-Straße and the 800 students of the neighboring real school.
Thus, it is much more than the particular interests of the gentlemen Medau,” Pötzl said.
Whether the criticism of the parental council of the children's crib, with the expansion of the street would be justified by one of "the few naturally left spots of Coburg will be lost", "can the reader decide himself."
At the beginning of October, Pötzl, together with the State Construction Office of Bamberg, intends to inform the city councils about the construction development of the university until 2020 "and in this context address the importance of the new development".
Peer Medau last week informed the parents of the children's crippe about the plans of the university.
Thus, the access to the new parking deck is not to go through the campus and the Friedrich-Streib-Straße, as before, but through the Medau-Berg.
This would require the extension of the narrow road on a length of about one kilometer.
According to high calculations of the Medaus, the traffic in the park of Schloss Hohenfels would thus be tenfold.
There are about 2,000 vehicles per day.
The city has so far refused to comment on the project.
Glandorf resigns from national handball team
Holger Glandorf will no longer play for the DHB team.
The 31-year-old from the Bundesliga SG Flensburg-Handewitt led to this decision primarily health problems.
The decision was not easy for me, it was made over several months.
It’s time for me to listen to the signals of my body and end my career in the national team,” the 2007 world champion wrote on his Facebook page.
He retired with a record of 167 national games and 576 goals for Germany.
Because the huge rear room player for the Champions League winner from Flensburg wants to go to the goal for a few years, he is no longer available to the new Bundestrainer Dagur Sigurdsson.
With the Icelander, who will announce his team for the home games against Switzerland on Tuesday, Glandorf held a "long and good conversation.
His ideas and approaches have thrilled me as much as they will thrill my long-time fellow players and my successors.
But for my club, I want to be healthy for the next few years, which requires longer recovery breaks, which the current double load does not allow.
The left-handed player had to fear his career end after a heel infection in 2012.
Because of Achilles' seed problems, he had been treated by team doctors of the German Handball Federation (DHB) with a cortisone injection, which later triggered a severe inflammation.
An emergency operation and two other interventions followed.
Then Glandorf had announced a lawsuit against the team doctor, the dispute ended with a comparison.
Twelve years of professional and eleven years of national team career pass without a trace on any body.
I have some health building sites that I can no longer ignore.
After the three infection-related foot surgeries, which took place at short intervals in 2012, I never managed my blood pressure properly.
There are a number of other complaints related to wear.
At the beginning of the year, I realized that while I control my head, I can’t fool my body,” Glandorf told Handball Time magazine.
He would only be ready for a comeback in an absolute emergency.
"When all the strings break, I am always ready to talk," the double family father explained to the magazine.
However, I can count the years I can still play handball on one hand.
I also have to say that after my long hospital stay in 2012, I have also become quite humble when it comes to my health.
After my career, I would like to be able to go straight.
In addition to winning the 2007 World Cup and the 2014 Champions League, he won the EHF Cup in 2008 (HSG Nordhorn) and 2010 (TBV Lemgo).
In 2012, he also secured the European Cup of the cup winners with Flensburg.
German economy shrunk by 0.2% in the spring
Crises around the globe slowed the German economy in the second quarter.
Gross Domestic Product fell by 0.2% from April to the end of June 2014 compared to the previous quarter.
This was by the Federal Statistical Office and confirmed the preliminary estimates.
Consumption alone revitalized the economy in the spring, while investment declined.
Foreign trade has also hampered the economy.
Thanks to the strong annual initiative, the total GDP increase in the first half of the year is 0.8 percent compared to the second half of 2013.
Horstmar was the starting point and the destination of the "Münsterland-Mooiste", which led through Burgmannsstadt for the first time on Sunday.
The Burgmann town of Horstmar witnessed on Sunday an invasion of Dutch "fietsets".
The largest cycling association in the Netherlands, NTFU, hosted the so-called "Münsterlande-Mooiste".
This is the largest cycling tour across Münsterland, the cycling paradise near the Netherlands.
More than 1000 participants thanked Jos ter Huerne for organizing this tour through the Münsterland.
Published in various specialized journals, this tour was offered to interested people.
We came from Den Helder and drove overnight to take part in this tour.
We also want to get to know Münsterland in this way,” the cyclists rejoiced over the route through the Steinfurt, Borken and Coesfeld districts.
After the registration at the Association of the Protective Brotherhood Sta.
Katharina went on a small "peace march" through the city over the wall, where the launch took place.
The route, which was designed for three different categories, continued towards Herrenholz via the Schöppinger Berg in the direction of Coesfeld and back to Horstmar via Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
On routes of 95 kilometers with 1175 height meters, 120 kilometers with 1475 height meters and 145 kilometers with 1775 height meters, the cyclists proved their good condition.
They were fed on the way to Havixbeck and Billerbeck.
The main organizer Jos ter Huerne and Mayor Heinz Lölfing were very pleased with the success of this cycling event.
We were very pleased and it was a great experience for all involved.
The organization went smoothly and there were no negative incidents,” Heinz Lölfing concludes positively.
Unfortunately, there were not as many participants as the organizer had hoped, which was probably due to the bad weather forecasts and the morning rain.
"We will meet again in 2015 in hopefully nice weather on August 30 or during another weekend," the cyclists promised to return to Münsterland and the organizers plan a new edition.
Constantine Wecker's Really Honest Memoirs
It is actually more philosophical testimony than biography, what Konstantin Wecker, songwriter, pacifist, political security activist, ex-prisoner, has brought to paper on 287 pages in Monk and Warrior.
Not chronologically, but more thought-tracks for thought-tracks, the Municher, born on June 1, 1947, has written his memoirs, each chapter initiated by a suitable song-text.
And he is relentlessly honest: from masturbation as a high school student to shop theft and drug use, he does not miss any human weakness.
Also, to show how he himself has learned tolerance in dealing with his fellow men.
Large spaces also include abstract but more important concepts: love, soul, ego, being in the now, spirituality – all of which he tries to go to the bottom, in a very philosophical but also very personal way.
And he also explains his pacifism, his criticism of society, his political engagement – and also how not only the music (the opera lover became a soul and rock musician) shaped him, but also his prison stay.
The latter has also brought the living man Konstantin Wecker closer to the ascetic monk, who arises "through subtraction", as he says, "by leaving away everything unnecessary."
Among all the high-spiritual views, however, there are also short anecdotes about the earth: for example, about battles in a local frequented by GIs or a crazy car ride, in which he frontally targeted a tree.
He is also unquestionably honest.
Lenny Henry: My father never took me in his arms.
Never said “I love you”
Henry was one of seven children of a Jamaican immigrant family in Dudley, Midlands in 1958.
His father, who died when Henry was 19, worked in a factory and their ratio was limited.
Henry tries for a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary conversation with his father and emerged from the series on Radio 4.
The soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap, with vibrant melodies.
But Henry had to work through some difficult childhood moments.
He attended "many" therapies after his mother's death, and Henry is reflecting on his relationship with his father.
It was hard to know him.
You never saw his face, you only heard his voice: “Stop the cries.
Leave your sister in peace.
Move on !
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton - who were already grown up when I was a child - went to the pub with him and talked about things like the shape of the beer glass or the beauty of a cricket beat.
I never had such a conversation with him.
For much of my life he was that serious guy in the corner who read the newspaper.
Recently, Henry opened a casting factory in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than at his father’s time, he gained an insight into how life would have been for him.
It’s somewhat bright now, but they’re dark, worn-out, deep stygic labyrinths with flames and smoke and a lot of sweat.
My father used to just lay in the bathtub and then you could slowly hear him singing because he could wash the casting from himself.
As I ran around there, I realized that he had been doing this for years to bring the food to the table, and my respect for him grew.
Nevertheless, Henry grew up as a child without any proof of love from his parents.
My father never hugged me, he never said “I love you.”
It was only when my mother was going bad about the end of her life that we began to say, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
Through his own daughter Billie, with Dawn French, he was able to share the love he missed as a child.
Could you stop saying “I love you”?
Stop hugging me!
Dad, I am 22 years old!
With Dawn French.
Why not be friends?
She is a great mother.
It is still friends with French, with whom he was married for 25 years.
Dawn is a good man.
Why not be friends?
She is a great mother.
Henry’s own mother was a diabetic.
This contributed to her death.
So when I became very, very overweight and showed symptoms of diabetes, my doctor said, “You have to be radical.
So I went through this fitness thing and also had to make a drastic diet to reverse the symptoms.
It is very hard.
And it is exhausting.
No one likes to eat carrots.
Henry’s career shift may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
Ever since he was praised by critics for his Othello, he has been haunted by the theatre.
It was followed by The Comedy of Errors, and then Fences by August Wilson.
This is a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that have filled his busy working life.
He started when he was only 16 years old when he worked in a factory.
A DJ discovered him on stage as he imitated people and wrote new faces about him.
His television career began in the mid-1970s. "I was the only black imitator/comedian on television for quite a long time."
He studied in the profession.
Not only did I have to grow big in the eyes of the public, but from 1975 to 1985 I also learned how to become an efficient joke-telling machine while being a star through television, and that was really difficult.
Lenny 1975 at New Faces
Since his manager owned the stage rights at the Black and White Minstrel Show, a light entertainment program in which people "make up black," Henry performed his comedy there over five years.
This was very uncomfortable for my family.
I wish it never happened, but I do not regret that I did.
It was a strange, uncomfortable position for me, but I worked on giant projects and learned how to deal with a large audience.
But this “years-long award-winning light pillar of British television” was also a “grotesque parody of black people.”
By introducing characters that both mocked and celebrated British black culture, Henry worked on an alternative comedy circle in the eighties.
The first series of the Lenny Henry Show went on broadcast in 1984, and in the nineties he was known, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!
Advertising, documentaries, TV series, and film roles shaped his next decade, but after his 2008 BBC series LennyHenry.tv, he thought, “What are you doing next, Len, because it all feels like you’re just bringing time out or walking a little on the spot.”
Then came a documentary series for Radio 4 titled What's So Great About ...?
The first episode was about Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
I had never really learned anything about him at school and thought he was mostly a middle-class domain, white in pants and a cabbage head in the front.
So I was very afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed for the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench said, “You should try it.
Don’t do it badly if you don’t know what you’re talking about.
Take a few of the words into your mouth, and then you will understand why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry recorded 20 lines from Othello’s last speech for the documentary, and he was thrilled.
I had the feeling that I could do it.
It was almost as if someone had finally put my head right.
“That’s why it’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn your text, research a little.
The trials were brutal, and I read this piece for months before we did it.
And it was a success.
They seemed to expect a car accident, and that just didn’t happen.
And soon he appeared in the comedy of errors.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre and I could hardly believe it.
There was a moment when I thought, “Oh, you changed.”
There was a technical mistake and Henry instinctively felt he needed to entertain the audience.
"A small voice told me, 'You have to bridge over for 10 minutes now while they're fixing the computer.'"
Instead, the stage manager announced that the show would continue once the problem was solved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, “Oh, thank God.”
I am not responsible for it.
I can leave it to someone else.
“You’re playing in a play, so stay in your role.”
Henry in Fences at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text for Fences was challenging.
Panic is very good, it strengthens the tendons.
This also came well, so it is like a great shield of the gods saying to me, "This is your destiny.""
He says this, of course, with a twisted voice.
So I stay with it.
I really love it.
I love being in a test room.
But Henry still has the head of a comedian - our conversation is filled with humorous outbursts, while repeatedly imitating people.
I have decided not to do stand-up comedy because I find this kind of immediate satisfaction from a hall full of strangers somehow dangerous.
If you are always looking for it, you are going to a wall.
I sometimes perform live at Apollo when I want to, but overall I don’t have as much as before.
I ask him if he will ever go on a stand-up comedy tour again.
The fun I have in a room with a director who helps shape a beginning, a middle, and the end of a trip – I don’t think I’d ever want to give it up again.
Is this his new incarnation?
I am thinking.
I like to be an actor.
It is fun.
You always tell a story, and that’s great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Houthi rebels block streets in Yemen's capital
In the conflict between Shiite Houthi rebels and the Yemeni government, the Houthis have called for civil disobedience in the capital Sanaa.
Houthi supporters had occupied central streets in Sanaa on Monday, a spokesman for the Houthi party "Ansar Allah" said.
Access to parliament was also blocked.
Yemenese media reports of a traffic chaos in the capital.
According to the online issue of the newspaper "Yemen Post", Houthi leader Abdulmalik al-Huthi called on the measures on Sunday evening.
The Huthi has threatened with further escalation of the conflict if its demands are not met.
The Shiite Houthis are fighting for greater independence from Sunni-run Yemen and are demanding the resignation of the government.
The Houthis have been besieging the Yemeni capital for almost two weeks.
Approximately 30,000 rebels have set up protest camps on the main access roads of Sanaa.
There are bloody battles with the Yemeni army.
Kenya registers officials to curb "ghost employees"
Kenya has begun to register all government officials biometrically in order to remove "ghost employees" from the government's salary lists.
Employees who do not register in the next two weeks will no longer be paid, according to a government statement.
The government believes that thousands of people will still receive salaries even after they leave the public service.
When President Uhuru Kenyatta took office in 2013, he promised to fight corruption in public service.
An audit earlier this year found that at least $1 million (£700,000) per month was lost in payments to “ghost workers” and other abusive financial practices.
The government suspects that salaries will continue to be paid on accounts after a person dies or leaves the public service, Wanyama Chebusiri told the BBC from the capital Nairobi.
All officials will now have to appear at identification centers over the next two weeks to ensure that their data is recorded through the biometric records, a government message said.
Anyone who does not do so without a credible excuse would be removed from the salary list.
"This approach will significantly contribute to the rationalization of public service by determining the actual number of officials and also revisioning the salary list at both levels of government - thus eliminating the "spirit workers," said Anne Waiguru, cabinet secretary at the Ministry of Decentralization and Planning.
The scandal surrounding art consultant Helge Achenbach will be tried in court for the first time on November 11.
Five heirs of Berthold Albrecht, the son of Aldi founder Theo Albrecht, are demanding 19.4 million euros in damages from Achenbach and two of his companies, which are in insolvency proceedings.
This was stated by a court spokeswoman on Monday.
In the complaint, it is said that Achenbach cheated on the purchase of works of art and old timepieces and charged Berthold Albrecht higher than the purchase price actually paid.
This also increased the agreed provision.
Achenbach purchased valuables for Albrecht for EUR 121 million.
Children need roots and wings.
He served in the school for 44 years, 23 of them as head of school.
From this time Manfred Richter knows many well-known Petershauseners and Kollbacher from their time as students.
His methods were sometimes unconventional, but always carried by his aspiration to see in the student the human being.
Sneekoppe is the most famous mountain in the Giant Mountains.
Manfred Richter loves the painting with the motive from his homeland.
Richter was born in 1930 in Trautenau, now Trutnov.
At the age of 14, he became interested in the teaching profession after four years of high school.
A year later, the Sudet Germans were exiled.
Within half an hour, the family had to leave the house.
After a few months in a camp, it went to Bavaria in 1946 - in a freight wagon.
So the judge struck in the upper-fränkische Senkendorf.
The training took place in Bamberg.
To do this, Manfred Richter had to run ten kilometers six times a week to the nearest train station, take the train to Bamberg, walk three kilometers across the city to school and return in the evening.
After two months, Manfred Richter was given an opportunity to sleep in a Red Cross home in Bamberg: together with up to 15 classmates in a bedroom.
In 1951 he took the first and in 1954 the second state exam after three years of teaching.
Since Oberfranken did not have a free teaching position for him, he applied to Oberbayern and entered the school in Kollbach on 1 November 1954.
The "Fräulein-Zimmer" was his first "service apartment" in the school house.
In 1958 he took up a three-bedroom service apartment in the newly built teacher house next to the school.
This house was bought by Manfred Richter in 1980, after the school in Kollbach was dissolved in 1968.
Until then, there were three classes in Kollbach in the school association Petershausen-Kollbach and five in Petershausen.
From the school year 1968/69 these were assembled in Petershausen in the present-day town hall.
When the school association Indersdorf was founded, only the primary school remained in the town.
In order to avoid a decline in the now smaller school, the then rector Georg Sigl moved to Karlsfeld - and Manfred Richter became his successor.
However, Petershausen grew, and so the children and their teachers could take over from September 1982 the current building, which was expanded in 1997 after Richter's retirement.
Manfred Richter praises the uncomplicated generosity of the then mayor Ludwig Götz, who at the expense of the municipality added a workspace and in the 1997 expansion built cellars, although this was not eligible for subsidies according to the directives for school buildings.
"Citizen Götz was very school-friendly," recalled the judge gratefully.
Thro his career, Manfred Richter has never forgotten the speech of a government official who responded to a school council talk on law and justice: “You must never forget love.”
“You have to give children two things: roots and wings,” says the 84-year-old.
And he had to learn, "This doesn't always succeed."Whether he meant only his students or his own six children, is not quite clear.
In any case, the judges’ actions were sometimes unconventional.
When students struggled, they did not get a punishment job from him and were not drowned to sit down.
At the expense of the municipality, the judge had bought two pairs of boxing gloves and had the two opponents compete against each other, even if there should be a violin.
For the benefit of the school, Judge, as rector,ined a good relationship with the then mayor Ludwig Götz (CSU).
This prompted the partyless judge after his retirement to run for the municipal council in 1996 at least as the last on the CSU list.
However, Judge was pre-elected to sixth place and joined the CSU.
180 km in three days
HR4-RADTOUR 700 cyclists make intermediate stops in the Kurpark of Bad Salzhausen and Scotland
When cyclists rest on their tour in Bad Salzhausen or Scotland, that is nothing special in itself.
On Friday, however, only the number of restants made an impression: the 700 participants of the hr4 cycling tour along with the accompanying tross a break in the lower spa park of Bad Salzhausen and later a party in the open air in the Scottish Alteburg Park.
Under the motto “Walk and celebrate on newly discovered paths between Nidda and Kinzig” the participants had met in Bad Vilbel on Thursday and attended a concert by Van Baker & Band.
On Friday it became serious: the cyclists took the first stage, attacking the 60 kilometers over Florstadt to Bad Salzhausen and further to Scots.
In Bad Salzhausen, the athletes were welcomed by Mayor Hans-Peter Seum, who started in Bad Vilbel by bicycle, and the head of the own company Bad Salzhausen, Petra Schwing-Döring.
All kinds of good things had been prepared for the refreshment of body and mind: the rural women from Ranstadt and Nieder-Mockstadt had baked 85 sheets of apple, swetschen, streusel and cheese cakes, which were wonderful for the skillful cyclists.
"Such cakes can only be baked by rural women," praised a participant from Aulendiebach, while ordering another piece.
At the drink stand of the Turnvereins Geiß-Nidda, cold refreshments were offered.
The "Duo Bravo" entertained the visitors with well-known melodies from operettes and musicals and received enthusiastic applause.
The atmosphere in the park was relaxing.
A gentleman also a head massage from his partner: "He deserved it, after all, today he has already jumped off chains back attached."
Meanwhile, the mayor and the manager still had to work: they were interviewed by reporter Rainer Janke at the well in front of the drinking room and took the opportunity to advertise for Bad Salzhausen on the radio.
Even doctoral chief Tobias Hagen, who has been with him since the first hr4 bike race in 2004 as a tour guide, was only able to sneak for a short time, though he had a lot to do with the technology on the spot.
His pickup truck, in which he communicated using three phones and a radio with his employees and the 15-member motorcycle staff of the Hessen police, wrote Facebook entries and made reports, also needed a check.
"The majority of the participants are from the Rhine-Main region," he said, "but also from Gießen or Fulda, from Lauterbach or the Taunus and even from numerous cities in Westphalia, cyclists have arrived.
The number of participants depends on the available accommodation capacity.
In category I, the participants will be accommodated in hotels, in category II in collective accommodations.
From the resort, the cyclists had a good impression when they broke up again after an hour and a half: "Goodbye!"
“It was nice in Bad Salzhausen!” they waved to say goodbye.
Upon arrival in Scotland, the group was allowed to take a short break.
But in the evening the cyclists were demanded in the idyllic Alteburg Park.
Under the direction of the Scottish Society for Tourism and Urban Marketing (GTS), the park hadined a nice festive environment and, of course, delicacies, such as flame cakes with well-cooled feather whitening, had been prepared.
Mayor Susanne Schaab, GTS CEO Markus Hoßfeld and MSC Chairman Wolfgang Wagner-Sachs in his capacity as a member of the Board of Directors of ADAC Hessen-Thüringen welcomed the visitors.
The three were apparently pleased with the "many operations in Scotland".
DJ Tobias Hagen then released the dance stage.
The opportunity to move fluidly in the open air was eagerly exploited despite the sporting activity on the bike.
Among the guests increasingly mixed citizens, who were enthusiastic about the good mood as well as the large crowd of cyclists.
On the second day, the stations Birstein, Wächtersbach and Bad Orb – including a concert with the Trenkwalder – were on the programme for the cyclists.
Yesterday, after 180 kilometers of cycling, the athletes met again in Bad Vilbel.
Dozens of Turkish police arrested for "conspiracy" against government
A total of 33 police officers have been arrested in Turkey on suspicion of "conspiracy against the government", local media agencies.
The police did not immediately comment.
Among the arrested are 14 high-ranking police officers, Hürriyet Daily News reports.
Some of them were involved in corruption investigations against government officials, including four government ministers last December.
In July, a number of Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly forming an organized criminal group and hacking phone numbers.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (who was then prime minister) described their actions as part of the activities led by the Islamist cleric Fethulla Güllen against him and other people in power positions.
Not all children in Ukraine go back to school
Schools almost everywhere in Ukraine opened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally an important day for families, and like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arsenij Jazenjuk brought his daughter to school.
There, he told waiting journalists that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
The September celebrations were not held in every school.
The sky is not peaceful all over Ukraine.
We must fight for a peaceful sky.
The entire Ukraine, a huge common Ukrainian People’s Front, must fight for a peaceful sky.
Aleksan Pastukhow, the head of the school in Slavyansk, who attended Jazenjuk's daughter, spoke Russian.
We hope that peace will finally reign here and that the children will receive an education that will be useful to them in the future.
The first school day of the new school year is traditionally celebrated, with the children wearing wrapped shirts, holding balloons in their hands and giving flowers to their teachers.
With Rona Fairhead, the BBC may have found the great director it needs.
She meets with a proud slate of fame from the banking world, media management and the inner circle of the Tory Party.
He has his own border experience.
Her career began at the global management consultancy Bain and Co., where she moved to Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and the media world of Pearsons.
She served as Chairman of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when the top position of Pearson's parent company went to a younger male colleague.
Their compensation wasly almost £1 million.
Their political rankings are also solid.
She was recommended by David Cameron by Lord Browne, the former chairman of BP, as he sought more private business knowledge at Whitehall: she became a cabinet adviser.
Her husband is a former Tory council member.
Already in May, I described the president’s task with a poisoned cup.
Not only is the BBC at the heart of public life as a huge and complex entity, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
Trust works in two directions: on the inside of the first guard of its own management hierarchy in the BBC, but also on the outside as a voice of public concern and unrest when things go wrong.
This creates a unsustainable duopoly that requires a comprehensive and comprehensive reform.
But which newly arriving president would risk taking action, knocking everything and dismantling an institution as complex as a Chinese dynasty, while taking his own job.
It is a difficult task.
And as if that wasn’t enough, many are also interested in seeing the BBC shrink – power, money and status outdated.
As competition gets closer and new technologies threaten old, convenient security, the upcoming negotiation of license fees for the BBC is associated with special dangers.
For the modest sum of £145.50 a year, the British public is buying into the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it says it reaches 96 percent of all households and each costs only 40 pence a day.
And apparently the BBC is climbing up again on the popularity scale: 53 percent support it today, compared to 31 percent 10 years ago.
The viewing and usage habits for the BBC have changed: I get news headlines on my phone nowadays and see missed programs later on my iPlayer.
But it remains a very beloved and remarkable institution.
She needs a remarkable chairman – I hope she has found him.
Perry of Texas Says Downloading Tweet Was Not Authorized
A tweet from Texas Republican Governor Rick Perry’s official user account on Sunday contained a degrading comment about the Democratic District Attorney at the heart of a criminal charge against him for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and replaced by another Perry’s user account, which disputes the previous one.
A tweet has just been sent from my account that was not authorized by me.
"I do not endorse the tweet and have deleted it," it said in the later message.
Perry’s staff did not immediately respond to requests for comments.
Although the tweets came from Perry’s official user account, it wasn’t clear who actually served the feed.
The previous tweet featured an unfavourable picture of Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted in April 2013 of drunk driving.
Perry vetoed financial support from her office when she refused to resign, leading to an indictment against Perry — who could potentially be a 2016 presidential candidate — before a Grand Jury this month in Austin.
The tweet reads, “I don’t always drive drunk with three times the permissible alcohol level ... but when I do, I’m prosecuting Governor Perry if he plays it out.”
I am the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
Lehmberg's office was not entrusted with managing the Grand Jury's investigation against Perry.
This was led by Michael McCrum, a San Antonio special prosecutor chosen by a Republican judge.
Perry pleaded not guilty and called the indictment a political trick.
His high-ranking team of lawyers requested the judge in charge of the case to reject the charge, arguing that the law prosecuting the oldest governor in the history of Texas is unconstitutionally diffuse.
Perry halted $7.5 million in government funding to the state’s Public Integrity Unit – which is based in Travis County and investigates cases of state corruption in Texas – when Lehmberg refused to resign.
This veto caused a public complaint from a leftist Watchdog group.
Perry’s official user account is frequently updated – and sometimes famous.
After finishing fifth in the Iowa elections during his 2012 presidential candidacy, Perry went on to speculate that he would stop by posting a tweet of a photo of himself while jogging near a lake, saying, “South Carolina, we’re coming!”
Berkeley declares housing market back to “normal”
One of London’s most prominent construction contractors pointed out that the housing market in Southeast England has “returned” to normal levels.
Homes in the capital were highly sought after and the subject of enormous price increases, which prompted the Bank of England to set mortgage ceilings in June due to widespread fear of a credit bubble.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of the top-notch construction company Berkeley, said on Monday, “Since the beginning of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels since its 2013 peak,” adding that this provides a “stable action environment.”
London’s real estate market was well positioned during the downturn as foreign buyers pushed into the capital.
According to the Catastrophe Office, prices in the urban area alone rose by 18.5 percent last year, far more than the average increase in England and Wales combined.
The average selling prices for Berkeley’s private, low-cost and student offers increased by about a fifth last year to £423,000 at the end of April.
A stronger pound, however, has made London property ownership less attractive to foreign buyers in recent months – some of them have also been discouraged by the introduction of new property taxes and political rhetoric around a possible “villa tax” ahead of the general election in May.
London-based real estate agent Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market report, which introduced tighter lending regulations, would also lead to lower market growth in both real estate sales and prices in the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday show a drop in mortgage approval in July, which also suggests the real estate market is cooling down.
Hamptions International, another real estate agency, adjusted its forecast for the rise in property prices in London for 2015 down to 3 percent, based on already weakening home price awareness.
The volume of transactions in London’s most expensive areas such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington has now decreased by a quarter year by year, according to broker WA Ellis.
Nevertheless, the desire to have a home in the capital is a blessing for Berkeley as the amount due for futures sales amounts to more than £2.2 billion.
Mr. Pidgley added, “The demand for the right, well-planned product at the best locations remained stable and as a result, deadline sales have also remained stable.”
In June, the company that it had sold 3,742 new homes in the year by the end of April, almost a third more than its pre-crisis high in 2007.
Annual pre-tax earnings increased annually by 40 percent to £280 million, sales by 18 percent to £1.6 billion.
In a statement on Monday before the company’s annual meeting, Mr. Pidgley said that revenue for Berkeley this year is expected to meet current market expectations.
Analysts estimate the annual pre-tax profit at £450 million.
Berkeley stocks stood firmly at £23.96 on London trading in the afternoon.
Nude photos of Jennifer Lawrence posted on the Internet
Jennifer Lawrence appears at the 85th Oscars.
Naked photos of Oscar-winning Jennifer Lawrence were posted online by a hacker who claimed to have a “master list” of images of another 100 starlets.
A representative of the star from "The Tribute of Panem" confirmed that the photos of Lawrence were genuine and sued the hacker for "clandestine violation of privacy".
Authorities have been notified and will pursue all those who post the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The photos originally posted on the photo sharing site 4chan were allegedly obtained through a gap in Apple’s online storage system iCloud. The alleged “master list” of the hacking victims includes the names of dozens of female stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen, BuzzFeed.
It’s not certain how many of the pictures are real, although Winstead, star of “Scott Pilgrim Against the Rest of the World” on Twitter also condemned the hack.
“To those of you who look at the photos that my husband and I took years ago in the private environment of our house – I hope you are so satisfied with yourself,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
However, Victoria Justice from the Nickolode series "iCarly" and "Victorious" denied that the photos were images of her and tweeted "These so-called naked pictures of me are FALSE, people.
Let’s go back to the beginning. – A game of intentions.
Buzzfeed late Sunday that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied the authenticity of the alleged photos of her.
Exclusive excerpt from Howard Jacobs's highly acclaimed new novel about love and the letter "J".
They broke up, it could be best described, they slowly dissolved like a cardboard left in the rain.
Occasionally, a woman told him he was too serious, exhausting, intense, distant, and a bit scratching.
And then shaken his hand.
He knew the brush.
He was stout, like in Igel, yes.
The last victim of this ugliness was a just beginning affair, which had been more promising to ease the lonely boredom of his life than usual, and even brought him some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a tremendously delicate beauty with untamed hair and a flattering heart from a village on the North Island that was even more remote and rough than Port Reuben.
She had come to the south with an elderly escort who thought Kevern was her aunt, and who had inherited a plot in a wet but paradise valley called Paradise Valley.
For several years no one lived in the house.
The pipes were leaked, there were spiders in the baths, naked snails had left their traces on all the windows and thought they belonged to them all, and the garden was overgrown with weeds that looked like giant cabbage heads.
It was like the house from a children’s fairy tale, both threatening and tempting, a garden full of secrets.
Portrait of the author: Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” is on the longlist for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
The shortlist will be announced next week.
Kevern had been sitting with Ailinn hand-held on the broken chairs in the high grass and enjoying an unusually warm spring afternoon. Both had sounded out of mind into the service console, which supplied the country with soothing music and soothing news, when the sight of their crossed brown legs reminded him of an old song of a long-forgotten black entertainer, whom his father had liked to listen to at closed rolloads in the house.
Your feet are too big.
Because of their own aggressiveness, songs of this kind were no longer played on the console.
Not forbidden - nothing was so properly forbidden - just not played.
It has been successfully obsolete, just like the word obsolete.
The general taste achieved what regulations and regulations would never have achieved, and just as in books people choose from dishwasher-to-millionaire memoirs, cookbooks and love novels, so in music they choose the ballads.
In the euphoria of the day, Kevern began playing an imaginary piano and singing Ailinn's big feet in a roughly funny serenade.
Ailinn did not understand that.
"This was a well-known song by a jazz pianist named Fats Waller," he explained to her, automatically putting two fingers on his lips.
This was what his father had always done to stop the letter J before it came out of his mouth.
It had begun as a game between him and his father when he was still a kid.
His father had played it with his own father, he had told him.
If you start a word with a J without putting two fingers over your lips, it costs you a penny.
It wasn’t a very fun game at the time, and it wasn’t a lot of fun now.
He knew that this was expected of him, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn had never heard of anyone.
Jazz was not played, although it was not directly forbidden.
Improvisation was no longer modern.
There was only room for a single “if” in life.
People wanted to be sure at the beginning of a song where it would end.
The mind as well.
His unpredictability made people nervous.
Jazz was musically expressed.
Although he was 10 years old without having heard of Sammy Davis Junior, Kevern knew something about jazz from his father’s semi-secret collection of old CDs.
But at least he didn’t have to explain to Ailinn that Fats Waller was black.
At her age, she probably couldn’t remember a time when pop singers weren’t black.
Again, no laws or constraints.
A conformal society meant that every element of that society gratefully agreed to the principle of group empowerment – grateful as those spared from fate.
People of African-Caribbean descent were suitable for entertainment and sports by temperament and bodybuilding, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent were blessed by nature with electronic talent and were cared for with the task of ensuring that no family remained without a working service phone.
What was left of the Polish community took care of the sewage; what was left of the Greeks crushed plates.
Those from the Gulf States and the Levant whose grandparents had not left the country as soon as WHAT HAD HAVE HAVE HAVEN HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE.
Everyone according to their abilities.
Since she had only heard ballads, it was difficult for Ailinn to understand how the offensive words Kevern had just intended for her could ever be dismissed.
Music was an expression of love.
“They’re not really offensive,” Kevern said.
Except maybe for people whose feet are too big.
My father never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden gave him the deceptive sense of security.
Nothing could overcome the sound insulation of the giant coal-like leaves.
Ailinn still did not understand.
Why should your father love something like this?
He wanted to say it was a jux, but hesitated to put two fingers on his lips again in her presence.
She thought he was something strange.
“It seemed funny,” he said instead.
She shrugged her head unbelievingly and blocked Kevern’s sight.
There was nothing else in the world to see except her uncharted black hair.
There was nothing else he would have wanted to see.
“If you say it,” I mean without conviction.
But that doesn’t explain why you give it to me.
She seemed honestly concerned.
Are my feet too big?
He looked back again.
Your feet are not so straight.
Maybe your ankle, a little bit...
And you say you hate me because my ankle is too thick?
Hate to you?
Of course I do not hate you.
This is just the stupid song.
He could have said “I love you”, but it was too early.
“Your thick ankle is exactly why I like you,” he tried instead.
I am a bit perverse.
It did not sound right.
It should have been funny.
When he tried to be funny, he often got into trouble because, like his father, he did not have the soothing charm needed to curb the cruelty inherent in jokes.
Maybe his father also wanted to be cruel.
Per he, Kevern, wanted to be that.
Despite his friendly eyes.
Ailinn Solomons turned red and stood up from their chair, threw the console and poured out the wine they had drunk.
Holunderflower wine, so drunkenness was no excuse for him.
In her excitement, she seemed to tremble, like palm waves in the storm.
“And your thick head is exactly the reason I feel perverse attracted to you,” she said.
Except that I am not.
She felt sorry for him, both for the unnecessary unfriendliness of his words and for the fear that appeared in their eyes when she revolted against him.
Did she think he would beat her?
She had not told him about life on the cold northern archipelago where she had grown up, but he had no doubt that it was essentially like here.
The same huge and cold ocean broke up here as it did there on the shore.
The same confused men, with even thicker skin and more frightened by THAT HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE been than their ancestors had been as smugglers and robbers, moved from pub to pub, always ready to raise their hand against a woman who refused or laughed at them.
A thick head?
They would have shown her a thick fist if she had not been careful.
They first knock - knocking was the most commonly used word for erotic attraction between men and women, an antidote to the non-spoken love ballads from the console - they first knock and then beat.
According to Kevern, this was an unnecessary refinement, since the crawl itself was already an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons gave him a sign to go through her body.
He stood up from the chair like an old man.
She also felt bleeding, but the wave of his sorrow surprised her.
This was not the end of the world.
They hardly knew each other.
She looked at him as he was moving away—as from a room on the upper floor her companion was watching him—a man complaining about something he had himself invoked.
Adam is leaving the garden, she thought.
She felt a sudden pain for him and men in general, although some had raised their hands against her.
A man turned away from her, bowing his back, ashamed, defeated, without a fighting spirit—why was this a sight she seemed to know well, if she could not remember a single time she had seen such a thing before this day?
When she was alone again, Ailinn looked at Solomon's feet.
Several years before the events just told, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic 32-year-old researcher on behalf of Ofnow, the non-legislative monitoring body for public mood, delivered a brief lecture on the continuing violence at the low and middle levels in precisely those parts of the country where its reduction, if not abolition, would have been most likely to be expected, given the funds and energy invested in eradicating this violence.
“A lot has already been done, and much has yet to be done,” she wrote, “to calm the innate aggressiveness of a people who have fought a thousand wars and won most of them, especially in the remote corners and valleys of the country, where the sweet breath of human kindness has historically rarely been felt despite the elevated church towers between the hills.
But some characteristics turn out to be inexhaustible.
The higher the church tower, it seems, the less the passion it continues to arouse.
People cry when they hear sentimental ballads, get drunk with stories of overcome difficulties, and claim to believe firmly in the virtues of marriage and family life, yet not only does the former cruelty hold the rural communities as well as our urban fabrics firmly in hand, but there is also evidence of the emergence of a new and insidious conflict addiction at home, at work, on the streets and even on the playgrounds.
“They have an unfortunate tendency to exaggerate,” her mentor said after reading the entire report.
I suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum lowered her head.
I also have to ask: are you an atheist?
“I don’t think I have to say that,” Esme Nussbaum replied.
Are you lesbian?
Again, Esme invoked her right to privacy and refusal to make statements.
The feminist?
Still still again.
“I’m not asking this,” Luther Rabinowitz finally said, “because I would be against atheism, lesbianism, or feminism.
This is a prejudice-free workplace.
We serve a prejudice-free society.
But certain types of hypersensitivity, which in themselves are absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, can occasionally distort results as you have imagined them.
They themselves obviously have prejudices against the Church, and those things you call “back-handed” and “rough” could be interpreted by others just as well as expressing a natural force and vitality.
Continuing to wander around what HAS Happened, WHEN HAS Happened, as if it had happened yesterday, means taking away its essential vitality from the country.
Esme Nussbaum looked around while Rabinowitz was speaking.
Behind his head, a LED inscription in Flamingorosa repeated the advice Ofnow had given to the country over the past quarter century or more.
Smile at her neighbor, appreciate her partner, listen to ballads, attend musicals, use her phone, talk, explain, listen, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, singing is better than writing, but nothing is better than love.
"I absolutely understand what you want out of," Esme Nussbaum replied in a quiet voice, as she was sure that her superior had spoken to the end, "and I say nothing but that we are not yet healed as effectively as we pretend ourselves.
My concern is that without warning we may find ourselves repeating the mistakes that at all led to WHAT HAS Happened when it Happened.
This time, however, it is not the others at whom we let go of our anger and our distrust.
Luther Rabinowitz formed a pyramid with his hands.
To show angelic patience.
"You go too far," he said, "if you refer to actions as "mistakes" that our grandparents may or may not have done.
They’re also going too far when you talk that they’ve missed their “rage” and their “dissidence” on “other.”
It shouldn’t actually be necessary to remind someone in your position that in understanding the past as in protecting the present, we’re not talking about “us” and “other.”
There was no “we” and there was no “other.”
It was a time of disorder, that’s all we know.
"Of which, if we are honest with ourselves," Esme dared to throw in, "no part of society can claim to have behaved well.
I do not complain to anyone.
Whether it was done badly or well, what happened has happened.
That was then.
There is no need to say more about this, we agree.
And just as no guilt needs to be assigned, so no guilt needs to be removed if such removal is appropriate and if there is a way to remove it.
But what does the past serve if we don’t learn from it?
The past serves to make us forget it.
If I can say something about it,
Luther Rabinowitz destroyed his pyramid.
“I will consider your report,” he said and fired her.
The next day, as she went to work as usual, she was overtaken by a motorcyclist who, as passers described, had driven onto the pedestrian path in a kind of "brutal anger."
There are coincidences.
Lesotho military member says no coup is planned; prime minister remains in South Africa
Officials of the military in Lesotho denied planning a coup to overthrow the government and said they were taking action against policemen accused of arming political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane fled the country and said that the country's army has surrounded his official residence and occupied government buildings in the capital Maseru.
The prime minister took his family to neighboring South Africa after reporting terror threats.
Military spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said there was no de facto coup d’état, but that the military was responding to the threat of “political fanatics” whose arms were being armed by the police.
“What happened this morning was that the staff of the Defense Forces of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that some elements within the police were acting that actually wanted to arm some of the political, party-political young fanatics who were about to cause devastating damage,” he told Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action gave the impression of a coup d’état.
"Al no one has claimed to have torn the government by force, all reports agree that the activities of Lesotho's defense forces so far show signs of a coup," he said.
A spokesman for the Lesotho military said on Sunday that the soldiers were withdrawing to their barracks and the situation in the capital was quiet.
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoya Metsing takes over the leadership of the government during Thaba’s absence.
Thabane said he believes he has become a target because of his attempt to fight corruption in the country.
There has been great tensions in Lesotho since June after Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to disputes in his unity government.
He said his actions had not undermined the government, despite other accusations.
Eurozone production at a 13-month low
Production growth in the eurozone slowed to its lowest point in 13 months in August, according to a closely observed study.
The final Markit Manufacturing Industry Purchase Manager Index (PMI) fell to 50.7 in August, down from 51.8 in July.
A number above 50 indicates an expansion.
New orders went down and factories experienced robbery at a time of rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures come before the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets expect the bank to have a clear plan to deal with a delayed recovery in the eurozone and the threat of deflation at an inflation rate of only 0.3%.
There are speculations that the head of the ECB, Mario Draghi, could make further statements during this week whether he is considering a quantitative relief for the euro zone, in line with those made by the UK and the US during the financial crisis.
"Al small growth is better than no growth at all, the braking effects of increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainty have become more obvious for manufacturers," said Rob Dobson, senior economist at Markit.
The factory PMI for Germany, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to its lowest level in 11 months at 51.4.
Meanwhile, in the bloc’s second-largest economy, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
France remains a child of concern, as is Italy’s descent from solid expansion to stagnation.
Evidence that growth incentives in the key industrial mechanism in Germany, as well as in Spain and the Netherlands are no longer reassuring, too,” said Mr. Dobson.
The decline in the industry is likely sparking the fire of analysts expecting further monetary or fiscal incentives.
A positive news came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since late 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the Eurozone’s August Procurement Manager Index is that the sector will continue to grow afterwards.”
He added: “Producers in the eurozone obviously find life quite difficult at the moment, as current increased geopolitical tensions – especially with regard to Russia and Ukraine – increase uncertainty in the still difficult conditions in many countries.
These increased uncertainties have clearly affected the economy – in particular, and consumer confidence, and likely lead to some orders being delayed or even cancelled, especially large orders.
He said it will be "increasingly likely" that the ECB will eventually have to initiate some kind of QE, "although we suspect this will be limited."
The Infernal Decade of the Survivors of Beslan: Ten years have passed since the terrible siege of the school, as the children trapped in it still suffer today.
Ten years ago, more than 1,000 people were taken hostage by Chechen militias at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
More than 330 people, more than half of them children, were killed in the three-day martyrdom that shocked the world.
We returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
Exactly a decade after the horrific siege of the school in Beslan, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, the heroic survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When fanatical Islamist terrorists captured and killed children and parents on September 1, 2004, the beginning of a new school year, this seemed to be the worst of evil.
The tragedy united the West and the East in disgust, and then surprisingly turned into action and hope for the future in the midst of the worst misery.
Ten years later, we returned to Beslan to find some of the victims who escaped death in the atrocity in the classroom.
We found surprising young people who have overcome resistance, although the memory of this terrorist hell will chase them forever.
Their greatest hope?
That the war that now plagues Ukraine – and in which children like them die – now ends.
The girl who was photographed trying to climb back into the crushed school gym
She was photographed by the Russian star photographer Dmitry Beliakov and became famous when she just tried to climb back into the shattered school gym after a mine exploded in her underwear.
Completely confused, Aida was looking for her mother, Larissa, now 40 years old.
Both were thought dead, but survived.
“A woman told me to run for my life, but I couldn’t,” Aida said at the time.
My legs were bloodshed.
I got up and climbed in again to look for my mother.
A soldier brought her safely.
After a series of operations, she thought she was completely healed, but said yesterday: "Three months ago, the pain returned.
I am afraid I will have to be operated again.
Some of the grenades are still in my knee.
Her goal is now to become a dentist to help people as she was helped by doctors.
"This tragedy changed my life, but it didn't break me," she says fighting.
“That has happened to me, and that cannot be changed.
Once a year I go to the gym to remember those who stayed there.
My friends and I try not to talk about it on other days.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Dzera Gapoeva was killed there.
We played together when we were young and dreamed of going to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish my studies and start my career.
I think of a family later.
She says that the siege will always remain a part of her, although the memory is getting slightly weaker every year.
I am glad that many people around the world still remember our horrors and we are so grateful for the help we received from people in the UK and everywhere.
When I see the photo of myself online as I climb back to school, I think many people see it for the first time, understand our disaster and help prevent something like that from happening again.
The boy who escaped through the bullet hole believes his mother is dead
It was his first school day (Russians go to school at 7 years old) and survived the three-day siege in the arms of his mother Tamara.
When he was seven, he said, “Mom told me to lie down if there was an explosion and hold her hand.”
After an explosion, he thought she was going to die.
She said to him, “Run.”
Fearing that she might be dead, he fled and saw a crying baby on the way, grabbed it by the hand and fled through a bullet.
His father Vladimir, who held his son in his arms outside, said: "Damir told me that his mother was dead.
He said, “I couldn’t save her.”
In reality, Tamara was kicked out and injured in her legs in the hospital, assuming her son had died.
After her reunion, she said, “I was crying out of joy.
I could not believe it.
He ran in and embraced me.
Damir later flew to London (from the now dissolved newspaper News of the World) to receive the title of Barnardo's Children's Champion from then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie.
"This horror is chasing you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering," he said yesterday.
But I can say that it becomes pale in my memory.
I still know that immediately after that I threw all my toy pistols away.
But now I can play computer games with shooting scenes and that’s no problem for me.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember those children with whom I played in the yard and who failed to get out.
We never say they were killed or dead.
We say they stayed in the sports hall.
I remember very well my trip to London, especially at the toy store, where I could pick up everything I wanted and ride in an open car on top.
But now he’s afraid of a place like Ukraine, where wars are causing the kind of misfortune he and his friends suffered.
This horror follows you every day, but I wish I could stop remembering it.
"I'm so sorry for all those who suffer from the atrocities," said Damir, who worked as a volunteer in a monastery last week.
I want to help so much.
I want to go to the police one day and hope they take me to the training academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, said: “37 children from our neighborhood were killed, can you imagine that?
I remember the terrible silence after the siege, there were simply no children who could cry and walk around, and this silence lasted for many months.
She remembers vividly her trip to London with Damir.
People in London were crying when I told our story.
I then understood how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and show their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and the opportunity to travel to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and just tell her that 10 years have passed, but I still remember meeting her and her husband in London, and how that helped Damir and me.
I still remember how Damir liked to eat Borsch and they called all the local Russian restaurants.
I remember playing with waiters in a restaurant. Damir shot them with his water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And that was just a month after the horror.
I was surprised that the British were so willing to share our pain and support us.
She said, “I always think this world hasn’t gotten better in these 10 years.
In Ukraine, the war is now going on, and people die every day, and I believe that many children have been killed and are still being killed.
They are kids like ours.
I think for many, war is part of the news they hear when they’re bored or busy with something else.
I just know what these people feel, all the horror.
And I can’t stop feeling that.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other and that’s so sad.
Damir has grown up and is a very gentle and calm boy, he is not aggressive or angry at all.
For example, he does not seek revenge, he is not overwhelmed by past abominations.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he has six close class friends and they occasionally go to the gym and light candles there.
When he was younger, he suffered under it – I remember sometimes lying on the couch, turning his face away from us, for hours.
He was not asleep, his eyes were open.
Damir is now 17, bigger than me, good-looking, intelligent and healthy.
I can hardly believe that for a few hours I was so sure that he was dead and I would never see him again.
As I recovered from the explosion and got on my legs, I looked around, and saw the hell around me, with body parts everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my little boy could have survived in this hell impossible.
"I remember shouting to him, 'Damir, run, run away,' but I was also so sure he hadn't heard me.
But he heard it and ran away.
And so life, unlike many others, goes on for us.
Georgy Ilyin, 17
The boy whose terrible image after the siege became a symbol of the abominations of Beslan
Consolation: The Beslan survivor Georgij Lyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 siege, right a picture of Georgij today
His bloody face was marked by fear as he ran for his life as Chechen terrorists shot down his classmates.
His painting was one of the most shocking symbols of the barbarism of Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, had dismissed him for his first school day before rushing to bring her older son Vladimir to university.
"I left the yard about two minutes before the terrorists stormed it, and so my little boy stayed there alone for three terrible days," she recalls.
Not all alone, there was a whole family of relatives of us, but they were all killed.
Only my Georgie managed to survive.
The closer this date comes, the harder it is to think about it and talk about it.
There is no day that we do not remember this tragedy.
We don’t think it’s been a long time ago, I mean it would have happened yesterday, some scenes from those days are always following me.
No one will ever forget that, I promise you.
The image of Georgij (left) was one of the most shocking of the attack and was eternalized as a statue (right).
I remember that Georgi wanted to go to school that day so much. he said he wanted to embrace his teacher.
I only knew he was alive when I saw him on TV.
And now there is even this statue of the crying George in San Marino.
George doesn’t like the picture, and it’s hidden in the bookshelf at home.
I understand this, but I also mean that people around the world are feeling our pain thanks to this image.
Georgij says today: “It is important that such a thing can never happen again.
“I doubt we will ever find out the truth.
People investigate such tragedies over and over again and never learn the truth.
And now they are investigating the crash of this Boeing in Ukraine.
Will we ever find out what caused it?
This world becomes something terrible.
"I can't understand how this is possible, because if you ask the people, no one wants war, so how does that happen?
Ten years is nothing with such pain.
It takes a few decades to forget it a little.
It has attacked my health and I still feel it.
For about three or four years I had a few nightmares about the siege, but then it got better.
I went back to school later in 2004 and was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who had been killed.
That’s why I always go to the sports hall when September 1 comes closer.
I want to pay tribute to my childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to go to the gym, but I have to do it.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is now part of my past.
I will not forget it, but I will not regret it.
My life goes on.
I graduated from school this year and attend a medical college in Vladikavkaz.
I will be a heart surgeon.
My first choice was training in the army.
I wanted to be a soldier, but my health did not allow it.
I wanted to fight for my country, but that won’t happen.
Georgi Fanijev, 20
The boy who survived despite being trapped at the feet of a murderous terrorist
A miracle: Georgy Fanijev was caught at the feet of a murderous terrorist during the siege, but he managed to survive.
During the siege, he was trapped in the gym and sat next to the bomb attached to the foot of a murderous terrorist.
It is a miracle that he was not killed.
"We feel like it was yesterday," says Georgij, who wanted to go to the FSB as a intelligence agent, but could not do so because of his health damage due to the siege.
It’s still with me, it’s nothing I’ve left behind.
I’m older now and people say children can easily deal with bad experiences – I have to say that’s not true.
“I worked with psychologists in 2006 and I actually felt a little better after that, but I can’t forget it.
And I would like to forget.
2005 – the year after – was the first and only time I went back to the gym.
I lost consciousness.
I will never return there again and please do not ask me to show you where I sat in this famous picture.
Survivor: Georgy Fanijev today, with a photo of himself in the hospital after siege on the laptop
My pain is tremendous and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don’t like to think about it or talk about it and they never asked me about school.
Physically I am well.
I should be careful with my injured knee, but I can walk well now.
But because of my health, I could not study at the FSB Intelligence Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent my documents, including the medical, and they answered that it was not possible.
My second passion was animals, so I went to the veterinary institute.
I have been behind there for two years.
He teaches the treatment of all animals "from cats to cows."
He said, “I knew I would never tell my children about my experiences.
Children should not know about this and they should not suffer from it.
His mother, Marina, 42, said, “This pain never leaves me.
It’s in my soul, worse as the anniversary approaches.
I will go to the celebrations to commemorate.
I know that Georgia will not go.
It must be even harder for him because he was there and I wasn’t.
I was waiting for him at home and could not help.
I am so grateful to God that he was returned to me.
It remains within us.
George is now an adult, but that horror is still in him.
It is hard to accept this when something so unfair happens to you.
He is a boy, he likes sports, but he can’t participate because of his knee.
He has been operated several times, he can walk, but does not play sports.
I would say he overcame the horror to 50% but you can never completely overcome it and forget it.
This terrible experience will always pursue us.
Many friends and neighbors were killed in the siege and that only increases my pain.
I lost a lot of people I knew well and who were dear to me.
My son is with me, and this is the greatest gift God could give me, but my heart is crying for the dead.
I know of families in which new children were born, but also of widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart jumped in me when I saw him in the hospital.
And now I see what is happening in the world – wars in other regions.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is very close to our country now and I can hardly believe it.
We were once a friendly country, how can it be that we are fighting now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that in Ukraine many children have already been killed and many will be killed.
If only we could take all these rebels and throw them out – as far away as possible.
Aljona Tskayev, 10
The baby that was safely carried by a special operations command
Rescued: Aljona Tskayev is taken to safety by a Russian Special Operations Command (left).
She is now ten (right) and does not remember at all the atrocities.
The world stopped breathing in 2004 when the baby Aljona was carried in the arms of a Russian policeman from the besieging of Beslan.
The terrorists let them go, but in their cruelty kept their 30-year-old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhar in the school gym.
Makhar, then three years old, escaped, but Aljonas mother and sister died in the murderous slaughter.
Her father Ruslan has since married again and has with his new wife Swetlana a little girl that he named after his lost daughter Kristina.
Aljona, now ten years old, does not remember the siege and has grown into an intelligent and happy girl, neighbors say.
"They are now a big happy family and Aljona and Makhar are both great kids," says a close friend.
Ruslan is a fantastic father and wants to save them all of the memories that come up with the tenth anniversary.
You will understand why.

4 Tips for Better Underwater Photos and Videos
If you like to take photos or videos underwater, there is a selection of devices.
The cheapest option is a waterproof point-and-shoot like the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or an action cam like the GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition, both of which are available for about $300.
I took these photos at a family party with multiple cameras, all available for less than $350.
Regardless of the equipment, there are a few rules for the best results.
Check your equipment twice.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure that the battery compartment and other compartments are tightly sealed.
Also, adjust your camera to the photos or videos you want to capture.
Some cameras and cameras have scene and recording modes that optimize exposure time for dark underwater conditions.
And before you jump in, check to what depth your equipment is working.
Some cameras are only allowed for up to 5 feet, others up to 50 or 60 feet.
Look in our shopping guide and reviews for digital cameras for conventional and waterproof models.
Do multiple shots – because many won’t work out.
Point-and-Shoot cameras have an LCD that allows you to compose images, action cameras usually don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, it’s hard to watch it underwater, and the right image setting is a lucky thing.
So you do a lot of recordings.
If your camera has a row mode that takes a series of shots with slightly changed exposure settings, use it.
Stay close to the surface.
The light becomes dramatically worse the further you get away from the surface.
So, if possible, stay close to the surface when shooting in a pool, lake or sea.
This also allows you to bring more color to your photos; the deeper you go, the less color you will see.
Get close to the objects.
This is also a good advice on land, but it is even more important underwater because of the poor lighting conditions.

Andrew Lawson was a man of the kind whose character changed things, even in such a giant organization as the NHS.
As a consultant anesthetist, he dedicated his career to saving the patient from both the agony of the disease and the torments of treatment.
Among his patients, his wife recalls, was a MI6 employee who had to live with the devastating effects of torture.
Lawson knew that diagnoses and diseases are important to doctors, while those treated are mostly concerned with something completely different: pain.
However, one day in 2007, he was the one whose path of suffering began.
“I didn’t feel it,” he wrote in May of this year.
I had trouble getting up.
While struggling with the flu-like symptoms, he noticed that he impatiently complained to his wife Juliet.
“I’d rather do it now than later,” he said.
When Juliet was on a business trip for a week, Lawson felt unusual and unnecessarily upset.
Something was in the air.
He asked a colleague to do a X-ray examination of his chest.
Just two weeks ago, he had been skiing in the French Alps.
The results of the X-ray examination were present.
He suffered from mesothelioma, an incurable cancer that attacks the chest, that is, the skin that overlooks the lungs.
As with most cancers, the exact trigger is usually difficult to determine.
For example, while some smokers develop lung cancer, not all lung cancer patients have previously been smokers.
But mesothelioma is different.
In almost all cases, the trigger is an asbestos load – contact with the fiber building material, which was once considered a “miracle substance” but has now been recognized as deadly.
For most of us, mesothelioma is a condition that can easily be ignored.
Asbestos is a product of the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has ceased to be used in the UK since the 1960s when the industry voluntarily committed to ceasing to use it.
Even where it was still used, only people in certain industries worked directly with the fabric - for example, clusters, construction workers, carpenters and shipyard workers.
As an industrial hazardous substance from a different era, it does not seem to be a matter of concern today.
But this self-satisfaction is inappropriate.
Britain, it seems, is experiencing the peak of a mesolthelioma epidemic today.
There are more deaths from mesothelioma here than in any other country in the world.
With a total of 2,500 deaths per year, twice as many people die from this disease as in road accidents.
Annual numbers of mesothelial deaths since 1980 and expected future deaths in the UK
The reason we are experiencing the deadly effects now, although asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were banned in 1999), is that a mesothelioma only develops after decades.
And the plunder of the mesothelioma is not limited to former workers in the construction industry.
Asbestos has been, and is often still, present in the homes in which we live, the offices in which we work, the schools in which we study, and the shops in which we shop.
And therefore mesothelioma knows no class boundaries, financial boundaries, professions or age.
The privileged bastions, from the elegant shopping malls in London to private schools, are not shelters.
Parliament buildings are polluted with asbestos.
Even in the hospitals, where we are supposed to be healed, this deadly carcinogen has already been established as a starting point.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He was not a clampster either.
In fact, it was difficult for him to imagine where he might have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he found out.
“It looks like there was a lot of asbestos in the tunnels at Guy’s Hospital where I trained for six years,” he wrote.
Everyone - students, nurses, doctors and caregivers - use the tunnels.
How many of my peers will suffer from the same disease?
Unfortunately, he was able to answer this question at least in part.
"Of the four doctors trained at Guy's Hospital who have been ill with mesothelioma in the last five years," he wrote in a letter in 2010, "I am the last one still alive."
How many of us will still get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma at the age of 48.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
It was an unusually long survival period.
Fifty percent of all mesothelioma patients die within 8 months of diagnosis.
The disease always ends deadly.
We can therefore only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will still get sick?”
Britain’s leading mesothelioma expert, Professor Julian Peto, estimates that between 1870 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain is expected to come to an end, a total of 90,000 people will have died of the disease.
Most of them don’t even know they’re going to die like this.

A brief look at the court files, to which the persons affected frequently turn for claims for damages, shows how widespread the mesothelioma plunder is already.
In June of this year, Marks & Spencer admitted, for example, that Janice Allen was negligently exposed to asbestos.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, and was in charge of the clothing department at two locations - one of which was the flagship store on Oxford Street.
Mrs. Allen was only 18 when she started working at M&S.
She now has two children in her 20s.
“Before that,” she says, “I had never heard of mesothelioma, I didn’t even know anything about asbestos.
I never thought this would affect me.
There are few people who know a lot about asbestos.
Asbestos is not a substance but a group of six minerals.
The name derives from the word “asbestiform”, a description of the fiber structure that makes the fabric resilient and flexible.
Three of the six were used in construction.
Chrysotile, also known as white asbestos, is by far the most common asbestos found in buildings today.
It has been used for roof panels, floor panels, pipe insulations, boiler insulations, even for brake coatings in cars.
It is less fatal than other forms of asbestos, but is still viewed by the EU and WHO as a “large health risk” with possible fatalities.
However, more dangerous are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocydolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts suspect that “there is clear but indirect evidence that this was a major reason for the uniquely high mesotheliom rates.”

Janice Allen may not have seen herself as a typical mesothelioma victim, but Julian Peto’s work suggests that her story is not unusual at all.
He presented a study of those affected, showing that “a substantial proportion of mesotheliomas without known exposure by work or at home were probably caused by asbestos contact in the environment.”
Much of these contacts, he said, are due to the “normal use and ageing” of our buildings.
It seems like no one can assume that they are safe.
A report by Goddard Consulting, which examined the Palace of Westminster, shows how people, even in the heart of the government, could have been unwittingly exposed to the substance.
In 2009, Goddard that the service boxes and pipelines behind Parliament’s committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be stirred up by something as harmless as “strong air movements.”
Members of parliament are often accused of caring for their own interests, but here it looks like the opposite is true.
While the Directorate of Parliamentary Labour Service has insisted that the Westminster Palace has received a “clean health certificate,” it is now undeniable that £1 billion of labor effort will be spent over several years to renovate the Parliament, modernize the electrical installations, and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 general election, MEPs are likely to meet at the nearby QE2 conference center rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report also pointed out that “the presence of asbestos has not been handled in accordance with the relevant regulations.”
No one knows if this mismanagement will cost lives.
All you can do now is wait.
One person who could never accurately determine the contact with asbestos is Graham Abbott, a general practitioner.
Like Andrew Lawson, the 50-year-old Abbott suspects that he was exposed to asbestos during his work in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where asbestos claims were ruled positively,” he says, “but I can’t prove it in my case.
It’s so hard to remember all the places you’ve worked on and the dates.
What he remembers very well is the day in early December 2009, when he got a kind of fever.
He was 45 years old and had an operation late in the evening.
Suddenly I had a frost.
It came suddenly.
I felt terrible.
I thought I could no longer make the trip home.
As a doctor, Abbott knew that the pain originated from the chest, the skin around his lungs.
But like Janice Allen, he had no reason to suspect a mesothelioma.
He did not go to work for a month.
Surprised doctors took X-rays of his chest and set up a pleural catheter to extract fluid from his lungs and test it in the laboratory.
However, his symptoms remained undiagnosed.
His health slowly improved and he returned to his workplace.
However, from time to time the symptoms returned, often after exercise and heavy breathing.
In 2011, an Abbotts patient came into his practice with similar symptoms and was later diagnosed with mesothelioma.
But even now, Abbott did not link this to his own case.
After all, his patient was a few decades older and had worked directly with asbestos.
The connection in this case was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition deteriorated again and his family doctor brought his CT scans and X-rays to an expert group.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott first felt ill, a camera-equipped probe was inserted into the cave between the rib and chest.
I am an optimist.
I usually just keep going,” he says.
Honestly, I hadn’t worried so much.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy appeared in the week between Christmas and New Year: "I was told it was mesothelioma."
Graham Abbott diagnosed with mesothelioma
Suddenly, Abbott had appointments with Macmillan nurses, one of whom advised him to take a lawyer.
It was only now that he understood the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos was very widespread, especially in large public buildings where pipes were often insulated with asbestos,” he says.
People exposed to asbestos in these buildings are now getting sick.
And so mesothelioma now affects younger people who have not worked in the typical professions.
The most dangerous tubes with asbestos insulation in hospitals were underground, so patients were probably less likely to be exposed to the substance.
But many employees who switched from one building to another in pedestrian tunnels (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in underground canteens (as Graham Abbott often did) were most likely to come into contact with the toxic substances.
It turns out that for several decades after the war, hospitals may have been life-saving for patients, but life-threatening for the treating doctors.
He is still removed today.
Students put their bunsen burners on asbestos carpets.
This is not just about hospitals.
Asbestos has been widely used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls due to its fabulous insulating and flame-resistant properties.
and schools too.
In fact, many people have probably had the first asbestos contact in the classroom.
Thro the country, in thousands of chemistry hours, students have put their bunsen burners on asbestos carpets.
The issue of asbestos in schools is now often discussed on websites.
Meanwhile, such innocent objects in our homes, such as floor plates or shed roofs, have contained asbestos as standard.
"It's an industrial poison that's contained in large parts of our properties," notes Andrew Morgan, the lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his trial against Guy's Hospital.
In one case, the only contact that came to mind to a affected woman was the demolition of a garden hole in the 1970s.
So be careful how you tear off your garden bowl.
The effects of diagnosis, and the knowledge that the disease is incurable, are immense.
"It takes a while to process that," says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I realized I couldn’t focus on what I was doing.
I was in practice for two weeks.
Then I knew I had to go and take care of myself.
I will not see another Christmas.
With the greatest difficulty was the shift of perspective from the position of a doctor to that of a patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how overwhelmed he was of all the information he had to deal with.
“It was very difficult to record all that,” he says.
I asked my doctor, “How long do I have?”
I was given about 12 months.
I remember thinking, “Well, I’m not going to experience another Christmas.
That was then.”
Mesothelioma is insidious because it is our life-supporting mechanism – the breathing itself – that causes the deadly cancer.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by asbestos contact.
Asbestos is made up of the smallest fibers.
When the asbestos is vertebrated and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the chest, the skin around the lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the chest skin and can trigger cell mutations.
“The problem arises with the needle-shaped asbestos fibers inhaled,” says Professor Tom Treasure, a heart-thorax doctor who moved to Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
It is precisely the hospital from which Andrew Lawson suspects that it has exposed him to asbestos that is now, ironically, a leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure knew Lawson and treated a few others who were probably also exposed to asbestos during their training in the hospital.
As soon as the asbestos needles reach the lung tissue, Treasure says, “they are pushed by the breathing process to the edge where the skin is.
It is invasive from the beginning.
The usual options for other cancers do not work as well with mesothelioma.
The effectiveness of an operation, for example, is hotly controversial.
Some think it is worth a try.
Treasure denies this.
“You can’t cut the chest off,” he says.
You don’t go around with the knife.
Meanwhile, the cancer “does not respond very well to chemotherapy,” which “shows effect,” but does not cure.
“Sometimes there are long-term survivors,” Treasure says.
In the end, they all die.
Fortunately, some patients actually live longer, much longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After contacting mesothelioma, Abbott came into contact with Andrew Lawson, who had become a one-man support and counseling office for fellow patients four years after his diagnosis.
“Hello, Cancer Centre,” he presented himself joyfully at the calls.
“He was very positive,” says Abbott.
He had received his diagnosis 4 years earlier and was still very active.
Originally, Abbott had been offered six cycles of chemotherapy that lasted four months and was expected to only extend his life by one month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
However, Lawson managed to “make things appear in a slightly more positive light.”
After consulting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue his treatment with Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski, a heart-thorax specialist at Guy's.
“We had an advantage in not having to be forwarded, I just called and got an appointment,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a referral and wait for treatment approval.
Money is crucial for mesothelioma patients to be able to experience the best available therapies.
But when these treatments inevitably end up failing, many sufferers face a different financial concern – about the future of the families they leave behind.
And so they turn to the courts in the hope of compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“It’s been known since 1898 that asbestos is extremely dangerous to health,” says Morgan.
But what changed in the 1960s is that it was realized that even very low stress posed a health risk.
And here the negligence of companies began to play a role.
Andrew Lawson and Guy’s Hospital eventually filed their case, but it wasn’t what Morgan calls a “full compensation” because Lawson couldn’t prove with absolute certainty that his mesothelioma was due to an asbestos contact on Guy’s.
However, after investigating his death, a Guy’s spokesman confirmed that “the asbestos fibers in the affected basement area were removed in the 1990s.”
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
In fact, for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation, it’s a huge problem to attribute the deadly asbestos contact to a company or workplace – usually decades after the incidents.
Many of their former employers have been sold or closed.
Insurance documents can be lost.
And those who defend themselves against claims know that the time is for them, but not with the plaintiffs.
In response, this year there were clear new legislation that makes it easier for people with mesothelioma to seek compensation, even if their former employers are no longer to be found.
The law has set up an insurance industry-sponsored fund of £350 million for anyone who was diagnosed after July 2012, can prove a contact but can’t sue anyone.
In these cases, the applicants receive 80 percent of what a court could have agreed to them in a normal compensation proceedings – about £120,000.
Approximately 300 successful applications to the program are expected each year.
Andrew Morgan thinks like so many mesothelioma affected that £350 million represented a “very good job” of the insurance industry.
“This is an insurer’s deal for insurers,” he says, suggesting that this amount is about a quarter of what insurers would have had to pay if time had not gone by and mesothelioma patients could find the companies and normally sued them.
Mike Penning, then Labour and Pension Minister, also admitted that the law was “not perfect.”
But both Penning and Morgan admitted that with seven deaths every day, quick action was needed.
“People are suffering so much and need help today,” Penning said during the second hearing of the Mesothelioma Act in December last year.
At that time, Graham Abbott was in the hands of Prof. Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After her first consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended an operation from which he expects a positive effect, unlike Tom Treasure.
This was accompanied by radiation therapy and chemotherapy – a triple therapy with which Lang-Lazdunski can present a five-year survival rate of up to 40 percent.
Abbot felt strengthened.
“This is of course the most important thing,” says Abbott.
This is often seen in patients.
There is something that keeps you going.
If you give up, you get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent an operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he had the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Follow-up scans showed no signs of the disease.
I had a scan in March 2014.
There were several cancer spots around my chest.
I just turned 50.
This is not life-threatening.
This is lifelong.
Abbott underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
No trace of the tumor is visible anymore.
But the process is physically and mentally very stressful.
You need to think about practical things – about the money when I’m no longer, for example, or show my wife how the boiler time setting works.
If you get bad news, you get negative.
You have to look forward.
As the father of Ellie, 16, and Tamsin, 14, it’s not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It is hard to know what to say and how much.
When I got my first diagnosis, I told my girlfriend that I had a disease with which I’t get old.
They reacted very differently.
Tamsin is very sociable and silent.
She told her friends and soon we got a lot of calls.
Ellie was more restrained.
She said not much.
Such conversations are something that all cancer patients need to go through.
But for those with mesothelioma, such conversations are not filled with hope, not a trace of hope for survival.
The disease brings (as in the end also for Stephen Jay Gould) a grim security.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mesothelioma is not life-threatening.

China denies Hong Kong right to government elections, protesters swear retaliation
On Sunday, the Chinese parliament, despite increased calls for democratic reforms, voted against the Hong Kong electorate’s nomination of candidates for the 2017 elections.
This action is likely to fuel the long-awaited protests in Hong Kong’s business district, while activists started planning and mobilizing within hours of the announcement.
The decision of the Chinese People’s Congress basically allows the Communist leaders to reject all non-Beijing candidates.
"It doesn't come unexpectedly, but it makes us angry," said Emily Lau, the leader of the Democratic Party.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They lied to Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In his defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress, said that accepting public nominations in the elections for the Hong Kong government would be too "chaotic."
Since 1997, when Britain returned control of Hong Kong to the Chinese, Beijing has pledged to let the inhabitants elect the government chairman from 2017.
The Chinese leadership presented Sunday’s decision as a democratic breakthrough because it gives Hong Kong citizens the right to vote directly, but the decision also makes it clear that the Chinese leadership is firmly in control of the process through a Beijing-controlled nomination committee.
According to a new clause, only candidates "with love for the country and love for Hong Kong" will be admitted.
The decision follows a summer when some of Hong Kong’s biggest and most popular protests in several years took place.
Behind the pro-democratic campaign in Hong Kong is the Occupy Central with Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to shut down the financial district if Beijing does not allow genuine universal voting.
On Sunday evening, within hours of the announcement, hundreds of Occupy Central supporters had gathered in the rain outside the government headquarters in Hong Kong.
During the demonstration, the organizers said their movement had reached a new level of civil disobedience and planned waves of protest in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide further details, apparently to avoid problems with the authorities.
In an online statement, the organizers said that the movement “has considered the occupation of the central district only as a last resort, an action that should only take place when all the opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and there is no other choice.
We regret to have to say that today all opportunities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the central district will definitely take place.
Hong Kong authorities have been preparing for days for Beijing’s announcement, and there were tightened security measures outside the government building on Sunday, including police and barricades.
The unrest is amplified by the feeling of many in Hong Kong that they are slowly losing control of their city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition for products and services.
Furthermore, there is growing fear that Hong Kong’s values such as democracy and freedom of speech are beginning to crumble under growing pressure from Beijing.
Some criticized the Occupy-Central movement’s demonstrations as endangering business operations – Hong Kong’s vital vein.
"The protests they are talking about could cause great economic damage depending on how many are involved and how long they last," said law expert Regine Ip, who has long criticized the movement.
We do not want to raise fears that Hong Kong is out of control.
This impression is bad for investments.
China’s state-controlled media also recently on Hong Kong’s democracy activists as subversive agents controlled by Western powers.
This summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, attending 780,000 people – more than a fifth of Hong Kong’s voters.
In July, tens of thousands took part in one of the largest democratic demonstrations in the region’s history.
The tradition of school graduation balls in the U.S. is now being transferred to the universities, where Freshmen performances are offered on the private plane.
We are excited to respond to this demand and offer the UK’s first luxury travel service to students today.
To a impressive performance at the university, the company also offers transport options such as private planes, Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Marten or McLaren P1.
Mr. Stewart also stated that the service has a security team.
This service is an ideal alternative for students who would otherwise have to shuffle their possessions in a dangerously overloaded car across the country.
Together with our new VIF options, we look forward to ensuring that students reach the university this year with a minimum of effort and a maximum of luxury.
A company spokesman said there were no new bookings as the service has just been introduced, but added that “students will book the service in the coming weeks.”
The company also said it expected a market for this offer despite the £9,000 tuition fees per year.
Students today differ greatly in their expectations and demands from students 10, 20, 30 or 40 years ago – it’s more important than ever to make a great first impression, and with VIF you can do just that.
However, the National Student Union criticized the service as removed.
Megan Dunn, NUS vice president for higher education, said: “This offer seems completely separate from the lives of the majority of students.
Many students starting their studies this month are exposed to a cost of living crisis as the available financial grants in the form of loans and scholarships do not keep pace with the sharply rising bills for the simplest living facilities before they can even think of spending thousands of pounds on something as simple as arriving at the student residence.
Feminist Women Criticise Racism and Police Behavior After Ferguson
The unarmed teenager was killed earlier this month by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo.
The participants raised their hands in the air and sang, “Hands up, don’t shoot,” while waiting for the funeral.
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Mo, over the shooting of unarmed teenager Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez noticed a change in white feminist online discussions.
In their experience, white feminist commentators put gender before race when it comes to addressing reproductive rights and income inequalities.
However, as tensions rose in the Middle West and gained attention across the country, Perez saw that white women’s responses were 100% around the race.
Compared to the responses of black women shortly after the August 9 shots, the personal essays with titles such as “Thoughts about Ferguson by a white woman” and “Feminism is not just about women’s oppression” came relatively late.
But for Perez, this meant a major change.
"I don't think you can find in feminism a lot of people who talk about being white and privileges in such a high-class way," she said.
People felt pressured to say something about the incidents.
It is characteristic of the crisis we are in and because the situation in Ferguson is so ethnic that they have to express it.
For English professor Koritha Mitchell of Ohio State University, Ferguson highlighted problems that black American women face every day, but are not seen as “women’s topics” in the cultural space.
"I can post something funny on Facebook about myself and my partner and get 150 likes from anywhere," Mitchell said.
When I post something about how coloured people are under siege in their own country, the silence is anesthetic.
"How can it be safe for women to talk about a relationship in public, but not about safety in public?" she asked.
For black women like Mitchell, who have studied race, gender, and sexuality throughout U.S. history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender issues.
For them, black women have not had the luxury of cleanly separating themes; they live in the combined reality every day.
While white women are now linking the topics of race and gender in the feminist mainstream circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women and gender studies at George Mason University, says that their predecessors did the opposite.
"Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 black men were lynched and the justification was almost always the rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
White women had to be involved in the story to justify the Lynch murder.
For Hattery, the division between white and black women came to the point where white women’s voting rights fighters such as Susan B. Anthony analyzed the country in the late 19th century and found that the struggle for voting rights could only be successful for one group each: women or blacks.
"They made the decision to fight for women's voting rights, and the voting rights for blacks should come later," Hattery said.
When one remembers such things, one becomes powerfully aware of why colored women do not trust white women.
We did not do our job well.
We have never helped black women protect their husbands and sons.
Even after women were granted the right to vote in 1920, it took another decade for white women to organize against lynching in the Association of Southern Woman for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed almost 40 years after the original request for help from black women, says Mitchell.
For Mitchell, the flood of white feminist reactions to the questions raised by Ferguson - police behavior, racial discrimination - is a mirror of the time when white feminists were "playing captive" with the problems black women have been dealing with for generations.
"Wouldn't it be great if the activists who have such traditional feminist platforms take the right to raise a child as seriously as they do with the right to control conception?" asked Mitchell.
Second-generation feminists, who built their careers on the struggle for reproductive rights and access to contraception, are now trying to understand what this means.
The well-known white feminist activist Gloria Steinem went on Facebook two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown and posted a pointed article by Rebecca Carroll, the Guardian columnist, demanding more protests from white Americans on the subject of racism.
"I hope that women who have a different but parallel reason to understand a danger inherent in the body - and opinions about race that are significantly different in public polls - will point to the changes," Steinem wrote.
Although Steinem stands for a rather intersectional feminism that addresses racial as well as gender issues, some of her comments on racial issues in America are still stunned.
Christina Sommers, a researcher at the American Enterprise Institute and author of "Who Stole Feminism?" told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are "much more vulnerable than their sisters," but Steinem's comments on Ferguson are contrary to their previous criticism.
There are now hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost nothing for boys.
But when the White House recently introduced a small program, My Brother’s Keeper, to help vulnerable young black and Hispanic men, there were annoying reactions from many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The relationship between the police and the black community is not the only problem that is pushing into the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After U.S. border police seized 63,000 unaccompanied minors on the country’s southwestern border this year, the issue of immigration reform also comes to the surface – this time as a women’s theme.
Andrea Mercado, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration reform, said that in order to reconsider the issue as a key theme for women, she just needs to publish the stories of immigrant women.
“These speak for themselves,” said Mercado.
When the vast majority of work visas go to male immigrants, the women who accompany them are in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and exploitation.
“These stories find a relief in the women’s organizations,” she said.
Pork House in Ipswich is for sale
The image of a house for sale was removed by real estate agents when it became apparent that it showed a large pig that had made it comfortable in the living room.
The standing house has one bedroom, is located on a private street in Ipswich and is offered for £120,000.
The details included an image of the house's living room - which also included a pig that had his head lying on a couch.
Real estate agent Connells said the pig in the photo was the owner’s pet.
"H, the photo was mistakenly published and has now been removed," a spokeswoman for the company said.
In the Exposé of the House, Connells described the former congregation house as a “unique one-family house with one bedroom.”
Although the broker has removed the image from the website, it still appears on advertising material.
The house sale caused interest on social media when some asked if the pig was included in the purchase price.

A newspaper kiosk in Harvey drew the jackpot in the first division draw for the second time in five years, after $1 million in November 2009.
The lucky winner has yet to be announced.
Store owner Steve Forward said the profit provided conversation material in the small town in the southwest of Perth.
The city is talking about nothing else, and everyone is pretty excited.
We thought that such a profit could happen.
Eight WA winners have celebrated wins in the first division last month, a decent finish for a few happy weeks for the players in the state.
Last week, a player from Canning Vale became one of the five millionaires in August after a couple from Belmont made the $7.5 million mega win just weeks earlier.
The winning couple had been playing for twenty years and said the win would allow them the opportunity to travel the world and buy a new home.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th first division winner in WA this year, with a total of $85 million.
Leonidas entered the Gladiator Arena
Not only the gladiators stood knee-deep at the first Rheinbach Roman Day in the recreational park.
However, the attraction of the event was strong enough to attract more than 1,000 visitors yesterday, who challenged the rains and the autumn cold and let themselves enchant the historical spectacle.
There was a colorful series of representations, performances, games, exhibits and information about the time of the Romans and their significance for the Rhine.
The main attraction of the day was undoubtedly the martial combat troops from the Gladiator School "Amor Mortis", which used every rain break to demonstrate their robust martial arts in the arena prepared with soft sand.
Gladiator owner "Leonidas" proved to be a humorous and knowledgeable presenter, successively sending his men into the ring for heroic duel in different gladiator breeds.
First, the "provocators" were in turn with a right-wing shield and a short sword, as well as leg ribbon on the left leg and arm ribbon on the right arm.
The "Essedarii" followed with chest shield, short sword and throwing plant, as well as iron gladiator helmet, leg and arm protection.
Particularly impressive was the appearance of the "Retiarius", who played against the "Secutor" with a throwing net, three-pack and dolch and after a short fight struck the boy to the ground.
Then the swords crashed metal to each other, the shields formed and the throwing plants flew surprisingly through the arena, so that one could fear and fear for the health of the gladiators.
But the imposing "Summa Rudis", the muscular referee, had a always attentive eye on it.
“We wanted to revive the Roman everyday life and make the culture of the Roman era possible,” Lorenz Euskirchen, chairman of the organizer “Freundeskreis Römerkanal”, explained the intention behind the spectacle.
After two years of preparation, the amusement park became a "Oppidum Romanum" for a day, a Roman city, as Deputy Mayor Claus Wehage noted in his greeting.
After all, the Romans not only brought war and conquest to our region, but also the Roman culture and numerous structures that we still admire today.
Remains of it were also to be admired during the Roman day, such as the "Aqueduct Marble" from the eleven meters high and 1400 meters long Roman Canal Bridge, which once stood near Lüftelberg.
The Frontinus company used to deal with the water and energy supply once and now, and managing director Petra Fricke knew: "We still benefit from the knowledge of the time today."
This is also confirmed by graduate measuring engineer Ralph Heiliger of the "IngenieurteamZwei" from Rheinbach, who introduced measuring instruments of the Romans such as Chorobat, Groma or Dioptra.
The Römervilla in Blankenheim presented sketches and models from the excavations in 1894 as well as bricks from the original hypocaust, the hot air heater that once heated the Römervilla.
Also impressive are the footprints left by wolves and foxes two millennia ago in the footsteps of clay before they were burned.
In 2011, the Office for Land Mining at the Landesverband Rheinland had excavated the remains of a Roman villa in the Gewerbepark Nord in Rheinbach.
The walls of an economic building have been found with a darre for drying grains and for grinding.
The building probably belonged to a Villa Rustica, an agricultural estate, archaeologist Dr. Jennifer Morscheiser explained.
A series of finds from these excavations she presented in a glass vitrine, including a large plate, several fine glass vessels, as well as parts of a graceful necklace.
The villa probably existed from the first to the fourth century AD, until the invasion of the Germanians in the then Roman Rhine, Morscheiser suspects.
The children were also involved in the Roman windmills game, similar to today's windmills game, or they wrote their names with metal gripes on waistboards, like the Roman students once did.
At the stand of the Römerthermen Zülpich the children were allowed to lay mosaics themselves, at the stand of the Glasmuseum Rheinbach to stain glass mosaics and at the stand of the Eifel Nettersheim Nature Centre to use a heavy wheat mill made of stone to grind the flour for a flat bread or a mill.
With the original, faithfully rebuilt Roman touring car, drawn by two cold-blooded people, visitors travelled through the leisure park and also passed by the impressive stand of the City Gymnasium, which presented the results of their "Roman project weeks".
With a Roman week from 13 to 21 September, the municipality of Wachtberg will also enter the Roman Year 2014, proclaimed throughout the Rhine, which is to commemorate the death of Emperor Augustus 2,000 years ago.
Together with the homeland and history associations, as well as the Wachtberger Wander-Verein, the Partnerschaftsverein and the Laienspielkreis Oberbachem, thematic walks, a lecture, cooking evenings and guided tours for school classes will be offered to remind Wachtberg of the Roman past.
For example, a Roman legionaire is told about his work on the sloping Wachtberg, plants are presented as living monuments from the Roman era, and a funny lesson on international understanding is offered between a group of Wachtberger "Germans" and attracted Romans.
The Adendorfer Primary School is dedicated to the Romer Theme as part of a project week.
With the Roman Week, the numerous, but often no longer visible traces of the Romans in Wachtberg will be experienced again.
In the Wachtberger Rathaus, a small presentation will commemorate the discovery of the Berkumer Matronenheiligtum in 1879.
Ebola: the epidemic hurts the West African economy
The Ebola epidemic in West Africa is also a severe blow to the economy.
Markets are orphaned - and international companies are moving away.
The devastating Ebola epidemic has devastated the West African economy.
The harvest is rotting on the fields, the mines are abandoned and the markets harvested - the virus has hardly added to the region.
Some international companies are also already moving away.
“The Ebola epidemic is not only a medical crisis, but also an economic one,” said Donald Kaberuka, the head of the African Development Bank.
Liberia is the most affected.
“It’s a total catastrophe, we’re losing a lot of money,” says Alhaji Bamogo, who sells clothing in Liberia’s second-largest market, Monrovia.
Only those who want to buy food or something to disinfect against Ebola can enter the market.
Liberia is the country most affected by the virus, with more than 600 people killed here alone.
Recently, health authorities said the disease spread to every corner of the country.
The virus has also spread to Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria.
Overall, more than 1,500 people have already died, and thousands more have stuck.
Foreign companies withdraw employees
Everywhere in the resource-rich countries, companies expand their operations.
Foreign companies such as the steel group Arcelor Mittal are withdrawing their employees, several international airlines are no longer flying to the affected regions.
The local merchants and farmers also react: few merchants still leave their hometowns to get feed.
In some areas of Sierra Leone and Liberia, which are under quarantine, cacao and coffee beans important for export are rotting on the fields, among others.
The farmers do not dare to leave their homes for the harvest.
Food is scarce
“People will travel less and less,” says Phillipe De Vreyer, a Paris expert on the West African economy.
For example, the man who usually goes to the market and sells his vegetables prefers to stay at home.
The population is therefore feeling the consequences of the epidemic directly and urgently: food is becoming scarce.
On the markets, the supply of basic foods such as rice is declining.
At the same time, the region, which is heavily dependent on international companies, is threatened with imagery damage – with far-reaching consequences.
The biggest danger is that international companies will generally avoid the area for a long time, says Philippe Hugon of French think tank Iris.
What matters is how far and how long the virus will spread.
Investors may have the impression that "it is dangerous to live in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia and therefore to invest," Hugon warns.
The disease also burdens the tight state budgets of states
The disease also burdens the already tight state budgets of the affected countries.
The rating agency Moody's fears that its budgets will be heavily strained by the high spending on the health system and the deteriorating economy.
The African Development Bank has already pledged to aid the health systems of the affected countries with $60 million (€45 million).
The effects are already noticeable in Nigeria, where only a few cases of Ebola have been diagnosed.
However, the oil-rich region in the southern Niger Delta has not yet been affected.
Many people are still staying at home for fear of infection.
Reservations in hotels are also declining.
Protectors celebrate their 50th anniversary
The Schützenverein "Tannenwald" Berngau celebrates its 50th anniversary from 12 to 14 September.
At Hochtouren, the Schützenverein Tannenwald is preparing for the 50th anniversary of the foundation from 12 to 14 September.
On Friday, September 12, a great entertainment evening with the group "Dorfrocker" is planned.
On Saturday at 18:00 there will be a big shooting.
Then in the big tent is the evening of the mood with the "Stoapfälzer Spitzbuam".
Blaskapelle takes care of the music
Highlights on Sundays are the feast service and at 9:30 in the parish church and the great feast at 14 a.m.
In the afternoon there is also the price distribution of the federal and gauschießens.
A beautiful sight will be the 25 Festdames with their Dirndlns.
Festkapelle is the Blaskapelle Berngau.
The patronage was assumed by Mayor Wolfgang Wild and Secretary of State Albert Füracker.
The original name "Schützengesellschaft Tannenwald Berngau" dates back to 1907, when on 21 March the association was founded for "social entertainment by means of exercise in room-stutzen and small-caliber shooting".
The Nazi regime caused the dissolution of the association in 1937.
It was only in 1964 that 19 young men found themselves again, who on 30 April in Lukas's hostel raised the "new" shooters' club "Tannenwald" Berngau from the baptism.
Karl März and Adolf Ried led the club through a difficult initial period, where it was mainly about finding a club room and installing the shooting operation.
Already in the autumn of 1965, the shooter club started in the hostel "Leininger" with two teams in the round competitions.
In the following years, the sports shooters, now organized in seven teams, established themselves in all classes up to the 1st Gauliga.
The club records broke every year and the magic limit of 380 rings was first reached in 1980 by Rudi Meier.
Just as the performance of active shooters has increased, the number of members has also developed positively.
After the "Leininger" club room no longer met the demands of a modern shooter club, the then board of directors under the leadership of Johann Rinn decided to create a future home in the basements of the new "Landgasthof Härteis".
After 2700 hours of work, on 8 May 1988, Parish priest Strasser granted the church blessing for the new shelters.
One of the great highlights in the history of the club was the 44th Gaustie, associated with the solemn consecration of the new Shooterflag in July 1991.
On 23 and 24 April 1994, the Schützenverein celebrated its 30th anniversary.
In 1995 a boiler group was established.
Josef Schmalzl was referenced by Böller.
A major challenge for the "Böllers" and for the club as a whole was the arrangement of the Bavarian Böllertreff 2005.
In many hours of volunteer work, the members of the association modernized the rooms and the shooting facility at the Berngauer Hof last year and thus brought it to the latest state of the art.
11 teams in round competitions
You can also see the sports performance of the protection club.
In total, eleven teams currently participate in the round competitions: six air rifle teams, one air pistol team, one sports pistol KK1, one youth and two AH teams.
The 1st team with Lars Ellrich, Katharina Ellrich, Steffi Grad and Kerstin Kellermann went from the Gauoberliga (highest league in the Schützengau ANB) to the district league 1 in the 2013/14 round.
The 2nd team with Verena Moosburger Alexandra Meier, Eva Schuhmann and Tobias Graml has ascended from the Gauliga Nord to the Gauoberliga.
In addition to the shooting sport, events such as boxing, fasching and kingball, club excursions and Christmas celebrations have a tradition.
With them are the shooters also at the parties in the parish and community.
Tony Stewart suffered an accident when he returned to the track.
Tony Stewart's return to the track ended halfway with his race on the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart ran against the wall for the second time after placing his right front tyre in round 172 and ending his evening.
Stewart drove his damaged car into the garage and left it without talking to journalists.
His team boss Chad Johnston said his 14-member team was disappointed but is now focusing on the race next weekend in Richmond, Virginia.
"I wish we had had a better bet and a better result for him," Johnston said.
We go to Richmond and hope we can do better there.
Stewart ran into a wall earlier in the race on Sunday evening after a collision with Kyle Busch and had to have the right side of his car repaired.
“I went in today with pretty good hopes for a good result,” Johnston said, adding, “it just didn’t work.”
Not long after the second accident, Stewart’s car was loaded into the trailer and the team had packed and was ready to depart.
Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races after his car hit and killed another driver in a ashroad race in the north of New York State.
He decided to return this week and win either in Atlanta or at the next race in Richmond to win a place in the pursuit.
He returned to his workplace during an investigation into the tragic incident that led to the death of 20-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. who had stepped onto the track during a race to confront Stewart.
Authorities said on Friday that investigations into the cause of the accident will continue for at least two weeks.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart should expect an indictment.
The three-time champion was welcomed with great applause when he was presented before the race.
After a start from 12th position, Stewart had advanced into the top 10 shortly thereafter and was temporarily in fourth place.
After a reboot in Round 122, Buschs fell.
Car with No. 18 out of control after leaving Curve 2 and collided with Stewart, with both cars driving against the wall.
Stewart continued, but fell back to 21st place.
Looking for young dancers
Simply try it: Laura, Lena, Lisa, Marie, Bettina, Emma and director Lisa Neitzel (from the left) are looking forward to companions.
Like many other clubs, the jazz groups in TV Jahn also provide full-time lessons in the secondary schools.
After the summer holidays, some groups have decimated sharply.
Now more and more young people are being sought for a sport that is healthy and great fun.
In the two jazz and modern dance groups of Lisa Neitzel, former dancer in the jazz and modern dance formation "Spirits", there are only nine children left.
“Three in the group of eight to twelve-year-olds, six in the group of twelve to fifteen-year-olds,” says the 20-year-old.
With more active, the whole would be much more fun, "you could dance completely different choreographies," she says.
Those who are interested in dancing can join the training session between 17 and 18 a.m. on Thursday or between 17 and 18:30 a.m. on Friday in the dance sports room at the former Hotel Meyer, Freistraße 9.
"The training starts regularly with a warm-up program," says the coach.
There are various choreographies.
JazzDance has the characteristic that there is no fixed shape and is therefore open to many styles.
Elements from folklore to classics to sport and acrobatics are processed in jazz dance.
Of course, sociality is not too short.
"We also go out to eat, watch dance movies and we have also spent the night in the dance room," says Lisa Neitzel.
In the group, you can make friends, share a beautiful hobby and do a lot for your own motor development.
For those who do not want to dance jazz, they can also get into one of the other offers of Jahn TV.
Children and adolescents can always enter the classroom on Wednesday in the areas of children’s dance/jazz dance, bambini ballet, videoclip dancing and hip hop.
His coach is Francisco Afonso.
Adult couples are welcome to the dance evenings on Monday and Wednesday.
Those who like Discofox, Slow Walzer, Viennese Walzer, Rumba, Cha-Cha-Cha and Tango can go by and participate.
Bulgarian prison guards protest across the country
Hundreds of prison workers from all over Bulgaria have organized a nationwide protest in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
In the peaceful demonstration, they repeated their demands for the restoration of their old working conditions, which have recently changed.
Higher wages are also on a list of demands to be discussed with Interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
Officials have been symbolically protesting against the new working hours for a month and calling for a return to the previous 24-hour strata.
Despite the meetings between the union of prison workers and representatives of the Ministry of Justice, no agreement was reached, the National Bulgarian Ratio (BNR).
The negotiations are ongoing, said Rosen Zhelyazkov, the Director-General for the Implementation of Criminal Measures.
The protest of prison workers is expected to be supported by members of the trade union Association of employees of the Ministry of the Interior.
Ukrainian Army abandoned Luhansk airport
In eastern Ukraine, pro-Russian fighters continue to advance.
After heavy fighting, allegedly involving Russian tank battalions, the Ukrainian army abandoned the rebel airport of Luhansk on Monday.
The military said seven soldiers had been killed in the past 24 hours.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko had previously drawn personal consequences from the severe defeats of his army in the fight against the separatists and announced changes in the top army leadership, without giving details.
Prorussian separatists shoot down plane
In the fight against Ukrainian government troops, pro-Russian separatists have, according to their own representation, again shot down a combat aircraft and two military helicopters.
Around 100 soldiers have also been wounded or killed in fighting in the Donetsk region, the rebels said on Monday, according to Russian agencies.
Ships of the Coast Guard Sink
The rebels also claimed to have sunk two Ukrainian Coast Guard boats in the Sea of Azov for the first time.
The Ukrainian border guard confirmed that two of its ships were shot down near the port city of Mariupol on Sunday.
Seven border guards were injured, a spokesman in Kiev told 112.ua.
Two crew members were found missing.
Local media blamed Russia for the incident.
The separatists also that they had taken control of several villages in the Donetsk region.
Diplomatic Offensive in Minsk
The contact group for Ukraine is meeting in Minsk, Belarus.
In addition to representatives of Ukraine, Russia and the OSCE, an envoy of the separatists from eastern Ukraine should also participate.
In advance, all actors used their appearances to publicly announce their demands.
NATO will not break agreements with Russia
NATO will not break its agreement with Russia with the planned deployments in Eastern Europe as a result of the Ukraine crisis.
NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said Monday in Brussels that NATO adheres to the 1997 NATO-Russia Council founding agreement.
The NATO chief, however, accused Russia of “a sharp breach” of the agreement.
“Today we have to face the reality that Russia does not regard NATO as a partner,” Rasmussen said.
According to documents and statements from the Russian side, “they see us as enemies.”
Stronger NATO presence
Rasmussen also announced his intention to strengthen NATO’s presence in Eastern Europe.
A readiness action plan to be adopted at the NATO summit in Wales will ensure that "we will have more visible NATO presence in the east as long as it is necessary," Rasmussen said on Monday in Brussels.
Kiev and Moscow agree on new gas talks
Russia and Ukraine have agreed to continue talks to resolve their gas dispute.
The talks are scheduled for next Saturday, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Nowak said on Monday.
It is still pending a decision by the European Union whether it will also send a representative to the talks.
Because of the dispute over the price of gas, Ukraine has not been getting fuel from Russia for weeks.
EU Energy Commissioner Günther Oettinger has spoken to both sides.
Ukraine has warned that Russia could also disrupt gas supplies to Europe.
Europe receives about a third of its natural gas from Russian sources, a large part of which flows through Ukraine.
Merkel: Maut will come “very clearly”
The Chancellor has made this clear again.
However, it is not a free letter for all the complicated details.
Persistent concerns from the CDU against the car toll have shocked the CSU.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel has spoken a power word for the introduction of a car toll after ongoing resistance from her CDU.
"To be very clear, she is in the coalition agreement, and she will come," the party leader said on Monday after meetings of the CDU top bodies in Berlin.
However, a detailed model has not been decided by Merkel so far.
In the black and red government program, certain parameters are mentioned.
Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) has made a proposal, and it is now being worked on.
The NRW-CDU, however, insists on its no to a fee equal on all roads.
Merkel stressed that Finance Minister Wolfgang Schäuble (CDU) will also participate constructively in the discussions for a bill.
In addition to the topic, he also talked with Dobrindt about other ways to activate more private capital for infrastructure investments, including broadband expansion.
Schäuble had left a "Spiegel" report uncommented on Sunday, his house is considering its own concept to compensate motorway investors with cash revenue - after the 2017 election.
CSU chief Horst Seehofer then warned against developing toll concepts against the leading minister in the cabinet.
CDU Deputy Armin Laschet reiterated his objections.
“The coalition agreement never assumed that all district and federal streets would be contaminated,” said the CDU country chairman of North Rhine-Westphalia.
In this regard, it is an important signal that Seehofer has now announced that he will talk about the subject again.
Opposition to the plans also comes from the CDU-Landesverbände Baden-Württemberg and Rheinland-Pfalz.
There are concerns that a toll would affect small-scale border traffic with neighboring countries.
Seehofer had demanded coalition loyalty from the CDU because of the toll criticism.
The left sees the plans as failed in the face of the dispute in the Union.
"The Murks-Maut is dead," said party leader Bernd Riexinger to the "Neuen Osnabrücker Zeitung" (Monday).
Dobrindt wants to introduce a vignette obligation on all German streets, which is set to start in 2016.
Domestic car owners are not subject to additional charges under the coalition agreement.
Therefore, you should get a full compensation for the toll through the car tax.
However, according to EU law, the model may not disadvantage foreign drivers because of their nationality.
Genetic disorder often misdiagnosed
A British woman says she thought she would die as a result of a misdiagnosis over many years.
Karin Rodgers lived almost her entire youth in the belief that she had only a few years to live after being diagnosed with another disease.
She actually suffered from Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) – a group of inherited disorders that damage the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord.
Charity CMT UK that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because so little is known about this disease.
About 23,000 people in the UK are believed to suffer from CMT, which can lead to motor disorders such as muscle weakness, insecure walking, and curved toes.
Sick people also suffer from dizziness or pain.The disease is incurable and progressive, which means that the symptoms get worse with time.
When Rodgers was 13, she believed she was suffering from Friedreich ataxia (FA), a disease with very poor chances of survival.
Rodgers thought she would sit in a wheelchair before she was 18, and die before her 30th birthday.
The mother of two children, who is now 51 years old, said: "As a child, I knew I couldn't do the same as the others.
I was constantly falling down and everything lasted longer with me.
I was never able to ride a scooter or skateboard with the other kids and was often hassled at school because of my way of walking and running.
Rodgers said that at the age of 13, after several surgeries to relieve her Achilles seeds and stretch her feet, she saw her medical records when her doctor left the room and read that she suffered from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was curious, so I didn’t tell anyone about it, but I went home, looked for the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Society,” she said.
When I got the answer, I was shocked and panicked terribly.
I thought I would be in a wheelchair at 18 and die at 25, and in the meantime I would slowly lose all my abilities.
I did it all by myself and planned my own funeral.
She said when she was 17, she realized that her abilities had not declined as much as she had imagined, and asked her doctor.
He just stood up, hugged me and said, “My love, I don’t think you have that, otherwise you’d be in a wheelchair now.”
I think you have something much less life-threatening.
After some genetic tests, CMT was found in her.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I felt like I was a winner,” she said.
Charity CMT UK has launched a CMT Awareness Month to raise awareness about this disease.
Staff Field Webel a.D. Berni Diether has been working as a firefighter since the closure of the former troop training site
For almost ten years, no more guns have been fired at the former troop exercise site in Münsingen.
Nevertheless, deadly ammunition still appears every month in the heart of the biosphere area of Schwäbische Alb.
The grenades are sometimes so dangerous that they have to be blown up on the spot.
An anesthetic blow is heard during the explosions over the heart of the biosphere area.
In December 2004, the last sharp shooting fell at the Münsingen troop exercise site, which was closed at the end of 2005 after 110 years of military operation.
Since then, the area of 6500 hectares has become the core of the Schwäbische Alb biosphere area, which is open to hikers and cyclists on 13 designated paths.
Tax burden on businessmen in the Washington area increases with economic recovery
A recovery in the economy means more customers, more sales and new jobs.
It also means higher taxes.
State and local tax deductions for companies in the country rose slightly last year as economic recovery accelerated, according to a new study published last week, and the firms in the Washington area were no exception.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia area jointly paid $27.6 billion to state and local authorities in the 2013 fiscal year, an increase of 3.8 percent from 2012 revenue of $26.6 billion.
The state and local corporate tax burden increased by 4.3 percent last year to $671 billion, up from 3.9 percent a year earlier, and it was the third consecutive year of growth after several years of declining modesty in 2009 and 2010.
Government taxes grew stronger than local taxes, by 4.3 percent, according to the study conducted by service agency Ernst & Young with the Center for State Taxation, a tax policy group.
More than half of the District’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from corporate taxes, while 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from companies.
Virginia receives the lowest corporate tax revenue with 28 percent.
Much of the increase in tax revenue is due to a recovery in corporate property values, the researchers say, leading to a 3.7 percent increase in property taxes this year after three consecutive years with growth rates of less than 1 percent.
While much of these profits came from large states such as California, New York and Texas, the expiration also seems to apply to the area of Washington.
Companies in the District, Maryland, and Virginia jointly paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, compared to $9.6 billion in 2012, an increase of 4.2 percent over the course of a year.
But the apparent recovery in property values is not as effective in increasing state and local tax revenue in Maryland, where property taxes account for just over one-fifth of corporate tax revenue.
Companies in Virginia and D.C. pay half of their state and local taxes in the form of property taxes.
“The following is happening in Maryland: Much of the property, especially in the tax zone around D.C., is either owned by the government or by non-profit organizations that don’t pay property taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
Maryland is therefore forced to rely much more on income taxes, for example, in order to offer the same services that other states offer.
The recent recovery in corporate tax revenues cannot be attributed to the recovery of the real estate market alone.
Corporate revenues also appear to recover, according to the data.
Companies in the region $2.3 billion in income taxes on governmental organizations, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest amount in the region.
While the trend is moving in the same direction, the local tax burden for companies is not increasing evenly in all three locations.
The rate of increase in the district was 4.3 percent of the national average, while the increase in Maryland was significantly higher, 4.9 percent.
Virginia alone an under-average tax revenue of 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the significantly lowest corporate income tax rates with 6 percent in all three departments (there are fixed corporate tax rates in all three).
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25 percent and in the District is relatively high at 9.975 percent.
A comparable study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce earlier this year showed that Virginia is demanding lower state and local corporate taxes and has a better tax climate overall than Maryland.
The study did not investigate the district.
Despite the benefits, Virginia is under pressure from its southern neighbors.
North Carolina has passed laws to lower its corporate tax rates this year from 6.9 percent to 6 percent, the same rate as Virginia, and the rate will drop to 5 percent next year.
If the state continues to reach its income targets next year, this law could reduce the state’s corporate income tax rate to up to 3 percent by 2017.
Meanwhile, small in the Washington area seem to be doing better, and therefore pay more state and local taxes, according to the latest study.
Corporate taxes paid as personal income taxes by small business people – a transitional structure by which most small are organized – rose by 20 percent to $2.4 billion last year in the District, Maryland and Virginia, a significantly faster growth rate than corporate taxes combined.
The researchers say the trend and rise in corporate taxes across the country is expected to continue this year, with overall VAT revenues for the state and local governments increasing by 6.2 percent in the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period of the previous year.
Nevertheless, the area could fall behind Washington if the federal government’s spending cuts impact the region’s labour market.
German beer for Guangzhou
Hop and malts - also a popular combination in China.
German beer enjoys an excellent reputation in China.
Frankfurt’s partner city in China now wants a brewery and also hopes for a direct flight connection between the two cities.
German beer, brewed in Frankfurt’s partner city of Guangzhou – this is the urge of officials in China.
"We would be very pleased if a German brewery settled in our city," Li Yiwei, the deputy party secretary of the South China metropolis, said this week during a visit to a SPD delegation in his city.
In the course of the conversation, the official of the ruling Communist Party of China has repeatedly recalled this question of the twelve-million metropolis.
Guangzhou, also known as the Canton in Germany, is one of the richest cities in China.
Therefore, the people also possessed the purchasing power to afford German beer.
The Hessic SPD chairman Thorsten Schäfer-Gümbel, who headed the German political delegation, admitted to the host that he would search in Germany for a possible partner for the project.
"It doesn't take much for beer: good water, grains and joy of life," he added at lunch with the party leader in Guangzhou.
This joy of life already radiated from Mr. Li, he pleased the host.
Then the official from Guangzhou stumbled on shepherd-gummels – but with red wine served to the meal.
The Chinese brand Tsingtao goes back to German brewing art.
Tsingtao beer is brewed according to the German law of purity.
More business traffic
A second wish of the Chinese hosts would be a direct flight between Frankfurt and Guangzhou, said deputy party leader Li.
Lufthansa had offered the flight earlier, but canceled it in 2012 for economic reasons.
“It would be worth it again,” the local politician proved convinced.
“The trade between our two cities continues to grow.”
Currently, travellers would have to take the circumference over Changsha in Hunan province, Li complained.
The administration of the province of Guangdong, whose capital is Guangzhou, also hopes for the air connection.
The province’s deputy governor, Chen Yunxian, highlighted this wish in his conversation with the Social Democrats.
"That's a very good idea," Schafer-Gümbel replied - Chinese Deputy Minister Li Jinjun, an intimate acquaintance with Germany, nicked in agreement.
Maintained partnership
The former deputy party leader of Guangzhou hopes to visit Frankfurt next year for a partnership meeting.
Li Yiwei was already in the main, but not yet in this role.
He entered office this year after his predecessor had been promoted from office on corruption charges.
Local party leader Wan Qinglian was also forced to leave.
The action against Guangzhou officials is part of a nationwide campaign against corruption in the party and administration, which is being harshly enforced by President Xi Jinping.
The new top politician Li Yiwei had worked for an American company before his party career, which is highly unusual in the Chinese Communist Party.
Before taking office in Guangzhou, he worked as a senior official in Fujian, where the automaker VW is building a large factory.
Frankfurt has officially entered into more than a dozen city partnerships.
The connection to Guangzhou, 9,000 kilometers away, is among thoseined by both sides, for example with a student exchange.
Last year we celebrated the 25th anniversary of the German-Chinese union.
The southern Chinese metropolis on the Pearl River is almost as strong with its economic power as all Hessen.
Next year, it aims to reach a gross domestic product of 250 billion euros, Li said.
Joan Rivers’ family “presses their thumbs”
Joan Rivers has been unconscious since being delivered to a New York City hospital three days ago, but her daughter today showed hope that the 81-year-old comedian will recover from her illness.
"Thank you for your ongoing love and support," Melissa Rivers said in a statement today.
We press all the fingers.
Her mother was admitted to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after an emergency for cardiac arrest at a clinic at the Upper East Side, Yorkville Endoscopy.
Doctors deliberately keep them sedated and under close observation until they are more satisfied with their condition, which continues to be described as “serious.”
The reactions came from many sides, including in the form of overwhelming online support from Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Environmentally friendly vacuum cleaners and rising wages
In the future, cars and vacuum cleaners will be subject to stricter environmental standards.
Similar to refrigerators and washing machines, new vacuum cleaners will receive a label from 1 September, on which the buyer can identify central data such as the energy efficiency of the device at a glance.
For new cars in the pollution class "Euro 6" stricter nitrogen oxide values apply.
In addition, there is more money for the armoured builders: they receive a nationwide uniform minimum wage of 10.25 euros.
Amazon to Acquire Twitch for $1.04 Billion
Amazon just confirmed what information on Monday morning: The online retailer - and video producer, and a host of other things - is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.04 billion ($970 million).
The announcement comes surprisingly, not because nobody expected a takeover of Twitch, but because it was widely suspected that YouTube would acquire the company.
Three months ago, it looked like the sale of Twitch to Google’s video service for a cool billion decided thing, and the collaboration also seemed natural.
Twitch, which was founded only three years ago as Justin.tv, was launched as a general streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for players who wanted to publish their bravour pieces in games, a “YouTube for live games,” according to an insider.
The Twitch interface.
And "let's play," a video genre in which the best-knowers give the (mostly older) games a patch of secret science theatre, are already very popular on YouTube.
It’s just that YouTube is often referred to when you want to describe Twitch, so the news that YouTube wanted to buy Twitch was taken up somewhat boring, a textbook example of an established technology company buying a potential competitor.
It’s a mystery why the deal with YouTube didn’t come about, as the company wasly willing to pay as much as Amazon.
Twitch President Emmet Shear said: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our community, they share our values and long-term visions, and they want to help us get there faster.”
Another secret is, frankly, the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say they’d rather do sports than watch it, it’s hard to grasp the attraction of watching others play instead of taking the control console into their own hands.
It’s one thing to look over the shoulder of a friend at 3 a.m. as she slides through Resident Evil, and something entirely different to watch a spinner be shot in the head 20 times in a row in Call of Duty.
You can watch all these games right now.
Another problem is that many of the most popular games today are ego games, so watching without your own control over the point of view can be a really good recipe for headaches.
I admit that the fast passes in which the Roger Bannisters of our electronics age run entire games in record time are entertaining.
But as long as there is no game or humorous virtuose in it, his Twitch channel is probably not so interesting.
What do skeptics like me know about it?
Twitch has 55 million different visitors per month and is the fourth largest source of peak internet traffic.
How exactly does Amazon make money from it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch being so elegantly integrated into Amazon Instant Video as YouTube could have simply swallowed Twitch.
But Twitch has something every company would like: thousands of young men being advertised as advertisers.
As the chairman of Twitch, Shear, said, Amazon and Twitch “both believe in the future of gaming,” and the medium shows no signs of shrinking, not even – swallow – as a spectator sport.
At the Hippburg at the Burggartenfest on Saturday night, a lot happened.
The proposal of the organizers was agreed.
Despite the heavy rain on Saturday night, an estimated 1,200 music fans attended the open-air festival in Burggarten.
The entry had to be temporarily stopped.
“It was annoying,” said Ron Sem, one of the organizers.
Lights and fun.
From two Spanish words, Maxim Sachraj and Ron Sem formed the name Amula.
Because the open air in Salzwedeler Burggarten is meant to radiate brightness during the day and evening through various shows.
The fun comes by itself anyway.
This was evident early on Saturday, when the first visitors opened up to the open air.
A celebration for all generations was promised by the organizers.
And they succeeded.
Around the supply stations on the Burggartenwiese, Salzwedeler, as well as guests from the nearer and further surroundings, had been welcomed.
They watched the first live appearances, wiped with the foot in the rhythm, cool drinks - in short: relaxation and pleasure were trendy.
And that through generations.
While some cuddled on the ceilings on the extra attached white sand at the beach bar, others cuddled on a quarter of wine in the vinothek, the offspring tumbled on the hipp castle, which was a great attraction for the smaller guests.
But even with children’s makeup, the volunteers, in the true sense of the word, had all the hands to do to become the master of the rush and enchant imaginative creations in the little faces.
The older ones used the kickert tables or participated in a skateboard workshop arranged by the Goodfoot crew made of salted wheat.
Until the great rain came.
Shortly before 5:30 p.m. he struck down on the visitors, especially families looking for the wide and dry.
However, the attractiveness of the party was not interrupted.
"There were more people coming than expected," said Ron Sem, who spoke of a "success on the whole line."
Therefore, there is no obstacle to a repeat of the big party next year.
Although there is still work to be done on the content and size of the event, Sem made clear in a first balance sheet on Sunday against the popular vote.
As annoying, he stated that the entry had to be stopped in the meantime.
Obviously, the security company was booked with too little force.
The result: Some who had already paid did not come to the ground.
The resonance was very good.
In a first cautious estimate, the Salzwedeler co-organizer spoke of about 1,200 visitors who tumbled in the Burggarten.
There were problems with the engineering.
The Salzwedeler hip-hop band Blocks'n'Rox stopped their performance.
The technicians were unable to produce a semi-reasonable sound.
The planned Shisha lounges could not be built because the tents could not be transported to Salzwedel due to a tire failure.
“They will be there next year,” the organizer said.
The premiere of the Amula Open Air was more than successful by the number of visitors.
And that in bad weather.
However, the organizers have made some mistakes that will still be forgiven on the first time, but must be eliminated on the second edition.
Even on the social network Facebook, the organizers have to get criticism.
"Sorry, but for twelve euros you simply expected more," said Melanie Meier on the event page.
“You have, unfortunately, taken a little over,” says Ele Zimmermann in the same place.
Others do not see the initial problems so tightly.
I find it very good that some people are not only foolish, but also really trying to put something on their feet.
Hats off!” wrote Stephanie Jenß to Amula.
The organizers now have one year to resolve these issues.
New Radom in Berkum: Wachtberg's landmark shrinks
As expected, this is not so.
Rather, the ready-made component is waiting to be used in the remarkable construction.
The action is in the context of a larger measure: Nearly 50 years after the establishment of the TIRA space observation radar, the shell, called Radom, is being completely renewed.
The new Radom will be slightly smaller than the old one, with a diameter of 47.5 meters.
However, the size remains a world record.
The last step to completing the new envelope is the cap replacement
The upper quarter of the old shell is cut off and removed with a crane.
Then the last quarter of the new shell is set up.
If the weather is favorable, the event will take place at the beginning of this week.
Participant in the Ice Bucket Challenge
Isabelle Roberts from the UK cried so much when ice-cold water was poured over her head that she injured the bone structure of her face.
This Ice Bucket Challenge went painfully by.
A woman was admitted to the hospital after screaming so much at the Ice Bucket Challenge that she cut off her jaw.
Isabelle Roberts from the UK cried so much when ice-cold water was poured over her head that she damaged the structure of her face.
"The water was so cold that I cried, and while I did, my jaw just stood still," she told The Mirror.
Ice water is poured over the 20-year-old.
Isabelle Roberts just a few seconds before the accident
I wanted to close my mouth, but that didn’t go, the jaw was hooked, and then I understood that something was wrong.
My mother and my sister also saw this and laughed almost into the pants, but I had to go to the emergency room.
The 20-year-old from the UK was admitted to the hospital to get her jaw reintroduced after participating in the viral trend on Tuesday.
The clip has become an internet sensation and linked thousands of times on Facebook and Twitter.
Will the castles soon be on a row again?
Last time there was a constant dispute between the two Wolfratshauser Burgvereinen.
The board is now considering possible cooperation.
As a model for the reconstruction of the Wolfratshaus Castle, the late Richard Dimbath, former chairman of the Wolfratshaus Castle Friends, led the project in Guédelon, France.
A year ago, there was no good climate between the Burgverein and the Burgfreunden Wolfratshausen.
To date, the views on how to deal with the history of the Wolfratshaus castle and a possible reconstruction seemed very different.
Now the two camps are moving towards each other: talks are expected to be conducted soon about a joint approach.
This is confirmed by the board of directors Torsten Sjöberg (Burgverein) and Herbert Piffl (Burgfreunde) at the request of our newspaper.
“I called Mr. Piffl and suggested that we could sit together,” Sjöberg reports.
According to him, all members of both clubs could be drawn together again in the future.
So you can see more visible successes faster.
While the castle friends around the suddenly deceased Richard Dimbath had until the last time in mind a reconstruction of the castle on the mountain forest, for the castle association around Sjöberg the "development and feasibility" of the terrain is at the forefront.
Herbert Piffl, the second chairman of the Burgfreunde, was very pleased with the call.
Since Dimbath’s death, he has stood before the castle friends.
A new president is expected to be found at a member assembly in mid-September.
According to the 74-year-old, the association currently has around 40 members.
"After the death of my friend Richard Dimbath, we first let the club activities rest out of respect."This "thinking phase" was necessary to "think how it could go on."
According to Piffl, the new chairman will then go into the conversation with the Burgverein.
Until then, the castle friends could also make an actual mood within their group.
There is no candidate for the presidency at the moment, says Piffl.
"But I am confident that someone will find himself." he himself does not want to run because he has his residence in Bad Tölz.
The new president should be a Wolfratshauser.
Tölzer wants to work on the project "but is very happy to continue working on it."
The different views on reconstruction will probably remain in Piffl’s eyes in the near future.
He praises Dimbath as a "missionary" who always believed in the reconstruction of the castle.
Two similar projects already advanced in Austria and France would show that this idea is not an air lock.
Thanks to the high participation of the population and volunteers from all over the world, they are a tourist magnet.
Piffl: “I was skeptical in the beginning too.
But over time I have become more and more convinced that it makes sense to push the project forward.”
There is nothing else here.
In addition, the project could be financed through EU grants, visitor tickets and potential sponsors, Piffl believes.
"I personally do not want to simply throw the idea of reconstruction overboard." he hopes that the Burgverein may move a little at this point.
Their goal of documenting history first is “important and good.”
Then you can see further.
Smart ways to save on university textbooks
Since the cost of university textbooks for many students is more than $1,000 a year, fast-second semester student Matt Schroeder thought of a clever savings idea.
He invented a loan system for books from higher semester students and offered a nominal compensation to delay resale.
“My math book usually costs $180 but I got it for $10 for a semester and a chick-fil-a-cook,” said Schroeder, 19, who attended the Covenant College in Georgia.
The books needed for the last semester would have cost him $430.
He gave 120 dollars.
The college board shared that students spend on average more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and study materials, but that there would be various cost reduction options for students.
Online stores and creative approaches such as the Schroeders are increasingly the solution of choice for students.
Renting textbooks is becoming more popular, and so students can use a book for a semester, often at a much cheaper price than when purchasing.
Neebo Inc., which operates more than 250 university bookstores, that textbook rental has doubled since 2011.
Industry surveys show that about a quarter of the books in college bookstores were rented in the past spring semester, Neebo’s vice president Tevor Meyer said.
Less than half of all textbooks are purchased in campus bookstores, according to the National Association of College Stores.
Here is the one-time for the best deals.
Buying online
Some new books cost online only one-third of the price for which they are in the campus bookstore.
The ninth edition of "Calculus" by Ron Larwon, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler costs almost $290, but can be purchased from the specialized textbook retailer Chegg.com for $239.99.
Buying needed
If you don’t care about other notes or normal usage tracks, used books are a good option.
"Calculus" is needed to have on Chegg.com for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a graduate student at Brigham Young University, says he spent 42 cents on Amazon.com for a used edition of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding the Business End of the Advertising Business.”
The book was sold for $48.
Academics such as Ingrid Bracey, director of the University of Massachusetts at Amherst College Without Walls, advised students to ask their professors whether past spending is permissible.
Sometimes updates for the workshops are not relevant.
In such cases, older expenses can often be purchased for a fraction of the cost of the latest issue.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, Half.com of eBay Inc is also a popular alternative to used books.
rented
Renting textbooks is worth considering if you treat them quite well, remember to return them, and you don’t want to keep the books after completing the course.
You can save more than 80% of the cost of a newly purchased book.
For example, a student could rent "Calculus" for about $20 for the duration of a semester.
Learn about the terms and conditions of the store you are renting from, including the penalties that may be charged for writing notes, underscorings or usage traces.
If you do not return the book, the penalty fees may even exceed the price of a new book.
E-Books
E-books instead of traditional textbooks are also an option.
Sometimes these books are rented de facto by providing an electronic license for a certain period of time from wholesalers such as Amazon.com, Chegg, and Barnes & Noble Inc.
At Chegg you can rent "Calculus" for 6 months for about $61.
Bracey says students in literature courses often find the best deals, as many classics can be downloaded for free these days, while science and engineering textbooks can be very expensive.
Look around anyway.
Joe Gault, 29, who is soon to attend Pepperdine Law School, recommends the ISBN number for pricing books, as you can be sure to find the right textbook.
And before ordering online one should check, according to Gault, whether the book is actually in stock.
This lesson he learned on the hard track.
He bought a book that had four weeks of delivery time and eventually paid the full price in the college bookstore.
Why "Guardians of the Galaxy" Wasn't a Boxer
"The Expendables 3" by Sylvester Stallone earned less than $30 million of his $90 million budget in the U.S., while "Sin City: A Dame to Kill For" earned only $12 million of his $70 million budget.
The Cameron Diaz-adjusted film, Sex Tape, made just $14.6 million in earnings on the opening weekend, while children’s films like “Dragon’s Cams Made Lightly 2” also disappointed in revenue.
An article by Telegraph film critic Robbie Collin suggests that in children’s films, the lack of quality in the films itself may be the reason.
Collin described 2014 as the “worst year” ever for children’s films and described “Dragon’s Camel Made Easy 2” as a purely “functional” fantasy sequel.
With films for a slightly older audience, however, it seems like the quality of the films isn’t necessarily the problem.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the average CinemaScore and Metacritic rating for each summer movie launched on at least 2,000 screens between American Memorial Day and July 20, 2013 and the current year.
The results are based on the opinions of movie viewers and film critics and suggest that this year’s film hits are equivalent to last year’s ones.
Some commentators believe that the development is due to changing viewing habits and the growing popularity of web streaming services like Netflix.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney's upcoming Jungle Book movie, told the website Hollywood Reporter: "I think times are changing."
We must accept this and not try to follow the past.
Contrary to the currently weak cash results of Hollywood productions, Netflix recently made $1.2 billion in streaming content revenue, almost twice as much as last year, with revenue of $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the film studios for focusing too much on comics filmmaking and predicting a "core meltdown" of Hollywood.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators argue that his dark prophecy may quite possibly contain a true core.
However, due to the potential box office hits expected in summer 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, Minions and Jurassic World, other representatives of the film industry are more optimistic:
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the fall in cash earnings as simply “cyclical,” saying to Hollywood Reporter, “Next summer will be the biggest summer at the box office ever, and no one will worry about the business anymore.”
When a few years ago the 2nd table tennis district class was deleted in order to tighten the league division, it was a step in the right direction.
The German Table Tennis Federation has added a third Bundesliga to its programme.
The result is that whoever has not ascended has descended.
Thus, Göttingen's highest-class team Torpedo in the upper league relegation has avoided the descent, but will only play fifth-class in the upcoming season.
Fourth-class Torpedos ladies remain, despite their grandiose breakthrough in the regional league.
The boys and girls of Torpedo start in the Lower Saxony League, as do the boys of SC Weende.
The SG Lenglern and the Torpedo-Reserve will play in the new Bundesliga, and no Göttinger clubs will be represented in the Landesliga.
For the ladies, TTV Geismar plays in the Bundesliga, the torpedo second in the Landesliga.
What looks like a better district class from the composition is now the new district superliga south.
Here TSV Seulingen, VfB Lödingsen, Torpedo III, Geismar, Einbeck, Hammenstedt, Bovender SV, Langenholtensen, FC Weser and the TTC will play.
In the district league, Dransfeld and SC Weende play as regional representatives, in the district class TTC II, Red-White, Bovender SV II and the teams of TTV Geismar II and III.
Güntersen, TTC and TTV Geismar II are here from the game.
In the district league starts Torpedo III and Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen.
With nine teams
The SC Weende sends his girls to the district league.
Also the district league season of the SCW boys – where Torpedo II is still starting – is not complete.
In a district class, Geismar, Tuspo Weende and the Bovender SV go into the season.
In the first season of the newly formed regional association, the two Göttinger Kreisliga start with nine teams each.
In the West season are the Red-White II, Bovender SV III, Laubach II, Torpedo IV and V, MTV Grone, Dransfelder SC II, Mielenhausen and SG Lenglern II.
In the East-Staffel play among others Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen, Nikolausberg and Landolfshausen.
The Damen-Kreisliga consists of Sattenhausen/Wöllmarshausen II, Bilshausen, Hemeln, Seulingen II, Tuspo Weende and the SG Rhume.
This is still better than in the Osterode district, where there are no women’s teams at all at the district level.
Surprisingly, none of the six 2nd Circle classes reached the target strength, here the innovative and dynamic Circle Board will have to think about it.
NATO Summit: Protests in Newport and Cardiff
This weekend there were protests of opponents of the NATO summit in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds gathered in the center of Newport for an anti-NATO march.
On Sunday, about 150 people gathered in Cardiff in front of the town hall to hold a so-called counter summit.
Stephen Fairclough followed the developments over the weekend for us and spoke to protesters travelling from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers from the Blue Mountains
Two youth bus wanderers were taken to safety with the rope wind after being caught overnight in the Blue Mountains in NSW.
The 16-year-old girl and the 19-year-old man broke up for their tour shortly after Sunday afternoon in Govett's Leap in Blackheath.
Concerned relatives called the police at about 8 p.m. when the two had not returned home.
A search team of local police and rescue services broke out and the couple was found around 23am near the Bridal Veil waterfalls.
The girl had injured herself in the knee and the man had fallen and had his head opened.
Rescuers stayed with the couple overnight and they were flown out on Monday morning.
They were taken to the Blue Mountains Hospital with an ambulance.
Anti-government protests escalate in Pakistan
Some 1,000 protesters were pushed out of the PTV building by soldiers, information minister Pervaiz Rashid said.
The broadcaster restarted the broadcast after about half an hour.
PTV director Athar Farooq said the demonstrators equipped with sticks had damaged devices in the editorial office.
Dead or injured were not.
The protesters are demanding the resignation of the prime minister, who they accuse of electoral fraud.
Police said about a kilometer from the residence of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif there were clashes between some 3,000 protesters and security forces on Monday.
According to the hospital, a police officer was injured.
During the weekend, at least three people were killed and more than 500 wounded as demonstrators attempted to enter Sharif’s residence.
They demand the resignation of the Prime Minister.
The powerful military had called on Sunday after a meeting at the army headquarters for a political solution to the conflict, "without wasting time and without using force."
The statement said: “The army remains committed to its role in ensuring the security of the state.”
The escalating violence has raised concerns about an intervention by the military, which has already pushed more frequently in the past.
The protests led by opposition politician Imran Khan and preacher Tahirul Qadri have been ongoing since Independence Day on August 14.
Sharif refuses to resign.
Khan and Qadri called on their supporters on Sunday to persevere.
"We will not go back without forcing Sharif to resign," Khan said.
Qadri said the same.
Khan accuses Sharif of winning parliamentary elections in May last year.
Qadri called for the resignation of the central and provincial governments.
Then a transitional government should reform the electoral system and call for new elections.
More than 40,000 security forces are deployed to protect the government district.
The demonstrators had initially held up peacefully in front of parliament until Khan and Qadri urged them on the weekend to enter Sharif's residence.
Hütteldorfer after second season victory to third place in the table.
With the 2:0 over Grödig, a bitter week on Sunday took a conciliatory end for Rapid.
"The victory is very liberating," said coach Zoran Barisic, whose team had reached an intermediate low with the defeat in the Europa League on Thursday.
"The success experience was incredibly important," confirmed captain and goalkeeper Steffen Hofmann, who led the team to third place with green-white.
Schrammel-Draumtor brings Rapid on victory road Rapid has shown the right response to the disappointment against Helsinki with the second season victory and goes into the country play break with a successful experience.
"We wanted to show a positive response," said defence defender Thomas Schrammel, who with his magnificent leading volleyball from the sixteenth corner in the 14th minute put the shifts to victory.
“I thought I’d dig through all the frustration of Thursday and squeeze it under the latte,” said the 26-year-old smiling.
When Schrammel had met for the last time in a Bundesliga party on November 13, 2010, it was still for Ried.
The first championship hit in the Rapid Dress will therefore remain in his special memory.
"For me, this is something very special, I am from the Rapid descendant," Schrammel said.
Due to Mario Pavelic's short-term pelvic blessure, Schrammel moved from the left to the right defensive side and also did his thing very well there.
He has enough experience to exercise this position as a mirror.
He deserved the goal, he has already made some assists this year,” Barisic praised.
Team shows character Schrammel also delivered the flank to 2:0 by Hofmann after well over an hour, which eventually brought the decision.
Even the guests could have written.
"Thanks to God we have had some luck today," Schrammel said, referring to the match between performance and result in recent weeks: "The results did not match, but the game was always good compared to last year."
Barisic even felt that he had been “better in many games before than he is today” – against “the strongest team that has played in this stadium this season.”
The first three points since July 26 have therefore proved that the team structure is intact despite the rebounds: "Today my team has shown that it has character."
He said, “We are happy that we have finally played to zero again.
Also, the fact that Brian Behrendt, Mario Pavelic, Christopher Dibon, Deni Alar and Michael Schimpelsberger have several failures to regret, and Srdjan Grahovac, Stefan Stangl and Philipp Schobesberger have made their start-ups, makes the victory even more valuable.
"You must not forget that," Barisic warned, who lost in the last three days with Behrendt and Pavelic players, "who have been very stable lately."
The land break must therefore be used to "leak wounds and lay a little in the physical area," Barisic, who has five U21 selection players in his ranks, explained.
One who is interested in the break is Captain Hofmann.
He breaks for the team, goes over pain.
It is in this difficult period that he has shown that he is a very important player for us,” Barisic said.
Hofmann not only gave the game Rapids before his replacement in the 68th minute, but also scored the second goal.
For the 33-year-old, who finished his 350th Bundesliga game, it was the first out of the game since 2 November 2013 (4:2 over the Admira).
Hofmann: "We must not believe that now everything is fine" "We have also had a bit of luck, but someday happiness must also come back to us.
It was time,” Hofmann said.
He warned of course to concentrate on continuing work: “You can’t always see this black and white.
We haven’t played as badly in the last few weeks as it has been shown.
But we must not believe that now everything is well.
He could not deny the importance of his role for the team.
It’s a very young team that I can help a lot at the moment.
They stick to me at certain stages,” Hofmann said.
Grödig coach Michael Baur had little to blame on himself and his team.
He regretted the quick counter hit "from the category of magic doors", as well as the regular goal of utility in the 40th minute, which had been wrongly withdrawn by referee colleagues.
The only accusation I can make to the team is that we were not concrete enough towards the goal at some stages.
We had too few conclusions.
Inside defender Maximilian Karner saw it similarly: "It started badly, but then we found it clean and even made a goal.
Overall, there would have been more.
Under this summit there is calm.
We showed a powerful tribe during our puzzle of the summer series "My piece of Rhône happiness" last Friday.
Several of these trees still exist in the district, the specimen depicted is the "Geißruheiche" above Unterweißenbrunn.
A hollow walking path leads up to the roughly 600-year-old oak.
It passes by couples, basalt stone buildings and basalt stone seas.
A little below the rockfall from Bauersberg, a kilometer north of the road to Weisbach, there she stands.
Vital looks the natural monument, it stands beyond the other trees of the surrounding area, reminiscent of an American mammoth tree with a circumference of over eight meters.
A small Buddha on a tree trunk suggests that it is a spiritual or mystical place.
However, despite intensive research, there were only indications of the origin of the name.
Dr. Wolfgang Schneider has consulted the Bischofsheimer Archive and interviewed elderly people from Unterweißenbrunn to find out what relationship it has with the Geißruheiche.
The result of his investigations remained the rather sober explanation for the name.
Thus, until about 80 years ago, the goat shepherds are said to have driven their animals from Unterweißenbrunn to the hard-rooted and stone-free lawns.
At the foot of the tree, the exhausted animal keepers are said to have rested.
In the meantime, the area has regained its importance, because on the lawns goat flocks are actually grazing again.
The area has also been declared the core zone of the biosphere reserve, Schneider further found out.
However, you should be careful when entering the stone collections, because the sun-heated basalt is also a popular place for crucifixionists.
A hiking path leads from Unterweißenbrunn to the tree, which is somewhat hidden.
Further paths are outlined, climbing in the direction of Hochrhön and inviting to an extensive hike.
Where is the Waterburg?
However, a water castle that is sought at our next task is rarely found in the height.
The mirroring in the grave already gives a good impression of the building, but we have some historic buildings in the district to which the building contrast could fit.
Where is our “piece of Rhône happiness”?

After weeks of dive, Italy's prime minister and current EU chairman, Matteo Renzi, against strong conservative resistance at the EU special summit last week enforced the nomination of his foreign minister Federica Mogherini as head of EU foreign policy, she will succeed the British Catherine Ashton.
Renzi considers the appeal of his favourite Mogherini, also in the government team, as strengthening the position of the Social Democrats and his own in the EU.
He also expects a boost to his “reform package” in Italy.
Last but not least, Renzi hopes to calm down the leftist party base that is repeatedly opposed to him, because Mogherini is attributed to it, though in a more moderate way.
Against the conservative representatives with Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and the Polish nominated as Council President Donald Tusk, according to the prevailing opinion in Rome, a political balance will be established.
The EU’s chief diplomat will also be the deputy representative of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker.
The approval of the European Parliament is still pending.
Otherwise, President Giorgio Napolitano would hardly have called the nomination of the 41-year-old politician of the ruling Democratic Party (PD) an “important recognition” of Italy’s role in the EU.
La Repubblica spreads optimism that Mogherini, who has been in party leadership for two decades and is known for her ambition, will be able to face “enormous challenges.”
The Roman native is married and has two daughters.
Her party career began in 1996 in the youth organization of the then Democratici di Sinistra (Left Democrats), which merged in 2008 with the Catholic center party Margherita to form the present-day social democratic PD.
In 1999, Mogherini became vice president of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth for three years.
With the election in 2001 to the Party Council of the Left Democrats, she entered high party politics, worked in the Department of Foreign Policy, whose head she soon became.
It occupied traditional priorities of Italian foreign policy such as the Middle East, became known through studies on NATO’s deployment in Afghanistan, in which Italy is involved with a troop contingent,ined contacts with the Social Democrats in Europe and with the Democrats in the United States.
Since 2008, she has been a member of the House of Representatives, where she is an expert on defence and European and international affairs.
When Renzi became prime minister in February 2014, he appointed Mogherini as his foreign minister.
If the PD today again has a better relationship with the strong peace movement in the country, which contributed to the party’s more than 40 percent of votes in the EU elections in May, then, as noted in PD circles, Federica Mogherini has a share of it.
The talks in Brussels, the new EU foreign envoy has too little diplomatic experience, so it lacks substance, is counted in the PD.
In Brussels, especially by Poland and the Baltic member states, Mogherini’s suspiciously realistic accents on the crisis in Ukraine are pursued and defamed as a “Russia-friendly course.”
She supports the South Stream pipeline operated by the Russian company Gasprom, through which Russian natural gas, bypassing Ukraine, will be transported directly to southern Europe, which also serves the energy security of Italy.
After Renzi took office as EU president in July, Mogherini made her first state visit to Moscow.
The photos she showed with Putin while shaking hands were taken in Brussels with outrage, as well as inviting the Kremlin leader to a Milan economic summit in October.
A total of nine young people began their training at emz-Hanauer in Nabburg on Monday.
Among them is an Azubi who has already completed another training in the company.
In the future, the new employees will work in four training professions: electronics (three trainees), mechatronics (two), tool mechanics (two) and process mechanics (two).
All Azubis are from the district of Schwandorf: Tobias Braun and Thomas Bücherl from Schwarzach, Stefan Brickl and Florian Rewitzer from Schmidgaden, Johannes Beer from Neunburg vorm Wald, Felix Domaier from Oberviechtach, Daniel Sorgenfrei and Sebastian Zahner from Pfreimd as well as Ferdinand Strebl from Teunz.
The new trainees previously attended primary or secondary schools and real schools.
From Wednesday to Friday, trainees of all ages and trainers go to a team-building event in Oberammergau, where, among other things, a full-day hike and rafting on the Inn is on the programme.
The company has 435 employees in Germany and 950 worldwide.
The number of trainees spread over all years is 27.
The socialists in France should "keep their mouths and put France in order," said Francois Hollande's key ally.
Mr Valls called on the deeply divided left to show "their love" for the controversial socialist president, whose cabinet formation has met with disapproval among the vast majority of the French.
The President deserves everyone’s respect, he deserves our loyalty, he deserves our support.
“It’s our duty to stay on his side,” he said with great applause.
As a reassuring gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not challenge the controversial 35-hour week in France despite fierce demands for a relaxation of the arrangement on the part of Emmanuel Macron, the new economic minister.
On Saturday, Hollande urged his fellow socialists to show "unity" with the government.
But Christiane Taubira, the Justice Minister, sprinkled sand into the gear where she performed at a meeting of retreating Socialist MPs and criticized the Socialist Party for taking the French “faith in their future.”
Marine Le Pen, the far-right leader of the National Front, mocked the socialists’ constant battle and said she couldn’t imagine the new Valls government lasting longer than a few months.
Francois Hollande is the emperor without clothes, but Prince Manuel Valls also has none, they are forced to form a new government if the old has not even survived a summer.
"And the new one will also not survive the fall or winter," Ms. Le Pen told supporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for a dissolution of parliament, saying she was confident to emerge as a winner in early elections and was ready for government.
France’s ruling party suffered a defeat in the local elections in March and the right-wing National Front was ahead of the EU elections in May.
A survey in the Sunday newspaper Journal du Dimanche found that 76 percent of French people believe that the Socialist Party is at risk of breaking down into several rival factions before the end of Hollande’s 2017 term.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would quickly lose patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and record unemployment rates.
"There's a small window of possibilities, but public opinion needs to quickly feel that things are changing," he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Norwegian Cruise to sign $3 billion deal with Prestige Cruises
Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCHL.O, the world’s third-largest cruise car provider, is undergoing advanced negotiations to acquire competitor Prestige Cruises International Inc. for about $3 billion, according to industry experts.
A deal would give Norwegian Cruise, a company with a market value of $6.8 billion, access to the luxury cruise ships of Prestige Cruises and its wealthy customers, while competing with larger rivals such as Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N) and Carnival Corp (CCL.N).
An agreement could be announced this week, the sources said on Sunday, warning that the talks could end without results.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private equity company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N) also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruises.
The sources asked to remain anonymous as the negotiations are not public.
Representatives from Norwegian Cruise and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comments, while a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment.
The Miami-based company Norwegian Cruise operates 13 cruise ships on routes between North America, the Mediterranean, the Baltic, Central America and the Caribbean.
Its revenue was $2.57 billion in 2013, an increase of 13 percent compared to 2012.
Prestige Cruises, also based in Miami, operates under the brands Oceania and Regent, which jointly operate eight cruise ships on routes to Scandinavia, Russia, the Mediterranean, North America, Asia, Africa and South America.
It revenue for 2013 of $1.2 billion, an increase of 6 percent compared to the previous year.
The cruise industry is worth around $29 billion in total and is expected in the coming years due to the strengthening of the middle class in emerging markets such as China and India.
The companies are trying to position themselves as the best choice among the cruise providers for these new customers.
Prestige Cruises applied to the U.S. regulatory authorities in January 2014.
Apollo has been the majority shareholder in the company since a $850 million deal in 2007.
Norwegian Cruise was formed in its present form in 2000 by a merger with a cruise provider owned by Genting Bhd (GENT.KL), a recreation and casino mixing group controlled by Malaysian billionaire Lim Kok Thay.
In 2008, Apollo invested $1 billion in Norwegian Cruise.
Norwegian Cruise entered the stock exchange in January 2013.
Genting held 28 percent of the shares, Apollo 20 percent of the shares, and private equity company TPG Capital LP held 8 percent of the company, according to licensing authorities at the end of June.
Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruise jointly own more than 82% of the passenger capacity of American cruise ships, according to the original application documents for the listing of Prestige Cruises.
Pro-Hong Kong activists condemn China the day after the election decision.
A group loyal to Beijing waved the Chinese flag nearby.
The Permanent Committee of the National People's Congress passed a framework law on Sunday allowing only two or three candidates to run the 2017 Hong Kong elections.
All candidates must first gain the majority support of a nomination committee, which is expected to be filled with Beijing-faithful members.
This decision made it almost impossible for opposition Democrats to be elected and prompted pro-democracy activists to realize their threat and paralyze Hong Kong’s financial square with Occupy Central protests.
Political reforms have long been a controversial topic in Hong Kong; and China’s party leadership fears the calls for democracy will spread to other cities.
Following the publication of a Beijing White Paper outlining China’s dominance over Hong Kong in June, democracy activists held an unofficial referendum on the electoral process in the Special Administrative Region, where hundreds of thousands marched in the city’s business district and organized a sit-in.
Lis’s questioning is organized by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
The Deputy Chairman of the Legal Committee of the Standing Committee, Zhang Rongshun, and the Deputy Director of the Office of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs of the State Council, Feng Wei, were to be questioned during the day.
Student activists announced they would gather in front of the Hong Kong leader’s office in the afternoon.
Britain did not foresee any democratic elements until the final phase of the 150-year colonial rule in Hong Kong.
Putin asks Kiev to start "state talks" with eastern Ukraine
Russian President Vladimir Putin, according to Russian media reports, demanded on Sunday that the Ukrainian government cease fighting the separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on the "statehood" of the separatist region.
His spokesman Dmitry Peskov later made it clear that Putin did not mean that the separatist-controlled territory of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that his status in relation to Ukraine would need to be redefined in order to give the Russian-speaking region the power to represent its rights and interests.
However, Putin’s call to the Kiev government to negotiate on an equal footing with the pro-Russian insurgents fits with the strategy he seemed to have pursued since the onset of the riots five months ago: helping the separatists seize territories and pressuring the Ukrainian government to allow the newly proclaimed Novorossiya region actual independence for an alliance with Russia rather than with the West.
In an interview with state television channel Channel One, Putin condemned the Ukrainian military campaign to recapture separatist-held territories in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were seized in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have recently referred to the occupied territory as "Novorossija" or "New Russia", a term that recalls the pre-revolutionary glory of the Russian Empire.
Putin pointed out that all those who are "trapped in their illusions" in the course of the campaigns of Ukrainian politicians for the elections on October 26 and while government groups attack civilian communities in separatist-held areas, Itar-Tass.
"We need to immediately engage in detailed discussions, not only on technical issues, but also on the political organization of society and the state status of southeastern Ukraine, in order to safeguard the interests of the people living there," he said.
Peskov said Putin’s reference to statehood should be seen in the context of greater autonomy, which has been discussed by the Kiev leadership for months, to dispel fears in Russian-speaking areas that their cultural and linguistic rights are at risk.
Only the Ukrainian government can grant the eastern regions the necessary autonomy, Peskov said.
This is not about negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, "because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal conflict in Ukraine."
The Kremlin spokesman’s clarification of correcting the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks highlighted Russia’s leadership in dealing with the separatist rebellion in the east as opposed to the direct annexation of Crimea, where the majority of its 2 million inhabitants are ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have far greater difficulties annexing the Donetsk and Luhansk regions in eastern Ukraine, as most of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians and polls from the pre-conflict period showed a broad majority for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy addressed by Russian diplomats in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to negotiate their own trade agreements and foreign relations, thus giving the Kremlin de facto control over an area that connects the Russian state territory with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, annexed five months ago, is the home port for most of the Russian navy, as well as an important trading port and historic coastal region.
The regions between the Rostov region of Russia and Crimea are also rich in mines, factories and castings that manufacture important components for the Russian military.
In his inauguration speech on June 7, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko suggested that Ukrainian legislation should consider amendments to the constitution after new elections, giving the respective regions greater control over their finances and the status of languages.
But his idea of autonomy seems to be in sharp contrast to that of the Kremlin and the separatist rebels, whose arms and incitement Moscow is accused of.
Putin’s last appeal to Kiev to negotiate on an equal footing with the separatist leaders followed another rebel advance last week after Russian troops and tanks entered eastern Ukraine across the previously peaceful region along the Sea of Azov.
The Russian-backed separatists took control of Novosovsk in a handshake, which Ukrainian security officials fear is the first step in a campaign to take over the strategic coastal region up to Crimea.
For this reason, massive civilian and military preparations have begun to consolidate Mariupol, a steel industrial port with 500,000 inhabitants, located between Novosovsk and the narrow access to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
"We are close to a point where there is no way back," Poroshenko said.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now on the territory of Ukraine.
The EU summit decided no concrete actions, the leadership called for the draft of further sanctions against Russia, which should come into effect in the event of an unspecified escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Ukrainian soldiers had to withdraw from their positions in Ilowajsk after two Russian tank columns and 1,000 soldiers entered the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists, Colonel Andrij Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, said on Saturday in Kiev.
The first 63 supposedly Ukrainian soldiers captured by the Russian invasion of Ilowajsk were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian parachutists captured on Ukrainian territory a week ago, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Nude photos of Australian celebrity and Gabi Grecko
Geoffrey Edelsten did not hide his anger about hackers who allegedly stole nude pictures of his fiancé Gabi Grecko and a Who is Who of the Hollywood A-Promis.
The film city is thrilled after a series of unmistakable photos of a naked Jennifer Lawrence appeared on the Internet in a hacking scandal around celebrities.
The hacker is believed to have 60 nude photos of Lawrence, the star of "The Tribute of Panem" and of superstars, including models Kate Upton and Cara Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Lea Michelle, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
The Australian actresses Teresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski, and Grecko from Melbourne were also allegedly published private photos due to an iCloud gap.
There are 101 promises on the list.
Edelsten, who had been engaged to Grecko last month, told Confidential: “It’s disgusting.”
All private letters and pictures should remain private.
It is a shame that private information can be stolen and passed on to others.
Grecko, currently in New York,ly said on a news website that the hack was “shameful” and that the affected “feel hurt.”
The hacker allegedly has 30 pictures of Palmer with her ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two footage in which she lies on top of a pool.
Palmers' films include "Love Is Invincible" with Liam Hemsworth.
Palmer, Chuck-Star Strahovski and actress Browning from Sucker Punch were not available to comment on the hacked images.
A Lawrence's representative told TMZ: "It's a disgusting breach of privacy."
Actor Seth Rogen condemned the hacker in his tweet: "Posting hacked pictures from a phone is nothing but selling Hehlerware."
Legally speaking, the redistribution of stolen images should not be tolerated.
Cyclists, joggers and hikers took part in the 8th cycling event on the Großen Feldberg yesterday and thus supported the association "Help for Cancer-Sick Children".
The tour, which was a torture for some, was an easy training for others.
Everyone agreed on one thing: it was fun.
Thomas Studanski probably slept well last night.
For the first time in his life, the head of the Oberurseler Brewery took a bike to the Feldberg yesterday.
For the good purpose.
He can easily hide the small muscle pain, especially since the participation in the 8th cycling on the Großen Feldberg in favor of the association "Help for Cancer Children" (Frankfurt) has also personally brought him a valuable insight.
A great thing.
“Now I know I can do it – fine!”
A small slide in the applause?
No, if I had stopped once, it would have been out...
Like Thomas Studanski, who sits for the CDU in the Oberursel City Parliament, many of the 718 participants tortured themselves yesterday in the early dive to the mountains and came close to exhaustion, but happy on the plateau.
Others, on the other hand, found it easier to overcome the well eleven kilometers long route between Hohemark and Feldberg.
Norman Dießner for example.
The green politician from the circle day - red dress, red bike - made a little bit of understatement at the start ("A lot of professionals, there is the goal!"), but then proved to be half-professional on the mountain and went through the goal after 45 minutes without breathing.
He also went through the track in a slide, as did Nina Kuhn, a press spokeswoman for the city of Oberursel, who had joined the road with Frank Grüneisen.
For the two triathletes, the "Feldberg cycling" was not necessarily a sports challenge: "This is about charity, we are happy to participate - we would have made an exit today anyway," says Kuhn.
On the way, they had met Paul Wenzel from Oberreifenberg.
The young man (12) had gone down to Oberursel in the morning to strumble back to the height.
The Frankfurter Florian Zierz had swung in the seat at home at 9 o’clock in the morning, “made” the Feldberg twice, then rolled home with fun.
We also had fun with “Toni”.
For the head of the Oberurseler cult kiosk, cycling tours over the Feldberg simply belong to it.
He had raced for 40 minutes on his 6.5kg bike.
A crazy event.
For this purpose, I am happy to be there,” said Andreas Balzke.
The well-trained Mainzer says of himself that he is an “ambitious racing cyclist.”
He must be, because he was on the "fixie wheel", which are also racing bikes, but without circuit...
That it went up loosely without a wheel proved not only the 20 hikers who climbed the White Wall and the fox dance to the summit, but also a jogger who pulled a car tire with weights on a rope.
Bergwacht doctor Professor Volker Lischke, who with his team, equipped with all-wheel bully and quad, took care of safety, said: "I know" the man from Frankfurt, who trains for a special slide trail, only that he pulls the slide off himself."
The 718 participants – and therefore as many as never before – had been sent on the track in groups this morning.
Walkers first at 9:30.
The first cyclists and runners followed at 10 a.m.
Five minutes later, the first mountain bikers set off.
Bent Hansen, chairman of the association "Wheelers on the Große Feldberg", gave the start commands and wished the participants a nice trip.
For next year, he hopes that it will succeed in blocking the route up to Feldberg for the safety of the participants.
