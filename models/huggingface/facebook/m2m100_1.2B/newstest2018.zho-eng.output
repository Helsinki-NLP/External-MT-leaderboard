Civil rights groups issue travel warnings for Missouri
Due to Missouri’s discriminatory policies and racist attacks, the American Association for the Promotion of Colour People (NAACP) has issued travel warnings to colour people preparing to travel to Missouri.
“The NAACP Missouri Travel Consultation, which came into force on August 28, 2017, calls on all African-American travelers, tourists and Missouri residents to be especially careful and careful when traveling to Missouri due to a recent series of suspicious racial incidents in Missouri,” the group said in a statement.
The NAACP noted that a recently passed Missouri law made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits and that the state’s enforcement laws also targeted minorities to some extent, which prompted the organization to issue travel warnings.
Violations of civil rights are happening to people.
They were parked, beaten or killed because of their skin colour,” Rhode Chapel, the chairman of the NAACP in Missouri, told Kansas City Star.
“We have received many complaints, an unprecedented number.”
This is the first such warning issued by the organization against a state in the United States.
The group cited the ethnic abuse of black students at the University of Missouri and the deaths of the 28-year-old black man from Tennessee, Tolly Sanders.
Earlier this year, Sanders died in suspicious circumstances.He exhausted fuel while traveling to Missouri and was detained by Missouri police without any allegations of crime.
The consultation also noted that a recent report from the Missouri Attorney General’s Office found that “the state’s black drivers were 75 percent more likely to be checked by car control compared to whites.”
Chapel said: “This consultation is meant to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues about what could happen in Missouri.”
“People need to be prepared, whether they take a bail to Missouri or let relatives know they’re traveling within the state.”
According to the latest data from the FBI’s Hate Crime Reporting Program, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; the state ranks 16th in the nation in terms of crime.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that will make it harder to prosecute housing or employment discriminatory.
Previously, U.S. states passed immigration law enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement agencies to detain illegal immigration offenders, and the U.S. Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the move would increase the number of racial lawsuits and released travel advice for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are typically issued by the U.S. government against other countries, but recently, advisory groups have taken this approach to address certain laws and trends in the U.S. territory.

BBC calls Beijing the most exciting city: make the old feel "living in a new era"
The British media on January 18 that Beijing may have a long history of three thousand years, but it is also rapidly transformed into today's modern charming city.
The capital of China, with its amazing high-speed internet, cutting-edge technologies such as facial recognition software, huge investments in artificial intelligence and unparalleled international energy, is one of the most exciting cities for exploratory foreigners.
According to the BBC website on January 16, German immigrant Clemens Sessey said: “If I can succeed there, I can succeed anywhere later.”
Sasha, who served as the creative director of Travelers Archives magazine, said: “If Sinatra were alive today, he would probably be singing in a city like Beijing.”
Simon Norton, who lives in England but has recently lived in Beijing, wrote on his personal blog 4Corners7Seas: “People generally have a sense of being in the center of something big, and it’s hard to say clearly, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it will become and want to witness it.”
The city’s high-quality high-speed internet and technology-friendly environment make everyday life easier than ever before.
Andy Penya Fuelt, who is currently deputy general editor at the Beijing Children website, said: “Beijing is rapidly transforming into a non-cash society, with the Internet integrating the functionality of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions.”
But smartphones are just the beginning of Beijing’s technological ambition, and facial recognition software has become very popular, and many mobile apps use this technology to make bank transfers and payments, get people into apartments and offices, and even use it to verify the identity of the driver.
Beijing also recently announced plans to invest 13.8 billion yuan in the construction of an artificial intelligence technology park, where more than 400 companies will be based, which will focus on developing a variety of artificial intelligence technologies ranging from biometrics to autonomous vehicles.
Food is also the core of many major festivals in the Chinese calendar year, participating in these celebrations is praised by foreigners, the Spring Festival is the most important social and economic festival, and is also one of the most easily participated festivals for foreigners.
“I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for New Year’s Eve, cleaning their apartments and the red spring bonds with New Year’s Blessings on their doorsteps are equally important, and on the day of New Year’s Eve, all family members gather together to eat a great meal, then keep the year until midnight, and welcome the new year with bright flames. For foreigners, this evening with friends and family is indeed an opportunity to integrate.”
The number of foreigners in Beijing is growing, but China’s language barriers and the ease of communication between foreigners can easily be an excuse for not fully integrating them into local culture.
He said: “Some foreigners have lived in China for years, but have little experience with their host country.If the first attempt to contact Chinese is not successful, then you will easily feel easier to interact with other foreigners.
In these so-called "old-out bubbles" (the "old-out bubbles" refers to foreigners only in the midst of foreigners, without contact with locals and local cultures - translator notes), foreigners cluster in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and friends only foreigners.
The easiest way to overcome this is to learn a little bit of ordinary words—which is easier than one might think.
Sasha said: “One or two hours of private Chinese lessons a week, or an entry-level radio show, should fit everyone’s busy schedule.”
Even learning a few classic phrases can be helpful when shopping, ordering a meal at a restaurant, or chatting in a taxi.
Persistent air pollution is also a fact in everyday life, but in recent years the government has struggled to curb some of the problems.
Residents stressed the importance of going outdoors during the warm months, which are often mildly polluted, as an opportunity to take those blue sky days as a hike in the historic slums or to explore the popular Sunrise Park.
Norton said: “Beijing is the Chinese city where you can find the most under the surface, and you can find great art and music activities, loving nightlife, historical wonders, super-modern commercial districts and ancient hollow neighborhoods.”

The European Commission accused Google in April of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre-install software such as Google Search and Chrome, otherwise preventing it from using other Google apps.
The European Commission considers the move to be detrimental to consumers’ interests and hinder competition.
European regulators initially asked Google to respond by July 27.
If the anti-monopoly offence is established, Google will face the highest fine of 10% of its global revenue, approximately $7.4 billion.
Google has not immediately commented on this.
Google is also facing an EU investigation for preference to its own shopping service in search results.
Zhang Yooning's stay is real, and it can be said that his realization of the "hopping level" from the country to the country is not accidental, and the extent of his leap growth is still surprising.
A picture of the legal status of Bitcoin around the world
In addition to the price rebounds naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the crash in the current round of digital currencies also has nothing to do with the “enemy” – regulatory risk.
From the visual map, the attitude of the Eastern countries to Bitcoin is more conservative than the West, and the countries that make up the global subject are still looking at the legitimacy of digital currencies, representing the "black swan risk" is still large.
*This article is from Wall Street News (WWID:Wallstreetcn), edited by Wang Mu. For more great information please land on wallstreetcn.com, or download the Wall Street News app. *
With regulatory storms in major Bitcoin markets such as China, South Korea and the European Union erupting, the global digital currency, led by Bitcoin, has suffered from bloodwashing since this week, and the price of Bitcoin has fallen below the $10,000 psychological digits on Tuesday, the biggest single-day drop in three years.
In addition to the price rebounds naturally triggered by speculative attributes, the crash in the current round of digital currencies has also been associated with the long-standing “host” – regulatory risks.
At this crucial threshold, the big data visualization site HowMuch.net created a chart showing the legitimacy and degree of regulation of Bitcoin in countries around the world.
As shown below, green represents the legitimate market for Bitcoin; orange represents the neutral market, although it has not yet legalized Bitcoin’s status publicly, but there are no major restrictions on its use; light pink represents a restricted market, i.e. local governments attempting to approach the use of digital currencies through red lines or regulations; dark pink represents a country that Bitcoin is defined as illegal; and grey is a country that has not yet been commented on.
(The above image is from HowMuch.Net visualization team on January 15th)
From the distribution of African green blocks in the chart, it can be seen that the Eastern countries in the traditional sense are more conservative about Bitcoin than the West.
Russia is currently the largest country that defines Bitcoin as illegal, China is one of the largest restricted markets for Bitcoin, and India is one of the largest countries that has not yet commented on or adopted any related policies.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of Bitcoin, i.e. the distribution of green blocks is more concentrated.
The views of countries in the Middle East and Latin America on Bitcoin are markedly divided, and the distribution of colour blocks in the above regions is more mixed.
Among them, Iraq, Iran, Turkey, Brazil are all legal Bitcoin markets, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia and others have some restrictions on their transactions and use, and more Latin American countries have not yet spoken about Bitcoin.
Among the 246 countries globally statistically recorded, a total of 99 countries (or 40%) do not impose restrictions on bitcoin transactions and use, i.e. green and orange regions.
Seven countries (or 3 percent) are limited markets (light pink), ten countries (or 4 percent) define bitcoin as illegal (dark pink), and 130 countries (or 53 percent) do not yet treat digital currency information (grey).
This suggests that countries that make up the global player (53 percent, more than half) are still watching for the legitimacy of Bitcoin-led digital currencies in their territory, and also represents the “black swan risk” of Bitcoin is still large, as some of those countries may eventually make legislative decisions to restrict digital currencies.
The article argues that global regulators have not fully understood the emerging category of digital currencies, possibly the main reason why most countries have not yet made a statement.
While Bitcoin’s “popularity” has grown indexally since last year, not all countries are interested, some countries may be concerned about threatening local fiat currencies, or more concerned about the use of digital currencies by criminal organizations.
Wall Street News has written a detailed summary of the international regulatory news on Bitcoin since last week, including China’s start to fight off-the-counter exchanges’ centralized online platforms and mobile apps, South Korea’s still considering shutting down digital currency exchanges, and the EU’s view that Bitcoin has not yet been widely accepted and warned investors of the risk of “bloodlessness.”
According to the WSJ, the WSJ’s chosen publisher, “Let’s Listen to 2018: The Global Year for Digital Currencies?” said that from any point of view of regulation, acceptance/criticism, and adoption, 2018 will be the year of digital currencies for the global central bank.
Great nations such as Russia criticize Bitcoin’s legitimacy as a way to make way for the official issue of digital currencies.
Xinhua news agency Madrid on January 8 (reporter Xinhua Xinhua) Barcelona's Xinhua Coutinho made his first debut in a Pizzeria shirt at Nocampus on January 8.
Coutinho passed Barcelona’s medical examination that morning and signed a contract with Barca president Bartomeu that would expire in the summer of 2023.
He later made his debut as a Barcelona player in front of 7,000 fans at Nocamp.
According to Spanish media revealed, the total transfer fee of Coutinho or reach 1.6 million euros (1 euro or approximately 7.77 yuan), is the first in the history of the club Barcelona and the West.
Since Coutinho is still injured at the moment, he still needs a break of almost 20 days to witness his own show in the Barcelona shirt.
What else is sacred?
Trump’s White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty
The most definite sign of regime change was when they began attacking the statue.
Americans agree with this as anyone else.So in 2003, Saddam Hussein in Paradise Square in Baghdad was carefully planned to overthrow.
As one of the key think tanks in the Trump administration, Stephen Miller was sure to know what would happen to him when he had a heated debate with CNN’s Jim Acosta about the president’s proposal to strictly restrict legal immigration when he cut off a symbolic tail of the Statue of Liberty.
Fairly speaking, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, then a group of cruise ship owners and liberal followers would surely swallow him.
But he did attack the meaning of the statue, especially in 1903 when Emma Lazarus’s famous poem was engraved on the foundation (the monument was built 17 years later).
As Miller criticized Aristotle, “I don’t want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America’s freedom to illuminate the world.”
The poem you refer to, which was later added, is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
In fact, Miller was right, but as he himself said, it wasn’t really about history.
This relates to the modern resonance of Lazarus, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrant, but also the poorest of the poor: "Your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowded people long for freedom to breathe, / the suffering people reject your crowded beaches."
There is no moment in which the “suffering people refuse” on our screens become more vivid.
Miller was not engaged in literary commentary, and he made it clear that these people would not be popular in the United States of the Trump era.
This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a wider political and cultural warfare: it is actually in conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, as well as her friends, who had held events after her death and imprinted her poems on the foundation, knew that the conduct they were engaged in was highly political.
The sculpture is intended to express the connection between French and American republicanism through an ancient classical metaphor embodied as a woman of the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poem, the image of a woman was no longer abstract, she wanted to speak out.
She gave herself a very different name: Mother of Exile.
The combination of the poem with the painting was a successful feminist coup and a devastating blow to American authoritarianism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right-wing always wanted to change it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker, Rush Limbaugh, a Baptist at the time of Trump’s arrival, argued in 2010 that liberalism was not inviting anyone, and that he is now an early neo-conservative who brought America’s flame of wisdom to the world of ignorance: “The Goddess of Liberty is brave to nothing.”
She intended to bring the torch of freedom from America to other parts of the world.
Torchlight is not illuminating America’s path.”
Unusual, Limbus was actually impressed by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive perspective.
The very imaginative practice of Lazarus was to be able to see it. When tired, poor but hopeful people would see it on the deck after a long and often terrifying journey.
On the surface, this concerns the perspective of those who seek asylum and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveyed to them the intention of hope and welcome they needed to hear.
Of course, that’s not the point Miller and Trump wanted to admit.
Their torch is not to illuminate the road, but to ignite the hatred of their only source of power.

2017 World Cup: Neil Black praises the Scottish national team of England
Eilidh Doyle recalls that there were only two Scots in the British national team at the time.
Neil Blake, executive director of the British Athletics Association, said that a team of 16 strong Scots in the World Cup group would “do a huge contribution to the national team.”
The number of Scotland’s athletes selected to participate in the 2017 World Championship in London, which opened on Friday, is the highest in history.
Blake believes that “Scotland is making extraordinary developments” and British athletes must learn from them.
“We accept and try to understand this, and we’ll stick to it until we succeed,” Blake said.
“I talked to people at the Scottish Sports Academy who thought it was related to their actions.
Scottish athletes think it has to do with their actions.
The British Sports Association believes this has to do with their actions.
Even the street people think so.
Regardless of the situation, this is very brilliant.
Several Scottish athletes were medallists, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be 5,000 meters lower than Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen as the team’s captain.
“Eric is a bit humble.
Her captain’s speech was incredible,” Blake said.
“Many athletes, whether they are Scots, or wherever they live or train, come out of the door with pride and hard work.
The passion and true feelings that Erid naturally put into it were great.”
The British Federation silver medal winner, who will participate in his fifth world championship in the 400m cross-country race, said that there are 16 Scots in the British national team, which is “incredible.”
Previously, the maximum number of Scottish athletes who participated in the World Cup was seven, which is the number of participants in 1983 and 2015.
In the past year, Muir has set five British records and two European records.
She will participate in the 1500m and 5000m projects.
Chris O'Hare, who participated in the 1500 meters project, is another notable Scottish athlete, who had previously achieved good results in the season, winning both the British National Championship and the Olympic Anniversary.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first World Championship, when the only other Scottish was Lee McConnell.
The captain said that what made her very proud was that so many of her compatriots not only joined the team, but in some cases also challenged medals and ran into the final.
“The special thing about being the captain of the national team is that it is voted by the other team members of the national team. Therefore, knowing that your teammates voted for you to fight for an extremely unusual achievement is a great honour for me anyway,” she added.
“Of course, I’m very proud of all the Scots.
It just shows how far we have gone.
And they are all old-time field athletes here, the field athletes who are about to advance towards the goal of the award stage.
How is my captain’s speech?
Well, I think it is great.
I just referred to the fact that in this case, we were very lucky because we held the World Cup at home.
That’s why it’s really important for us to grow with our support at home and our return to the Olympic Stadium.
I’ll get a second chance to compete, and the atmosphere there will be incredible.”

Blocking critics on Facebook: If you can't tolerate the blame of voters, don't run for public office
Our father knows the bad media style.
Americans loved Washington, but soon after, the major newspapers began to violently criticize him for everything, from domestic policy to political principles.
He was upset by those criticisms, no doubt.
But he did not silence those critics.
As early as 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of speech is deprived – we will be slaughtered in silence and ignorance like lambs.”
This reminded me of Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who needed to learn from Washington.
Hogan’s staff blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people as they posted their views on his official Facebook homepage.
The American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor’s officials said the lawsuit was blatant, with online reports filled with their fierce rebellion: “Who cares?”
Many people say, “This is just Facebook.”
But that is important.
This is especially important because it faces people like Hogan.
He was a Republican who served as governor in a democracy-majority state, and he was also surprisingly popular.
Among the country’s 50 governors, he was ranked second.
Hogan is not a reactionary agonist.
He smoothly governed Maryland and strictly followed the rules.
He’s also very good at using Facebook as the primary way to connect emotions with voters, shouting on his home page for the first time after chemotherapy.
So blocking those who come to the Governor's homepage reviews is absolutely unnecessary and ultimately very dangerous. This homepage is a public forum and is an official management platform for the list of employees fed by the public who pay taxes.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan’s spokeswoman, Amelia Shares, defended the governor’s behavior, saying she thought blocking their comments was merely to restrain them a little.
But they overwhelmingly describe it as a flood beast or cynic who swirls through the network.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with those blocked by Hogan.
They are merely dialogue between ordinary people and their chosen leadership: their identities are teachers, small business owners, and priests, not flood beasts.
They have repeatedly stated that their comments are profound, respectful, and not downright.
The pastor quoted the words of the Bible in his posts, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Ramani, a lawyer in Bowie, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked questions about hate crimes.
She wrote in the Washington Post news story commentary section, “I politely commented and I was disappointed that he did not respond to hate crime and other recent news events.
I also don’t like a group of people commenting on the same topic, because they’re directly ignored by some people, thinking they’re so-called psychopaths, rather than considering them a group of worried citizens.”
The “intensive junk information bombardment” called by the governor’s officials may have been “insisting on assertions” in the opinion of others.
The Facebook era made it easy to modify a message, just blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.
And clearing far cleaner than in the past, in the past years, to do the same results required sending employees out to collect and burn newspapers with critical speeches or arrest or silence protesters.
But that’s really what’s happening now, but on a digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be accused of silencing others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
A milestone ruling came last week in Virginia on such issues.
According to U.S. District Judge James C. Cassarris of the city of Alexandria, Lloyd's County Supervisory Committee chairman's act of blocking voters from her Facebook homepage violated the First Amendment.
The governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevin (R), has also been viewed by the U.S. Civil Liberties Alliance for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
It should not be so difficult.
In the Washington era, affordable postal fees and the Internet had a similar impact.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, and there were anonymous letters of fierce criticism of his leadership.
And even at that time, Washington was targeting his anonymous flood beast.
People, using fake names such as Eureka, Valerius, Belizarre, Pogba, and others, wrote to the newspapers to severely criticize Washington’s decision.
According to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper’s online program, his office was flooded by petitions that criticized his attitude toward the Treaty of Friendship, Trade and Navigation between King George Washington and the United States of America.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, freedom of dissent and freedom of speech are the foundations of this country.
True leaders need to accept this.
The winds of the building and the winds of the market are all affecting people's sensitive nerves.
Purchasing restrictions are a harsh lever in many urban real estate regulation policies.
In May 2017, Jiangnan introduced the provision that undergraduate students pay social security for six months in a row, and enjoy equal housing purchase policies for residents of local permanent residents.
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy that stipulates that university students can graduate within 3 years with a diploma and employment certificate.
Following the policy, the official said that "university students can buy houses at prices below 20% of the market price";
In July, Chengdu issued a regulation that young talents with undergraduate and higher degrees at foreign universities can apply for the graduation certificate.
In addition, there are also cities or regions such as Kunshan and Shanghai, which have also introduced "introduction of talents" related policies, reducing the threshold for talents to buy houses.
Zhang believes that this is actually the competition of major cities for the population, especially talent, to retain the population, especially talent, and the city has competitiveness, which is the most important meaning of these real estate policies.
Some even think that this means the time has come for the building market to “limit” the purchase.

Ronaldo is looking forward to enjoying feeling home at the Renaissance Club
The East Locian Renaissance Club hosts the 25th Scottish Youth Open, where former European champion Ronnie Lafferty will enjoy the feeling of being home for the next three days.
The Northern Irishman Archerfield Links, who led the neighbor last year, advanced to the final but eventually lost to Paul Iles. He now works for the new venue, serving as an event ambassador on behalf of the club's founder and CEO Jerry Salvati.
Rafferty said: “I have witnessed the establishment of the Renaissance Club and we will witness its glory through this competition.
Athletes will see the best appearance and state of the field.
Jerry created this place unparalleled.
He is an enthusiastic supporter of this competition and is also very proud of his achievements here.
This is the best show on this stage.”
The Englishman Eils was looking forward to his first defense, although in his 32-year career he has won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
The Shawport athlete said: “It’s really special.
I didn’t defend the Estremadura Open because it was cancelled in the second year I won.
It feels magical to come here.
Playing golf here is great.
The memories of last year come up, and for me and my wife, Sharon, last year’s victory has a special meaning for us.
It’s really a special memory that we’ll remember forever.”
Returning home was Gary Orle, who was just 50 years old earlier this year and then also participated in the European Tour.
This is his first time in Scotland since the Scottish Open in 2013.
Helensburger Orel said: "The home home match will always be more meaningful.
You want to do well; but you can feel that extra pressure.
I really enjoy being able to play again and I’ve been playing golf.
I am satisfied with the current situation.”
The three-person team in the field included former Masters winner Ian Wusnan and World Championship champion Paul Brodherst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark Mayweather.
There are six Scottish athletes on the pitch, two of whom are Orle and former Red Cup captain Sam Torrens, and four others are Andrew Audacon, Stephen McAllister, Bill Ramsey and Ross Drummond.

The director of the Environmental Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, Zhou Tsui, presented on the 22nd in Beijing, in August, a total of 57 continuous punishment cases were implemented on a daily basis across the country, and the new amendment of the Environmental Protection Law implemented earlier this year significantly increased China's environmental law enforcement efforts.
At present, environmental protection organs across China can use daily continuous punishment, seizure, restriction of production, and transfer of administrative detention to punish environmental violations, and cooperate with the judiciary to punish environmental crimes.
In August, a total of 335 cases of seizure and seizure were implemented across China; a total of 177 cases of restricted production and suspension; a total of 189 cases of administrative detention for transfer and 166 cases of suspected environmental pollution crimes for transfer.
Among them, Henan has implemented seven consecutive punishments per day, and at present, China is embedding from end-to-end control to the entire process, comprehensively accelerating the management of environmental pollution.
Although the downward pressure of the economy is apparent, the Chinese Ministry of Environmental Protection has previously made it clear that China should properly deal with the positioning of environmental protection in economic development, enhance the "green determination", the lower the economic growth rate, the less environmental protection can be relaxed, and play a good role in environmental protection in the optimization of the economy.

A new batch of water samples had just been collected, and Liu and his colleagues were immediately busy.
During daily monitoring.
This year, they are working to address the smart management of rural sewage.
How to manage it properly is actually a very serious challenge.
The Zhejiang Qinghai Long Triangle Research Institute for Ecological Environmental Research is located in the birthplace of the spirit of Red Ship.
Nothing from ten years ago to now.
Zhejiang Qinghai Long Triangle Research Institute has developed into a regional innovation gathering force with three national-level key innovation platforms and four hundred overseas scholars in Zhejiang.
The spirit of the Red Ship is a force that we must follow and understand, and innovation is actually very difficult.
Every innovation here.
Everything feels impossible to solve, then this stage you have to persist, you are constantly walking.
The people went up the door, and now it is up to the bottom, so is it.
Practice for the people.
To date, through this method, the Chongqing district has collected a total of 5,985 problems, of which 3,868 problems have been solved, and 1,4496 problems are being handled.
We in Zhejiang have one thing to say.
Geographical advantages are not as good as cadres' advantages, policy preferences are not as good as quality of service, and the spirit of dedication of the Red Ship is an incentive that allows us to strive forward, and more to do this in the first place.
Dare to fight.
Recently, some representatives of the 19th National Congress of cultural and artists and well-known artists of the Chinese Union of Cultural and Cultural Organizations have formed a proclamation delegation to tour the spirit of the 19th National Congress in Inner Mongolia, Chernobyl, Gansu, Shanghai, Guangdong, Guizhou and other places.
They delve deeper into the grass-roots mass arts halls, local colleges and some colleges in Inner Mongolia, Chengdu, Gansu and other places, and take on the new cultural mission of the 19th National Congress of Spiritual Chinese Art workers.
I am deeply proud and happy, I am willing to sink down and again sink down, and write more about the fate of the small man of the great era.
For this level of literary development, there can be some good suggestions.
Now the mass literature is very entertaining, and there is a bit of popularity.
Continuously promoting the excellence of the time.
It should be rooted with the grassroots, deep into life, and then make a work with a certain cultural thickness, positively oriented, while having a permanent artistic charm.
It has reached twenty-eight, and the contract area of fifteen and two hundred million acres, of which eleven and one hundred million acres have been completed.
Approximately 82 percent of the land area of the second round of family contracts, seven provinces such as Sichuan have basically completed the report to the Party Central Committee and the State Council.

In space, we observe such a new one that has not been observed before, which cannot be explained and explained by existing theories.
The significance of the findings is multiple, and most importantly it demonstrates the use of the most cutting-edge technology by Chinese scientists.
The ability to manufacture scientific instruments to explore a very difficult scientific problem.
Toilet by the nose, this is the last century, many people remember about Chinese toilets.

The tourism department requires that the landscape toilet should be equipped with toilet paper and handwashing.
But in some areas.
Should this public service be stopped because of the uncivilized behavior of individuals?
Managers have made choices everywhere.
On the one hand, we advocate savings through civilization, on the other hand, technological innovation is also underway.
Public toilets in Jiangsu and Nanjing.
If you brush your face for three seconds, you can get a free toilet paper, but if you want to get a double, you need to wait another ten minutes.
Avoid abuse of public resources
Habit, maybe some tourists are really thinking about taking the paper back, but on the other hand we also think about it.
Isn’t the next toilet that our tourists are going to go into there is no paper, so that’s what we especially emphasized in the new three-year plan?
To solve this imbalance.
To push the toilet revolution deeper is to think more about what the masses think.
There must be a third toilet, so that the family can accompany the elderly and children to the toilet.
We take the baby, the male toilet, and we are ashamed to go in.
Women's toilet kids are so small as to understand a little embarrassment, that board is especially comfortable, very convenient for us to bring children.
At the same time that people feel civilization, they also become builders of civilization. In the countryside, villagers in Guangxi River Pools are building new water toilets in their homes.
There have been great results, actively promoting the toilet revolution can not only help people away from disease, but also drive economic development to narrow the regional development gap.
This toilet problem is a programmatic problem, a node in the development of social problems.
It is a national civilization project, from the perspective of the country to guide the layout, and then to solve small social problems from different degrees of participation from all sides.
So we packed all of our short.

Poverty and Death in Indonesia
Badtynna Dyer doesn’t have a stove when cooking.
She rarely even uses pot.
Her mansion is located in Enarotali, the capital of Panaya County, Papua, Indonesia, and the housewife usually just puts a potato — the locals call it a “nota” — directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the burned potato was taken out by a pair of unwashed hands, and the wolf swallowed it.
Daisy was sitting on the mud—she had no furniture, and this was also the place where she did her daily household affairs, such as washing clothes, and the water for washing clothes was very dirty, all from nearby swamps.
In a room without a roof there is a bowl of water, which is an outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of her husband's four wives, so she was not assigned to the fields to take care of.
Polygamy is common here.
It was dangerous, of course, to work late in the evening: most men in the village were unemployed, and many were drunk and muddy, plus a lot of soldiers here.
She said, “No one dares to walk in the village after 5 p.m.”
This is a rare glimpse of everyday life in the Papuan Highlands, once a Dutch colony, which was annexed to Indonesia after a referendum in 1969, but the referendum was also controversial, when only 1026 elders were forced to vote by hand-height in front of the occupying army.
The current strong demands for independence and anti-Dutch rule movement will soon point to the Jakarta government as it exercises high-pressure over the region and isolates foreign journalists and rights defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally split into the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is remote and smoke-free; to get here it takes a 90-minute plane from the province of Chaapura to Naberie, then a 5-hour rental car ride, and the way through the stomach of the river into the sea.
There is no public transportation here.
In this town of about 19,000 inhabitants, the wooden houses are surrounded by bamboo fences, and the wrinkled steel roofs are all kinds of yellow brown coverings made of rust.
There are very few Indonesians here, let alone journalists, and hardly any foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Meipago Papuan believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here too.
Daisy said, “We’re not used to these clothes.” she referred to her bright colours of hand-woven towels, a dark shirt and a bright half-dress.
“We used to cover our bodies only with leaves.”
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of people living below the poverty line, and the region with the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But this is also Indonesia’s Africa.
Located in the Highlands of Panye County, with approximately the same area as New Jersey, there are 153,000 people. The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Glasberg, is just 60 miles away, and is owned by Phoenix-based Philip McMurray Gold Company.
In 2015 alone, Philips mined around $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua has a wealth of wood resources, estimated at $78 billion.
However, these rich resources were also the source of the Papuan tragedy, and the powerful military power of Indonesia was therefore able to repress them.
A 2005 New York Times survey that Philip paid $20 million to local military personnel and troops between 1998 and 2004, with a single official paying up to $150,000.
The increasing demands of the Papuan people for independence threatened the monarch, and they suffered cruel treatment.
According to rights activists, more than half a million Pabuans have been killed since 1969 and thousands have been raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian army.
According to the Asian Commission on Human Rights, mass slaughter in the Papua tribal highlands in the 1970s has escalated to genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesia’s police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Diocese of Brisbane, “We Will Lose Everything,” covers evidence of the past year’s horrors, such as extrajudicial executions, torture – another report that rape and electricity are widespread – and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
Andrias Halsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: “Violence is happening every day, so it’s hard to count the number of victims.”
The resources of Papua attracted large numbers of immigrants outside of Indonesia, and the oppression began.
83% of the province’s 3.5 million population is Christian, but its demographic structure has changed after Muslim economic immigrants from densely populated Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi have come here.
Java's grocery stores sell a dodo mixed with chicken and vegetables, featuring peanut sauce.
Locals are fighting.
Apos Yu, a 24-year-old local in Panaya, moved to the province of Chaipura in search of work, explaining that “those immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables on traditional markets at a lower price than the local Papuan.
This left the local Pabuans—mama-mama women—losing their markets.”
Indonesian President Zoko Viktor (often referred to as Zokovi) vowed in his 2014 campaign to address Papua inequality and abuse of power.
The former carpenter’s path to the presidential palace in Jakarta has been supported by 27 of all 29 districts – including Panye.
But nothing has changed in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
“We’ve broken our hearts, and in 2014 we voted for Zhukov, hoping that he will fulfill our wishes and restore justice.”
In fact, just two months after Zhukov took office in October, Panye suffered his worst nightmare.
On December 7, 2014, eleven children in Enarotali were singing Christmas songs in front of the fire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly crashed in a motorcycle.
The children told them to turn on the headlights.
According to the local priest, Yavit Tobaï, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their voice and then returned with four soldiers.
Victims and witnesses said the drunk soldiers used their guns to chase the children.
Then one of the soldiers fired a gun at the children.
The 16-year-old Yulianus Yemene was severely beaten and in a coma.
Hours later, the nearby government agency election committee building burned a bearfire, and the incident escalated the next day.
Around 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They took the ritual hunting bow and jumped the waita dance of the Papua Mee Pago tribe—running around and imitating bird rings.
Some protesters began throwing stones at regular military posts.
According to an official document recorded by Time magazine, when the mood continued to escalate, the soldiers received orders via internal radio: “If the crowd resisted more than three times, immediately shoot.”
The 56-year-old Jeremias Kajami, the leader of the Enarotali Kego Koto neighborhood, felt a danger was about to happen, so he called on the crowd to calm down and beg them to go home.
But no one was in the mood to listen to him.
He stood on the doorstep of his coloured wooden house and told Time magazine, “When I turned back, my left arm suddenly shot.”
Qayami still doesn't know who fired the gun, but he said the bullets came from among the gathered soldiers.
He said, “They were crowded and they fired a lot of guns.”
According to a local cousin, Olpheus Yure, he witnessed the shooting and saw three shots in his body.
Eugene told Time magazine sadly, “I ran past and checked his body to see if it was him.
I found him dead... I kissed him.”
Papuan police chief Eugene Mend told reporters that his subordinates were just “protecting” the police station because the police station was attacked.
In 2015, Papuan police spokesman and chief of police, Sergio Sulistio, said: “When someone threatens to kill us, we must defend ourselves.
It is a question of life and death.”
Human Rights Watch said five young protesters were killed and more were wounded.
The news of the murder spread slowly in Jakarta the next day.
Three weeks later, Zokovi delivered a loud speech in Chaipura, expressing deep sympathy to the families of the victims and vowing to address the abuse of authority over Papua’s historical legacy.
He said, “I hope this case is resolved as soon as possible so that this will not happen again in the future.”
In October 2016, Security Minister Verando said he wanted to set up a non-judicial mechanism to address the historic legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuse for withdrawal also almost sounded out.
He said, “Most of the violations occurred a long time ago.
Some were in the 90s and early 2000s.
The focus is that we are already committed to addressing these violations, but that still requires a process.”
Then, on June 5 in Jakarta, Verando, in a conversation with Time magazine, said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, “Everything will be settled according to law.”
The United Nations has filed a complaint against Verandor for “crimes against human rights” over the deaths of more than 1,000 people in the bloody independence referendum in East Timor in 1999, but he said 11 cases of human rights violations in the Papua region have been resolved, including the Panai case.
Families of the victims of the Panai attacks have been upset by these statements.
He said: “I’ve been interviewed four times in the last three years, but there’s no progress at all.”
Years later he said, “I’m tired.”
He still lives in fear now.
He said, “I am scared.
I’m afraid of being arrested by the army and afraid of being shot.”
His brother, Yukabus, also believed that the people of Panye were afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four victims.
He said, “After the corpses were buried, the military came to me.”
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police shot villagers in the neighboring Panyai county of Deai.
A building company manager refused to help transport a man in a coma to the hospital, where conflicts broke out, killing one and injuring 17 others, including children.
A 24-year-old man, Raviano Doro, drowned while fishing on a nearby river and died on his way to the hospital.
Angry villagers protested in front of the company’s on-site office.
Police said the villagers threw stones at the police, so the police fired warnings.
But the anti-violence mobilization force (the Indonesian paramilitary police) started firing at the crowd and one was killed.
Dominic Valley Buddy, 29, told Time magazine, “We were all in panic at the time, and now we are afraid they will take revenge.”
“I was hiding at home for two days.”
The Iraqi parliament has called for the police to be brought to justice and for anti-violence mobilized forces to be evacuated from the area.
Paniye has always been an outstanding place for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has fueled dissatisfaction among the people of the Mee, Moni, Dani, and Damal tribes, who were scattered in the lush central Highlands of Panny.
Many have joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel group that claims to protect the rights of the Papua people by dispersing attacks and raids on the kidnapping of Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the senior leaders of the Free Papuan Movement were born in Panaya, including Tadius Eugene and Daniel Yudas Kohaga.
As a result, thousands of Panias have been arrested and deliberately detained in recent years by the military under the pretext of “preserving national sovereignty.”
Some did not appear again.
In the Papuan eyes, Panay is a “land of forgotten tragedy.”
Poverty increases dissatisfaction.
Enarotali sold less poor rice, and the locals could not afford it at all.
Bread is far away.
People here grow everything they can eat: mainly potatoes and some fruit and leafy vegetables.
Farming is a woman’s job, and every woman can take care of four or five potatoes.
They usually keep most of the harvest for household use, and put the rest to the local market for sale.
Ten potatoes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rubles (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequalities have cleared up among local Papuan and new immigrants, and the number of these immigrants has increased dramatically since the opening of the new route to Nebrija Airport.
A small amount of existing jobs usually falls into the hands of better-educated and richer immigrants.
Papuan people rarely have the funds or skills needed to run a competitive company.
John Goebbie, chairman of the Panai Tribal Council, said: “The young people don’t want to stay in this village... because there is no work or money here.”
Papua is isolated.
In addition, the restrictions on international media reporting remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudery and Basel Rougeau were expelled from Papua for not working with relevant agencies, even though they had rarely been licensed to shoot.
According to Human Rights Watch’s Deputy Director of Asia, Felim Cain, Zokovi’s election pledge to revoke reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development has not been fulfilled.
In a statement, he said, “If foreign journalists try to report dissatisfaction in Indonesia’s most eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua, they are at a new risk: refusal of visas and blacklisting.”
The absence of media supervision means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is basically limited to Papua’s neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations – Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands – asked the UN Human Rights Council to investigate Papua’s “various widespread human rights violations,” including the Panai shooting.
These countries also supported the Free Papua Movement.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Almanata Nasir, who was not interested in the group’s allegations, told reporters in Jakarta that “Indonesia still practices a democratic system and the media is free, so evidence of human rights violations is difficult to cover up.”
Local people want more attention from foreign governments.
According to an informed source, on May 4, when Dutch human rights ambassador Keith Van Barr led a delegation of officials to visit Chaapura, local people broke the silence and cried out “We want freedom.”
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but the Papua people say they are unlikely to vote for Mr. Zhukov again.
The chairman of the tribal council said, “Zokovi’s intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people involved in the Panye shooting.”
He wanted to let Zokovi know that the people of Panaya not only live under the threat of a greedy army, but have nothing, that the region is poorly educated, and that public health services are scarce.
Gorbachev said the people of Panye, like other Papuyans, thought that the ballot they gave to Zhukov was a debt he had to repay.
He said, “They don’t need money, they need justice.”
Even under threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Panay shooting still make their last symbolic rebellion: buriing a victim’s body across the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they won’t let those culprits forget their crimes.
Yukab said, “My family has been killed.
What else can we do?”
Sophia, Hollywood, Top Solid and other brands with the help of capital forces are customizing the household industry, on February 10, 2017, the Chinese Securities Regulatory Board approved the initial application of Guangzhou Shenzhen Delivery Home Co., Ltd., issued the deep-exchange small and medium-sized firms listing pass, more than 20 days before the first IPO was passed.

On Tuesday, Samsung Electronics released its first set of components for autonomous vehicles developed jointly with Harman International, as well as an information and entertainment solution, which is an important step in the company's entry into the car electronics market.
Samsung Electronics acquired HAMAN International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week, Samsung unveiled vehicle cameras with collision warning, lane deviation warning, and cruise control, which were developed in partnership with HAMAN.
Samsung plans to start shipping the camera system this year, which is built on technologies such as machine learning and augmented reality.
Samsung also showed the "digital cockpit", even if the driver is not the owner, it can make the vehicle more personalized, because this system allows users to download the driver's information from mobile devices and the cloud.

Fire again swallowed Dubai's torch tower
On Friday, a fire in the world’s tallest residential building in Dubai forced hundreds of residents to flee the 337-meter-high, 79-storey super-high building.
It was the second major fire in just two years that swept up high-rise buildings, and it happened at the torch known as the torch.
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been, and the cause of the fire has not yet been found.
“We were asleep, and then we woke up by firefighters and people started screaming.
We ran down the stairs and ran from the 50th floor for about 10 minutes,” a resident named George told Reuters.
Dubai's civil defense authorities said firefighters extinguished the fire around 4 a.m. local time (Greenwich Standard Time) and were heating up the building.
The government said it was working to provide shelters for those affected.
The incident could once again raise concern around the world about the safety issues of the use of exterior wall materials in high-rise buildings.
A survey conducted by the torch skyscraper management after its 2015 fire found that most of the damaged objects were decorated and insulated outer walls.
British police have said they believe problems with insulation and covering panels in London's Grenfell Building may have caused the rapid spread of the June fire, which killed about 80 people.
Williams also suggested that Massa is likely to return, although he has already announced his retirement.
On January 9, only a month from the opening of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in South Korea, with the Olympic holy fire from the south to the north and the pre-heating and various preparatory work intensely carried out, the atmosphere of the Winter Olympics in South Korea is becoming more and more intense.
South Korea's public opinion expects this long-running North Korean talks to bring a "egg" for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in a month.
On November 1, the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Holy Fire arrived in South Korea.
The thunderstorm of the Holy Fire was directly reflected in the sale of tickets for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the sales rate of tickets for the Winter Olympics in Pyongyang was only 32%, the sales rate of tickets for the Winter Paralympic Games was only 4.3%, and the declining sales rate of tickets once made the outside world worried about the popularity of the Winter Olympics in Pyongyang.
But as Li Xianvan, chairman of the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics Organizing Committee, recently predicted to reporters, “As the Winter Olympics holy fires spread across South Korea, the heat of the Winter Olympics is rising, and I am confident that ticket sales will soon improve.”
According to South Korean media reports, as of January 3, the sales of tickets for the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics have reached 64%, and the sales of tickets for the Paralympic Winter Olympics have also broken 50%.
In order to encourage foreigners to visit the Korean Winter Olympics, the South Korean Ministry of Justice also announced on 8th that it will extend the stay in Korea for foreigners visiting Korea to watch the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics to a maximum of 120 days.
A survey found that more than one-fifth of U.S. travellers carry banned items on board
A survey of airline passengers found that more than 20% of passengers have deliberately or unintentionally carried illegal items through the U.S. Transportation Safety Authority’s boarding checkpoints, with at least 6% of passengers unintentionally carrying illegal knives or other knives on board.
Less than 1 percent of passengers said they had noticed that they were carrying guns, ammunition or explosives.
The survey of more than 1,000 people, conducted by the flight rental company Stratos Jet Charters Inc., also found that younger travellers are more likely to openly disregard the regulations.
Of those who admitted attempting to carry TSA-prohibited items on board, 19.7 percent were Millennials, compared with less than 15 percent of Generation X.
The most common items that TSA security inspectors deliberately skip are food and beverages.
More than 3% of respondents admitted that they had deliberately carried a knife, while 2.2% of female respondents and 3.7% of male respondents also said they had deliberately carried illegal drugs on board.
The company said the survey was carried out to determine the number of people who accidentally carried and deliberately carried embargo goods through the safety check on board.
It is not surprising that those who are most likely to carry embargoed goods through safety checks – intentionally or unintentionally – are those who fly the most frequently.
However, the company noted that the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and incomprehensible.
People are often unsure what type of fluid they can carry and how much.
Therefore, it is not surprising that the TSA seizes the most forbidden liquids.
It was once thought that the TSA might also consider books as an embargo.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry.
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Director Prout changes his mind on Obama-era emissions reduction regulations
One day after being prosecuted by 15 states, Environmental Protection Director Scott Prout changed his earlier decision to postpone the implementation of Obama-era regulations to reduce emissions of smoke pollutants.
Prout proposed to make this change because, compared to previous governments, the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond faster to the needs of environmental regulatory state agencies.
He did not mention the legal challenges raised by the Federal Court of Appeal against his previous position.
The controversial focus is on setting a deadline on October 1 for states to start implementing the 2015 ground ozone standards.
In June, Prout announced that he would delay the implementation of the plan by about a year to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid “interfering with local decision-making or hindering economic growth.”
Prior to being appointed by President Donald Trump, Pruitt was Oklahoma’s Attorney General who had long opposed the tightening of environmental regulations.
Since his arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly turned to blocking or delaying regulations that oppose the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday’s sudden reversal was a recent legal barrier to Prute’s shift to regulatory agenda.
Last month, the Federal Court of Appeal in Washington ruled that the director of the Environmental Protection Agency had overriding power in an attempt to postpone the implementation of the Obama administration’s regulations requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released on Wednesday night, Prout made a major shift in his attitude toward ozone standards, saying he would strengthen the Environmental Protection Agency’s commitment to cooperate with states to implement complex procedures to reach new standards.
Prout said, “Under the administration of the previous government, the Environmental Protection Agency usually failed to reach the deadline, then waited for radical groups and other persons to prosecute and agreed to a timetable by agreement.”
“We don’t believe in regulation through lawsuits and we take the deadline seriously.
We also take regulations and authorities seriously.”
Nevertheless, the Environmental Protection Agency said in a statement that Prout could again use his “renovated authorization and all other legally available authorizations” to ensure that regulations are in line with “good policies and the best available information.”
Republicans in Congress are pushing for large-scale rewrite of the ozone layer regulations.
A House Bill passed last month aims to delay the implementation of the 2015 rule for at least eight years.
The measure has not yet been voted in the Senate.
New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states, sued the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency this week, saying it intends to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said: “The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s reversal – after our lawsuit – was a significant victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with communities of more than 1.5 billion Americans directly affected by smoke emissions.”
California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia, all joined the ranks of New York to participate in this case.
Ground ozone is a common pollutant emitted by automobiles, power plants, refineries, chemicals and other sources that reacts to sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause severe breathing problems in sensitive populations, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists greeted Pluto’s surprising transformation.
Laurie Ann Bird of the Center for Biodiversity said: “It is disturbing that this common sense measure is under tremendous pressure from those in charge of protecting the air we need to breathe.”
“We must end up fighting with the Trump administration for a mental movement that addresses polluters and special interest groups.”

Zhejiang, deputy director of forestry, said that with the good sales situation, Zhejiang wood production has also achieved a faster development.
In the past two years, the plantation area has expanded to 30,000 acres, and the total area has reached 180,000 acres; at the same time, actively developing outside the area, the plantation base has reached 80,000 acres across the country, which has increased by 30,000 acres compared to 2008.
At the same time as the cultivation area is expanded, the quality of seedlings is also constantly improved, the value of seedlings is constantly increasing, and there are many high-quality seedlings, and some seedlings are scarcely sold.
He also reminded that in the face of the current prosperity of production and sales, producers should calmly face and objectively analyze, both to see the society's demand for wood will be long-term and constantly increasing, but also to recognize that the market competition will be more intense.
The U.S. company Somaltus filed a lawsuit in the East Texas District Court, accusing Apple of infringing a battery technology patent it applied for in 2010.
The company has previously sued Huawei, Lenovo, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba for the same patents.
The lawsuit alleged that the iPhone 6s and similar Apple devices violated U.S. patent No. 7,657,386, which is called the Integrated Battery Service System.
The plaintiff wants cash compensation or a patent fee for infringement devices after the judgment is announced.
Judging from the lawsuit, the plaintiff appears to believe the iPhone’s quick-charging feature violated the company’s patents.
The iPhone with fast charging function quickly charges to 80% of the power, after which it is charged with a slurry.
Somaltus is actually a so-called “patent thief” because the company doesn’t offer obvious products and services, and it’s hard to find relevant information online.
However, they have managed to reach an out-of-court settlement on the patent with automakers such as Ford and Nissan.
The meeting believes that accelerating the development of informatization, promoting the integration and efficient utilization of resources, enhancing the level of digital and intelligent industries, is of great significance for promoting "Made in China 2025" and mass entrepreneurship and innovation, fostering new dynamics, and improving the quality of life of the masses.

According to leaked phone records, Trump had pressured Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post leaked records of US President Donald Trump’s conversations with Mexican and Australian leaders.
In a January 27 call to Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly saying he would not pay the cost of building the border wall.
The U.S. presidently expressed dissatisfaction with his public criticism of the isolation wall, alleging Putin had told him: “Don’t tell the media.”
During his presidential campaign, Trump promised to build a wall on the southern U.S. border and solemnly announced that he would have Mexico to pay for the project.
A record of his calls with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has also been released, which shows tensions between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the U.S. deal to take on sending refugees to Australia was “absurd,” “disgusting” and “stupid,” and that he had suggested that the U.S. ban refugees’ resettlement, and now insisted on the deal under the Obama administration, which would make him look like a “stupid.”
Trump hanged the phone after telling Turnbull that “this was the most unpleasant call today.”

Moore Beach Tragedy: Activists Repeat Racism and Struggle for Justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car crossed a group of peripherals in the small town of Monroe, Georgia, and ran toward the small Moore Beach Bridge.
The car was carrying four black passengers and a white driver, and before the car arrived on the bridge, a group of white men with guns walked forward, blocking the car’s way forward.
The head of the gang — a middle-aged man in a fine striped suit — breathed a cigar deep, staring his eyes into the windshield.
The passengers in the car were frightened.
“We want – Roger!” the man shouted.
“Take him out of the car!”
A young black man was dragged down from the front row passenger seat, screaming to break the silence.
Fortunately, this horrific scene of July 22 was just a repetition.
But when "Roger"'s neck was wrapped up with a rope, almost all the audiences in the circle gave a real breath.
Civil rights activists have been returning to Moor Beach Bridge since 2005, portraying the scene of two black couples – Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Merry Dorothy – hanged by the Three K Party in the evening of 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
“While we know who they are, even though we’ve seen them in the community, it’s incredible that none of them have been arrested over the years,” said Tyron Brooks, who helped organize the replay.
“This is the dirt of history, the burden of our souls.”
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgian lawmaker and lifelong rights activist.
For him, the repeat was a striking call to remind the Monroe community every year that injustice was never corrected.
“We want to prosecute, we want to close the case, we want to heal, we want reconciliation, but we have to get justice first,” he said.
“Unless we receive justice, we will not be healed and reconciled.”
On July 27, 1946, an officer covered the body of a murder victim in Moor Beach.
According to the FBI archives obtained by National Radio News, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of being involved in the execution.
None of them have been charged.
While the suspects have been out of custody for a decade, civil rights activists say the dual motives for the execution are well-known throughout the city: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling allowed black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in primary elections later that summer.
According to the FBI’s statistics, about the same time, black farmer Roger Malcolm murdered white landlord Barnet Hester in a fight — seeming to be for a woman.
Brooks said the rumors in the town were that Hester was sleeping with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and her baby was not her husband.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the prominent white landlord Roy Harrison paid $600 to release Malcolm from prison.
Dorothy and cousins Mac Merry and George Dorothy accompany him to prison.
But as they returned from the prison and approached the Moor Beach Bridge, a group of prisoners surrounded the car.
“It turns out that Harrison organized and ordered the murder,” an FBI report concluded.
“It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement agencies that not only participated in murder, destroyed evidence, but also concealed the identity of witnesses.”
Brooks is very simple.
He said: “This is a catastrophe of voting rights.”
“They were brutally murdered, and the murderer sent a message to the black people in this community: ‘If you register and vote, you’ll have the same end.’”
For a decade, Cassandra Green has been in charge of the annual replay of the Moore Beach Bridge massacre.
Her behavior is distinctive, intriguing, and has a profound racist background.Many people want this kind of racism to cease to exist in the United States.
It’s hard to see, it’s harder not to see, but Green says that’s the key.
“We don’t want to talk about suicide because it makes us face the ugly side of everyone,” she said.
“But if you don’t listen to me or listen to me telling about my own experiences, I can’t build a relationship with you.”
This year’s show began in June, with 30 actors – dozens of whites, the rest of whom are blacks – crowded in a room on the first day to hear Green release a refined overview of the show.
Wade Malbo is the co-director of Green.
He has been playing the role of the Three K Party for years, but he says the role is never easy.
“I feel so dirty because I’m not that kind of person,” Malbo said.
“But I think it’s important to keep this period of history fresh, because we don’t want to go back to that era.”
In the room, actors Roger Malcolm and Barnet Hester, Dario Bradshaw and Nick Rascone, are refining their speeches.
At the beginning of the show, Malcolm shouted and pushed Hester out, angry at his sleeping wife Dorothy.
“I said, get out of my place!”
Raccoon is back.
Then they beat up.
Then everyone (at least all the black actors) burst into laughter.
Green laughed the most.
“What’s going on?” asked Raskoni.
He was panicked and confused.
Am I acting too much?
“No,” said Green laughing.
“I just think white people won’t say ‘Oh.’”
“Yes,” another black actor joked.
“Your voice must be tough.”
This is how the energy in the room changes; the feeling of fraternity drives away the feeling of discomfort.
Everyone worked hard to do this, not only to perform the show, but also to commemorate the four victims.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Lasconera said the word “Oh,” the tone was sharp and powerful.
No one laughed.
The repetition ended vigorously and quickly.
The shooting, the shooting, and then the silence.
A woman in a funeral black dress stood next to the actor’s body, singing Billy Hallyday’s lamentation “Strange Fruit.”
Her voice overcame other words.
A hundred yards away, about forty spectators were constantly wiping the sweat and tears.
Nearly half of the audience were black and white.
A couple went to the show from Isaac in New York, and a lot of them lived near the street.
Brooks took them to the cemeteries of Malcolm and Dorothy, almost eight hours away, all suffering the unpleasant heat of Georgia.
Until then, the murderer was still a fan.But now, standing on the same land where private punishment took place, anxiety flooded in the air.
When the last note of the song disappeared, Green asked people to get close to some of the bodies played by the actors.
The children bowed their heads down, looked at false blood and bodies, stealing private language from each other.
“They’re not really dead,” a little boy whispered, as if reminding himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and the show ended.
The actor threw off his rope and wiped away his tears.
Bradhaw embraces the dressed man Malbo who plays the leader of the Three K Party.
Nick Rascone hugged his two colleagues and cried in their arms; the emotions in the show eventually infected him.
“No problem,” one of the women said lowly.
We know that your heart is not like that.
You do it for a reason.”
Afterwards, the audience sat down and ate dinner with the actors.
At the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted intimately with a black couple they had just met and talked about the replay.
Dennis Duplinsky had a hard time finding words to describe what she felt after watching.
“It’s hard to imagine those terrible words and actions ... being said and done by people like you because they look very similar to you,” she said.
“That really made me think that the executions are still going on,” she added, “now that’s just called police shootings.”
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sat at the table watching, tasting and tasting citizenship.
He said he has already begun planning for the show next year.
“Repetition is an inspiring way because it describes the horror we’ve experienced, but it’s also very educational,” he said.
“If you don’t learn from it, it might happen again.
Those who do not study or understand their own history are doomed to repeat the same.”
The importance of the gas market reform in terms of "conducting network independence" is obvious, but the resistance and controversy are also greater.
On the 7th, the reporter was informed from Hebei Kane Group that on the 7th, at 11:25 am, an explosion occurred in the Kane Group Chemical Co., Ltd. milk chemical workshop in the ancient metallurgy district of Dongshan City in Hebei Province, and 13 operators were trapped on the scene.

However, the fans did not express any dissatisfaction with this, but instead sent a blessing, because the reason for the disappointment was that Zhou Jeron happily became a father.
After waiting for a whole year and a half, Yellen finally arrived in Beijing last week to dedicate this first work after his ascension to his father, and also his 14th album in his music career, "The Story of Zhou Yellen Before Sleep".
Chinese Air Force Engineering University scientists study laser satellites to clean out space junk
According to the US media, Chinese scientists have put forward a bold innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up the troubled Earth's orbit and destroy the old satellites and their sky junk.
According to the U.S. Newsweek website on January 15, researchers at China Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled "Sky-based laser cleaning small-scale space deformation model study", which describes how by using sky-based platform lasers, space debris can be laser irradiated into smaller, less harmful debris.
Space junk has been a concern for the international space agency for years, and NASA has considered multiple options for tracking, detecting and removing artificial debris.
Ways to remove large-scale space debris include huge networks used to clean and collect waste, as well as magnets that can be used to suck them out of orbit. Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean the Earth's orbit.
The summary of the paper said: “(the simulation study) provides the necessary theoretical basis for the application of sky-based platform laser cleaning space debris technology.”
A 2014 study by U.S. defense giant Lockheed Martin found that there are about 200 threats per day to satellites in orbit.
High-speed debris that moves along Earth’s orbit is seen as a serious threat to future space missions and has been described by the European Space Agency experts as “a deadly string of threats.”
According to the US "Volkswagen" monthly website on January 17, the space is basically empty, but the space near Earth is becoming more and more crowded.Each satellite we send into space will eventually turn into another piece of debris orbiting the Earth, and over time, these debris will accumulate.
The more the debris is, the more likely a satellite that is still operating is to be hit by the debris, thereby damaging or destroying a multi-million dollar investment.
All space agencies have developed plans to clean up space junk in the future.
NASA is considering reducing the speed of the debris from its orbit by using gas injection, Europe is considering launching a satellite carrying a large net to capture the debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan’s idea is to capture the debris with an electric chain.
At the moment, China is also proposing a way to solve space junk by using a large laser to hit floating space junk into smaller, less harmful pieces.
According to a paper published in the German monthly journal Optics by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University, such a laser installed on a satellite would cleanse space effectively enough, at least according to the simulation results.
The only way to confirm its validity is by testing, which has not yet been arranged, but may soon be installed on the satellite and then sent out into space.
Once done, we can finally begin to eliminate the problem of space junk once and for all.

According to reporters, the growing Taliban and so-called Islamic State (IS) groups in the Karabakh region have aroused serious concern from NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to UN statistics, at least 1,662 civilians were killed in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, compared to about 20% in the capital.
A suicide car bomb attack in a predominantly Shia-dominated region of Kabul in late July killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban claimed they were responsible for the attack.
A massive explosion in the centre of Kabul on May 31 killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since the 2001 overthrow of the Taliban by U.S.-led multinational forces.
The violence highlighted U.S. President Donald Trump’s weighing on whether to increase troops in Afghanistan while supporting its military and police in the country’s dangerous security situation.
The suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also sparked a crisis of public confidence in the reputation of the government and its policies, in particular of President Ashraf Ghani.
U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) overturns decision after lawsuit, delaying smoke regulations
During Obama’s tenure, 15 states filed lawsuits against the U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency for limiting smoke-causing emissions, a day after the lawsuits, the EPA overturned the regulation.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced on Wednesday its decision to continue implementing the so-called “2015 Ozone Target Zone” and pledged the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will work with states.
Scott Pruitt, director of the U.S. Environmental Agency, said in a statement: “We are confident in the dialogue with our national partners and are committed to responding to it.”
Pruitt announced in June that the EEA plans to postpone the implementation of the ozone reach zone standards until October 2018, with a one-year delay - based on the standard, measuring existing smoke pollution in some areas to determine which areas should reduce emissions that cause smoke pollution to meet air quality standards.
Fifteen major Democratic states and the District of Columbia filed lawsuits on Tuesday, declaring the act illegal.
As part of a broader agenda, President Donald Trump’s authorities have been working to restore various environmental regulations enforced by former President Barack Obama to boost economic growth.
But these efforts have sparked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups who fear more emissions will affect public health.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on its website that breathing ozone-containing air “will decrease lung function and increase respiratory symptoms,” such as asthma.

Miki Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time to discuss possible future decisive battles
The most remarkable 147-pound boxing game will take place shortly thereafter, with Vasily Lomachenko and Miki Garcia currently in a potential state of conflict meeting for the first time on Thursday.
In the separate room of the ESPN office in Los Angeles, the unbeaten World Boxing Council lightweight champion Garcia took the lead down the hallway to congratulate the World Boxing Organization super-heavyweight champion Lomachenko.
At Saturday's Showtime boxing, the referee unanimously ruled that Garcia defeated quarterback world champion Adrian Brona for a victory, so that the two boxers have become the top five in the heavyweight list.
Garcia stretched out his right hand and said, “Champion, are you okay?
I wish you good luck.”
In an ESPN match at 7 p.m. on Saturday night, Lomachenko defeated Miguel Mariaga and safeguarded his position.
As they photographed the two, Lomachenko’s agent, Agis Klimas, pointed out that the potential match between the two players depended on “perfect size.”
“I was light before,” Garcia said.
“I raised the level to fight Bruno (140 pounds), but I didn’t weigh that much.
Compared to 140 pounds, my weight is a little smaller.
I want to go back to the light level.
And he has to reach the lightweight level (135 pounds), and then we can fight.
This is what the fans want.
Then we satisfy them.”
Romanov agreed to this.
“The boxing world needs this fight.”
Klimas asked whether he should be charged in secondary terms, and part of his strategy was to have Romagnoli play his debut with a £135 player later this year in order to set a date with Garcia next summer (37-0,30 elimination). Garcia was also interested in confronting the winner of the match against Huerta Linares-Luc Campbell after the September 23th Forum Lightweight Boxing Championship.
“Because all the fans are asking this question, this confrontation may be charged in a row,” Garcia said.
“We are the main characters.
Others could not generate that much attention.
As long as they are ready...”
Garcia praised Lomachenko as "an outstanding player" and was likely to watch his boxing match live on Saturday.
But Lomachenko was hesitant about Garcia’s praise, saying he thought the third-part champion from Riverside looked “slow.”
Garcia said the focus was on showing the strength of the fist, and then on boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their own boxing game.
“This is a fight that must be fought.
Attention and warmth are not the same as other boxing games.
I am very happy to participate,” Garcia said.
Lomachenko said: “I’ve been waiting for the top fighter, this time it’s Mackey’s turn.
It will be a great fight.”

The officials of the China Development and Reform Commission on the early completion of the 11th Five-Year Plan of Emissions Reduction targets have given the steel industry, which is compromised by limited electricity production, a strong re-production expectation.
Although at present, the steel plant has not received a clear notification of the local government announcing the end of energy saving and emissions reduction, the industry estimates that around December 15, 2010, the steel plants that were originally limited will be successively completed, and the price of steel will start to bear pressure.
At present, there is no notice of the end of limited production of electricity, but in fact, the pressure on various enterprises has been much less than in September and October, a person from a private steel company in Hebei province told reporters.
Some parts of Hebei have repeatedly issued electricity production restriction documents, and once took the way of compulsory pulling gates to restrict enterprise production.
The reporter learned from local enterprises that at present most of the steel plants in Hebei have resumed work, limiting production pressure.
My steel grid analyst Zhang Tianjin predicts that as the north has already entered the winter, the end demand for building steel will gradually shift from strong to weak.
In addition to the gradual end of energy saving and emissions reduction, by December 15, most steel plants will be basically re-produced, and products will reach the markets before the New Year's Day.
The increase in the supply of resources will put the current price of steel under some pressure.

Swedish Refugee Age Assessment Test
The Swedish refugee test uses the latest methodology to evaluate their age from a medical point of view, with the latest results showing that more than 80% of subjects were judged to be over the age of 18, but not everyone is confident of its accuracy.
The Swedish National Center for Forensic Medicine (Rttsmedicinalverket) started this test earlier this year.
After failing to accurately assess the age of refugees who claimed to be minors, the Swedish Migrationsverket designed these tests to provide a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
So far, the Swedish Immigration Authority has sent 6,880 testers, and the French Medical Center has now released the results of a total of 2,481 testers from mid-March to July 31, 2017.
80% (2002) were found to be 18 years of age or older, but in another 25 tests, the Swedish National Forensic Center determined that the subjects “may be 18 years of age or older.”
In 432 tests, the result was that the person was “probably under 18 years old.”
The test is only for people with questionable age.
John Granson of the Center for Forensic Medicine said the results were consistent with those of the previous months.
He told The Local, “These figures don’t differ much from the previous months, and the numbers are very consistent.”
A higher percentage of cases of convictions of age over 18 does not necessarily mean that these refugees lied about their age.
In May, the center released the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases “indicating that the subjects were 18 years old or older.”
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet surveyed the results of 581 tests, and found that 243 of them had publicly stated that they would be 18 years old this year.
X-rays of smart teeth, nuclear magnetic resonance scans of joints and analysis by dentists and radiologists have also been challenged in some areas.
One of the skeptics was Carl Marcus, an endocrinologist at Caroline College, whose work included evaluating people’s biological maturity to determine whether they experienced puberty earlier or later than normal age.
He told the newspaper Metro: “I have reason to think so, and I think the method of measurement used shouldn’t be that way.
In this way, determining the physiological age is inaccurate.
If we can’t guarantee accuracy, we shouldn’t pretend we can.”
However, Granson of the Forensic Medical Center defended the accuracy of these tests: “In general, the risk of uncertainty about determining a child to be an adult is small.”
The biggest risk is that person is just under 18, which is about 10 percent.
West Virginia Governor Announces Party Change
On Thursday night, West Virginia Democratic Governor Jim Justice announced at a rally with President Trump that he would change party.
“Whether you like it or not, the Democratic Party has gone away from me,” said the governor’s judge.
“Today, after a lot of prayer and thought, I want to tell you... Today I want to tell you, as a West Virginia citizen, that I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor.”
The gathering broke out of cheers.
“So tomorrow I’ll change my party status to Republican,” Justis added.
“As a coach, I want to tell you it’s time to start another game.”
Trump earlier pledged at a rally in West Virginia to make a major announcement.
Mr. Trump won West Virginia’s 42 percent vote rate, while Justin didn’t support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justin was named the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
Forbes notes that he inherited his father’s coal industry and owned coal mines in five states.
Currently, its value is approximately $15.9 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening saying: “Governor Justin’s change is another blow to the Democratic Party, which will not but will not prevent our country from becoming great again, but will make our country great again.”
“The Democratic Party currently has only 15 governors and controls the number of state parliaments at its lowest ever, and Governor Justis’s statement is the latest rejection of such a party that loses leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unified slogan,” Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronnie McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.

Sebastian Koch praises Russia’s “honest” apology for doping scandal
On Thursday, Federation Chairman Sebastian Koe praised Russia’s apology for the doping scandal and said the apology was “honest,” but reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to re-engage in the sport.
The President of the Russian Athletic Federation, Mitri Chiractin, said at the International Athletic Federation conference on the eve of the World Athletic Championship that it was right for his country to be banned from the sport and that he was determined to fight doping.
He said he regretted that “all athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were deprived of their medals.”
Despite his comments, the IAEA General Assembly still voted in favour ofining the ban. Earlier, a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) mentioned evidence that the Russian state sponsored the use of doping, and the ban was implemented in November 2015.
“I think today’s response is very frank and very frank,” IATA Chairman’s Department told reporters.
“The entire council and the Federation are delighted ... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has gone through a very burning period and is doing everything possible to ensure that Russia can return to the competition.”
He said he was also “happy” that Russia accepted the criteria for re-entry.
“I think it’s a very constructive day, and I also think we’ve made some progress, but I think it’s not the time to restore Russia’s eligibility for the competition,” he said.
“We need to do everything we can to normalize this situation in the coming months.
Our guiding principle has always been the hope of separating innocent athletes from contaminated systems,” he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict standards of the International Tennis Federation, will compete as neutral athletes at the World Tennis Championship held in London on Friday.
Warren Anderson, the head of the team, said on Monday that Russia has not yet met a number of criteria for re-engagement.
He told reporters after a speech to the IAAF Board in London that the drug tests were still inadequate and that the banned coaches were still training.

After the implementation of the project, it will play a positive role in promoting the regional scientific development of the city of Xi'an, achieving the subsistence of lakes, accelerating the improvement of the quality of the water environment in the reservoir, ensuring the safety of drinking water, and promoting energy conservation and emissions reduction.
Today, four groups in Zhejiang province, such as Kylian County, have won the eighth Chinese Environmental Award for their contribution to beautiful China.
Established in 2000, the Chinese Environmental Award is the highest award in the field of environmental protection in China, and is composed of a selection committee of several central departments.
Li Wei, head of the selection committee and secretary general of the Chinese Environmental Protection Foundation, said that China is facing the ecological problems left behind by the development model of heavy GDP and light environmental protection in the past few decades.
The Chinese Environmental Prize is selected to recognize those units and individuals who contribute to improving the livelihoods of the people, in order to reflect respect for the public opinion.
In the opinion of the selection committee, the ecological county-based Zhejiang province of桐 county was honored with this honor.

How did the financial rules affect Neymar’s transfer to Paris?
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted spending by European hockey clubs will not prevent Neymar from transferring to Paris Saint-Germain Football Club (PSG) in France from the Barcelona club in Spain at a record price.
As a result, the European Football Association (UEFA) has further downgraded the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club. The European Football Association (EFA) is the regulatory body of European football matches and has the power to ban teams from participating in the widely-attended Champions League.
UEFA’s Financial Fair Play Rules (FFP) introduced in 2011 meant that the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club had to ultimately prove Neymar’s transfer was funded without causing huge losses.
The Barcelona club has already paid €2.2 billion ($2.6 billion) merely to pay for the Brazilian player’s withdrawal, while Neymar’s salary will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial implications of Neymar’s transfer to France.
Given that the team’s funding comes from the wealthy Qatar ruling family, Paris Saint Germain Football Club could of course sign Neymar with cash and incorporate him into the other star clouds.
Clubs can spend huge amounts of money on players, but they have to use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge amounts spent to balance their losses on football-related.
The Financial Fair Competition Rules were proposed by Michel Platini after he was elected chairman of UEFA in 2007.
The former French player argued that for clubs that have high debts in pursuit of success, if the banks or everyone withdraws support funds, they are actually cheating and putting the club at risk of destruction.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from club debt issues to club loss monitoring.
The change meant that the business model used by Roman Abramovich when he acquired Chelsea in 2003 – buying a club with potential, then spending huge amounts on improving the team and building a global brand – now faces a more demanding situation.
During the three-year evaluation period of the Rules, which ends in 2018, the club could lose €30 million.
Despite Abu’s depreciation by the then chairman in 2015, UEFA successor Alexander Ceferin is still committed to stopping excess spending.
“Of course the Rules are not out of effect yet, and we will definitely strengthen the regulations in the future,” Andrea Traverso, UEFA’s head of Rules affairs, told Associated Press last week.
While the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club will pay Neymar’s break-off terms once, it can also allocate amounts according to accounting purposes during the contract term.
Neymar has already signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer fee may amount to €44.4 million in annual accounts for the next five years.
The first wave of Rules sanctions, introduced in 2014, imposed the most severe sanctions on the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and the Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City club.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was fined €60 million ($82 million at the exchange rate at the time), later reduced to €20 million, and required the team to reduce players to 21 instead of the normal 25 players in the Champions League in the 2014-15 season.
UEFA is looking at clubs that try to deceive financial regulators by increasing revenue by linking them to club owners.
While Qatar’s companies can sponsor the Paris Saint-Germain football club, if the amount of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market price, UEFA will not regard it as a legitimate income.
That’s what happened in 2014 when UEFA ruled that the Qatar Tourism Authority’s funding of the Paris Saint-Germain football club was exaggerated.
A portion of Neymar's income from the Paris Saint-Germain football club may come from payments to the 2022 Qatar World Cup organising committee.
But both the Paris Saint-Germain Football Club and the organizing committee denied that Neymar would serve as World Cup ambassador, which would be easy for UEFA regulators to take.
The recent sanctions imposed on the Paris Saint-Germain football club mean that UEFA will be more alert to any attempt to circumvent the rules.
Information sources said on Thursday that UEFA did not have any preliminary discussions with the Paris Saint-Germain football club on Neymar's transfer.
Both have only been in contact with the Associated Press as they were not authorized to discuss the status of the Paris Saint-Germain football club.
The last published accounts showed that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club's operating revenue in 2015-16 amounted to €5.42.4 billion, with a profit of more than €10 million.
The accounts for the previous financial year have not yet been published.
Paris Saint-Germain Football Club expects Neymar’s accession to the club will bring a gospel for sponsorship, franchise and clothing sales.
The club expects revenue to grow by at least 30 percent after signing Neymar.
Obviously, the Spanish league was deeply angry to see one of the most famous players leave, trying to block Neymar’s move and claiming that Paris Saint-Germain Football Club violated the Rules.
Javier Tebas, the chairman of the league, told the Spanish newspaper AS that “this is a clear example of a ‘financial doping’ that clubs and nations are the same,” referring to Qatar, which has final ownership of the Paris Saint-Germain football club.
Arsenal team (all members of the club are U.S. sports champions) head coach Arsene Wenger, has reservations about the attitude of the state-funded club and the West League.
“This is a consequence of ownership, and it has radically changed the entire ecology of football over the past 15 years,” Wenger said on Thursday.
“Once the country has a club, anything happens.
This would make it very difficult to comply with the rules because there are many different ways or interests for a country to demand that the big card players represent a country.”
Intelligent interactive robot developer Rokid received new investment
In recent years, start-ups in the field of artificial intelligence have continued to be heated by capital.
ROKID is about to complete a new round of financing recently, led by Daimler, Swiss Credit, CDIB (investment institution of Taiwan Development China Holding Company), old shareholder IDG capital and other institutions followed.
It is that the round of financing is about $ 100 million, and Switzerland and CDIB appeared for the first time in the domestic financing transactions in the field of artificial intelligence.
Rokid is an intelligent interactive robot developer, dedicated to the field of robotics research, products can manipulate intelligent devices in the home, with the ability to continuously independent learning and growth, but also with recognition, understanding, feedback and other functions.
This round of funding will be mainly used for research and development, talent introduction, strategic promotion and investment layout of the industry chain.

According to Apple, from February 28 this year, the iCloud service in mainland China will be transferred from the cloud to Guangzhou company.
Apple said: “The partnership with the State of Guangzhou in the cloud will allow us to continue to improve the speed and reliability of iCloud services, while also in line with the new rules that Chinese cloud services must be operated by local enterprises.”
During the deactivation period, user data previously stored in iCloud will also be stored in iCloud and will not be lost.
If users want to use the iCloud service after February 28, they will need to accept the new terms and conditions to ensure that their accounts are reactivated and migrated to the cloud.
In a statement, Apple said: “Apple has strong data privacy and security protections and will not create backdoors in any of our systems.”
The iCloud main data center will also be Apple’s first data center project in China, which will be used to store data from Chinese Apple users when completed.
When it is built and put into use, Chinese users upload and download data without having to cross long distances between China and the United States to transfer back, improve speed and reduce delays.

3D animated film "Boo Fukushima" held the premiere ceremony in Wuhan on the 25th, "Boo Fukushima" director Zhou Yuan, "Boo Fukushima" animated director Mon Wisdom, film producer, Emmy Award winner Tom Disher made a number of debut, the scene to share the story behind the scenes of film creation.
“Tofu” based on the story of King Liu Yang of Hangzhou in traditional Chinese culture, born out of the tradition of “Tofu by Liu Yang, made by mistake”, tells the story of the protagonist “Tofu” from a bean fantasy into a human form, overcoming serious difficulties, and adhere to the dream of the monster.
In the territory of the city of Hubei, Hubei is one of the world cultural heritage sites declared by the United Nations, as well as the birthplace of the culture and martial arts of the Dao family, known as "the ancient unspoilt land, the first sandy mountain in the sky."
Director Zhou Yuan revealed that in the pre-production period of the film, he travelled with the main creation team to the mountains of Wu.
He said that the story of "Boo Fukushima" took place in the years of the Wuhan King, in the background of Huangnan King Liu An Refined Feng, the film's protagonist "Boo Fukushima" was a bean that accidentally fantasied into a human when Liu An Refined.
In addition to being the origin of the culture of the Dao, the Hubei mountain also has a profound background with China's historic traditional instrument - the clock.

Ancient infectious powers in the market – “Hara Summer Camp” and “Detective Twins”
Repeat this story to remember the actors' landscape years of the 80s and the rubbish age of the 90s (after David Wayne and Michael Schwartz made the comedy for MTV's sketch "Nation"), as well as the memory of old age itself, the memory of 2001; before this year, many stars such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Luther have not yet risen.
As a cultural artwork, it is the imitation and reflection of the eternal memories of our Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time isn’t enough.
The reaction after Camp Day was strong, but not just because of its ridiculous humour (the story is about the original story of a talking vegetable can, spoken by H.John Benjamin).
The duplicate use of the core laughing in the drama — the middle-aged actor playing a child who is just the age of the stunt — makes it impossible to go back to the past a part of the fun too.
In Ten Years Later, adults really play adults, the emotions are not so deeply rooted, imitation is also more dispersed, including improvised creations on the 1990s tracking films, such as The Hand of Pushing the Shell.
At one point, a character fell into an Apple notebook, some straight-line skating shoes, and “something else from 1991.”
Many of the core stories are the same.
Mr. Sweet has now become a novelist, but he still hasn’t forgotten Katie (Margaret Moreau).
Victor (Ken Marino) still retains the body of a man.
There is also another sinister conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Schwartz) inspired by George H.W. Bush (played by Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of this series is the introduction.
It’s interesting to see this ever-young Mr. Luther, who featured the soul patch of Matt Dillon in the movie “Single Aristotle,” and Andy in the previous “Campus Giant” now feels like a giant.
It’s a random crazy moment that might be driving the film, like the retrospect of the Seven Years of Life series, until the conclusion I think is logical: “Haraj Summer Camp: Twenty Years Later,” its final scene is to get the cast to see the premiere of the film “Haraj Summer Camp.”
Meanwhile, Amazon's Detective Gemini talks about different old-fashioned content: the Cold War Renaissance "American Spy Dream", the movie "City of the Cold", and even the Eastern wrestling image "GLOW: The Famous Women's Wrestling Alliance".
This comedy, created by Brian Gattwood and Alexander Tenga, was directed by Reese Thomas: a comedy drama set in Romania in the 1980s that tells the story of two Bulgarian officials struggling for truth, atheism and Marxism-Leninism.
The main characters - the hard-to-hard Gregor and the idealistic Ethan - are played by Florin Pearcey and Cornelius Ulrich, respectively, whose conversations are spoken by Channing Tatum (also the executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.
This is a great idea.
But it is not just an idea.
Some of them have good visual heads (the police watch chess on TV for a while, because Americans like to play football).
And there are numerous celebrity speakers – including Jenny Street, Nick Overman, Mahsara Khashbaz Ali and Colo Sevigny – who have created a great sound event.
But Detective Twins is so devoted to creating a loud and realistic propaganda comedy – a drama in which there is a killer with a Dean Reagan mask on the head – that it usually plays such a role.
The six-episode television was slightly delayed, and comedy effects were not released quickly or frequently enough.
The detective twins were more rigorously edited, with greater incitement and irony when Gregor and Ezzor repeatedly visited the U.S. embassy, because there were always two fat wolves in the embassy hall to swallow a bunch of hamburgers.

Recent interviews with reporters learned that in the Northeast region, the efficiency of steel, rail transport, ships, machinery manufacturing and other industries generally declined, and even losses.
Some experts believe that under the current situation, the new round of rejuvenation of the Northeast industry is not only related to the national economic recovery, but also will have an impact on the long-term development of China's manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, so it is urgent to adjust the transformation.
The general decline in enterprise efficiency in traditional industries and the loss of raw materials and heavy machinery equipment manufacturing industries and the serious decline in efficiency and even losses, is the first manifestation of the economic downturn in the Middle East and North East industry.
In the past, in the downturn of the economy, mainly low-end, primary products were greatly impacted, but in this economic fluctuation, the traditional high-end and low-end industrial products in the Northeast were affected.
Saddle Steel Group (Microsoft) in the previous years from the adjustment of the product structure, focus on the development of high-end boards such as container boards, steel rails, boards and civilian household appliances, however, this year these varieties have seen a significant decline in sales, especially boards sales decreased by 50% compared to the same period last year.

The Bank of England will maintain a 0.25% interest rate.
The Bank of England will later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged, with previously weak economic growth and relaxed inflation lessening hopes.
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will continue to be “weak” as it controls interest rates while strengthening household income austerity.
The bank’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decision makers decided to maintain the interest rate at 0.25% with a 6-2 vote, while a handful of members this month called for higher rates, even though weak economic growth has weakened the hike’s help.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England slashed its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and 1.6%, respectively, and warned that household income tightening will continue, while inflation will rise to 3% in the fall.
But it said interest rates will need to be raised in the coming years to curb Brexit-related inflation, while borrowing costs may need to be raised more sharply than the financial markets expect.
A large-scale economic boost policy was implemented a year ago, impacted by Brexit, and members also voted to withdraw it.
The Bank of England will announce the cancellation of its regular financing program, starting in February next year, to provide low-cost funds to banks, although the bank says the plan currently requires an additional £15 billion on the basis of £115 billion.
In the record of the interest rate decision meeting, the Bank of England said: “In MPC’s core forecast, gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the recent period as the austerity of real household income continues to suppress consumption.”
Regarding interest rates, the bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for “some tightening of monetary policy” to curb inflation, and to a “greater extent” than the markets expected.
Currently, the market is expected to see the first growth in the third quarter of next year and the second in 2020.
But the bank stressed that any raise would be “slow” and “constrained.”
The bank’s growth forecast for this year and next year is downward, compared with the forecast for May of 1.9% and 1.7% respectively.
The bankins its growth forecast of 1.8% in 2018.
The pound fell against the dollar, followed by the euro.
The pound fell 0.5 percent against the dollar to 1.31, while the euro fell 0.4 percent to 1.11.
Prior to this unchanged decision, rising price expectations were crushed by recent unoptimistic growth data. GDP grew to 0.3% in the second quarter compared to only 0.2% in the first three months.
The bank said growth in the third quarter is likely to remain at 0.3%, although it is expected to increase slightly at the end of the year.
Ordinary households are shocked by rising inflation, while wage increases are insignificant, and the Bank of England’s recent inflation report doesn’t bring them any good news, as the bank says austerity will get worse before it gets better.
Monetary policy “cannot prevent” the impact on income in the coming years, but wages are expected to recover “in a large scale” at the end of the three-year forecast.
Meanwhile, with the devaluation of the pound, the demand for British commodities rising significantly, the economy will be stimulated to offset some of the effects of low consumption.
A year before the decision was made, a shocking EU referendum dropped the pound and lowered the interest rate to 0.25% in August.
The Bank of England estimates it may take four years to fully impact prices and the UK economy.
The calls for a rate hike were not heard before the bank announced its latest interest rate ruling, as inflation has made the average household, which has long been under pressure, squeeze, while three policymakers called for a rate hike to 0.5 percent in July.
Inflation fell last month from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the Bank of England said it was expected and will rise again in the coming months.
The bank claims its target of 2% over the portion that has been entirely the final bottom line of the weak pound.
Andrew Montreux, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: “Given the recent decline in default rates, the mortgage market seems to become more competitive again as lenders strongly call for more business and look forward to making the perfect sentence for this year with a positive stance.
Such markets look favorable for those who may be about to end existing trades, as re-hypothecks (many of which are free of charge and low interest rates) are becoming more and more popular.

UK National Health Service System (NHS) opens green light on controversial HIV drugs
After a high court ruling on NHS drug funding, patients will be able to access “revolutionary” HIV prevention treatment from September.
NHS England announced that pre-exposure preventive medication (PrEP), a drug that can be taken before sexual intercourse, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk populations by about 86 percent.
It agreed to fund the trial after the Court of Appeal backed the High Court ruling last year.The ruling said that while the NHS claims that local authorities should fund the drug, the NHS is entitled to pay the PrEP fee.
The move announced on Thursday was described by NHS chief executive Simon Stevens as a “significant new intervention,” while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a “critical moment.”
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first sex health clinics to register people. More clinics will join in October, followed by full implementation across England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure preventive medication (PrEP) is a HIV drug that is taken before sexual intercourse to reduce the risk of infection with HIV.
Studies have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce the transmission of HIV in people at risk.
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means there are enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
This medication can be taken daily or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include homosexuals, bisexual men, transgender people and HIV-positive persons who have failed to receive treatment.
The clinic will determine eligible and consenting participants in the trial, including men, women, transgender persons and persons unknown whether their sexual partners are HIV-infected or receiving antiretroviral treatment.
Persons who live and are registered as general practitioners in England can also register at their local sexual health clinic.
The program will cost £10 million, and the NHS England branch has signed a contract to purchase the drugs this week after a competitive international procurement.
The trial aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is located, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr. Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and strengthen the extensive and increasingly successful HIV prevention.
This is another milestone in more than 30 years worthwhile efforts to make progress in addressing major human health challenges.”
Depola Kim, chief executive of the UK AIDS Trust (NAT), said: “This is a crucial moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target people in need and at risk, pre-exposure preventive medication offers the possibility of changing the UK’s AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, people at high risk of HIV will get a new, licensed tool through the NHS-funded trial in England, which is truly autonomous and can be implemented without consultation with sexual partners, which will improve the lives of many people.
We support this announcement.”
Ian Greene, Chief Executive Officer of Trent Higgins Trust, said: “The priority now is to ensure that the trials are launched nationwide quickly and that none of the HIV-infected falls.
Now that we have purchased PrEP trial drugs, we are prepared to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV.”
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: “After months of delays and government delays, the initial PrEP trial was popular and should come earlier.
Evidence shows how this drug can change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This test will give us a deeper and more comprehensive understanding of the benefits of PrEP.
It is important now to launch this trial nationwide as soon as possible to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us further halt the spread of HIV in society.”

High quality of life: Apply roofs and clever designs to turn the Count Palace apartment into a spacious home
Joanne Ray, a former banker who was passionate about renovation, moved from a large house on the Knights Bridge to a small apartment in the Count's Palace in 2014.
The apartment is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne-style terrace -- Joanne has not packed baggage to sell it, which is a strong proof of the new design.
“Before that, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a larger house on the Knight Bridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for a suitable house.
I saw this apartment in the Count's Palace, and its ceiling was also high.
I was very pleased to make an appointment the same day.”
Since the first visit, this 1,000-square-foot apartment has now been thoroughly renovated.
The apartment was originally a complexly arranged single room — it took a walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom — and Joanne wanted to add storage space and ceiling to make the most of the adequate ceiling height.
“I want high ceilings, big windows, enough light.
That is my request,” she said.
To do this, she hired Elvan Azadi from the Duck & Shed Architecture and Design Studio (Noding Hill) to use this 12.5-foot ceiling to carefully build a home, which is not only a development project but also where Joanne lives.
The height of the ceiling was not enough to add two up and down spaces, so the architectural challenge was to create a ceiling high enough for people to stand.
Elvan must play the creative way to solve this problem.
“The steel structure is quite complex,” he explains.
"We have to arrange the space so that it is displayed up and down, and there is no need to shoulder the bow.
It’s not just as simple as building a simple platform, but also starting these steels to make them at the right height to function.”
Through this arrangement, Elvan was able to get two whole-height rooms in the space — which could add many fun elements.
The ceiling features vintage bronze windows of the Retrouvius brand and offers a glimpse over the fascinating living area.
Gold furniture with mirrors, silver pieces of furniture and Serge Mouille antique lighting lay the overall style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing atmosphere, space and light.
Installing a mirror at both ends of a short corridor can make it look longer.
A kitchen with a mirror is like a window that leads to another room.
At the entrance, a small grille with mirrors provided Joanne with storage space for the storage of tableware and glass utensils.
The beautiful living room has a fascinating sense of space, which allows the kitchen to be wrapped up when the kitchen is not in use.
Folding kitchen is not new.
But the uniqueness of this folding kitchen lies in a garage-style lift door.
“This involves knowledge in some engineering fields,” Elvan explains about the MDF doors that are reinforced by steel.
“This is based on the principle of balance, so it’s easy to slip when you push the door.”
Thanks to the clever use of space and treasures, Joanne gets an additional 16 square meters, an additional bedroom and an improved layout.
“Ultimately, what you sell is the area of the house – or your property valuation is based on the area of the house,” Elvan says.
“Basically, the real estate agent goes into the room and calculates according to the size of the floor.”
They will be able to increase landing space while using high-quality materials, thus bringing a sense of luxury to the space.
Elvan said, “The materials are personally selected and therefore help to create emotional bonds at home.”
“You won’t love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they don’t shake your heart.”
It turns out that with a good design as well as adding additional space, the standard apartment can shake and make you astonish.
In fact, you might choose to stay like Joanne.

Two brothers play $500 million real estate empire fighting the war
Forty years after their Italian family founded a dynasty, the two brothers fought a war for one of Victoria’s largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million.
Colin De Lutis, former director and developer of the Carlton Football Club, lived in a luxury house in the Tucara district, three rooms away from where his brother Paul lived. The latter sued him to the Supreme Court over the separation of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has been hoping to separate from his family business since 2014, but the brothers have argued heavily about the asset division in the Supreme Court.
The brothers and their mother together own 38 properties worth over $500 million, which have been accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in Colinwood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually expanded to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company was sold for $85 million.
Later that money was invested in real estate.At present, the Deerotis family’s asset portfolio includes city office buildings, Brunswick and Sorrento development projects, Gold Coast and Breslau apartments, and suburban shopping centers.
Under an agreement with his late father, Colin, whom his brother Paul referred to as the “main driver and dominant figure” of the Deerutis family, owns about two-thirds of the company’s assets, compared to Paul’s about one-third.
The documents submitted to the court said that after settlement, Colin’s assets were worth $3.16 billion, while Paul’s assets were worth $1.76 billion.
Paul argues that the separation of real estate and cash proves to be the cornerstone of the negotiations.
“Colin’s proposal for the division of property left him the best wealth I think,” he wrote in a first court oath in 2015.
On Friday, the Supreme Court held a hearing for the first time after several failed mediations.
Now, the two brothers are still fighting for control of the existing business, and Paul says Colin has kicked him out of office.
Colin denies this and accuses Paul of being inadequate in managing certain properties.
In an early oath Colin submitted, he said he hoped to resolve the dispute.
“My Italian tradition determines that family is the most important option.My Italian descent determines that family is the most important,” he writes.
The costs of the cases are rising, with hundreds of pages of vows, emails, and company reports submitted by companies such as Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, top law firms such as Allan Myers, QC, and senior lawyers employed by both sides.
Ms. Ruthis and her deceased husband, Louis, were both Italian immigrants. They started running public food and cooking stores in the late 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s.
They used mortgages to buy the Colinwood property, where Colin opened his family’s first jeans shop.
Colin said, “I was in high school at three,” where he founded Westco, “at that time Paul was very young (about 10 years old).”
Anna de Ruthis said she and Louise, who died in 2012, hoped to pass the property peacefully to her son.
"Louis said to me often that he never wanted the brothers to eventually come to court," she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer members of the Derritis Group, and Colin said Mark paid him $10 million when he left the company and $26 million to Luke.
Paul said Luke and Mark both “expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of their property division.”
According to a 2015 biography by television star Eddie McGuire, Colin has remained low-level despite being a member of the board of the former AFL club.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
But only Colin responded by texting.He said, since the case has been submitted to the court, “I really can’t say too much.”
“My brother Paul chose to prosecute me and bring our family affairs to court, which is very, very sad,” he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to meet his brother’s demands.
He said: “Our father doesn’t want to see Paul and me finally have a dispute like this,” adding that he “still has hope for a settlement.”
On Friday, that hope seemed to be broken.
“Our issue will be settled through courts in the near future,” Colin wrote.

Trump’s new sheriff plans to limit presidential media time
Others have tried, but all ended in failure.
John F. Kelly could really do it.
If that is true, he is the first.
According to Politico, the new White House sheriff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump — including news media reports — to ensure the big boss is more smooth.
Here is a quote from journalist Josh Dawsi:
“When the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, began his first day working to gather high-ranking officials for discussions, he pointed out that he was addressing a major issue of President Trump’s entry into the White House: the flow of bad information to the president’s hands.”
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information helps the president make better decisions, so the information needs to go through his hand—whether in writing or in a brief.
Kelly’s diagnosis looks similar, but others have also tried to domesticate it by monitoring Trump’s media time, but ended up failing.
President Trump’s television addiction has been around for a long time—now at the White House, his habit of watching television is still deepening.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Naberger told Politico: “It would be very beneficial for candidate Trump to be frustrated with unfair reporting, then let him know that he has also received positive reporting from credible channels.
Politico’s Tarah Palmery wrote at the time, “According to the experience of six former campaign officials, the focus of controlling Trump’s tweeting habits is on ensuring that some praise has always been included in the media messages he receives personally.”
It is absolutely no problem.
But it’s ridiculous that Trump’s Twitter habit was once “controlled.”
Per these campaign officials know something we don’t know—that without their intervention, Trump’s Twitter would be even more flaming.
We may never know those tweets that Trump did not send.
If his staff managed to save him from the fire, even a few times, their efforts were worth it.
But no one can stop Trump from causing controversy.
Part of the problem is that in a White House made up of competing groups, people are promoting their worldview by providing Trump with potentially reliable and potentially unreliable information.
Politico — all about the story — in May that consultants had a hobby of providing strategically questionable information to the president.
This is an example described by journalist Sean Goodmancher:
“The current and former Trump officials said Trump’s reaction to negative news clips like volcanic eruptions, especially those with destructive information leaks, he would crazyly want to find out their source.
At the end of February, someone maliciously copied an article on the website GotNews.com of cyberbullying activist Charles C. Johnson to the president, accusing Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the “source of massive information leaks” at the White House, when Trump was acting like that.
Even if Johnson has been permanently blocked on Twitter for harassment, no concrete evidence has been provided, and he has exploded a lot of erroneous quality controls, which he later publicly denied.
Trump read the article and began asking officials about Walsch’s situation.”
Goodmancher also said then Chief of Staff Reynes Pribas and White House Secretary Robert Porter "tried to establish a system to manage and record the documents Trump received."
And the result?
Kelly intends to do the same thing in three months.
Maybe he can prove himself to be a more efficient manager than Pripas, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his assistants are still competing with each other for influence.
These eternal influences make Kelly’s task more difficult.
Small town tourism: how to get drunk
The potential of Zhejiang’s small towns is gradually being awakened.
Today, these small towns have become important destinations for Zhejiang tourists to appreciate Zhejiang mountain water, read Zhejiang culture, and feel Zhejiang rural sorrow, and will also provide important assistance to our province's efforts to create China's most beautiful tourist destination.

In recent years, with the promotion of tourism construction throughout our province, the potential of Zhejiang town has been gradually awakened.
In 2016, the General Office of the provincial government officially issued the "Zhejiang Province Tourism City Creation Implementation Measures", and proposed that through a period of about 5 years, the province will accept the name of 100 people's style, beautiful ecological environment, and rich tourism industry.

Housing customers negotiate the canyon and return to "Rich Street"
Some of the wealthiest owners in the West Midlands region have once again argued with determined homeowners who have negotiated a government-pulled canyon to demand the return of land outside the mansion.
Guests parked their 20 trailers on an empty area outside the bustling Solihall Street, which is dubbed the "Rich Street."
Housing passengers, holding horses, babies, and leading the housing squad, returned again after being driven out in May, and the "Guard River" excavated by the municipality did not stop them from entering.
The smooth team found that there was a gap in the defense line, and despite there being no road barrier set to pass, their vehicles were squeezed through that gap.
Angry residents criticized the Solihull Council, calling it “bad in dealing with the issue.”
One resident who didn’t want to be named said, “They came there on Monday night, before they came to Bentley Street, throwing stones at passers.
The committee should be ashamed of their actions, for they are simply useless in dealing with the matter.
The passengers came here in May and were then driven away, and now they are back.
A lot came last night, maybe more today.”
She added: “The Birmingham City Council knows how to handle it in a way that protects its parks by imposing a long-term ban.
I live on Streetbrook, and I’m not willing to continue paying municipal taxes if Parliament can’t stop it.
A local resident who refused to disclose his name said: "It's so ridiculous, we just saw the last batch of passengers go away, but it's easy for another to destroy."
The number increased again, and some even saw horses eating grass on the lawn of the park.”
A spokeswoman for the Soleil Committee said: “We know that someone has been unlicensed to camp on an empty plot of Soleil Brook Street, and now we are working with Soleil police and taking the necessary legal action to get them away as soon as possible.
To support our collection of evidence, it is very important that as many local residents as possible report any anti-social or criminal behavior to the police by calling 101.
This helps us to make an overview of the case when submitting it to the court for examination.”

Italy takes a tough stance on NGO migrants rescue boats
Italy has warned non-governmental organizations operating migrant rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue their rescue operations unless they sign the new operations code.
In an interview with Turin Daily News, Interior Minister Marco Minniti said: “It’s hard to see what they think will happen if NGOs don’t sign the new code of conduct.”
The day before Minetti issued the warning, Italian officials detained him on suspicion that the crew on a boat of the German aid organization Youth Rescue actually conspired for human traffickers to assist with illegal immigration.
The aid group operated for only a year and declined to comment on the specific charges against Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartuzio.
The organization said in a statement on social media, “To us, saving lives is now and will continue to be the most important thing, so we regret not being able to operate in the rescue zone at the moment.”
“After we have collected all the information, we can only evaluate all the allegations and situations.”
Italian officials have been monitoring the youth rescue ship Iuventa since October.
Its crew members are suspected of carrying migrants transported directly from small boats by human traffickers and allowing smugglers to rush away and reuse the ship.
According to the prosecutor’s documents, at least one such encounter is alleged to have taken place at sea 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast.
Its crew is suspected of openly disregarding the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the region for humanitarian enthusiasm rather than for any other motive.
According to the Code of Conduct, ships such as Juventa clearly require an Italian police officer to oversee their activities on board.
Currently, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the Code of Conduct: Save the Children, the Migrant Maritime Assistance Centre based in Malta, and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it believes the new regulations are unnecessary but acceptable, as they will not bring any “significant changes and obstacles” to its rescue operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Minetti said the number of migrants arriving in Italy had dropped sharply in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guard and joint local mayors had already seen results.
The minister said: “Over the last few days, we have begun to see dawn at the end of the tunnel.
He announced plans for in-depth talks this month: discussing economic development with Libyan mayors, and discussing with Chad, Niger and Mali how to reduce the number of migrants who want to leave these countries to Europe.

Beijing's "high school disregard" new initiative: ten thousand students of Northern Chemical Industry will be admitted to Chongqing new campus

Michelle Carter Sentenced to Suicide for SMS Messaging to Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two and a half years for committing suicide by texting and telephoning her boyfriend.
The 20-year-old Michelle Carter will be sentenced to 15 months in prison, after which it can be converted to a suspended sentence.
Carter was convicted in June of unintentional non-premeditated murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy’s father at the hearing on Thursday said: “My family is saddened.
My son is my best friend.”
While awaiting the appeal, Carter was allowed to remain in personal freedom.
She faces up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers believe she and Mr. Roy are both mentally ill.
At the time of the verdict, Carter stood up, wearing red pants and rice shirts, his hands tight, his eyes tearful, his eyes downward.
“Her actions killed Conrad Roy,” the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended her life in order to live better.
She has no responsibility,” the prosecutor said.
“She has no regrets.”
But Carter’s lawyer said it was “a terrible consequence and she felt very sorry.”
However, Judge Lawrence Moniz said he did not find that her “age or maturity, or even her mental illness, would have any significant impact on her behavior.”
A prosecutor read a statement from Roy’s mother, Lynn Roy, that she said, “I don’t have a day that I don’t grieve about losing my beloved son.”
I want him to be proud of me and everything I’ve done, and I’m trying to stand with his sisters in all my suffering, which will accompany us forever,” the statement said.
Mr. Roy’s sister, Camdy Roy, testified that she was “stunned” to realize she could never attend her brother’s wedding or become his child’s aunt.
“The loss of someone who has been with me since I was born is a pain, and the rest of my life will be with that pain,” she said.
The case appears to set a legal precedent, as the laws of Massachusetts do not stipulate that others are guilty of committing suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found dead from carbon monoxide poisoning in his car; in that year, Carter was 17.
Carter’s text message revealed that the case caused national concern after she accused him of committing suicide.
“There are many ways to hang, jump, and stain yourself,” she said in a few text messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was on vacation with his family.
In the period before his suicide, she wrote, “You need to do this, Conrad,” and “All you have to do is turn on the generator and then you get freedom and happiness.”
Judge Moniz said Carter drew attention through Mr. Roy’s death and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are legal divergences in this case.
Amanda Knox was one of the few defenders, who was accused of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007 and was declared innocent two years later.
Ms. Nox, 30, said in a column in the Los Angeles Times: “Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not imprisonment.”
Zhang Zhang is destined to be a controversial film artist, and since he began to shoot the first film "Red Highway", he has been leading the Chinese film trend, also harvested a lot of controversy.

Although the field in the Olympics is the gold medal, the fielder gets the sky, but the field name will be lower than the puzzle.
Automotive manufacturers face shock, Audi will refurbish up to 850,000 diesel vehicles
The day before Audi announced the upgrade, BMW said it would provide software upgrades to more than 350,000 cars.
BMW’s chairman said BMW believes “there are more smart choices than restrictions on driving,” meaning that major European cities – including Munich, where BMW’s headquarters is located – are considering banning or limiting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will refurbish 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
No company has claimed the move to be a recall.
European automakers are pushing for diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and may cause asthma.
The cost of automakers installing equipment to offset diesel car exhaust emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to keep diesel cars competitive in price.
With German automakers facing censorship, the government led by Prime Minister Angela Merkel has also been accused of giving too much to these powerful automakers and ignoring the signs of the problem.
The automotive companies are trying to avoid repeating Volkswagen’s equation of masking its use of so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions during car testing to comply with regulations and returning to normal driving conditions.
Several Volkswagen executives have been charged in the United States, while other executives are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine research and development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager Zacero Giovani Pamo, who is an Italian, is not protected by extradition and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen, where the German government accused Audi of installing systems to escape European emissions demands, expanding its previous scope to the United States.
Audi’s investigation could have a significant impact on Volkswagen: luxury car makers account for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen’s profits.
A film from preparation to premiere, lasting one or two years or even years, can be called empty.
The animated film "Big Fish Seals" has just announced that it will be released on July 8, this film has been 12 years from the preparation to the premiere!
The original author of "Big Fish Fish" Lianglong, 21 years old from the University of Qingdao thermal energy power industry, with a good friend Zhang Spring founded the other side of the sky, in 2008 gained the joint venture capital of millions of dollars, launched the animated film virgin "Big Fish Fish Fish".
The film has won numerous awards at home and abroad in the creative sampling phase, and is also recognised by the French Pompeii Contemporary Art Centre and praised as "one of the most outstanding works of art".
Due to the six years from creation to production, the film was called "God Dome" by millions of fans who were looking forward to the premiere.
"Big Fish" tells a fantastic story belonging to the Chinese people.With the release of this archival trailer, it brings new expectations for all the audience.
Liang said: "these 12 years only did this thing, now it has turned from a dream to reality, I am both nervous and excited."
Zhang said: "Always thinking of using one fifth of someone else's budget, to make the same picture effect as others, the team will be crazy by me."
Dongguan, the "world factory" that used to rely on the processing and large numbers of common workers, is turning its eyes on those high-level talents who can lead the city to reposition.
Recently, the high-level talents event held by the Dongguan municipal government, the first financial reporter saw that some of the local quite powerful enterprises participated in talents talks.
On the orange red background wall painted with especially bright advertisements, they each marked an unfathomable price.
Therefore, the China Television Drama Production Industry Association decided to unite the national television drama production industry and sign a convention on self-discipline.
Provence Lavender Threatened by Climate Change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but now there is bad news that it is being threatened by climate change.
Lavender is declining due to ongoing droughts and the appearance of insects carrying the virus, causing headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute for Agricultural Studies (CRIEPPAM) in Provence, said: “Lavan grass in Provence is facing a huge threat as the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, with a significant reduction in rainfall in spring and heavy rainfall in autumn.
This will affect the life cycle of lavender.
There is also an individual smaller fox, a fox that can spread tiny bacteria, in very dry weather, they will appear in large quantities.
The main thing is that its quantity is huge.
In addition to attracting holidaymakers, lavender oil is also sought after by the perfume and cosmetics industry.
Eric Chase said: “Unlike plants that can grow many large flowers, with very long grapes, we have problems with smaller individuals with poor development, lack or weakness.
So our essential oil content is less.”
The solutions being studied include adopting better irrigation techniques and slowing the evaporation of soil moisture, spraying protective mixtures of clay and water onto plants, and developing more dry-resistant varieties.
Compared to the science fiction elements in the film, the two protagonists argue that the story in the film is more attractive to them.
On the afternoon of September 5, the Washington Post reporter, interviewed several prominent figures from the phonographic community, and two phonographic performers, and surprisingly, they remained silent.
One is the Berlin filmmaker, one is the rising youth actor, and the psychic crime is also Liuvan and Liu Yi Feng's first partner.
Mexico in danger, journalist killed
The entire staff of the Riodoce weekly usually gathered on Wednesday to recall their reporting plans on the riots in Sinalo, which were sparked by criminal organizations, corrupt officials, and endless drug wars.
But today, the shadow of tragedy overwhelms them, and they gather together to discuss security issues.
They are told to change their daily habits, which is important.
Two senior journalists discussed which one would feel safer: whether to take their children to the office (which had been attacked by a grenade in 2009) or leave them at home.
The security experts wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: enemy, neutral, and ally.
They had the journalists list their names under each column—no evidence needed, observation and intuition were enough.
The suspected drug dealers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on the government’s list, or cartels, have put Mexico’s reporting work at risk.
Violence has never ceased, the bodies are scattered across the country, including an increasing number of journalists: according to the Commission for the Protection of Journalists records, at least 25 journalists have been killed since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists have been protected by the federal authorities following attacks and threats; and so far this year, at least seven journalists have been killed in seven states.
The last one to die was their editor and source of inspiration, and also the co-founder of Riodoce, Javier Valdiz Cardenas.
Valdiz has written many books about drug violence, and in one of them he wrote: “The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist.”
It was deeply felt that he had left, though he was everywhere — a huge photo hanging in front of the Riodoce office building, with Valdiz lifting the middle finger with the adjective “Justice”; the t-shirts worn by the two 30-year-old journalists Aaron Ivar and Miriam Ramirez also showed his smile, with his glasses or his iconic Panama hat.
The seminars were held less than two months after his death, with journalists discussing their common trauma, nightmares, insomnia and suspicion.
While a special federal prosecutor’s office was set up in 2010 to handle journalists’ cases, the office prosecuted only two people, according to the Commission for the Protection of Journalists’ Records.
Most of the thousands of criminal cases each year involve drug trafficking and organized crime, so it is rarely possible to bring the murderers of journalists to justice.
In Riodoce, they insist on reporting the violence in Sinalo, even though their hearts have been broken, even though the land has been splintered.
Ivar said there was no information about the killer, no justice, and there was no use in holding a security conference.
He said: “It’s stupid to waste time attending such workshops.
As long as we don’t know why, you don’t trust anyone.”
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left Riodoce’s office in the capital, Culiacan.
His red Toyota Carola was only opened in a few blocks and stopped by two men; they forced him out of the car and fired 12 guns, speculated because of the name of the newspaper — translated as The Twelve Rivers.
The bandit drove his car away and crashed it nearby.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Left behind his wife and two adult children.
Curtis has four rumors.
But on the subject of Valdiz, there is actually nothing but silence.
Since Guzman was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinalo has become the country’s bloodiest battlefield, crazyly slaughtered by hostile forces.
Every day, one or more people are shot in the streets of Sinaloa, and the cemetery is filled with poison and magnificent two-layer tombs, which are commonplace.
Temporarily forgotten about the state of “peace” was when only one cartel controlled this coastal state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even though Valdiz was deeply aware of the dangers of the work, Riodoce’s 60-year-old co-founder and director, Ismail Bohoki, was guilty of failing to protect his friend.
He believes two mistakes caused this tragedy.
The first, published in February, was an interview with Damaso Lopez, who led a cartel group fighting with several of Guzman’s sons.
The report may have angered the sons; the newspapers were purchased by suspected gang members as soon as they arrived.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdiz to leave Mexico for safety considerations after another newspaper the same story was confiscated.
Valdiz was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death had a significant impact on the violence against journalists in Mexico.
His spirit has survived, and his friends and colleagues believe he has always been with us.
He was also a senior reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to found Riodoce and sold a $50 stake.
Bohoki said that in Sinaloa, “it is impossible for the journalism to be on the foot without dealing with the drug issue.”
Over time, the newspaper gained a good reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising also increased.
Journalists like to be able to publish direct-hit investigative reports without worrying about censorship, and readers also like newspapers to publish stories that others do not dare to report.
Fifty years later, Riodoce won the Latin American Press Prize.
The same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded Valdez the International Press Freedom Award in recognition of his courage to pursue the most authentic Mexican drug report.
He also confessed he was afraid.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the prize, he said, “I want to continue to live.”
Later in late October, he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV that “in Sinalo, drug trafficking is a way of life.
You have to take the task on your shoulder as a journalist—either you do it, or you do it as if you were deaf.
I don’t want to be asked, “What did you do in the face of so many deaths... Why don’t you speak out about what’s happening?”
All the employees of Riodoce were missing Valdiz, missing him to curse like a port worker, missing the friend who never regretted his embrace and advice, missing the teacher who knew how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
I often go to the El Guayabo bar on the other side of the office and always sit at the same table.
Now, they’ll ask: Was it his daily habits that caused his fall?
His death also forced them to think about how to work and live well.
“They don’t like you bothering their women and children, they don’t like you influencing their legitimate companies and the secret airports used to transport drugs.”
These things have crossed their bottom lines.”
As a result, even at the safest times, a high level of self-censorship and self-protection isined.
Believe in your intuition.
If you smell dangerous breath, move away.
The Riodoce editor, Andreas Verraril, said the problem is that “the breath is a feeling that is being deceived... and then something like Havel happens.”
He and others say the previous rules no longer apply to Sinalo—just as they no longer apply to Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Gérard, and other states, where the smuggling routes are profitable, and the institutions are small, government officials are corrupt, and smoke gas.
The situation is constantly changing.
Suddenly, cell phones were banned from the rooms where Riodoce employees attended security training; a few days ago, spyware allegedly sold only to the government had already been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two policemen ride cold in the shade of trees, hiding from the heat of 104 degrees (40 degrees Celsius).
They were sent by the state government to protect Riodoce’s offices in a four-story building in the middle-class district of Culiacan.
Some reporters joked and joked that they didn’t know if the police were only 50% of what the governor said.
Journalists have been in the mountains for months, where the drug trafficking group is under the actual control.
Riodoce three major events this week.
Among them is the murder of the brother of the great former boxer of Sinaloa, Jurio Cezar Chavez.
The governor’s home government funds are disclosed.
As well as the kidnapping in a expensive restaurant in Culiacan, which is just a quarter away from the prosecutor’s office.
Officials don’t publish information about the abductions and the abduction process, so writing about what the city knows is careful: that’s where the restaurant is loved by both drug dealers and officials.
A reporter learned from public archives that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician from the ruling Revolutionary System Party (PRI), which dominated almost every political class throughout the previous era.
Recently, several revolutionary system governors have been accused of corruption in several highly valued cases.
Verraril asked reporters to write down what had happened on the scene before the incident, including the fact that a son of the Mexican drug giant, the No. 1, escaped a military assault.
If a few months ago, readers would look at Valdiz’s columns to find the most powerful information about the abduction.
The 46-year-old Verrier, who was called “thin” because of his thin body, said: “We knew what had happened before.
Now all our information sources communication channels are shut down.
Valdiz’s office is now being used to store labels and stickers protesting the killing of journalists as employees become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The next morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed a sign and went out of the room to the local prosecutor’s office for a parade associated with another journalist.
El Salvador Adame disappeared in western Michigan three days after Valdez was killed.
Officially, a burned body was found, and according to DNA tests, this is his body.
Around the country, journalists have become more straightforward, organizing protests, painting the words “save the media” on the sidewalks and buildings.
On the same day, Boehovey was not in Washington, where he was working to bring justice to the Valdez case and seek international support.
The day after Valdez was killed, in a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa, Ramirez accused the official of spying on reporters’ information and killed them because they told the facts.
Given that her anger had affected her objectivity, she also demanded to resign from a post reporting on government affairs.
Valdiz has repeatedly reiterated that Mexican journalists are “enveloped” by organized crime, co-pollutionist government officials and indifferent societies.
In his previous book, “Drug Journalism,” he wrote that journalists are not only harassed by drug trafficking groups, but are also on the list of politicians and security forces who are associated with organized crime.
Media surveillance group Articulo 19 blamed police and public officials for more than half of journalists’ attacks last year.
Ramirez said, “In Mexico, they let you die to keep your mouth silent.”
Obviously, these murders are frightening.
No one forgets that six years ago, the brother Mary Elizabeth Masias died on the border north of Tamoulipas.
Next to her body was a signature allegedly signed by Zetas Cartel: “I came for my report.”
Her head was cut off and a computer keyboard and headphones were placed next to her.
After Miroslava Brech was killed in March, several newspapers were closed, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others are still going on, the directors of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo were killed in 2014, but they are still going on.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez published a first edition of a public news conversation about the drug cartel, titled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists fled their homelands or even left the country.
It is a difficult choice.
They find it difficult to find work in exile, and they still need to be careful and alert to danger on the streets.
Sometimes they are arrested, and it is said that in 2015 photographer Ruben Espinosa was killed in a Mexican city with four women three months after escaping Veracruz.
For those who continue to work behind the scenes, this is a daily step of high-risk decision making.
Ivar once wanted to be a poet, and he admitted reports of drug trafficking scared him.
He said, “Mexico is becoming hell, so I became a journalist.”
Last Friday at midnight, the latest edition of the newspaper had been printed, and Riodoce’s editors were sitting on the hallway outside the office drinking beer, and suddenly their phones were ringing.
A series of gunfire between gangs and security forces near the beach resort city of Massachusetts has confirmed the deaths of 19 people.
The fighting is also escalating, as a series of cartel information predicts found in the area.
They uploaded the news to Riodoce’s website on their phones along the way.
The headline had to be changed the next day.
The flute sounded nearby – another live-and-death shooting in the area.
Bohoki glanced at the police guard standing there, to see if they were alert.
If they were a little scared, then they didn’t show up either.
The founder of the newspaper was dead, and in his large portrait, his middle finger pointed to the whole of Sinalo where the whole of Riodoce’s staff followed in his footsteps.
Boogie said, “How can you even want to shut it down? the same day that Havel was killed, the interns asked me to send her out on the street to report.”
China's self-driving tourism market in 2020 will reach trillion dollars
In the context of consumption escalation and the prevalence of free movement, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and loved by an increasing number of consumers.
But at the same time, the self-driving travel market, which is expected to break the trillion scale, also faces a double challenge.
In the large context of consumption upgrading and the prevalence of free trade, self-driving is encouraged by national policies and loved by an increasing number of consumers.
But at the same time, the trillion-sized self-driving tour market is also facing a double challenge, on the one hand, the development of the self-driving tour industry and market demand are not proportionate, self-driving tour clubs and travel agencies such as self-driving tour organizers are facing a small profit; on the other hand, self-driving tour faces infrastructure and services are also in the initial stage.
accounting for 60% of the total domestic tourism population, the market size is expected to break the trillion
In 2016, 44,4 billion people visited domestic tourism throughout the year, self-driving tourism accounted for about 60% of the total domestic tourism population, and by 2020 the self-driving tourism market is expected to break the trillion.
According to the statistics of the China Tourism Association on the number of self-driving travelers, in the past five years, the number of travelers has continued to grow, and the number of travelers accounts for the proportion of domestic tourists is stable in more than half.
At the same time, regional and national levels have shown greater attention and support to the emerging area of self-driving, with intensive policy regulations related to self-driving, touring cars and camping tourism introduced from 2016 to 2017.
In July 2017, the National Tourism Bureau, the National Sports General Administration and eight other departments jointly issued the "Automotive Self-Driving Camp Development Plan"; in the same month, the 14 departments of the Development and Reform Commission, the Ministry of Finance and others jointly issued the "Qualitative Upgrading Action Plan for promoting rural tourism development" (2017), self-driving was highlighted.
The introduction of policies provides opportunities and policy guidance for domestic self-driving development.
Self-driving club profitability is small, the complete industrial chain is key
Although the domestic self-driving travel market has huge potential and the national policy is actively guided, the self-driving travel industry is still in the initial stage.
According to the 2016-2017 China self-driving travel annual development report, domestic self-driving clubs, auto clubs, car friends' associations and so on reach thousands, but the proportion of tourists self-arranged self-driving travel accounts for the majority, participating in car friends' associations, self-driving clubs and other institutions account for only about 15% of tourists.
At the same time, online travel companies and traditional travel agencies that independently develop self-driving travel products are also countless, and many online travel platforms sell only self-driving travel products offered by some suppliers, and some self-driving travel clubs are also important suppliers.
From the organization of self-driving activities, it covers "eating, living, traveling, hiking, shopping, entertaining" many aspects, the degree of fragmentation is high, the upstream supply chain is heavy, and the consumer consumption is random.
Beijing road car club founder and chief executive officer Li Chongzhi believes that the self-driving tour club is essentially similar to the travel agency, the early main profit model is mainly based on offline activities, the core point is self-driving tour products and leadership services.
But now the homologation of line products within the field of self-driving is serious, the level of leadership service is uneven, and self-driving clubs are facing the need for a new transformation.
It can be seen that self-driving itself is not an independent industry, but its self-driving characteristics form a cross-geographic, industry ecosystem, and the formation of a complete industrial chain is very important.
Experts point out that in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important consumption element.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving travel industry, the experience characteristics should be enhanced, the "self-driving travel +" theme and the IP of self-driving travel products should be developed.
Landscapes are not just roads, car campgrounds should not just meet accommodation
In the face of the rise of self-driving, the basic supporting development of self-driving is also relatively primary.
Li Chongjiang pointed out that the tourism landscape is not only a road, but also needs to integrate the elements of transport and tourism, but the road repair and tourism itself are two departments to be responsible, the transportation sector to increase the tourism elements, but also stop in the construction of toilets, consultancy centers, advertising bars and other facilities, and the combination with tourism is not high.
Compared to the well-known self-driving route "America's 66 Road", the construction experience is worth taking.
Landscape design is no longer the most direct and fast route between the departure to the destination, but in accordance with the design concept of "experience driving pleasure", for self-driving tourists to provide the best enjoyment of appreciating the beauty along the way; the landscape can connect point-shaped and face-shaped tourist landscape, both preserve the historical value and cultural value of ecotourism resources along the way, and also hold various thematic activities to enhance the participation and leisure experience of tourists, to create economic benefits for the local tourism industry.
In addition to landscape trails, the campground is also an important support facility for self-driving.
But among the self-driving tourists learned by the New York Times, there are few consumers who choose to stay in the camp.
They believe that many camps are predisposed to infrastructure, and can only meet the needs of eating and living, not high grade, single product, and can not meet the needs of self-driving, which contains many elements.
There are people in the industry who are reluctant to disclose the name, saying that in the previous years, many of the enterprises in the camp were to take the land, and after the land, the supporting infrastructure construction and services of the latter period did not keep up, and many of the business conditions were losses, and without the subsequent funding injection, it was difficult to do some corresponding supporting products.
Consumer groups
According to the data released by the China Tourism Vessel Association in 2017, in terms of age, the self-driving group is concentrated in 21-40 years of age, of which 31-40 years are predominantly, this part of the population has a certain economic basis, and the demand for personalized tourism is higher, and more for family and children travel customers.
According to the accommodation survey, self-driving tourists relatively prefer non-standard accommodation.
In terms of type of self-driving, surrounding self-driving is the main type of self-driving, accounting for 84.32%.
Exit self-driving is the desire of many people, but the proportion is smaller.
At the same time, with the rise of consumer demand, in the past, tourists who liked to drive "tourist attractions" began to change the idea, no longer in the course of self-driving "shoot up and sleep in the car", but more attention to the experience and process of travel.
Dinosaurs use disguise to escape enemies.
At first glance, it looks awful, but it looks like a statue.
Researchers have published the first findings about the unbelievable rhinos-sized bio-fossil discovered by Canadian miners, pointing out that the fossil is well preserved, so experts call it "the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world."
This fossil is very well preserved and can even determine the color of its scaly skin as red brown.
Reports in the journal Contemporary Biology described it as “the most perfectly preserved armored dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world.”
The fossil is a newly discovered species of coniferous dragon that lived in the middle of the White Age between 1.1 billion and 1.2 billion years ago.
Its state of preservation was extremely good and shocked the researchers, who described it as “truly stunning.”
According to National Geographic, the herb dinosaur fossil is the best preserved dinosaur fossil ever found.
On March 21, 2011, the fossil was discovered by Shawn Funk during the mining of the Millennium Mine of Sinclair near McMurrayburg, northern Alberta, Canada.
At that point he stumbled upon something that seemed to be less than the rocks around him, and he decided to look closely.
The fossils he found were then sent to the Royal Terrier Museum of Ancient Biology in Canada.
It took scientists six years to reveal the real face of the beast hidden inside the 2,500 pounds (1100 kilograms) of soil.
After such hard work, the final results can now be announced.
“If you look at it, you’ll almost believe it’s asleep,” said Caleb Brown, a scientist and first author at the Royal Terrier Museum.
“It will be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens in the history of science – the Mona Lisa in the dinosaur world.”
By studying their skin, the researchers found that the herbicide, while wearing armor, like a walking tank, could be a major threat from the meat-eating dinosaurs.
The armed dinosaurs used red-and-white disguises to hide predators, and used the hiding technique known as “anti-shadowing,” which is also used by many modern animals.
Experts say that in this way, it is better integrated with its surroundings, thus avoiding the enemy, suggesting it is preyed by larger dinosaurs.
This 1.1 billion-year-old creature, belonging to the family of dragons, was first headlined in May and is currently on display at the Royal Terrier Museum of Ancient Biology.
Mark Mitchell, one of the team’s museum technicians, spent 7,000 hours carefully uncovering the veil of the beast, and the researchers now study it and named it “Borealopelta markmitchelli.”
The samples were very well preserved, allowing Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to record the patterns and shapes of his scales and armor.
They discovered the “anti-shadowing” technique, a common way of defense in the animal world, which means that the creature’s back is darker in color than its side.
Although "anti-shadowing" is common, the findings are surprising, as the dinosaurs are far larger than existing animals that use anti-shadowing.
The dinosaur faces the pressure of being hunted by the meat-eating dinosaur, thus evolving in a favorable direction, allowing it to hide in the fence as a means of survival.
However, most of the existing anti-shadow animals, such as deer, zebras, or eagles, are as small and fragile as prey, suggesting that the creature is facing real survival pressures.
“The crazy prey suffered by large heavy armored dinosaurs shows how dangerous the Carnivorous dinosaurs were,” Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in its scales also suggested that the dinosaur’s skin was red brown.
Scientists are continuing to study the life clues of the organism, including the stomach content it retains to find out what the final food is to eat.
They believe that the dinosaurs fell into the river when they died, then flooded into the ocean and eventually sunk into the ocean floor in a back-down way.
At the time, Alberta’s climate was as warm as the climate in southern Florida today, with rivers and oceans likely deeper inland than they are now.
Brown said: “This nodule is truly stunning, because it is completely covered with the preserved scaly skin and, to date, is preserved in dimensional space, thus preserving its original shape.”
“Therefore, the form of the species now is almost the same as that of the White Age.
You don’t have to rebuild it with too much imagination; if you look at it, you almost believe it’s asleep.”
The White Age was the period when two-legged big beast-footed dinosaurs roamed the earth.
Although the Dragon King is the king of the dinosaurs, it appeared only millions of years after the Peggy Dinosaurs.
These include the high-tinned dragon, a giant beast weighing up to 6 tons and 38 feet (11,5 meters) long.
The latest study appears in the journal Contemporary Biology and scientists believe that the dragon was thrown into the ocean after his death and then formed a mummy in the mud.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink excavated the creature in a millennium mine near McMurrayburg, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the most perfectly preserved armored dinosaur in the world, with the skin and armor in the area from the nose to the buttocks complete.
This biological average is about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighs up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kilograms).
It has two 20-inch long spikes that stand out from the shoulder.
The researchers believe that the herbaceous dinosaur was active in the current western region of Canada, after being flooded by rivers in the ocean.
However, this dinosaur is buried beneath the sea so that its armor is fully preserved.
The fossil remains of this special sample are very well preserved, so that the remaining skin still covers the unshakable debris on the dinosaur skull.
As Michael Greshko writes in National Geographic, this degree of preservation is very rare.
The more I look, the more I find it incredible.
The remaining skin fossils are still covered over the patched armor on the dinosaur skull.
Its right forearm is on its side, with five toes spread upwards.
I can calculate the number.”
The reporter learned that natural or plant sources of seaweed acids, corrosive acids and amino acids additive carriers to the urine production process can be modified to the traditional urine, formed seaweed urine, zinc-corrosive urine, grain urine nitrogen utilization rate than ordinary urine increased by 5-10 percentage points.
Environmentally friendly, the potential for growing crops is obvious, especially large particulate value-added urine is a high-quality raw material for BB fertilizer.
The total number of insurers is twice as many as the number of insurers at the 2012 Olympics in London.
To ensure the safety of the Rio Olympics, Brazil is launching the largest security unification programme ever.
Earlier, the Brazilian government said that a total of 85,000 from the military and police will work together, including 20,000 soldiers and 65,000 police officers.
The majority of the military will be responsible for defending the Olympic venues, while the additional 3,000 will be responsible for the security of international airports, metro stations and streets.
Police patrolled other parts of the city, including the subway, buses and streets.
It is that 6,000 troops have arrived in Rio for security services.
In addition to being in charge of the four major Olympic districts of Rio, they are also in charge of patroling the airports and the main roads connecting the airport and the Olympic venue.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service industry has long been not a new thing, but to make the evaluation mechanism effective, it is important to make supervision more effective and not flow into the form.
How do radicals learn to answer the question: “Who’s the street?”
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was troubled.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis man sat down on his rental bed and browsed Facebook on his mobile phone.
She accidentally found a high school student’s post.
“The police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and the child was still lying on the street.”
She found that no one else posted the message on the donation message and was confused. She shut down Facebook and opened Twitter.
One @TheePharoah user constantly pushed her the dynamic Times.
St. Louis region singer live tweeted the death of Michael Brown. Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He placed a picture of Brown's lost body lying on the street and his body lying on the street for four hours.
“It’s crazy,” Ferrell thought.
But for her and her community, death is nothing new.
She put her cell phone down until she re-opened Twitter that night, reading a tweet about the crowd gathering on the Canfield Avenue.
There were police videos and pictures of people screaming, as well as a photo of a man who claimed to be Brown’s father, with the words: “Ferguson police just killed my armless son!”
She saw a message on the spot where a police officer stood in front of a group of protesters with a cow dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman raised his gun and shouted, “I’ll kill you all ... beast.”
“That’s not normal,” Ferrell said in memories.
“This is not what we are accustomed to and can be called a typical murder.”
At that moment, I felt cold.
I was angry and crying.”
She booked a return flight and returned home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years was the theme of a new documentary “Who’s Street?” to be released in theaters on August 11.
It’s a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of people living in this community, crowded with streets demanding answers.
When Ferrell and his daughter (worn a flower dress, worn a crown accessory) drove to Ferguson, the two re-discussed the topics they had talked about before that morning—“about the black experience and the situation of the black.”
“Do you remember when I taught you when blacks had to fight for their faith?” she recalled.
“We’re going to Ferguson now, because it’s not right for the police to kill an 18-year-old boy.
I had to take her,” Ferrell said later.
“What is happening today is the orgasm of everything in the past.
She wants to know, see, and rise from this.
Not only does she need to develop well in radicalism and organization, but also to understand the different aspects of the black experience and situation, and to understand what we have to do to gain freedom and liberation.
Even if I was fortunate to offer her a racist experience she had never experienced in person, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I feel like I’m hurting her.”
They arrived at Ferguson’s first stop, opposite South Florida’s Sanlo Police Station, where the radicals waited until police officer Darren Wilson was ultimately denounced.
Ferrell and her daughter get in touch with a local business owner who makes bags for lunch.
They prepared bags to hand over the bags to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrell began to form a new type of activism.
She said, “My radicalism changed drastically after August 9.”When she attended her undergraduate degree at Missouri State University in St. Louis, she was chairman of the minority nursing student association, focusing on food justice and health gaps in black communities.
“I have no organizational experience.
This is how it all comes.”
A few weeks later, Ferrell met with film co-director Sabah Foleyan during a night march.
Foley said she and her photographer, Lucas Alvarado Faller, “just wanted to record” what happened.
A question arose in Ferrell’s mind: “Do you want to record or do you want to find a story you can use?”
This suspicion stems from many of these cases: people—usually whites—enter a community to benefit from its pain and tenacity.
As Foucault explained in a recent interview, “We’ve heard that people native to Ferguson didn’t focus their voices, and we wanted to do it differently.”
Foleyant has been in contact with co-director Damon Davis, a regional artist known for his radicalism against dead prisoners.
His involvement led Ferrell and six other locals to join the “Who’s Street?” project team, which remained unwavering for years after Brown was shot.
“This documentary isn’t someone speaking for us or talking to us, it’s our speech,” Davis said.
“I’m primarily concerned about how these characters are presented, because that’s how I’m presented.”
Though the goal was not to focus on Ferrell’s experience – but to demonstrate the campaign “not about the leader of the Saviour, but about community cohesion,” Foleyant said – it turned out that she was the most open-minded of the film participants.
As a result, “Who’s Street?” surprisingly records Ferrell’s personal life, such as falling in love and getting married.
“I felt like I was naked,” Ferrell laughed when he first saw the finished product.
“But I understand that doing this work and humanizing blacks requires a certain degree of vulnerability.”
Furthermore, Ferrell’s story reiterates and repositions the role of black cool women in the broader movement of black life events.
Two of the movement’s three founders – who created #BlackLivesMatter on social media after the shooting of the black teenager Trevor Martin in 2012 – were identified as cool.
“Cool black women in the leadership generally supported this movement,” said Ferrell, “because we’re constantly fighting on multiple fronts.”
Black cool women have to endure all this.”
Foleyan agreed and mentioned that “this campaign really got the support of black women and many black cool women.”
Because of her identity, Ferrell was chosen as the core of the film, however, she insisted that "this is not an action against affirming things."
“She’s the one who inspires that energy,” she said.
“While she’s on the front line, it’s not a coincidence because in these crossroads of life, as a black cool female, you have a lot to do.
Through the screen, you can feel her energy.”
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras have long disappeared, but tensions between the community and the police remain.
For attempting to block the highway during a parade, Ferrell was sentenced to more than two and a half years in detention.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere in the area she calls home: “A mess.”
Nevertheless, since she walked the Ferguson Street three years ago, she has been holding on to the Holy Songs she has struggled to remember.
“We have a duty to fight for freedom.
We have a responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We have nothing to lose except our locks.”
In fact, online translation services were already available on the web a decade ago, and in fact, long ago, the argument that “machines are about to replace human translation” was never heard.
Similarities: Artists use DNA portraits to create Chelsea Manning
In the center of the Friedman Gallery in New York, there are several faces: white, black, and brown, with almost imperceptible similarities between each one of them, which are tied up by ropes from the ceiling.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea Manning to send her cheeks with cotton tags and hair crumbs.
Manning sent hair crumbs from Livenbosch prison for leaking confidential diplomatic telegrams through the WikiLeaks website, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years in prison.
The exhibition opened on August 2 with the title “Similarities”.
This was the result of two years of communication between Dwight Hagueburg and Manning, Dwight Hagueburg combining his disciplines with himself in technology, computer science and art, while Manning was a well-known dissident who had been imprisoned and had completed transgender surgery in prison. Former US President Barack Obama pardoned her remaining punishment three days before the end of his term.
Through algorithmic analysis of Manning’s DNA, Heather Duwey Hubberg created 30 portraits of “very likely appearances.” Heather Duwey Hubberg made a sharp and somewhat ruthless comment.
Born Bradley Edward, Manning publicly acknowledged that she considered herself a woman when she was a teenager and was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including six allegations of espionage, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was suppressed, with only one photo, a black-and-white selfie with a particulate sensation, which looked obviously unhappy, sitting on the driver’s seat, wearing a purple golden hair.
In 2015, Heather Duve Hubberg made a huge success in her 2012 project, Stranger Visions.
In that work, she uses DNA extracted from the debris from the middle court evidence from tobacco and rubber to create 3D portraits of characters that may look similar.
That was an email she just received from Paper magazine.
“They wanted to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and needed a portrait,” Heather Duwey Hubberg told the media at the opening ceremony.
Chelsea Manning could not visit or take pictures at the time, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
So the artist and her imprisoned muse became impossible friends, exchanging many letters over the course of two years.
They even created a comic book, “The Head of Repression,” painted by Shoili Kanungo. The comic book predicted that the president could in the future allow Manning privileges, she could see the exhibition in prison.
And Obama asked for her release a few days after the book was published.It may have been a coincidence when Manning spent his seventh year in a military prison in Kansas.
Because of contemporary America, the Trump administration has continuously declared war on government leakers and transgender soldiers, while looking for new ways, which can be hashed on Twitter, to nakedly incite division, and this exhibition is precisely to bridge such division.
When asked about all this special time, Heathrow Hubberg said, “Everything has a reason to happen.”
In an artist’s statement written on the gallery wall, Manning’s super-big signature below (the “i” in the name is drawn with a heart) calls for an end to “partisan strife based on gender, sexual orientation and culture.”
On the opposite wall is her linear DNA sequence, with pencil distortions written with the symbols Cs, Gs, and As.
By containing 200 letters (or nucleic acid, the sophisticated scientific dictionary of each artist), Heather Duwey Hubberg hopes to express that by portraying these remarkably similar portraits, at least in the physiological structure, everyone is like that.
“I hope people get out of this trouble and our genomes don’t care who we are, how public genetic data is interpreted, and how subjective it is,” said Heathrow Hubberg, whose 2007 video, False Memories, is also on display.
“DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, so here are 30 of them.”
The last work in the exhibition, in a room, comes from one page of the novel in the previous illustration.
Showed in the U.S. soldiers hand-held amplifiers under floating, diamond-shaped Manning.
“When they make your speech stop, they win,” the wall wrote.
“So don’t keep your mouth shut.”
“These contents came directly from a letter she wrote to me,” said the artist from Philadelphia.
“I’m just scared, I still have to say.”
Manning hasn’t seen the exhibition in person, as predicted in the comic book, but when she does, she’ll be greeted by her own DNA portrait mask, just like a group of protesters in the exhibition center.
It was also purposeful, as all the items in the exhibition reached the height of her genetic unipolar information written with a pencil (5.2 feet, Manning’s height).
“In the past, I’ve hung them on the wall, but I hope they feel like a bunch of people,” Duvey Hagberg said when talking about the portrait.
“But I want them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting for her release at the time.”
Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee sought for murder
Police said a man was found deadly stabbed in a Chicago luxury apartment, and a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University employee were later sought and are currently searching for suspects nationwide.
Cook County court records showed that Wendham Lessem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, were ordered a degree-free arrest on Monday for murder suspected of the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Durrall.
According to documents, the 26-year-old Cornell Durandrough died of multiple beating wounds.
A community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department said the body was found on July 27.
Police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment after receiving the phone call and found the victim had some cracks.
Police said Cornell Durango was killed on the scene and detectives are investigating his murder, while police are actively looking for two suspects.
Lessem has been an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cowbech, Deputy Director of Campus Relations, said in an email statement that Lesem has now been dismissed and has been banned from entering the Northwestern University campus.
Koch said: “This is now a criminal case, relevant authorities are investigating, and the Northwest University is actively cooperating with the investigation.”
Warren is a senior financial assistant at Oxford University.
A spokesman for Oxford University’s Summerville College said in an email statement: “We have been in contact with the British police and are always ready to assist the U.S. investigative agency if needed.”
The statement added that Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped he could file the case for surrender.
Chief Liaison Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Gurelmi, said he strongly encouraged the suspects to surrender to the authorities.
Guterres said, “Police has an approximate idea of where they are, and we are working to locate possible locations.”
Guterres said local, regional and national authorities are making every effort to assist in the search for the suspects.
Guterres said the police had received a call from the Grand Plaza apartment manager, who had just received a secret message that the apartment number 1008 had happened.
Police said the situation was terrible at the time.
Guterres said it remains unclear whether the incident also occurred on July 27.
He said, according to security cameras, that Lesem and Warren were in the building at the time.
“We believe that Professor Lesem has a certain relationship with the victim,” Guterres said.
The management team at Grand Plaza issued a statement to residents saying: “Police is currently investigating the victim’s timeline and background and is investigating various motives, including possible domestic incidents.”
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko said: "We will complete the roadmap of the World Anti-Doping Agency in the near future."
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said the implementation of the remaining standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) to restore the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) would not take too long.
“The implementation of roadmap standards has reached a certain stage, and RUSADA has been granted the right to plan and test in partnership with UKAD.
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard," Mutko said Thursday.
This was stated by Deputy Prime Minister Mutko in commenting on the second part of the World Anti-Doping Agency Roadmap, Compliance, which sets out the criteria for restoring RUSADA’s rights and was recently published on the organization’s website.
According to Mutko, the standards do not include anything that could cause Russian concerns.
He added, “Everything has to be announced and everything will be implemented.
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future.”
However, one of the criteria mentioned on the list is that the Russian anti-doping agency must publicly accept the findings of an investigation approved by Canadian attorney Richard McLean on the Russian state’s support for the use of doping in its national sports.
Mutko said: “We are investigating that our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind it, and we will not admit what doesn’t exist.”
Mutko’s words responded to the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
Smirnov acknowledged the problems of the Russian anti-doping agency in the past during a media visit to Russian outlet RSport earlier that day, but added: “We have repeatedly said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally,” Smirnov said.
Following the November 2015 doping scandal, WADA suspended RUSADA’s right to conduct doping inspections in Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate testing this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
WADA Director-General Olivia Negri, who visited the organization's Moscow headquarters in July, said RUSADA was "going in the right direction" and working to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it be chess or national chess, defeating humankind was no longer the subject of discussion decades ago.
Croatian football association president Davos-Suk said in an interview that participating in the China Cup is meaningful for Croatian football, and the prize number of the China Cup is very large.
More than 8,000 products with zero tariffs.
At the routine press conference held by the Ministry of Commerce on January 11, spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce, Cao Phuc said that so far, China has implemented 15 free trade agreements, involving 23 countries and regions, covering more than 8,000 types of zero-tariff import products.
Meanwhile, imported cosmetics, Icelandic sandwiches, Chilean red wine, tropical fruits from ASEAN ... you need to buy these products at a high price.
At present, China has signed 16 free trade agreements with 24 countries and regions, 15 of which have been implemented, covering more than 8,000 types of tariff-free imports.
Taking agricultural products as an example, with the implementation of the Free Trade Agreement, consumers can taste agricultural products from different countries of origin, quality and cheap.
For example, import duties on tropical fruits such as pomegranates, lilies, and argan fruits in ASEAN were reduced from 15 to 30 percent to zero.
Iceland’s sandwich import tariffs were reduced from 10% to 12% to zero.
Red wine import duties from Georgia and Chile were reduced from 14% to 30% to zero.
There are also significant tax cuts in New Zealand for specialty agricultural products such as beef and milk powder.
Take industrial goods, for example, the tariffs on imports of some cosmetics in Switzerland have been reduced to zero.
Import tariffs on some watches have been reduced by 50 percent and will be reduced to zero in a few years.
South Korea's import duties on products such as refrigerators, electric cookers, massage machines, cosmetics devices have been reduced by 40%, and will be reduced to zero in a few years.
There are also significant reductions in taxes on consumer electronics.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the Free Trade Zone also include many intermediate products and raw materials needed for the manufacture of domestic consumer goods, and also to a certain extent promoted the structural upgrading of domestic consumer goods.
A spokesman for the Ministry of Commerce said that one-third of China's total imports of products can enjoy the treatment of preferential tariffs of the Free Trade Agreement, most of which are final consumer goods, bringing tangible benefits to consumers.
Further reduction of import duties on consumer goods
Since December 1, 2017, China's import tariffs on some consumer goods have been adjusted to further reduce the import tariffs on consumer goods, covering food, health products, pharmaceuticals, chemical supplies, clothing and shoe hats, household equipment, cultural entertainment, daily grocery and other consumer goods, including a total of 187 tax numbers.
The average tax rate for this batch of consumer goods will be dropped from 17.3% straight to 7.7%, almost being “stopped”!
As of January 1, 2018, China also made partial adjustments to other import and export tariffs.
Import duties on certain cosmetics such as lipstick, eye shade, perfume and so on were reduced from 10% to 5%;
After the reduction of tariffs, it means that consumers do not need to buy, and more so do not have to go abroad to buy foreign products they like.
2018 Yiwu Import Goods Shopping Festival: Imported red wine, snacks, fruits ... all cheap!
Foreign News: U.S. shopping mall regulations vary greatly at the end of the year, shopping returns need to be careful
The New Network on December 29
According to the U.S. World Daily, Christmas is just over.
According to ABC, more than half of the goods sold last Christmas were returned.
In addition, there are readers who have been cheated on many occasions, and consumers need to be more careful when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but if you buy gifts or e-commerce purchases from some small stores, you must be careful.
Ms. Hu of Rolan Gong local time on December 1 in an online store that sells printed coats, bought a coat for more than $60 (USD, USD), the result has not yet been sent.
She sent a mail to the customer service and did not reply.
Another user exploded, last year traveled to the United States, bought a mobile phone from a third-party seller, and after sending it, found in it a box of rubber mud.
After being cheated, apply for a refund to the website and get a full refund.
But there are also customers who believe that the website’s refund service isn’t 100% perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident in Northern California, said he had purchased an accelerated delivery service from a website twice, and an accelerated service of $4, but never delivered it on time.
Subsequently, a refund request was submitted and no response was received.
Large shopping malls or shopping malls have a better return policy.
Most Macy’s products are fully refunded within 180 days.
However, the goods must remain "originally" and have purchase credentials such as receipts or bank purchase records.
If there are no credentials, customers can also get shopping spot points that can be used to buy other goods.
Target typically has a 90 day return period for general goods, and electronics typically 15 days.
However, the return period for electronic and entertainment goods purchased between November 1 and December 25, 2017 is extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day refund period starts on December 25, i.e. to be returned before January 25, 2018.
Extreme shopping experience, commercial shopping development new era has arrived
More than a decade ago, China is generally still in the sales market, the choice of people is limited, and the demand is limited.
But after a decade of development, the market has long achieved the shift from the seller market to the buyer market, and today's consumer tastes have become more disgusting, they are no longer satisfied with the simple "one-hand money-to-one delivery" shopping behavior.
So, how to give consumers an incredible shopping experience becomes the next competitive spot for real estate developers.
Among the many factors affecting consumer shopping experiences, the influence of shopping centers in the business circle is the most significant.
See how urban builders around the world focus on shopping experiences.
There are no two completely identical leaves in the world, no two completely identical shopping centers, and a famous shopping center must have its own characteristics.
For example, the world-famous Canyon shopping center in Turkey, its unique wave-shaped architectural design is inspired by the Grand Canyon, so called the harmonious Canyon, walking the 200 meters of the ministry walk in the Canyon is as if placed inside the Grand Canyon.
In addition to the canyon-style design, in the center of the shopping center there is also a large oval showroom, unique in shape, and often hosts special performances.
Because of the open platform design, tourists can walk on every floor to see the activities carried out in the "canyon", and have the effect of changing views.
At home, there is China's first forest-style walking consumer spot called Nanjing Forest Moor commercial street, which combines shopping with ecology and fairy tales perfectly.
7000 square meters of green ground square, 3000 square meters of roof water platform, the project consists of 9 single buildings, air corridors interconnected between the buildings, the overall submerged courtyard design, take the geographical surface of the French cottage tree as the architectural surface, the roof water terrace, creating a forest-like feeling.
Walking into the forest Moor, as if inadvertently fell into the rabbit hole in Alice's adventure, climbing the tree trunks surround the building, the grass, the springs shaped, bringing people into the lively and vibrant forest.
There is also in Chongqing, Long Lake, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China, China and China, China, China and China, China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China, China and China.
Not only that, the Aquarium Commercial Circle also integrates the ecology into the building, with TOD public transportation oriented, combining fashion shopping, living services, catering, entertainment, education, sport in one, in bringing to consumers the ultimate shopping experience at the same time also lead them to enjoy Chongqing's unique "shore water culture", the perfect integration of shopping and water entertainment, leisure.
It can be found that at present, a part of the real estate enterprises are aware of the discovery trajectory of this new urban business, and the industry says that this consumer-centered consumption model, how to combine shopping and experience will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
Today, the business world is not only a scattered place for goods, it is more a place for the integration of artistic culture and creative themes, but also carries the responsibility of people to live in the city.
Therefore, at the same time as satisfying the material needs of consumers, maximizing the multi-level spiritual needs of cultural arts, and playing the needs of habitable living, is inevitably the high point of the future development of the business community.
In Chongqing, the country's northern shore of Jiangsu, located in Jiangsu, close to the viewing bridge, the world's commercial essence, the international giant is surrounded, the first-class brands gather, and close to the international fashion.
There is a great world, a great world, a great world.
It has a good shopping environment, and it is close to the southern marketplace, enjoying the western and even the country's leading four-tier stereo transportation system, improving the comfort of shopping.
In addition, the greening of the gardens and the landscape of the two walking streets of the Wanda Road and Wanda Square have been upgraded, planting about 300 plants of Jomo, transforming the land of 40,000 square meters, and upgrading the image of the business circle of the South Pole;
And Long Lagoon Lake 1, close to Chongqing's first low-density shore-water business circle - the Shinjuku water business circle, is surrounded by nine parks, the commercial district is low in density, and the degree of opening is high, so that people are more willing to stay, stay and slowly enjoy the pleasure of shopping when shopping, rather than being pushed forward by the people behind.
Today's business competition will only be more and more intense, how to kill a bloodway in the homogeneous market and seize the reputation of the "shopping holy place" in the hearts of future consumers, which is worth all real estate developers to seriously think about.
Differentiation strategy alone is far from enough, only those developers who truly put consumers in their hearts, hurry consumers, think what consumers think, provide consumers with extreme and simple shopping experience can laugh in the storm coming market.
Of course, in the end I think the most excited still Chongqing people, having such a good shopping experience and business circles, placed 10 years ago no one could imagine today's prosperity.
Consumerism Celebrations Hide the Real Environmental Prices
162.2 billion yuan, which is the amount of turnover consumed by TianKat users during the 24 hours of the "Tiancat Twin Eleven Global Celebration Festival" on November 11, 2017.
Specifically, after the start of the "Double 11", in just 3 minutes, the trading amount of TianKat broke 10 billion, 6 minutes and 05 seconds exceeded 20 billion yuan, and 9 hours broke 100 billion.
On that day, the total number of consumers worldwide made payments through Paypal reached 14,8 million, an increase of 41 percent from last year.
These consumptions will result in 8.1 billion logistics orders.
Whether it is the TianKat online shopping platform or the Paypal payment platform, all belong to Ma Yun's Ali Group.
Ten years ago no one would have imagined that the November 11 single youth out of self-righteous creation of the "Skin Festival" subculture will be compiled by e-commerce, becoming today's phenomenal "double 11" shopping feast.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba first used the "Great Halloween Promotion" marketing headline: no one talks about falling in love with you, then "single dogs" come and buy online.
The result is surprising, that day Taobao Merchant City (the "Tian Cat" predecessor) transaction amount broke 52 million yuan, which is 10 times the daily transaction amount at the time.
Since then, the "Double 11" has become the shopping festival created by Alibaba, from the beginning of the domestic buyers and sellers entertain themselves, to the current influx of global merchants, nine years have passed, the "Double 11" hundreds of billions of transactions have been more than 3,200 times that year, making the "Black Friday" unexpected.
With the "Double Eleven" promotion, there are many e-commerce, among which "Kyotoon" is the strongest.
"Kyotoon" has its own shopping festival "6.18", but there is no "double 11" impact, this year from November 1 to November 11, "Kyotoon" cumulative sales reached 12.71 billion yuan.
And after the "Double 11", followed by a similar "Double 12" discounting celebration and Christmas New Year shopping period.
Through the New Year, Chinese consumers are still waiting for the annual procurement period before the Spring Festival, the Valentine's Day shopping period, consumption, and no vacation.
The environmental issues brought about by instantaneous mass consumption have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua Daily News, according to the industry's usual standard conservation estimate of 0.2 kilograms per packaging box, at least 300,000 tons of garbage were generated during this year's "double 11".
Liu Hua, director of the Pollution Prevention and Control Project of the Green Peace and East Asia division, told China and foreign dialogue that this year's "Double 11" order volume alone will produce 160,000 tons of packaging garbage.
In 2016, the National Post Office issued a report, pointing out that during the 2015 "double 11" period (November 11 to 16) about 7,8 million quick pieces, using more than 3 billion weaving bags, 99.22 billion packaging boxes, 169.85 billion meters of tape, the length of the tape can be around the Earth's equator 425 round.
And this year, the National Post Office expects the number of "double 11" mail business is expected to exceed 1.5 billion.
Wang Zhao, a manager of a waste incineration center in Beijing, told Xinhua news agency that the daily amount of garbage entered after "Double 11" exceeded 2,000 tons, and also exceeded the treatment capacity of the incineration station.
Express companies have realized that the environmental pollution caused by the express industry cannot be underestimated.
Some e-commerce logistics enterprises including Suning "Double 11" introduced recyclable reusable plastic express boxes, recycled packaging bags that can be repeatedly used as shopping bags and garbage bags, etc., but the acceptance of troubled consumers is not high.
Ma also called on the logistics industry to support "green packaging" and "green logistics".

What kind of mobility do Germans want to pay?
Zhang Winter: The mobile payment warfare launched in Germany is not expected.
WeChat payments and treasures have only moved the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, the seizure of positions has not changed – the Chinese, this is also globalization?
Where there is a payment treasure, there must be a microchip payment.
In accordance with the agreement with the German e-payment service provider Wirecard, WeChat Payment officially started landing in Germany in November this year, and gradually made the layout of merchants across Europe.
This exotic "old country" reunion took place in Europe.
Since then, Paypal and WeChat have been singing high on the path of globalization.
For the globalization of mobile payments in China, Erie advised the China Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Research Report 2017 to summarize in two ways: one is to invest strategically, export experience, shareholder and support domestic mobile payments enterprises abroad.
The second is to promote mobile payment services to foreign businessmen through Chinese tourists' consumption behavior abroad, thereby changing the perception and acceptance of Chinese mobile payments in foreign countries.
Indeed, the Chinese have to go.
China's economy is developing rapidly, coupled with the large population base, and the spending of Chinese tourists in Europe is an attractive figure.
But it is also doomed that the Chinese mobile payment warfare launched in Germany is not expectative.
WeChat payments and treasures are only moving the battlefield to Europe, the competitors have not changed, the position of the robbery has not changed – or the Chinese, that is also globalization?
The more pioneering question is, can China’s mobile payments expand in mainland Europe?
Take Germany for example.
A new “magical” sale.
Chen Qing Li, Yang Qing: Amazon announced its entry into the world's top ten retailers and grocery stores, regardless of the time and motivation, it is worth playing.
In November 2015, Amazon opened its first physical bookstore in Seattle, followed by two more bookstores in Portland and Santiago.
Amazon opened stores in New York in early 2017 and plans to have at least eight stores by the end of the year.
Almost the same time, Amazon announced its unmanned supermarket (Amazon Go) trial operation, customers to the store do not need to line up, do not need to settle the bill, enter the door, take the goods they want to leave, the purchase amount will be automatically deducted from the customer's Amazon account.
For Amazon, the sudden frequency of action on physical stores in recent years is very unexpected.
As early as 2007, in his Open Letter to Shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos emphasized that Amazon would not easily open a physical store unless the following four conditions were met:
We must be confident that this new opportunity will give shareholders a return on investment.
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is significant for the company as a whole.
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is ignored by the market.
We must be confident that in this market we have enough resources to differentiate towards our customers.
Bookstores and grocery stores are the two most shake-down categories in the physical retail, and the first rival that fell after the rise of Amazon.
Amazon announced its entry into the world's top ten retailers, regardless of the timing and motivation.
Is Amazon’s approach contrary to the promises in the shareholder letter?
Similar voices were heard from the other end of the planet, too. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the 2016 Hangzhou Nanjing Conference, Alibaba Board Chairman Ma Yun delivered a theme speech.
“From next year, Alibaba will no longer mention the term ‘e-commerce’.
The era of pure e-commerce will soon end, and in the next ten or twenty years there will be no e-commerce, replaced by "new retail".
The combination of online and offline logistics will create new retail sales.”
At one time, the three words "new retail" were like magic, frequently hanged in the mouth by industry people.
But what does “new retail” mean?
If it’s just combined on the line with the bottom line, then this concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer tracked 180 of the largest e-commerce providers after estimating total e-commerce sales at around $200 billion, while the largest 25 of them accounted for more than $15.9 billion.
Of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers who have only started operating on the line in the last five years (such as Messy, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.).
Alibaba Group invested 28.3 billion yuan in Suning Cloud traders, which has also been seen.
Globally, retailers and e-commerce are shifting from a single channel to a full-channel retail system that covers physical stores, e-commerce, mobile ends and social media.
Is Ma Yuan’s “new retail” more a summary than a future outlook?
If not, what’s the difference between the whole channel concept and “new retail”?
Per the problem is not whether online and offline will not integrate, but how to integrate.
Looking back at the retail industry over the past 20 years, the rise of e-commerce, like the rise of discount retailers in the early years, has been focused on price and convenience.
Relying on these two pain points, e-commerce companies have shifted highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, from offline to online.
With the formation of online consumption habits and the continuous improvement of customer experience, e-commerce companies have reached out to other categories and started to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang Yong, "using the ideas and technologies of the Internet to comprehensively reform and upgrade the existing approximately 30 trillion social retailers total, so that the increasingly upgraded consumer demand of Chinese consumers can be effectively met, so that the whole process of commodity production, circulation, and services due to the widespread use of the Internet, big data becomes more efficient."
Therefore, the road of e-commerce is a surface light asset, the road of actual heavy assets.
"Light" refers to the burden of fixed assets, personnel allocation, management processes, etc. The traditional retail industry is not large; "heavy" refers to the huge investment in logistics, warehousing and other aspects.
The change in logistics methods ensures the high efficiency of e-commerce.

On January 18, Alibaba held an e-commerce poverty alleviation summit in Chongqing, announcing that it will promote accurate poverty alleviation and rural revitalization by exploring the new model of "Internet + poverty alleviation".
This is after putting forward a rural strategy, launching rural Taobao projects, launching a poverty alleviation platform and establishing Alibaba poverty alleviation fund, Ali has once again "added" to poverty alleviation.
Poverty alleviation is one of China’s most important national strategies.
Total poverty eradication has never been achieved in China for thousands of years.
E-commerce poverty alleviation is a new round of innovative initiatives for poverty alleviation and development, and is an important factor in achieving accurate poverty alleviation and accurate poverty alleviation.
The Central Committee attaches great importance to the role of the Internet in promoting poverty alleviation, promoting accurate poverty alleviation and accurate poverty alleviation, and allowing agricultural products to go out of the countryside through the Internet.
As a result, Ali already put forward a rural strategy in 2014, along with big data cloud computing and globalization, and listed Ali's three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the rural Taobao project, recruiting "Village 2" in the countryside, leading farmers to get rich through e-commerce.
In 2017, Ali worked with the business sector to create a channel for poverty alleviation in agriculture, which is currently linked to 13 provinces and 120 national poverty-stricken counties.
The village of Taobao, which emerged from the Ali platform, already has 2118 villages.
Of these, 400 appear in provincial poverty counties and 33 appear in poverty counties in 13 countries.
In 2017, in Alibaba China retail platform, the national sales of Taobao village reached 120 billion yuan.
In the face of the national strategy of poverty alleviation, Ali has been thinking about how to use the technology, big data, cloud computing and other innovative capabilities of the Ali economies to take a new path for poverty alleviation.
Among them, Qingdao is the main carrier platform for Ali e-commerce poverty alleviation, and passed through a new link to the internet poverty alleviation for direct sales.
In the cultivation sector, the villas and ants have jointly supported agricultural tools and small loans.
In 2017, in 832 national poverty-stricken counties, 795 of them were served, providing convenient payments, credit and other services.
Shijiazhuang solves warehousing and logistics, Shijiazhuang is responsible for sales, and Shijiazhuang is responsible for guiding agricultural production, further improving the supply standards, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of e-commerce to get rid of poverty requires not only products, sales channels, and industrial planning, but also talents.
Ali opened e-commerce courses through Taobao University, teaching farmers standardized, qualitative and scalable cultivation methods, and achieved the combination of "poverty alleviation + supporting minds", so that farmers can sustainably get out of poverty.
These courses have already covered about 92 percent of national poverty-stricken counties.
The idea of poverty alleviation by "public welfare mentality and commercial means" can also ensure that Ali does "true poverty alleviation" when poverty is alleviated.
Ma Yun, chairman of Alibaba’s board of directors, said that poverty eradication should be divided into three stages: poverty alleviation, poverty alleviation and enrichment.
Poverty alleviation is to give people fish, poverty alleviation is to give people fish, and getting rich is to build a "fish pond" for farmers, so that farmers have fish to feed.
The industry driven by e-commerce to alleviate poverty is to build fish ponds.
In industrial poverty alleviation, the model of poverty alleviation created by Ali and Shaanxi apple industry, has been replicated by relevant departments as an example in the country.
Ali e-commerce poverty alleviation work has also been acknowledged by decision-makers.
E-commerce companies represented by Alibaba have been sent to ensure that farmers increase production and revenue through online offline channels.
Some of the villages’ employees have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experiences in e-commerce poverty alleviation.
At present, the Chinese office of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has joined village chao and engaged in the e-commerce industry poverty alleviation in Anguilla and other places.
The "third new economic think tank conference" jointly organized by Ali Research Institute and China Vision Think Tank Tuba was held on January 16, and Zhang Li, director of the Institute of Electronic Commerce of the Ministry of Commerce, attended and spoke.
She believes that our globalization has actually ignored the most important problems, namely the body and use of globalization and the stage of globalization.
In this way, many people think that globalization has stagnated, and many developed and developing countries, in the new stage, their attitude toward globalization is different, is different to the pattern.
The second concept is the question of the intermediate stage of globalization, what is constrained by the intermediate stage of globalization?
By the basis of the economic environment, it is precisely because the economic basis has changed globalization that the constraints occur.
Zhang Li believes that the global economic adjustment is basically over at the end of 2017, after 2018 will enter a new round of growth, the next round of growth must be raw products.
The first fresh supermarket in Kyoto, 7FRESH, officially opened recently, and plans to lay more than 1,000 stores in the country in the next three to five years.
In addition to Ali's fresh horse, eternal super species, Suning's fresh horse, the hand of the Mermaid's fresh fish, and so on, "new retail stores" began to pop up, and in innovative models and even prices "call each other".
The competition for the upgrading of fresh supermarkets has become a phenomenal topic in the new retail field, where is the new retail?
“In 2018, we will quickly enter the country, and a bunch of shops will open in Beijing, Shanghai and Hangzhou before the Spring Festival.”
Chief Executive Officer Hu Jintao revealed the "new way" of 2018 at the second New Retail Summit on the 10th.
“From 2018, Box Horse is not just a fresh e-commerce, but a life-class e-commerce that meets consumers’ instant service.
The core model online is lead, experience, and online is real sales.”
Different from traditional grocery stores and supermarkets, Box Horse in the eyes of many consumers is a fun and tasty "web shop", and even intermediary agencies have developed the concept of "box room".
Online e-commerce platforms and offline retailers each have advantages and disadvantages, but consumers are in a variety of channels, so both sides are trying the whole channel model.
The industry believes that in the context of consumer upgrading, in 2018 there will be more and more "box horses" stores.
And Box Horse continues to explore from the original fresh to more consumer fields, indicating that more innovation will appear in the retail market in the new year.
"For example, the business model combined online and offline has attracted the eye of consumers, and fresh supermarkets are opened everywhere."
"But these relationships say more and more, it is useless to show up, and finally implement that you have not brought a great experience to consumers, I have experienced it to be willing to pay."
According to Yuan Bin, Joint Chief Executive Officer, under the new retail environment, consumer habits have changed, and purchasing demand has also changed.
Originally, the line is purely on the line, the line is broken, the line is to defeat the line, the line is to counter-attack the line, now together, because the consumer has no distinction under the line.
The dispute of capital to enter the office, so that the current fresh supermarket represented by the new retail firearms taste full.
At present, the competition of new retail in the first-tier cities is still far from reaching the Red Sea pattern, and there are still large parts of second-tier cities to be excavated, and the market still has great opportunities and space.
Different types of industries for new retail layout, will bring the development of new retail into a diversified state of development.
China Academy of Social Sciences Institute of Finance and Strategy Research, for everyone to grind a dry goods, is this Chinese e-commerce annual development report.
What have Chinese companies achieved this year?
What are the trends in global e-commerce?
Let us reveal it to everyone one by one.
Total sales record-breaking growth return to accelerated track
Since 2006, China's online retail sales can be said to have been showing super-high-speed growth, it is estimated that at that time it felt that online shopping was fresh, without going out and buying, too cool!

This year, however, the situation is different, with online retail sales re-accelerating, re-growing to 34.2% in September.
Much higher than the growth rate in 2015 and 2016.
Per everyone in the outdoors swing around and find that buying or buying is more physically and mentally pleasant.
Among them, the retail sales of physical goods online amounted to 5.08 trillion yuan, and the retail sales of services online amounted to 1.49 trillion yuan.

Secondly, the French netizens who love their hands, per capita online purchases at $1925, and they buy the most goods online, are clothes, a country that loves fashion.
My favorite online shopper must be young people.
Help you avoid becoming the next startup for Uber
Amy Erret once wanted to investigate employees’ well-being at her e-commerce startup, but the investigation didn’t work.
The answers are often obscure, useless, and worse, deceptive.
Even if she promises to be anonymous, some employees still don’t trust the process.
Ereth, who manages San Francisco’s e-commerce escort Madison Reed with 75 employees, said the response was “lack of consistency and objectivity.”
So she called out for help.
A group of new human resources start-ups emerged after the rain, helping the company to understand the feelings of employees.
They built and authorized software specifically for measuring employee engagement, allowing companies to quickly conduct polls on specific teams and populations, provide employees with anonymous and complaint hotline, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass executives to report directly to the board.
“Now you can track your health with tools like Strava and Fitbit, but where is the company’s Fitbit?” said Jim Barnet, co-founder and CEO of Redwood City startup Glint.
Eret said that in three years, she gained more insight into employees’ thoughts and feelings with Glint.
In addition to quick surveys of specific teams and polls, Glint also provides a company hotline of which units complained the most, which managers approved the low scores, at a glance – which gives her an in-depth understanding of why.
Companies have begun to realize that they have to be skilled in controlling the company’s workplace culture to avoid becoming the next Uber. Previous Uber employees have published a blog post describing the harassment environment, whose speakers have been punished by the company and subsequently plagued by Uber.
For startups like Glint, the company’s desire to oversee is a huge business opportunity.
According to data from the financial technology analytics site Let’s Talk Payments, by 2020, global governance, regulation and compliance industries could be worth more than $1.187 billion.
Convercent, a start-up in Denver, Colorado, is dedicated to helping companies prevent and detect bad behavior, which saw an increase in interest and activity during Uber’s damaged reputation earlier this year.
Convercent has 600 customers, including Apple, Microsoft and Tesla.
Uber recently signed a contract as a customer.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized “diagnostic” surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view hotmaps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides an anonymous text hotline for employees to report misconduct.
If the chairman is involved, the complaint will go directly to the board.
Patrick Kunlan, founder and CEO of Convercent, said: “The public opinion courts have abused the authority of the regulators.
If a company is found to treat employees inappropriately or to behave unethically, even if regulators do not intervene, it could face the harsh consequences of consumer resistance, employee loss, and involvement in lawsuits, Kunland said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with more than 500 locations and more than 25,000 employees, has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees understand work guidelines and procedures and provide an easy way to contact the company’s headquarters.
Before that, if employees want to report a problem, they must find the company’s headquarters phone number or email, submit a formal complaint and hope the headquarters will take it seriously.
It’s often a frightening and disturbing experience, Ruby Tuesday’s general legal adviser James Vitranno says, saying he thinks there’s no good way to track employee complaints.
But now, using Convercent, the company can quickly detect and address issues previously unknown to executives in remote offices, cities or states — such as discrimination, harassment, or unfair pay behavior.
“I can get a closer 360-degree view of the work experience,” said Vitranno, who is responsible for the Ruby Tuesday risk management team.
“We are protecting our shareholders from employment lawsuits.”
Kunlan said that after the bankruptcy of the Andalusian accounting firm due to a violation of the ethics code in the Annan scandal, companies have increased their emphasis on ethics, values and employee commitment since 2002.
But it wasn’t until “social media entered their own world” that companies realized they couldn’t stop their explosives from spreading virally online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, people see hope as a strategy,” he said.
Both Glint and Convercent provide their software as a service and charge companies regular fees for using the product.
This business model and business opportunity is supported by venture capitalists who have already supported the two startups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million in funding from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising its total capital to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million in funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, a total of $60 million.
Given the interrelationship between companies, culture and venture capital, these investments are hardly surprising.
More and more research shows that today’s employees have higher expectations of the workplace than ever before.
In a competitive market like Silicon Valley, high salaries and fun projects are just bets.
Employees want to feel accepted, valued, and feel their time spent in a company with a positive mission.
“When people are happy to join a company, feel their voice is heard, and the work they do is beneficial, they are more committed to making the company a success,” said Nina McCartney, Vice President, Global Welfare and Employee Experience, LinkedIn.
Investors reward when their portfolio companies perform well; companies perform well when employees are loyal and dedicated.
It’s not surprising that if third-party analytics tools promise to increase employees’ loyalty and commitment, they will seek financial support.
Workplace culture experts say it is very important to have data on employee engagement.
However, these data are useless unless the company’s administrators take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can be expected that the company is changing.
If change is not progressing fast enough, or if there is little progress, it can bring disappointment and cause employees to leave the company.
Russell Roth, head of consulting at Curtis International, said: “If you want to look for 4,000 suggestions, you need to be prepared for 4,000 conversations.”
“Because if you don’t follow the whole process, the employee will think, ‘Have you really heard me?
Do you care?
If you don’t care, why should I care?”
Erret said Madison Reed now conducted a monthly employee survey and was able to take action on the day that Glint the issue.
After gathering feedback from employees about their frustration with the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve problems by restructuring internal teams and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights about its employees, and in the long run, they hope to make a shift in this industry known for high talent loss rates and better retain employees.
“If you’re not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you’re losing talent,” Vetrano said.
If you lose talent, you will lose customers.
When you lose customers, you lose the company.”

NCAA cancelled training twice a day and extended the day training time of the Bears
Close to 11 p.m., a team member at the University of California, Los Angeles, talked around next to the team’s new campus training ground.
Some players have taken off their shirts and exposed their body to sweat after training on the first day of the camp.
For a large portion of the team, these free minutes are rest time.
After three hours of practice, players attending the summer class will be returned to the hostel end-exam and then returned to the Wasserman Football Center for the meeting at 6:30 a.m. the next day.
“The next three days are a meltdown for these guys,” Medvedev coach Jim Mora said as it was about to enter Tuesday.
The NCAA cancelled two exercises a day (designed to ease the player’s burden), but actually extended their daytime training time – at least before Friday’s end.
That’s why the first three training sessions at the University of California in Los Angeles are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to accommodate the players’ crowded schedule.
From cancelling training twice a day to more training once a day, the Bears started training almost a week before the previous season, with Moore training at a summer school for the first time in Westwood’s six seasons.
They are scheduled to start 18 training sessions on August 20 before preparing for the official competition for the Texas farmers in the first battle in September.
Mora said he supported the NCAA’s adjustment of the rules, although this would add another project to the busy schedule of the players.
“In three or four days, we’re going to impose a huge amount of training on them, which is very challenging,” Mora said.
“They’re just passing too, they’re finishing and they’re all great kids.
I thought we’d have more time on Saturday, really great.”
At the end of the training camp, training at the University of California in Los Angeles stopped. Given the clear view of the nearby parking lot and the Luskin Center, it wasn’t an easy task. The Luskin Center Premium Hotel has been scattered with a soccer ball thrown through the back of the gates.
Beginning this weekend, the Bears will stay at the hotel, but Mora admits that problems could arise once the rooms are left empty during the season.
“We will take security measures,” Mora said.
The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in a room to record a training scene is not strong.
If you have a training video tape, it’s also pretty good.
But we will take security measures there, and we will also take security measures at parking lot 8.
We will use the available resources to do our best.
I will not worry too much about this.
We have a plan.”

Facebook Will Launch Fact Verification to Fight Fake News
Facebook announced on Thursday that it will send more potentially malicious articles to third-party detection agencies and show the results underneath the original post. Facebook, the world’s largest online social network, is trying to fight so-called fake news.
Facebook said in a statement on its website that it would start using the updated machine to learn to detect possible malicious acts and send them to fact-checkers, and may display the fact-check results below the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main spread points of so-called fake news, and many believe that Facebook influenced the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
The issue has also become a major political topic in Europe, with voters suffering a flood of fake stories ahead of the French presidential election in May, and Germany being the first to pass a fine scheme ahead of the September election, which would be fined if social media networks failed to remove hate posts in time.
In a separate statement in Germany on Thursday, Facebook said it was launching a new fact-verification feature test in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
Sarah Sue, Facebook News Feedback Product Manager, said in a blog post: “In addition to seeing which stories are questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people want more backgrounds to help them make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing.”
She added that Facebook will continue to test its “relevant articles” feature and make other changes to its news references to reduce fake news.
Creating a painting novel: the story of the castle of England
Recently, the tiny Scotty Castle became the protagonist in the compressed music film, and once became the refuge of Mrs. Margaret Thatcher during the 1970s.
But Scottney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history in a comfortable location in the Baylor River Canyon, Kent, and is now inspired by graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes (a Yorkshire man who has a special passion for historical documents and holds his head down).
“I can see the writings of an ancient man 300 years ago, and I find it so beautiful,” he said with an eager eye.
“What kind of interpersonal fate is it that makes this letter fall into my hands?”
From the Middle Ages to Edward’s time, A Castle in England tells the stories of families living in Scottshire, each of which was written by different, future British artists such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rose’s first book to use archives as raw material: he also wrote Dent and Other Stories in 2014, a book inspired by British Library literature, a work he completed with an uncontrollable creative passion.
He said: “I can’t restrain my impulse to write since I saw the thumbnail left on the side of the letter, which was written by a double agent working for Jacob in the 18th century.”
That was his fingerprint!
And the letters always smelled like smoke, because at that time, you need to light a fire in order to have light.
For us 300 years later, this smell makes us feel like they are with us.
I like the archives!”
For those impressed by the old paper, being able to get the support of the National Trust and the Arts Commission of England and living in the castle for four months (“To be honest, I’ve stayed a little longer”) seems great, just not to believe it is true.
Rhodes spent days visiting Victoria’s “new” castle, browsing the archives, exploring the estate’s many treasures and ancient toys, such as hanging dog heads on walls, and bottles spent centuries in the river.
He walked through the land and ruins of the old castle, chatting with wanderers, gardeners, and sometimes with illustrators painted for him in his books.
Then in the evening he would “drink a whiskey and then write.”
Scotney’s secret history is not very clear, as the National Trust was not fully entered until after the death of his last heir, Elizabeth Hesse, in 2006.
A decade later, when Roth arrived, the staff began handling the files, and he described them as “the aristocrats who were going away hundreds of years ago: ‘Oh, put it in the roof.’”
Diaries, letters from the British Empire period, maps of the territories of different countries: “You would think land disputes would be boring,” says Rose, “but it would happen that two families would fight big for a pine tree.
Let go guys!”
Some of the stories in the work take the castle as a starting point to study the history of Britain on a broader level, including The Labourer, the story of a man who left the newly built castle to participate in the 1381 peasant uprising.
“The story in the book, Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex, tells the story of a riot in the castle in 1380,” Rose said.
“The peasant uprising began in that area, and I think it was a good place to start the uprising.
Per the two are connected?”
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit pastor for seven years during the British Reformation.
Or The Smuggler, the protagonist of the story is the 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have performed a funeral by filling himself with stones filled with coffins (a few years later his coffins were exposed to the ground and people only discovered).
The Darrells, the Scottish castle family’s favorite, said: “These gentlemen seem impolite, constantly borrowing money and spending money on things they can’t afford.
Generation after generation, Darryl men solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy old women, and I think they should be a bunch of cute guys who know how to pursue women.”
As his mission in the castle ends, Rose begins to look for other strange writing experiences.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness to complete a painting novel about El?¤m?¤nm?¤ki, a nursery from the early 20th century that was slowly abandoned.
But Scotty has a special position for him.
“I am very sad to leave,” he said.
“It’s like, ‘Oh, I have to go face-to-face with the real life of cakes.’”

Big energy companies each are "rich enemies", so who of the many energy companies in the world is most interested in money?
Yesterday, the renowned PFC energy company announced the top 50 listed energy companies in 2011, with U.S. oil and gas producer ExxonMobil winning the championship with a market value of $40.6 billion, followed by China Oil and Royal Dutch Shell.
In this PFC list, China Petroleum has topped twice in 2007 and 2009, with ExxonMobil occupying the top of the list in all other years.
In the top 50 list in 2011, there were three companies from mainland China, in addition to the second-ranked Chinese oil, the ninth-ranked Chinese petrochemical and the fifteenth-ranked Chinese marine oil.
According to PFC statistics, however, although the current oil price is much higher than it was four years ago, PFC Energy CEO noted that there are many reasons for the low total market value, mainly including the decline in North American natural gas prices and the low activity of the global stock market.

U.S. changes to green card rules
The media quoted President Donald Trump as saying that the United States would launch a new immigration plan and amend the green card regulations.
The plan aims to reduce legal immigration to 50,000 per year, and temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications will be subject to stricter regulations.
The new regulation was proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be discussed in both houses.
U.S. media quoted Trump as saying, “This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save billions of dollars for taxpayers by changing the way the U.S. issues green cards to citizens of other countries.”
The law will replace the current scheme and reduce chain immigration.
This new application process favours applicants who speak English, have financial support and have skills that are conducive to economic development.”

Speaking of the upcoming 2017 year, Zhao Raytan said: "After the end of the tour next year, I want to clean up myself, and then settle down and write more new works."
In order to optimize the landscape environment and build the beautiful Southern Sunshine, the Southern Sunshine Tobacco Bureau (sub-company) "636" volunteer service group recently launched environmental protection activities "climbing forests, caring for homes".
The activity not only received the support of all cadres and employees of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also attracted retired cadres and employees' families to participate in environmental protection practices, and the three generations of elderly and young people collaborated, climbed forests, cleaned up garbage, and devoted their strength to the construction of the "beautiful Southern Sun".
This volunteer activity is aimed at protecting Southern Shaanxi landscape resources, promoting the volunteer service concept of "treating others, caring for society, caring for nature", and also allowing the next generation to accept smoke from a young age and pass on the virtues of volunteer service.
It is that since the establishment of the "636" Volunteer Service Group since the beginning of April this year, a total of 16 members have developed, and subsequently conducted a series of volunteer service activities such as visiting disadvantaged retail customers, helping tobacco farmers to care for tobacco leaves, and contributions to the earthquake in Yan'an, becoming a voluntary force with the heart to convey positive energy.

In recent years, Silicon Valley giants such as Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook have been waging an arms race in the field of artificial intelligence (AI).
Sex robots are surging, but we should be careful.
Just when you think 2017 won’t be stranger, the sex robot field has released a new report on technological developments.
Yes is .
Sex robots are important.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) released a report outlining the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to Sheffield University Honorary Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence and FRR Co-Founder Noel Sharky, we need to start taking the rise of sex robots seriously.
Customers can choose the robot’s eye color, nipple shape and nail type.
In the release of the new report, Shaki said: “People are laughing behind, but big companies have indeed launched a lot of sex robots, and we’ll see more.”
Modern sex dolls have evolved from full-air dolls to robots, they have silicone skin, touch warm, and also use artificial intelligence to set human-like sexual responses.
Users can also “customize” their bots to suit their preferences, ranging from eye color, nipple shape to nail type or color.
But even more disturbing is the fact that many robots with “personalities” make “replicating females” look so advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicone skin.
For example, RealBotix robots can be defined based on features that users find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots developed by True Companion that can pre-set character traits, including the slightly shy “Cold Farah” and the “Risk-loving” “Wild Wendy.”
“The Roxxxy Gold robot has as much personality as possible as you can,” the True Companion company website said.
So she loves what you love, evil what you do.
She was just as emotional in those days as a normal person!
She can be lazy, she can talk, she can be ‘sexual’!”
The rise of sex robots brings a lot of unrest—not just replacing real human relationships—and the feminine traits of bowing down and the rape hints drawn in the cold (interpreted as: resistance) Farah are the most worrying.
True Companion compares Roxxxy to a man’s shake bar on its website.
The website said, “If women have a shake bar, then why can’t men have Roxxxy?”
However, these sex robots are not a mere love object, nor are they just a sex toy.
Their appearance and growing maturity point directly to the darker, deeper parts of our culture: the escape from perfect gender equality to sex with submission as an additional option.
Of course, most men won’t have sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming increasingly popular, they are still on the verge of consumer culture.
But what has penetrated from the edge allows us to see the course of the era in which we are.
Many people are neither strange nor aggressive until the free market gives them the chance to be.
It’s no coincidence that these subtle sex robots appear at a time when women’s rights are threatened globally, and the White House has a president who boasts of sexual violence against women.
The most frightening part of the TV series The Servant's Tale is not in the realistic picture, not in the hanging body, not in the pair of eyes that were excavated, but in the excessively real imagination.
The Republic of Greece was a leap, but it doesn’t seem far away now.
The goal behind these sex robots is to make as much technology as possible to create the most real female-like bodies (although in proportion to porn stars).
The creators of these robots wanted them to have human touch and imitate real human movements.
But frankly, their “personality” does not represent real women.
They cannot break up or leave.
They had no agency, no follow-up, no independence at all, and nothing that could break the complete illusion of slavery.
In other words, they are fun slaves.
Or, as the 2017 popular saying goes, the maid.
In ancient times, a Chinese elite force to defend humanity, on the world famous Great Wall to carry out a life and death battle with monsters.

Deng said, “On the show, the same thing I’t do, to keep updating.”
The great achievement of Trump?
Make Mitt Romney a shrink of common sense.
Political differences have led to the polarization of U.S. voters and, from a microscopic point of view, undermined the harmony of U.S. families.
After Christmas and Thanksgiving, major U.S. newspapers are filled with commentary columns on how to deal with the fears of voting for Trump’s relatives.
It’s often thought that we’re doing everything we can to break through our “filter bubble.”
Less commentary is Trump’s power to bring families together.
I mention this because my cousin, a leftist poet living in Chicago, has long been in disagreement with the Republicans in our house, who are coming to New York to visit me this week.
She reminded me that uniting against the common enemy can have powerful effects.
Thanks to working with Trump at the White House, everyone she knew, even her Republican relatives who have been fighting politics for decades, are now suddenly and strangely on the same front.
That’s a good thing if you’re at the table, of course.But I’m shocked that from a wider perspective, this poses significant risks.
While the leftists have been fooled by Trump, the loud effect he has brought as president drives us all to turn to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, what we mean is the possibility of concern that his bizarre behavior may one day stop.
However, there is a more worrying long-term scenario that Trump wants to “normalise” relations with right-wing Republicans, who had previously opposed Mr. President’s standards and now suddenly appear to be a symbol of reason.
I’ve recently found myself missing some of Mitch Romney’s epic weirdness: putting a dog on the car, a 14 percent income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), and the crimes of these two moves seem really too small to compare to Trump.
After the end of the Trump era, the next Republican candidate would only have to reasonably qualify for immeasurable improvements.
When my cousin lived in the town, we took the kids to the New York Park’s Rotary Horse, the largest rotary horse run by the New York Central Park Administration, and if you don’t need coffee, this $3 ticket is the most expensive you can buy in the city.
The sound of the horse was as big as a thunderstorm, and the central column was designed for the fiber of glass, and all the clowns and animals turned their heads, looking at their shoulders with horror and dread, while the sound of the sounding music sounded strangely.
Too many vulgar cities are disappointing: the landscape overlooking high-rise buildings becomes old-fashioned, the horizon becomes too familiar and can no longer provide too much stimulation, and the reality of the city does not support the dream.
Thirty-five years later, I haven’t completely forgotten the day when I found out that this “Swiss Cottage” wasn’t actually a Swiss Cottage, but a theme bar, “Ye Olde Swiss Cottage,” I don’t remember, but near a crossroads in north London.
However, the Central Park’s spin-off horse is still a magical experience where everyone can have fun for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old and four 40-year-olds.
If I could evaluate the rotating horse, I would give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week at a grocery store, before cleaning my credit card, I was asked to score one to five stars on my transaction “experience.”
The same is true of the coffee shop in the corner of my street, and you can also choose to score at a 15% discount, which is to buy on the counter.
The effect of doing so is not only slowing down the speed of transactions that should have been neutral, but also putting pressure on servers to add personal factors to unnecessary situations.
The poor woman in the grocery store laughed sorry, while I was tired and the credit card transaction experience rated her five stars.
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital for chest pain
It was the second time that Pistorius was transferred from prison to hospital.
Last year, he was taken to a hospital for a wrist cut, which prison officials said was caused by a fall in a prison.
After prosecutors appealed the original murder verdict, Pistolis was convicted of murder.
Early in the morning of Valentine’s Day in 2013, he shot Steenkamp several times through the toilet door in his home in Pretoria, until his death.
Pistolis claims to have mistakenly thought of her girlfriend as the intruder who hid in the dormitory at night.
Prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal again, this time for a six-year prison sentence against Pistorius, who they consider to be too gentle.
The Prosecutor’s Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa, which could be heard this year.
If the prosecutor wins, Pistolis will face an increase to 15 years in prison.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.

On May 18, the Ministry of Finance announced the "Special Reward Refund Management Measures for Adjusting the Structure of Industrial Enterprises", which will arrange special Reward Refunds to promote the resolution of excess production capacity in the coal and steel industries, with a total amount of 100 billion yuan.
Recently, several local governments such as Shanghai, Shandong, Shandong, Jiangsu and Chongqing have submitted reform opinions on resolving excess capacity.
Among them, many provinces have even proposed to actively seek central finance financial support for their provinces.
One proof is that only eight provinces announced their target of decommissioning coal capacity to meet 90 percent of their national coal reduction plans.
In an interview with reporters at Xiamen University's China Energy Policy Research Institute, Dr. Limbang said that the "de-production capacity" of the steel and coal industries is far from sufficient to rely on the central 100 billion yuan alone, and that more funding is needed from local governments and enterprises to solve the problem.
In the recent announcement of the coal de-capacity implementation rules, Shaanxi proposed to restructure the coal group into a state-owned capital investment company, to restructure and integrate the assets and of enterprises, and to build a new business model.
The actual shortage of funds may be three times the previous subsidy, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security Minister Yong Zemin said that the preliminary statistics "de-production capacity" to distribute employee coal system is 1.3 million, steel system is 500,000.

Do beef, dairy products and chocolate help relieve inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)?
Chicken and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.
But a new study shows the opposite: A diet rich in meat protein and dairy products can help relieve associated symptoms in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
The incurable condition affects the lives of approximately 1.3 million Americans and approximately 300,000 Britons, leading to stomach rashes and bloating, frequent or bleeding diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington typically advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products to ease symptoms, but researchers found that the key amino acid-chromycinate in the protein helps boost the growth of immune cells, which can boost intestinal tolerance.
The lead researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells patrol the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not silently enter the body.
It balances between the cells that cause inflammation and the cells that enhance tolerance, protecting the body from damaging all sorts of sensitive and fragile tissues.
When the balanced state is too inflammatory, inflammatory bowel disease may occur.
A cell that promotes immunity was discovered in experiments in small white mice carrying specific bacteria.
Bacteria need chromosomes (one of the components of proteins) to form the appearance of cells.
Professor Colonna said: “We have established a link between the development of a bacterial population (Royce Lactobacillus, which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiome) and a population of cells that can promote resistance.”
The more chromosomes the mice eat in their diet, the more immune cells they have.
He suggests that if humans use the same approach, a combination of a diet rich in Lactobacillus and a diet rich in chlorine could form a more tolerant, less inflammatory intestinal environment.
Postdoctoral researcher Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas studied an immune cell that boosted resistance when she found that a group of studies in mice had such cells, but not when another group of the same strain was bred separately.
She suspects that this difference is related to the gut microbial populations of small mice (referring to the bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the stomach intestines).
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in small mice found that six bacterial populations existed in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
Little rats are bred in anesthetic environments, so they lack intestinal microorganisms, and can not appear this immune cell, and in the presence of luteum bacteria produce immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system, the researchers cultivated luteum in fluids and then transferred a small amount of non-bacterial fluid to immune cells separated from small mice.
The immune cells develop into tolerant cells.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be demonstrated that the active ingredient is a by-product of the chromosome metabolism, called magnesium-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the number of chromosomes in the feed for small mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50%, but the number of cells decreased by half when the level of chromosomes was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans, like mice, have the same cells that increase tolerance, and most of us have luteinizing bacteria present in our stomach intestines.
Whether humans are able to induce cell development like the little rats in the experiment by inducing the coronavirus by-product from the luteum bacterium in the body, is currently unknown, but genetic defects associated with coronavirus have been found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.
“The growth of these cells may be exactly what we want to get because these cells can control the inflammatory responses on the surface of the intestines.”
It can be said with uncertainty that the high levels of chromosomes present in luteum may lead to an increase in the number of species.
Jose Mourinho believes Manchester United has signed the "genius" Neymar Matic
On Wednesday night, after Nemanja Matic made his first debut in the match against Sampdoria, Mourinho identified Manchester United as a “genius” midfielder.
Matic, from Chelsea, signed gold for as much as £40 million and played 2-1 in the league’s final pre-season match before the Real Madrid Super Cup in Dublin on Tuesday, winning the favor of Paul Pogba and Andreas Perrera.
However, in the pre-Bruce season Asia Tour, Matic’s state of play was seriously understated, completing only 45 minutes, and Mourinho acknowledged the need for improvement before the start of the Premier League season.
“He needs time, but he has the experience, the intelligence and the genius of thinking – he thinks of football,” Mourinho said.
“We will help him prepare as soon as possible.”
Mourinho began arranging his debut lineup at the beginning of the season. Like Matic, new signatories Victor Lindrow and Romelu Lukaku also started the game at the Ingvar Stadium.
The Independent this week that Mourinho still hoped to introduce three more signed players, but he insisted that the club “worked great” and he had four preferred signed players in his mind, three of whom the club has already introduced.
“The club introduced three of the signed players, and I’m very grateful,” he added.
“I would be happier if the club could bring all four players, but they’ve done a lot for me.”
Will China be lagging behind if it does not build this type of warships?
With the world's major naval powers recently announced the construction plan of the new type of escort ships, as if the escort ships had become the focus of the naval attention of the major powers, first Japan in the 2018 defense budget to determine the purchase of two new types of escort ships, so that the Japanese DEX escort ship program finally had a substantial breakthrough, after the US Lockheed Martin recently announced the latest program of the U.S. FFG escort ship program, then China's new type of escort ships should go from where?
With the departure of the latest Type 054A escort ship at the end of 2017, the Type 054A escort ship has built up to 29 ships, which has approached the sum of 053H series escort ships, and since the first Type 054A waterfall in 2006 to date, the construction process of 054A has been 12 years, even in the world, the construction of such a number of high-performance general escort ships, in addition to China, and only the United States built in the 7th and 80th century "Perry" class escort ships can be mentioned.
The reason why so many 054As were built was simple, and that was affordable, useful, and supplemented by years of naval debt.
054A escort ships due to the high cost ratio and good combat power have been favored by the Chinese Navy for many years, its discharge of about 4,000 tons, carrying a 76 mm main cannon, 32 units Red Flag-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missile joint launch vertical system, eight Eagle hit 83 and a straight-9 helicopter, although it was started in 2006, the design time is very early a ship, but its combat power even to the present day is not too bad, looking at the world's escort ships can reach the middle level.
But after all, this is a type of vessel designed in the early 21st century, weapons configuration on the side, its power system and electronic radar equipment with the current world's mainstream escort ships has been compared with a large gap, such as the same type of escort ships in Europe have been equipped with full-power propulsion, small multifunctional phase-controlled radar, large-scale helicopter deck, it is also time to develop a new model.
So how China’s new escort ships should develop is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic orientation of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese navy will definitely become a blue-water navy, and the future will also be towards the ocean, with rapid deployment in areas closely related to China's vital interests, showing the presence of armed forces, and being able to have a strong combat force when necessary to ensure that China's vital interests in the region are not damaged, so it seems that the new Huwei River will inevitably be towards large-scale, remote development.
Looking at the positioning of the new type of escort vessels in the future Chinese naval series, the future Chinese navy should be similar to the U.S. Navy, in addition to the necessary near-sea defense vessels, other main-powered vessels will need to form aircraft carrier combat groups or bipartisan attack vessels strike groups according to the situation.
And the role of the new type of escort vessel in the future aircraft carrier battle group should serve as the anti-submarine main force and the positioning of the near-region air deployment, in the anti-submarine attack vessel strike group should serve as the escort vessel class, then according to such a need to require the new type of escort vessel must have strong anti-submarine capabilities and good medium-range area air deployment capacity.
Based on the above positioning, we can boldly imagine the shape of the future domestic guard ships.
First of all, the drainage volume compared to the current 054A type of escort ship will have a significant increase, the drainage volume of the new escort ship is estimated to reach 5,000-6000 tons around; the power system will use a QC280 improved gas turbine and two diesel engines composed of a comprehensive power propulsion system, the maximum speed is expected to reach about 30, the duration of the flight will be significantly increased; as for the weapons set up 76 mm main cannon and 1130 near defensive cannon should be retained, but will add a red flag 10 launch system, the main cannon should have a 32-48 unit red flag 16 improved and fish-8 shelf vertical transmission system, in the back of the ship should be fitted with a large vertical system for launching eagle and 18 new cruise missiles; the warehouse and stopper platform will also increase, to reach two 10-ton helicopters and storage; in terms of the electronics radar system, the high should be equipped with a multi-charging range.
In this way, the overall level of the new type of escort ships will reach the current world's first-class level, even compared to the U.S. FFG.
Of course, the above concept is only my guess for the domestic new type of escort ship, and how we can only wait until the new type of escort ship is underwater, let us look forward to it.

China's household debt rate is close to the U.S. Is it worse than not buying a home?
In recent times, everyone has been discussing what has changed in real estate policy recently, is the real estate policy to loosen?
But when we worry about real estate prices, worry about macroeconomic regulation, worry about the future movement of the real estate market, the People's Daily wrote again, the last time we specifically discussed the people's Daily's commentary on the regulation of real estate, and now the People's Daily discusses a more serious topic than buying a home, that is, even if you can buy a house, can you pay off the debt?
Today, we’re going to talk about something more serious than buying a home: repaying loans.
China's growing housing debt crisis
The People's Daily overseas edition on January 17 published a commentary article "Award and Loan: Struggle Youth's Joy and Sorrow", according to the data in the article showed that in November 2017, the National Finance and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences and the National Balance Sheet Research Center released the "China Leverage Process Report for the Third Quarter" pointed out that the leverage rate in the residential sector continued to rise, from 47.4% in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6% in the third quarter, up 1.3 percentage points, and 3.8 percentage points in the previous three quarters of 2017.
The share of debt in the residential sector in the entire real economy has increased, and the leverage rate has risen faster.
Studies have shown that Chinese households’ liabilities in financial institutions are predominantly consumer loans, accounting for about two-thirds of residential liabilities, or about twice as much as business loans.
Among them, in the consumer loans, the medium-term loans based on housing loans account for about 80%, but from the point of view of the increase, short-term consumer loans are growing at a faster rate, higher than medium-term loans.
In addition, the Chinese household debt rate is only a statistic of the total amount of credit obtained by the household sector from financial institutions, while many Chinese households have large-scale hidden debt, including private loans from relatives and friends.
According to the statistics of Suning Financial Research Institute, the leverage rate of Chinese residents in 1996 was only 3%, and in 2008 it was only 18%, but since 2008 the leverage rate of residents began to show a rapid growth trend, doubling in just six years to 36.4% in the third quarter of 2017.
In May last year, HSBC released a survey in nine countries with 10,000 respondents.
The report visits “Millennial” youths (born between 1980 and 2000) from nine countries.
The report noted that China’s housing ownership rate for young people after 80 and 90 is up to 70 percent, leading Mexico (46 percent) to the second place, and twice as high as the U.S. (35 percent).
The data revealed a very likely problem: China’s largest potential “grey rhino” is currently estimated to be unable to pay off debt compared to being unable to afford a home.
Why is the housing debt crisis the biggest problem?
As we have previously analyzed, although we have been saying that China's house prices are higher, but in comparison with other countries in the world, China's housing ownership rate is actually quite high, so instead of saying that the house price is not affordable, I am afraid to ask a lot of friends now the question is whether you can afford a loan?
We look at the real estate market around the world, China's real estate market because of its late start, except for Hainan, we have not seen too much real estate crisis, but just a decade ago the world financial tsunami in 2008 was the origin of the U.S. real estate crisis.
The cause of the real estate crisis in the United States is due to two houses: Housing and Housing.
At the time in the golden age of the United States, real estate companies in order to expand the sales of the house with a very low initial payment sold to the low-income population of the United States at the time, the U.S. economy was a good time, the real estate market was also a thriving, but the good prospect was not long, with the U.S. economy appeared stagnation of growth, which caused the income of home buyers to decline, so a large number of household consumption expenditure began to decline.
But the U.S. situation at the time was that the financial assets and real estate assets consisted of U.S. household assets, and in the U.S. low-income groups almost all household assets were real estate, while in the top 20% of the high-income groups most assets were financial assets, so that the poorer people in the U.S. the greater the debt rate of real estate.
A serious fact is that these people are all buying houses when the economy is better, so the money to pay for the loan is also calculated by their better income, and when the income appears to fall, the pressure on the loan not only does not decrease even because some sub-loan plans become floating, so that the real estate problem of these U.S. households under the age has so gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
Therefore, someone can not pay for the loan because of the low income, so the banks began to recover the property, when the bank recovered the property from the hands of the borrowed home buyers, they would sell it at an extremely low price, which led to the region's house prices gradually decline, this process triggered the price of the house further decline, forming a vicious cycle, when the price of the house fell to a certain extent, more and more home buyers found their house value even lower than their loan, so there were more people to stop continuing to repay the loan, and caused more bad debt.
This creates a vicious cycle:
“Economic recession – lower incomes – some people can’t afford home loans – banks sell home to debtors at low prices – house prices fall – more people stop paying home loans – banks sell again – house prices fall again...”
And the problem is more than that, because the house price continues to fall, we stop borrowing the house to the bank after you don't have any debt, if the money you get from the bank's auction house is still not up to the loan you owe to the bank, then you still need to repay the money, simply assume that you have paid 600,000, the loan 2.4 million bought a set of then worth 3 million houses, when the house price fell to this house only worth 2 million, you no longer borrow the house to the bank, the bank after the auction of the house, you have not only lost your first payment 600,000, but also owe the bank 400,000 debt, you still have to repay the money.
So, in such a vicious cycle after that, the U.S. economy gradually collapsed, eventually triggering the 2008 U.S. financial crisis.
So, at this stage, the level of Chinese household debt rate reached 46.8% is a very cautious problem, this data is currently still below the level of developed countries, but the problem has begun to appear, the country since last year has repeatedly stressed the issue of leverage, this is a very foreseeable judgment, if the household debt rate is allowed to continue to rise, it will inevitably trigger huge risks, so to prevent the emergence of financial risks.
So with the house is used for living, not for hiring position, the country more quickly to establish multi-subject supply, multi-channel guarantee, lease and purchase and other multiple measures to further eliminate potential risks.
For our personal family, we must give up the real estate speculative thinking, when buying a house, and do a good job to avoid falling into the huge burden of our own family, only reasonable assessment of their income and debt level is a healthy family wealth development path.

Wanda chairman Wang Jingling辛 worked hard to save this game, online and online were constantly busy, and even personally attended two "Chinese Cup" conferences, and the result became a hot-headed challenger.
Today, many online consumers find the word "smog impact" in their express logistics state.
One of the reasons for the delay of express shipping is that due to the influence of fog weather, traffic control is often implemented, and the capacity is insufficient.
British inventor implants a chip in his body and moves his hands into the car
A British inventor installed a chip for himself and became the first person in the country to open the front door of his home, enter the office and even start the car.
Stephen Northum, 33, implanted a small chip between his thumb and fingernail and is now providing the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, a service implemented by his company BioTeq through technology.
He has worked with Dr. Jeff Watson, a senior advisor at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Hampshire, Winchester, to ensure that the implantation process meets medical standards.
The technique is similar to a cat-dog chip implant and takes only 30 seconds.
Mr. Northum’s company will also replace the locks of the rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, costing £300 each.
The married father with one child has now installed the technology for both his home and his BMW Z4, and he can start the car just by putting his hands on the steering wheel.
Speaking of this central financial and economic work conference, the content of this conference is concerned with the development of the country, but also affects the personal life.
On July 10, the National Bureau of Statistics released the National Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Industrial Producer Price Index (PPI) for June 2016.
The White House cost thousands of dollars.
According to military records released by Time magazine, the White House decided last month to send a Naval Corps helicopter to the Southern Grassland to commemorate the huge glory of U.S. manufacturing, costing as much as $24,000.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D (also referred to as Naval Corps 1 when he was on board) was an important exhibition at the White House on July 17, highlighting U.S. construction projects.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence, and senior White House officials inspected manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibits include a Connecticut-made helicopter, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire car, and a Mississippi fork.
According to the records of the Naval Corps Helicopter First Flight Squad (HMX-1), which operated the helicopter, the White House military office requested that the helicopter appear on a daily order (FRAGO), that is, only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Grassland to participate in the “special” event.
The day before the event, the commander of the HMX-1 said in an email to the senior Naval Corps Flight Deputy Commander, “I just want to confirm you know, because this event is highly valued.”
The information suggests that the helicopter will arrive at South Grass at about 7 a.m. on July 17 for an event at 3 p.m. and will not leave after the grass is cleared at 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. on the same evening.
The information also said that in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, the return flight would require a second group of crew members because of service time restrictions.
The original crew remained on the side of the helicopter during the event, while security forces remained nearby when the aircraft was on the ground.
The records obtained by Time magazine did not clearly state whether a second crew would eventually be needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 had asked if the activity violated the bill.
The commander wrote, “One question we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hack Act and was told there was no violation.”
“It sounds like you’re locked up,” the deputy commander replied.
The White House defines the “Made in America” event as an official activity and is therefore not covered by the Hacking Act.
But even official activities have political colours.
During the event, the president promoted the Senate’s theme of healthcare reform and lobbied for the control of government regulations.
The use of Naval Corps 1 or Air Force 1 aircraft for political propaganda purposes is not new.
All previous presidents were asked to travel on these planes.
However, it is not common to use it for photographic purposes only.
Trump was in the spotlight in February, when he was in Melbourne, Florida, where the presidential machine slid slowly and eventually stopped at the backdrop of his first campaign rally, while his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the former president’s use of the presidential machine.
White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said: “The White House is thrilled by the next ‘Made in America’ exhibition, which shows products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials.”
The HMX-1 crew regularly flight training in the vicinity of Washington, D.C., and the Southern Grassland, practicing the precise placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
During Trump’s visit to the G20 summit in Germany in early July, HMX-1 exercised 58 landings at the White House.
One official said the U.S.-made flight was included in the crew’s training requirements this month.
Helicopter forces also flew an additional 11 hours of “non-presidential support missions” on the same day.
The White House said taxpayers did not pay for any other items involved in the event.
A spokesman for Sikorsky said the company was not involved in arranging a South Grass helicopter show.
HMX-1 does not keep a budget record of the presidential flight, so it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Department of Defense’s 2017 fiscal year instant fee record, VH-3D’s Department of Defense can reimburse $24,380 per flight hour.
The military records recorded a 30-minute flight from a base at the Naval Corps airport in Pattyco, Virginia.
The White House said the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower than that.
Walter said: “It is very misleading to estimate taxpayers’ costs based on reimbursable fees.
These estimated costs include staff costs, maintenance costs and many other sinking costs included in the annual appropriations.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the Department of Defense’s reimbursable costs do not include personnel costs, but do include oil costs, maintenance costs and contract costs.
At the time, former White House spokesman Sean Spike defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
“The idea is to show what’s made in America this week.
And I know Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of this, and they all contribute to our national security, and I guess thousands or hundreds of people will depend on it.
And I feel like most Americans, we are all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, a result of the hard work of countless Americans.
Therefore, it is not untimely to demonstrate this.”
We don’t know if Trump was interacting with the helicopter while visiting the South Grass during the event, but he did sit in the driver’s seat of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump spoke to a Sikorsky company representative and joked about the company’s own aircraft and the media.
He said, “I know the Sikorsky aircraft very well.

According to the Market Star report, from 2005 to 2011, the GDP of our province rose from the center to the second place.
But there are still difficulties such as low investment efficiency and lack of core competitiveness in the industrial economy.For this reason, the latest issue of the provincial economic information center "Economy Blue Page" recommends improving the quality and efficiency of economic growth.
Based on a number of representative indicators of the economy of the province in 2005 and 2011, it is compared with the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic efficiency, in 2011, China's province accounted for a considerable proportion of industrial energy, raw materials and other high-energy industries, which were affected by large market fluctuations and overcapacity "double pressure", at the same time, household appliances, automobiles and other dominant industrial innovations are insufficient, leading to small profits.

The British General Trade Union’s Scottish branch said the company has remained silent about the future of its investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory has more than 500 employees producing products such as oatmeal (Hobnobs) and rich tea (Rich tea).
Pladis, the owner of McVita, said the company has invested more than £5 million in the plant over the past few years.
He added that if the factory operations change, employees and trade union representatives “will know first.”
In a letter to the company’s chief, the British General Trade Union’s Scottish branch called on McVita to “solve the problem of funds not linked to the modernization of the production line.”
Drew Duffy, senior organizer of the UK General Trade Union, said: “We can’t get a clear understanding of Tollcross’s future business needs and investment plans from the factory general manager, which deeply concerns our members.
Generations after generations of families work here, with a high concentration of workforce in local communities and the Greater Glasgow region, which is an important pillar of decent employment in areas with high unemployment and severe social deprivation.
So from the perspective of employment, wages and economic prosperity, in the context of Brexit, rising cost of living and a long-term recession in manufacturing, the eastern region of Glasgow urgently needs McVita to expand its production network.”

Two months ago, we held regular meetings at Tollcross with employees and representatives of the UK General Trade Union to publicly discuss a number of issues.
We discussed with our employees and then, like all other companies operating in a competitive and economically uncertain environment, we reviewed our continuous operating patterns applied to and factories in order to remain competitive.

We are fully aware of Tollcross’s historic position as a production base, and if any changes to our operational operations at the factory, employees and trade union representatives will be the first to know.”

West Ham may regret throwing olive branches at Marco Verrati
After making a £1.8 billion bid to try to enforce the exemption clause, Paris Saint-Germain won’t give up signing Neymar, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of attacking the world recorded assailant?

When Manchester City expressed an interest in signing with Blaise Matthews in 2014, Nasser Alhalefi issued a harsh warning against any club that wanted to sign Paris Saint-Germain’s best player.
“I’m not worried because they know that if they come into contact with any of our players, we’re going to go against them and we’re going to get in touch with their players,” Alhalefi said.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign up for our players, they’ll have their own bad luck.”
Earlier this summer, the Spanish club seemed to have crossed the line, with Barcelona throwing an olive branch on Paris Saint-Germain midfielder Marco Veratti.
Paris Saint-Germain has made it clear that they will not allow the Italian to leave anyway, and Barcelona is likely to be much affected by the loss of the genius Neymar.
