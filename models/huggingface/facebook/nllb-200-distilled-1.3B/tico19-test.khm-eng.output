Rapid increase in coronavirus infection (COVID-19) incidents in the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom from 1 January to 15 March 2020
The rise in coronavirus (COVID-19) cases is showing similar trends across the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area, and the UK has noted that while at different stages depending on each country, the COVID-19 epidemic is evolving rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and healthcare institutions should increase preparedness for the surge of COVID-19 patients who will require healthcare and especially high-demand care.
On 31 December 2019, a case of rheumatoid arthritis of unknown origin was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported the causative agent was a novel coronavirus, which refers to coronavirus type 2 of the severe respiratory syndrome syndrome syndrome (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection has been named Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19).
The evidence so far is that 80% of people with COVID-19 have mild, or respiratory viral infection with or without pneumonia, and most of these patients recover.
In 14 percent of cases, COVID-19 disease progresses to severe illness requiring hospitalization, while another 6% develops to severe illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate of patients discharged from hospital due to COVID-19 was 4%.
In this study, we assessed the trend of the increasing incidence of COVID-19 infection in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom and compared them to Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom with the number of cases in Italy during the period from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
After hitting China, COVID-19 continued to spread, and the rapid COVID-19 outbreaks around the world are currently following China's lead.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
In the 5th issue of Eurosurveillance 2020, Spiteri and others reported the first European-confirmed COVID-19 cases based on the World Health Organization's epidemiological data.
In Europe/European Economic Area, the first three confirmed cases were reported by France on 24 January 2020 to people returning from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been detected in 30 countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, which between 31 December 2019 and will include that date, had 39,768 cases of the disease and 1,727 deaths reported, of which 17,750 cases of infection and 1,441 of deaths were from Italy alone.
Take the total number and incidence of COVID-19 cases.
At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), the number of reported COVID-19 cases in each country worldwide, obtained from official sources such as the Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and the World Health Organization, is updated daily at 8:00 a.m.
All of this data was used to assess COVID-19 infection in countries of the European Union/European Economic Area as well as the United Kingdom and compared all of this data with data from Italy.
As a representative of the active COVID-19 outbreak, we calculated the consecutive incidence of COVID-19 cases that were contained within 14 days, taking into account the normal course of COVID-19 in each country of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom, from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also show the increase in the number of cases of each country reported on 15 March 2020 at 8:00 am compared to Italy during the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
The situation of COVID-19 in the European Union/EEA and the United Kingdom
The trend in COVID-19 cases occurring in a 14-day circulation in the EU/EEA and the UK is following the pattern of cases in Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
For the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom as a whole, the incidence of COVID-19 flu-like illnesses began to increase around 21 February and then increased significantly on 28 February 2020 (additional documentation).
This was mostly driven by a rapid increase in the number of cases reported from Italy, but the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom showed a similar increase in the number of flu-like cases of COVID-19 (additional material).
Figure 2 shows the total number of overlapping COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA countries and the UK, as compared to Italy, for the period 31 January - 15 March 2020.
The report notes that as of March 15, 8:00 a.m., 15 other countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom had reported a decrease in the number of cases, compared to Italy's figure of just three weeks earlier or even less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom.
The observed patterns in the COVID-19 outbreak show that the pandemic is evolving at roughly the same rate in all countries.
This is in contrast to countries at different stages, changing national public health responses and different country case definitions, and different procedures for selecting patients to be tested for COVID-19, including testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the worst-affected areas of Italy reported that 10% of COVID-19 patients in the area required intensive care, and several sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in those areas were doing their best.
Data on the admission of COVID-19 cases in hospitals and/or intensive care units are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected systematically to complement current monitoring data focused on reported cases and deaths.
A study conducted in 201011 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and medium-security care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100,000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or fewer resources than Italy (12.5 care and medium-level care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in 2010-11).
A model scenario involving healthcare burnout was provided in the ECDC's sixth new Rapid Risk Assessment of COVID-19 with estimates for countries of the European Union/European Economic Area and the United Kingdom that COVID-19 patient admissions are at risk of exceeding the critical care bed capacity of 90%.
Because many cases have occurred clustered in a few regions in the European Union, the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, and hospitals and intensive care units typically serve only a designated local population, information on cases and care arrangements should be provided on the territorial unit database for Statistics 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience from Italy and current developments in other countries suggest that the global COVID-19 epidemic is evolving rapidly in the countries of the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom.
Countries, hospitals and healthcare organizations should therefore take care to prepare for new scenarios of community transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which may be circulating, and an increase in the number of COVID-19 patients requiring healthcare and especially high-demand care, such as the one that is occurring in the affected areas of Italy.
As highlighted in the ECDC's new Rapid Risk Assessment, a rapid, appropriate and comprehensive approach is essential to delay the spread of SARS-COV-2, shifting from containment to mitigation, while a rapid increase in case numbers may not give decision makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and respond appropriately if not implemented early and timely.
A rapid risk assessment also included public health measures to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a short window of opportunity in which countries are likely to further increase their control efforts to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and reduce pressure on healthcare institutions.
Failing this, the healthcare systems of other EU/EEA countries may face a surge in patients requiring intensive care in the coming days or weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) caused by coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far killed more than 3,000 people and infected more than 80,000 in China and elsewhere in the world, resulting in a human catastrophe.
The virus is similar to its unique cousin, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003. SARS-CoV-2 can transmit from rats and causes similar symptoms through a similar mechanism to SARS-CoV.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but is more transmissible and affects older people more than younger people, and men are more contagious than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on this epidemic, this article aims to provide a timely and comprehensive review of a rapidly evolving research topic.
We will discuss the basics of epidemiology, causation, pathophysiology, diagnosis, treatment, prediction and prevention of disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope that this review study will help us understand and help eliminate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 was unprecedented and unforgettable for all Chinese, who were urged to stay indoors for the holidays and for several weeks following the outbreak of the novel virus.
The virus is similar in appearance to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).It was therefore named SARS-CoV-2 by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020, and other related diseases were named CoV Disease-19 (COVID-19).
The outbreak first began in Wuhan, China, and spread rapidly domestically and to about 50 countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has caused 80000 COVID-19 infections, with over 40,000 patients discharged from hospitals and over 3000 patients dying.
The World Health Organization warns that COVID-19 is Public Enemy No. 1 and has even greater potential than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 studies have been published on COVID-19, including studies of viral infection, causative infection, diagnosis, and treatment since the first report on January 7, 2020, which identified the virus sequence that was isolated from a wide range of patients.
This review attempts to summarize the evolution of research in the rapidly evolving new discipline.
Wherever possible, we will try to compare COVID-19 with SARS, another coronavirus-caused disease, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, which broke out in 2012).
We will also discuss what we have learned about disease prevention and prediction as well as questions we urgently need to answer.
Normally, CoVs are considered harmless pathogens to humans, mostly causing influenza, about 15% of influenza 4.
However, this century has seen two highly pathogenic human-infectious coronaviruses (CoVs), SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which first caused outbreaks in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and then spread to many other countries with greater severity and mortality.
Thus, COVID-19 is currently the third coronavirus (CoV) outbreak in recorded human history.
As shown in Figure 1.1, a batch of pneumonia patients of unknown origin was first reported from Wuhan on 31 December 2019 to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the sequence of the coronavirus (CoV) was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death from Wuhan was reported.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to neighboring cities, provinces and countries.
On 20 January, infections of healthcare providers were reported, confirming that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On 23 January, Wuhan was closed to public transport.
On 24 January, the first practical laboratory study of the disease showed that of the 41 patients infected, only 21 were directly linked to the Wuhan seafood market, which is believed to be the site of an unknown animal outbreak.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries in the world (Figure 2).2)
As the situation is evolving slowly, the latest status and severity of the outbreak continues to be monitored most closely.
On 11 February 2020, a multicenter study of 8866 patients, including 4021 confirmed COVID-19 patients, showed the following outbreaks of symptoms (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infections occur at all ages, but most occur between the ages of 30-65.
Almost half (47.7%) of the cases were over 50 years of age, very few were under 20 years of age, and only 14 of the cases were under 10 years of age.
SARS-CoV-2 infects men (0.31/100,000) more often than women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 has spread in a widespread or widespread form in and around Hubei Province.
COVID-19 takes an average of 5 (2-9) days from onset to diagnosis.
The median incubation period is approximately 4.8 (3.0-7.2) days.
The mean time from onset of illness to death is 9.5 (4.8-13) days.
The base seed sequence (R0) is 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the correction R0 is 2.23-4.82.
The number of cases surged before 23 January 2020, a time of mass migration ahead of the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate of patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI: 1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate of all patients was 3.06% (95% CI: 2.02-4.59%).
The three major risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (men) (age (age) 60 years and older) and those with severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses, or CoVs, are large, enveloped strains of viruses that contain a single RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, alpha-beta-gamma and alpha-CoVs, and beta-CoVs are known to transmit to humans.
The substrate glycoprotein spike (S) binds to the activation of angiotensin-degrading enzyme receptor 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV respectively, and subsequent fusion of the two enzymes occurs.
However, the RNA gene sequence of the virus is transferred into the cytoplasm. After viral DNA is isolated, the RNA gene, surrounded by glycoproteins and nucleocapsid proteins, forms small water droplets that dissolve with plasma to release the virus further.
The first genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 was reported on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was identified as a novel strain of beta-CoV with a genetic identity of over 99.98% in 10 sequential samples collected from the original site of the outbreak, the Hunan Seafood Market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is more genetically similar to SARS-CoV than MERS-CoV.
Through particle electron microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in the uppermost portion of the epithelium of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been found to be a receptor agonist for SARS-CoV-2 as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S-protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 weakly than binding to SARS-CoV, which is in contrast to the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form novel short proteins encoded by orf3b and secretory proteins encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may play a role in viral infection and inhibits IFNβ release. However, orf8 has no known functional domain or pattern.
February 18, 2020 Joe et al. reported the cryoEM structure of human full-size ACE2 at 2.9 A with a complex containing B0AT1 amino acid transporter.
They found that it was compact, with open and closed conformations, fed into two dimers, and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex able to bind two given S proteins, all providing evidence in the recognition and transmission of coronaviruses.
B0AT1 may be a potential therapeutic target for drug screening to eliminate SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The first and middle rows
It is known that both SARS-CoVs originate from bats and are transmitted to humans through civet rats and MERS-CoV originate from camels.
By comparing the phylogenetic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses (CoVs), bats are considered the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 because the new virus is 96% identical to the coronaviruses (CoVs), which are similar to two SARS viruses derived from bats, bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, what is the intermediate factor that allows the virus to be transmitted from animals to humans is still not fully understood, and its transmission pathway is not yet well understood.
Ji and others suggest that snakes are the transmitters of the virus from bats to humans, involving recombination that is homologous in the S protein.
According to a study, a team of researchers in Guangzhou, China, showed that the long-beaked, round-nosed, round-nosed lizard, often used in traditional Chinese medicine, is the central vector for SARS-CoV-2, potentially based on 99% genetic similarity in the coronaviruses found in the lizards and SARS-CoV-2.
However, the 1% difference that spread to the two genomes is still a large difference. Therefore, a collective conclusion for the actual evidence is pending (Figure 33).
The biochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are not yet well understood.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive for 48 hours in dry conditions and survive for 5 days at 20 degrees Celsius and 40%-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may be similar in appearance.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 is resistant to ultraviolet radiation and heated at 56 degrees Celsius for 30 minutes. 75% ethanol ethylene ether, a disinfectant, chlorine, containing peroxide, chlorophorum, and other non-chlorhexidine metabolites, can inactivate the virus.
The global population is generally immunocompromised to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore susceptible to the new virus.
At present, no detailed studies have been reported on the immune system response to SARS-CoV-2.
So we only looked at previous studies on other CoVs, specifically SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Figure 4) 4.
Generally, after virus entry into the mouse, it is first recognized by the mouse's immune system through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including C-type lectin-like receptors, toll-like receptor (TLR), receptor-like-NOD (NLR) and RIG-I-like receptor (RLR).
By various routes, the virus induces the release of inflammatory agents, the aging of dendritic cells, and the expression of type 1 interferon inhibitors (IFNs), which inhibit the transmission of the virus and increase the rate of cytokine paroxysmal antigen release.
However, the N-protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape the immune system.
Soon, an adaptive immune response will join in to fight the virus.
T-cells, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in the body's defenses.
CD4+ T cells go to the B cells to form a specialised immune system against a specific virus, and the CDC8+ T cells kill the virus directly.
Helper T cells produce proinflammatory cytokines to aid the immune system.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit T cell function by inducing a form of T cell death.
The human fluid immune system, including C3a and C5a reservoirs and the immune system, is also crucial in fighting viral infection.
For example, tissue isolated from recovered patients has restored normal MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, overreaction of the immune system generates a number of free radicals in the base, which can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs and in the worst-case scenario, multiple organ failure and death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is characterized by the onset of group symptoms, is likely to affect older people with the disease and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to large amounts of the virus or those with weak immune function to be more likely to become infected than others.
The average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1-14 days, with most lasting 3-7 days based on a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases showed that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, showed that the incubation period was 4.8 days (3.0-7.2) based on a population of 8,866 cases.
It is critical for health authorities to adjust the timing of effective vaccination based on the most appropriate recovery time, thus protecting those who are infected but asymptomatic from transmitting the virus to others.
In general practice, individuals who are exposed to or infected with the coronavirus are usually required to quarantine for 14 days.
Should I cycle for 24 days?
A fever is the first and most common symptom of COVID-19, which is usually asymptomatic or accompanied by a variety of symptoms, such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, headache, facial pain, sore throat, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea and cough.
Some patients have experienced pain and/or hypoxia within a week of the onset of the disease.
In severe cases, patients begin to develop symptoms of shortness of breath, severe immune reactions, excessive acid secretion, metabolism, and clotting.
Patients with fever and/or symptoms of respiratory illness and severe fever, even if there are no abnormalities in lung imaging, should be screened for viruses for diagnosis first.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that the percentage of symptoms was 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for heart disease and 3% for cancer, and 8% of patients required ventilation.
Similar studies have shown that two recent studies of a family and a group of people caused by infection from asymptomatic individuals.
In comparison, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients had 98% fever, 47% dry cough, 55% shortness of breath, their main symptoms.
However, 80% of these patients require more ventilation support than COVID-19 patients, and this is similar to MERS, which is more severe than COVID-19.
Rabies (26%) and multiple sclerosis (21%) were also observed in patients with MERS.
In SARS patients, it has been shown that fever (99%-100%), dry cough (29%-75%), runny nose (40%-42%), diarrhea (20-25%) and abdominal pain (13-25%) are symptomatic, and ventilation support is required for approximately 14%-20% of patients.
As of 14 February, COVID-19 deaths were 2% while confirmed cases reached 66,576 worldwide.
Compared to the SARS mortality rate as of November 2002, it was 10% of the cases, with 8,096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, based on a June 2012 demographic study, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
Previous studies reported that the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was as high as 6.47, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, whereas the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
Comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of their overall and R0 symptoms are shown in Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is more capable than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in spreading, but it is less dangerous than the latter two viruses.
It is therefore more difficult to control the spread of SARS-CoV-2 than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The onset of the disease is usually in the same family, or occurs in the same group or ride, such as a tour boat.
Patients generally have a history of travel or stay in Wuhan or other affected areas, or have had contact with an infected individual or patient in the last two weeks before the onset of illness.
However, it has been reported that people can contract the virus without showing any symptoms for more than two weeks, and patients who have recovered and been discharged from hospital may contract the virus again, suggesting an emergency declaration to extend the time for surgery.
Patients may have normal or low numbers of lymphocytes in the early stages.
For example, lymphocytes with a white blood cell count of 4×109/L, including a lymphocyte count of 1×109/L, and the presence of a virus in the blood and elevated amino acid levels of aspartate were found in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver, muscle and myoglobin enzymes were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and electrocyte sedimentation were also elevated in the blood of some larger patients.
In patients with severe cases, the levels of D-dimer, a debilitating product of fibrin, in the blood are increased and the number of lymphocytes is reduced in sequence.
Abnormalities in chest X-rays have been found in most COVID-19 patients and have been characterized by double-blindness or a thickening of the lung.
Patients often develop abnormal pneumonia, permanent liver injury and symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When severe respiratory symptoms, uncontrollable inflammation, fluid buildup and progression to pneumonia occur, it can make it impossible to move gas or air inside.
Type I and type II abnormalities of the pneumocytes sequence cause a decrease in surfactant levels and increase surface tension, thereby reducing inaccessible liver capacity and increasing the risk of liver damage.
Thus, the detection of the worst chest muscle reflex often corresponds to the most severe stage of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, a secondary diagnostic analysis of COVID-19 showed the degeneration of pneumocytes, the emergence of coagulation plaques, and the invasion of interstitial lymphocytes and lymphocytic lymphocytes in the lungs of patients who died from the disease, consistent with the symptoms of infectious disease and ARDS, and similar to the symptoms of infectious disease in patients with SARS and MERS.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by trans-transcriptase polymerase (RT-PCR) chain reaction has been used as a key diagnostic feature for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high false positive rate that could accelerate the spread, clinical trials were launched for diagnostics (which do not rely on RT-PCR alone) in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of medical history, clinical evidence, laboratory test results, and X-rays are important and useful for effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Fengshan team described a procedure for using CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technology to detect SARS-CoV-2 virus, which detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments measuring at 20 × 10-18 mol/L to 200 × 10-18 mol/L (10-100 rules per micrometer of input) using a chemical reagent probe in less than an hour without the need for any major instruments.
Hopefully, this new technique can help promote understanding of key points and provide convenience if matched in a real experimental test sample.
Due to the lack of experience in treating this CoV, physicians have only offered post-surgical care to COVID-19 patients while trying to test a variety of treatments that were previously used or recommended for other coronaviruses (CoVs), such as SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table (Table2) 2).
These treatments include current and potential treatments using antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological counseling.
Even plasma from recovered patients has been proposed for use in treatment.
Many pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop vaccines and vaccines against the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 begins attacking the lungs at an early stage and continues to attack mildly other ACE2-producing organs such as the digestive system and kidneys.
However, dysfunction and respiratory failure are a major threat to patients and are a leading cause of death.
As such, respiratory support is essential to alleviate symptoms and save lives and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-fluidized inhalation, and mechanical ventilation depending on the severity of the illness.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a technique to support the cardiovascular system used to treat cardiac arrest and life-threatening respiratory failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of post-concussion viral infections and viral reactions, and protecting the function of these vital organs are all necessary for SARS-CoV-2 patients.
It is known that cytokine storms are caused by strong immune system reactions in SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response expressed by the release of a series of cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines stimulate immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which are the root cause of ARDS and multiple organ failure.
Immunosuppression is necessary in the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in patients with severe conditions.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 antibody, are used to treat cytokine storms.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storms include modulation of immune response that drives T cells, inhibition of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF, inhibition of JAK, use of the drug blinatomab, inhibition of cytokine signaling 4 and inhibition of HDAC.
Steroids, an immunosuppressant, are widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the risk of more severe falls that affect inflammation.
However, high-dose steroid use is not useful in treating severe lung injury in SARS and COVID-19 patients.
Instead, they can cause serious side effects, especially osteoporosis, which affects disease prognosis.
However, short-term use of low to moderate dose corticosteroids is recommended with extreme caution for severely ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of writing, there are no antiviral therapies that have been proven to be effective.
However, intravenous administration of Remdesivir, an analogue nucleotide, was found to be effective in one US COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug developed by Gilead Biopharmaceuticals, initially for the treatment of illnesses caused by Ebola and Marlburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir was shown to inhibit co-administered RNA viruses, including MERS and SARS.
Based on all this, Gilead has provided equipment to China to conduct two clinical trials on humans infected with SARS-CoV-2, with highly anticipated results.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon-α, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin have been suggested as potential treatments for patients with mild respiratory symptoms.
Nausea, cough, vomiting, liver cell damage, and other reactions may occur after combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interactions of these treatments with other medications used in patients should be monitored carefully.
The plague was from the sick who were cured and the creation of the body
The collection of blood from patients who have recovered from infection to treat other patients with the same disease or to protect healthy individuals from infection has a long history.
In fact, patients who recovered had elevated levels of antibodies to the pathogen in their blood.
Immunoglobulins are immunoglobulins (ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight infection as well as other foreign foreign agents that are not in the body, and they may be able to identify which molecules cause the disease and kill the molecules themselves.
Based on this, plasma collected from the blood of patients who recovered from COVID-19 will be injected into 10 critically ill patients.
Their symptoms improved within 24 hours with a decrease in inflammation and viral load and improved oxygenation in the blood.
However, comparative and verification are necessary to propose methods for large-scale use before any specific treatment has been developed.
In addition, due to its therapeutic effects, certain properties associated with plasma should be considered with caution.
For example, the body's immune system response can overwhelm and trigger symptoms of cytokine release that can lead to lethal toxicity.
Blood plasma levels of the tumor are usually low and require large amounts of plasma for treatment of patients with severe lesions.
It is difficult to develop and produce specific organisms quickly enough to combat the global spread of the disease.
It is therefore more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genes that implanted the organ or to screen the organ for effectiveness against the main protein of the virus.
This way, we can increase the production of cells very quickly.
TCM has been used to treat various diseases in China for thousands of years.
However, its effects mostly depend on the combination of several components in a formula that varies depending on the diagnosis of the disease based on the assumptions of TCM.
Most of the effective ingredients are still unknown or unclear because it is difficult to extract and match such ingredients or to store them optimally.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatments for COVID-19, TCM has become an important alternative treatment for patients with moderate or symptomatic symptoms or those who have recovered from the severe stage.
For example, herbal medicines Feng Shui and herbal medicines Hwang Jinwen have been found to be effective in treating COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates for COVID-19 patients were observed in some provinces in China using TCM, where 87% of patients from Guangzhou (63.7%), Ningxi (50%) and Hunan (50%), while Hubei, which used TCM in about 30% of COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rates (13%).
However, this is a hasty comparison, as many other impact factors such as the number and severity of patients should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Bolingbroke and colleagues published a study comparing Western-style (WM) therapy alone with combined treatment between WM and TCM.
They found that the time required for recovery of basal body temperature, symptom resolution, and hospital stay for the WM+TCM group was shorter than the WM group.
Most interestingly, the rates of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) were significantly lower for the WM+TCM group than for the WM group (7.4% vs 46.2%), and the low incidence rates for the WM+TCM group than for the WM group (8.8% vs 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of TCM are still awaiting large-scale, well-controlled clinical trial treatment.
It is also of interest to define the film characteristics of the activity and to confirm the effectiveness components of the treatment with TCM or its combination therapy if possible.
Most patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are very fearful of the infection and are potentially life-threatening, and people who are isolated are also anxious, lonely and angry.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, shortness of breath, and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can cause increased anxiety and emotional distress.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, some serious psychological problems such as depression, depression, anxiety, depression, flashbacks and suicide have been reported.
The need for contact tracing and immunization, which is part of the public health response to the COVID-19 outbreak, can cause some people to become restrained and unresponsive to the impact of infection, immunization and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, individuals suspected of having the disease and people in contact with them, as well as the general public who are in need of this care.
Psychosocial support should include the establishment of multi-specialized mental health teams, clear communication with regular and appropriate updates on treatment plans and the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, and the use of electronic devices and professional software to avoid close or overly close contact.
Effective vaccines are essential to prevent the transmission chain from infected animals and humans to susceptible viruses, and these vaccines are usually in addition to antiviral therapy to manage the situation of disease outbreaks caused by new, more common viruses.
Efforts are underway to develop a vaccine from the S protein to create a robust and long-lasting human immune system and immune system against SARS-CoV.
A live vaccine was evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the efficacy of live vaccines, these trials in older adults and at-risk models, and their protection against zoonotic (animal-to-human) viral infections must be determined before real clinical studies can begin.
This may be because SARS erupted 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported.
In contrast, isolated outbreaks and outbreaks of MERS continue to occur in the Middle East and spread to other regions due to the non-proliferation of zoonotic (animal-to-human) sources in the infected areas.
Vaccine manufacturing strategies have been developed for MERS using viral inactive DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, viral-like particles and recombinant protein fragments, and some strategies have been tested and evaluated in animal models.
The development of an effective and safe vaccine against SARS-CoV-2 for immunocompromised individuals is an urgent and important requirement for containment of the epidemic.
However, it remains a challenge to overcome this challenging situation as a long time (generally 18 months) is required to develop vaccines and rapidly adapt to different strains of CoVs.
As a new strain of COVID-19, it has only begun to make its full appearance in clinical trials when there are already thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients recover gradually without any complications.
However, COVID-19 cases similar to SARS and MERS have also been associated with high morbidity and mortality rates in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, the creation of a model of prognosis for disease is necessary for healthcare agencies to prioritize in their service delivery, especially in under-resourced areas.
Based on the empirical studies reported in the past, some of the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table (Table 33)):
Age: Age is the most important factor in predicting the likelihood of SARS and COVID-19 infections.
COVID-19 occurs mostly in people aged 30-65, with 47.7% of patients over 50 years of age in the 8,866 case studies described above.
Patients requiring intensive care are more likely to have moderate and severe medical consequences and are older than those who do not (mean age 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a determining factor for the outcome of COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more males than females (0.31/100,000 versus 0.27/100,000) as described above.
Confusion and anxiety: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to experience pain from congestive heart failure and severe cardiac arrhythmias.
Heart problems remain the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can invade ACE2-positive cholangioctues, which cause impaired liver function in COVID-19 patients.
It is also worth noting that age and pre-existing conditions are strongly correlated, which can cause side effects.
Laboratory abnormalities: Levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflect the severity of inflammation or wound healing and have been proposed as a predictor of disease progression, response to treatment, and eventual recovery.
The correlation of CRP levels to the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been noted.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), aminotransferase (ALT), and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict outcomes.
These enzymes are widely expressed in many organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released during cellular damage.
They are therefore a common symptom for heart or liver failure.
Key clinical trial symptoms: Chest X-rays and the time evolution of clinical trial symptoms should be considered along with other issues for predicting outcomes and outcomes of COVID-19.
Steroid use: As described above, steroids are immune system depressants used in combination therapy for some infections to reduce the severity of inflammation.
High-dose corticosteroid use is used to treat severe SARS patients. Survivors have suffered vascular and bone disorders that result in lifelong disability or impaired quality of life.
Therefore, if needed, steroids should be used in low doses and for short periods for COVID-19 patients.
Emotional stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients experienced unusual stress as they endured prolonged and prolonged stress, uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close family members and other patients.
It is necessary to provide psychological counseling and long-term support to help these patients get rid of stress and return to a normal life.
According to past demographic studies, COVID-19 appears to be distinct from the SARS epidemic.
In addition to transmission in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively transmit through the upper respiratory tract and cause symptomatic or asymptomatic early stages of infection, similar to other coronaviruses that cause the common cold.
Therefore, patients who are infected in the early stages or in the asymptomatic period can produce large amounts of pathogens during their daily activities, which makes it difficult to control the epidemic.
However, continuous transmission or transmission of SARS-CoV is considered to have occurred when patients were severely ill, while most infections did not occur in the early stages.
Thus, the current outbreak of COVID-19 is more severe and difficult to control than the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).
Currently, a major effort is underway in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuous quarantine of virtually all the population, in the hope of preventing further transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these actions have caused damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new cases is decreasing, indicating a decrease in the spread of infections.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end in March, and the slowdown phase will last 3-4 months.
However, other experts are not as optimistic.
Paul Hunter and others have predicted that COVID-19, which appears to be more contagious than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and others developed a model to predict the outcome of the outbreak and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect up to two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian team reported that SARS-CoV-2 was found in both nasal mucus and gastric mucus of patients who recovered and were discharged from hospital two weeks ago, suggesting that the newly identified virus may be a flu-like cyclical stage.
However, a significant sign has emerged in China based on the declining number of new cases, suggesting that the current strategy may be working.
Ebola was initially predicted to cause up to one million cases with half a million deaths.
However, through surgery, isolation and isolation, the disease is brought under control.
It is possible that due to its similarity to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 may weaken in infection and eventually decay or become a rare disease-causing virus in humans.
Comparisons between the global outbreak of COVID-19 with SARS and MERS are shown in the table below (Table (Table 55)).
SARS-CoV-2 has a high rate of transmission through coughing, sneezing, or can be transmitted through direct contact with any object that contains the virus.
The virus has also been found in the saliva, increasing the new possibility of saliva-to-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of the total cases were likely caused by hospital-acquired infections, with 17 patients becoming seriously ill, including 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, the best precautions should be taken to protect human beings, especially healthcare providers, social workers, family members, co-workers, as well as those who have direct contact with the sick or infected.
The first protective belt that can be used to reduce the risk of infection is through wearing a mask. Both the use of surgical masks and N95 respiratory masks (series #1860s) help control the spread of the virus.
Surgical masks protect fluid inhalation from susceptible individuals, preventing the inhalation from traveling through the air or falling on the surface of other materials, where they can be passed on to others.
However, only N95 masks (series #1860s) can protect against virus penetration with a small diameter of 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virus can penetrate this mask.SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV, with its cover diameter of 85 nm.
Because particles can penetrate even through five surgical masks stacked side by side, healthcare providers who come into direct contact with patients must wear N95 (Series 1860) masks, but not surgical masks.
In addition to wearing masks, healthcare providers should wear separate medical equipment in order to further reduce direct exposure to the virus.
The virus can also be transmitted to a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he was wearing an N95 mask.The virus may have entered his system through his swollen eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear face masks or eye protection vests when working with patients.
For the general population in areas with or highly contagious, all are advised to wash their hands with disinfecting soap more often than usual and try to stay indoors for self-isolation and limit contact with persons who may be infected.
Three feet is considered the appropriate distance for people to stay away from patients.
These actions are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection as well as prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus for the human world, its strong similarity to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have made China more cautious and should have clearly recalled the outbreak of SARS in 2003.
However, until 19 January 2020, the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control misled his citizens by saying that the new virus had low transmission, that its reproduction was still limited from person to person, and that it had no problems preventing and resisting the disease.
This eased the public emergency declaration, especially as the entire country is preparing for the Spring Festival, and it is a critical moment missed in curbing the outbreak when it was still at its lowest levels in Wuhan.
Disease control agencies in China may learn these hard lessons and make significant improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should (1) be more careful when making public announcements, because all words are so important to citizens and can change their behavior and decisions; (2) be more vigilant and responsive to misinformation coming from clinics rather than waiting for official reports from doctors or officials; (3) be more restrictive in order to counter potential outbreaks in the early stages rather than trying to deceive the public; and (4) more often in order to implement informed and effective tests to increase public understanding of skin diseases and to conduct routine clinical trials and responses.
The COVID-19 outbreak, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread across China and nearly 50 other countries worldwide at the time of this writing.
Because the virus is similar in appearance to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has created a sense of a resurgence of SARS.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS that are necessary for prevention of spread and for treatment of patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people and more men than women, and the severity and mortality rates for patients who are much older are also higher than younger people.
SARS was more common than COVID-19 (10.91% vs 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus to others even if they have no symptoms, while SARS patients have no symptoms when they are in a critical condition, which makes it more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This explains in part why SARS-CoV-2 spreads more rapidly than SARS-CoV.
The normal RNA strand of SARS-CoV-2 may not be present in some COVID-19 patients.
In addition, patients who have been treated and recovered may become positive for the virus again.
These findings greatly increase the risk of viral transmission.
With such rapid developments in COVID-19 research, there are some key issues to address:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 originate?
Although 96% of the genetic similarity was found between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-like bat virus, we still cannot conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats.
What is the intermediate animal that can transmit the virus from the original parasite, say, a bat to a human?
Without knowing the first and second answers, we cannot effectively slow down or transmit, and an outbreak could occur again at any time.
Despite molecular modeling and biochemical testing, it has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 can mutate and enter ACE2, but how the virus enters the respiratory tract cells causing the disease is not yet known.
Can the virus bind to ACE2-releasing cells in other tissues?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will this epidemic last?
How does a virus evolve during human transmission?
Will it become a global pandemic, or will it disappear like SARS, or will it reappear like the Great Plague?
It's important, but it can sometimes take time to do research to answer the above questions as well as other questions.
However, at any cost, we have no choice but to stop the spread quickly and get our lives back to normal.
The zoonotic origin of the human coronavirus
Mutations and adaptations have driven the coexistence of coronaviruses (CoVs) and other organisms, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human co-infections with human coronavirus (HCoVs) were found to cause mild illness similar to that of the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have turned the tables on how virulent and life-threatening HCoV infections are.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put the virus back on the hotline, surprising us with its high prevalence but, in turn, decreased pathogenicity compared to its sister SARS-CoV.
HCoV infection is a genotoxic disease (animal-to-human), and understanding the genotoxic origins of HCoVs may help.
Most HCoVs originate in bats, where they are not pathogens.
Central bronchial tumors of some HCoVs have been found.
Animal pathogen identification has a direct impact on the prevention of human disease.
Investigation of the interaction of CoV-hosts in animals may provide important additional insights into the pathogenesis of CoVs in humans.
In this review, we will present our current knowledge of the seven HCoVs and we will focus on the context of their discovery as well as the origins of animal-to-human transmission and species-to-species transmission.
More importantly, we compared and differentiated HCoVs and the theory of viral evolution as well as the reassembly of its genes.
The current 2019 CoV disease (COVID-19) outbreak is discussed in this context.
Furthermore, the need for successful transplantation and the impact of the virus' evolution on disease severity were emphasized.
Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the family Coronaviridae, a group of single-stranded, sub-positive RNA viruses.
These viruses are hosting the largest of 26 to 32 genes, the lobes in the viral RNA, which are called  CoVs because of their spherical shape in the electron microscope.
CoVs have structurally fragmentless genomes that lie under similar loops.
About two-thirds of the genome contains two large, overlapping transcript variants (ORF1a and ORF1b) that have been transferred to the polypeptide kinases pp1a and pp1ab.
The polytetrafluoric acid is further processed to form 16 non-structural proteins identified by nsp1~16.
The remainder of the gene contains ORFs for proteins with structures including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N).
Some helper virulence genes are also encoded by different virulence CoVs.
Based on differences in protein sequence, COVs are classified into four types (alpha-CoV, beta-CoV, gamma-CoV, and delta-CoV), of which beta-CoV has the highest number of HCoVs and is further subdivided into four subtypes (A, B, C, and D).
Evidence from human, plant-derived fragrances suggests that bats and rodents serve as the genetic sources of most alpha-CoVs and beta-CoVs, while birds are the dominant source of gamma-CoVs and delta-CoVs.
Over thousands of years, CoVs have crossed the animal barrier and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronavirus (HCoVs) have been identified.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alpha-CoVs.
The other five beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, acute respiratory syndrome, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 usually cause mild symptoms such as a normal rash and/or ulcerative colitis.
In contrast, the newly discovered SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic agents that cause severe lower respiratory tract infections in patients with a high rate of progression to acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS) and extraspasmodic symptoms.
The first HCoV-229E strain of B814 was isolated from nasal secretions of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, much knowledge has been gathered through extensive studies of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause symptoms of limited duration.
In fact, the theory was widely accepted that HCoV infections were generally harmless until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak in 2003 was one of the most devastating in recent history, infecting more than 8000 people and having a total mortality rate of over 10%.
Ten years later, the Middle East respiratory disease outbreak has been spreading steadily in the Arabian Peninsula, with a gradual spread to the rest of the world.
The 2019 novel HCoV (2019-nCoV), renamed SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which has killed more than 3120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm is ringing and the world needs to prepare for the imminent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
All seven HCoVs are of zoonotic origin from bats, bats or domestic animals.
The abundant evidence supports the evolutionary origin of all HCoVs from bats, where viruses are highly mutagenic and nonpathogenic but show remarkable genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 outbreak has presented serious medical, scientific, social and ethical challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the genotoxic origins of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the nature, motivation and extent of species-to-species transmission.
This could also help guide or facilitate the detection of the viral vector, central vector, and stack vector of SARS-CoV-2, with important implications for preventing future outbreaks.
In this review, we present an overview of the origins of animal-to-human transmission, species-to-species transmission, and the causation of HCoVs.
In particular, we noted and discussed a topic that said that the original strain of HCoVs could not cause disease when it lived in its original host, but it turned out to cause disease after it was transferred to a new host.
We also reviewed the evolutionary hypothesis of HCoVs where increased transmission can often occur with decreased pathogens.
The consequences of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak are also discussed in this context.
CoVs in animals have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the initial isolation of HCoV-229E strain B814 from nasal passages of people with common cold, different CoVs were isolated in animals infected with various diseases, including turkeys, rats, cows, pigs, rats, and dogs.
Over the past several decades, seven HCoVs have been identified.
A summary of the sequential HCoV detection history (Table 1) will provide information and guidance.
The HCoV-229E strain was first isolated from the respiratory tract of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and was later adapted to grow in the WI-38 lung cell line.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E have common flu symptoms including headache, diarrhea, vomiting and stomach pain with fever and cough, which have been observed in 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from tissue culture and sequential replication in the brains of newborn bats.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those of the symptoms caused by HCoV-229E, which are characterized as not different from infections with other respiratory pathogens such as influenza A virus and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are globally distributed and they are prone to being transmitted more commonly in winter in temperate climates.
Generally, the incubation period of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by about two weeks of illness.
According to a voluntary human study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E evolved into a mild, conventional flu.
Only patients with weakened immune systems show severe lower respiratory tract infections.
SARS, also known as SARS-CoV-2, is the first recorded epidemic caused by HCoVs in human history, and the biological agent causing the disease is SARS-CoV, the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first case of SARS may have occurred as early as late 2002 in Guangdong Province, China.
As a result of the SARS outbreak, 8096 cases were reported, 774 deaths, with the outbreak spreading to many countries and continents.
In addition to the high prevalence, it is estimated that each case can cause approximately two subsequent cases over a 4- to 7-day period, and that the peak of the virus appears on day 10 at the time of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially have muscle aches, headaches, fever, fatigue, and dizziness, followed by coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, which are secondary symptoms.
Lymphadenitis, liver dysfunction tests, and elevated creatine kinase are common laboratory abnormalities of SARS.
SARS patients have been observed to have multiple ruptured pulmonary arteries, rapidly growing epithelial cells, and elevated blood clots.
Approximately 20-30% of patients require continuous intensive care and mechanical ventilation.
In addition to lower respiratory tract infections, many organs including the pancreas, liver, and kidneys can also become infected in some severe cases, usually with a cytokine buildup that can be life-threatening in patients with weakened immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from the lung swab of a relative of a patient who had travelled to Hong Kong from a chicken egg.
Since then, a great deal of effort has been devoted to HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old infant from the Netherlands during late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, the elderly, and patients with weakened immune systems with respiratory disease.
Expression of coryza rhinitis, eye blisters, fever and pneumonia are common in diseases caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study reported isolating the same virus from a nasal sample of an 8-month-old boy with pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although they identified it in the Netherlands, they did distribute it worldwide.
It is estimated that HCoV-NL63 accounts for about 4.7% of common respiratory illnesses, and its peak incidence is in early summer, spring and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with colic and inflammation of the pancreas, known as Croup disease.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and pneumonia in Hong Kong.
In addition to hepatitis and community-acquired pneumonia, HCoV-HKU1 has been reported to be associated with acute heart disease.
Similar to HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 has been found worldwide causing mild respiratory illness.
All four community-acquired HCoVs have adapted well in humans and are generally not susceptible to high infectivity, although there have been unprovoked outbreaks, such as the rare case of the HCoV-NL63 subtype, which was recently reported to cause severe lower respiratory infections in China.
In general, once these HCoVs gain the ability to transmit efficiently and to maintain themselves in humans, they become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who developed acute pulmonary and renal insufficiency in Saudi Arabia.
Most of the cases confirmed by the laboratory originated in the Middle East, with reported imported cases having a secondary transmission due to close contact in a number of countries in Europe and Tunisia.
Another second outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015, with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, characterized by a mild, progressive pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many patients with MERS also developed mild pulmonary insufficiency, which is unique for MERS among HCoV-induced diseases.
More than 30% of patients with abdominal symptoms such as diarrhea and constipation.
As of 14 February 2020, more than 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases were reported with a high mortality rate of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the deadliest viruses ever encountered by humans.
In mid-to-late December 2019, a group of pneumonia patients with a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection was found in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak of the lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and has also named the outbreak COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, there are 90,053 confirmed cases worldwide, with a 3.4% overall mortality rate.
It is worth noting that the death rate in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while the overall mortality rate is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infections such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which have also been shown to cause fever, cough and fatigue.
Some who had leprosy were also there.
Pneumonia is a symptom among other serious symptoms and can slowly progress to a severe respiratory crisis.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are similar in appearance due to the 82% high-nucleotide sequence similarity, they branched off into different branches in the genome.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic, but it can transmit more rapidly compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Asymptomatic subjects have been reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2 and may contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparisons and comparisons between SARS-CoV-2 and the other six groups of HCoVs show similarities and differences of remarkable benefit.
First, the incubation and evolutionary duration of HCoVs are very similar.
In this sense, SARS-CoV-2 follows the general pattern of the other six HCoVs.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is dependent on SARS-CoV and the four groups of HCoVs (e.g., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the other hand, this SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibited some characteristics similar to community-based infection of HCoVs, with some uncertainty or no symptoms at all.
In other words, they can also see a small subset of severe COVID-19 cases, as in the case of SARS-CoV infections, although the ratio is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission also shows interesting patterns of community-acquired HCoVs and SARS-CoVs.
On the other hand, at least the replication potential of SARS-CoV-2 may be as high as that of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether there is a decrease in SARS-CoV-2 infection after transmission to other humans, as in the case of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other HCoVs, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in a sludge sample.
Whether orally transmitted SARS-CoV-2 plays a role as important as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least under certain circumstances, remains to be determined by future studies.
It is also interesting to see if SARS-CoV-2 can show seasonal variation as in the case of community-acquired HCoVs.
However, the nature of SARS-CoV-2 that is evolving, including its infectivity, pathogenicity and human-to-human spread, would fuel the outbreak of COVID-19.
All four community-acquired HCoVs that cause mild symptoms are well adapted to humans.
In other respects, it may be true that humans have adapted well to all four HCoVs.
In other words, they may both have survived the HCoV pandemic in the past.
HCoVs that cause severe illness in humans and humans that evolve into severe HCoV infections are eliminated.
For all of this to happen, HCoVs must isolate themselves in the human body to have sufficient capacity to cluster against the immune system.
In this sense, as the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak becomes longer and more people become infected, it will have more chances to adapt to humans.
If the virus is able to adapt well, its transmission to humans will be difficult to contain, even with the application of social distancing or other infection control measures.
In recent years, all four groups of CoVs have been known to infect humans with flu-like symptoms with strong immune systems.
These viruses do not need to be embedded in animals.
In contrast, the highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV do not adapt well to humans, and their replication in humans is not stable.
They need to maintain and breed in their genome and look for opportunities to spread to the most contagious target population possible through intermediate and evolving hosts.
SARS-CoV-2 has similar features to SARS-CoV/MERS-CoV and the four groups of HCoVs.
It is transmitted as slowly as community-acquired HCoVs, at least for now.
However, it is more virulent than community-acquired HCoVs and less virulent than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It is still seen to be fully integrated into humans and run inside humans without the need for a central animal jaw or jaw.
Before discussing the animal origins of HCoVs, it would be helpful for us to discuss the notions and characteristics of the evolutionary, vegetative, tooth, middle and tail evolution of HCoVs.
Animals act as evolutionary hosts of HCoVs if they are closely related to ancestors that share high levels of homology at the molecular level.
Often, the older virus adapts well and does not affect the tumor.
Also, the HCoV host will remain for a longer period of time.
In both cases, the virus is usually infected and is the natural host of the HCoV or its parent virus.
Conversely, if HCoVs have re-emerged in the central nervous system immediately prior to or during their human exposure, they may not adapt well to the new nervous system and often do not cause disease.
The central worm is the source of animal-to-human transmission and acts as a worm propagator, allowing the germs to divide and then spread to humans to spread further to humans.
HCoVs may stop transmission if the virus cannot migrate out of its central incubator.
In contrast, HCoVs can also adapt to the central nervous system and even create long-term transmission.
In this case, the middle tooth becomes the natural incisor tooth.
Data from epidemiological studies have suggested in the past that the recent cases of SARS have a history of exposure to animal-related games.
Blood test results showed that animal traders had higher anti-SARS-CoV IgG concentrations compared to the general population.
Mice and rats sold in live animal markets were the first to be identified as carrying SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
It is supported by the fact that there are no more reported cases of SARS after killing all the cattle on the market.
However, it has been reported that cattle from forest or farmland with no impact on the livestock market are highly negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that cattle may only act as intermediate vectors but not natural vectors of SARS-CoV.
It is worth noting that since 80% of the different animals on the market in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that multiple small animal hosts could serve as the central vectors of SARS-CoV.
All of this appears to be the last major carrier of SARS-CoV.
A continuing search for the natural animal host of SARS-CoV has revealed a close relationship to a CoV in bats called SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3) found in Chinese horse-legged bats.
These mice were positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV and the genetic sequence of SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3.
This virus and other mouse CoVs account for 88-92% of the nucleotide sequence gene type homology.
These studies form the basis of a new theory that bats act as human pathogens.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have also been identified from mice, but only one identified WIV1 can differentiate into a live virus.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be a receptor for SARS-CoV.
WIV1 derived from bat saliva samples has been demonstrated in use in bats, mice and humans with ACE2 receptors for cell entry.
Interestingly, serum serum erythrocytes (SERA) of SARS patients have the ability to inhibit WIV1.
Thus, WIV1 represents the closest ancestor of SARS-CoV in mice, sharing 95% of the acronym sequence with eukaryotic nucleotides.
Although the two viruses are very similar, it is believed that WIV1 is not the original strain of SARS-CoV, nor are bats the central vector of SARS-CoV.
Genetic analysis grouped MERS-CoV into the same groups as the bat CoV-HKU4 and CoV-HKU5 groups.
Bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use a single receptor, peptidase 4 (DPP4), for virus entry.
The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase sequence of MERS-CoV is very similar to that of the beta-CoV in bats, which was identified from Europe and Africa.
To date, no MERS-CoV has been found living in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and CoV-HKU25 in its closest relative, the mouse, share only 87% of the same sequence of the mouse genome.
So bats are probably not the central vector for MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, Middle Eastern studies have shown that camels have immunity to MERS-CoV specifically similar to camels native to the Middle East in several countries of the African continent.
The live MERS-CoV, which is similar to the virus found in humans, was isolated from a mid-range camel snout sample, further suggesting that camels act as the true host of MERS-CoV.
It is also noteworthy that although generally symptomatic, there has been a high transmission of the virus in experimental camels infected with MERS-CoV.
It is noteworthy that infected camels transmitted the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the oral route, which is also a major channel for transmission from rats.
However, questions remain as many confirmed MERS cases have no history of camel contact before the onset of symptoms, which is confirmed to be transmitted from person to person or an unknown transmission route involving an unknown animal species that hosts MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares a 96.2% nucleotide similarity with the RaTG13 CoV in mice isolated from Rhinolophus affinis.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence conversion between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to establish a definitive relationship.
These suggest that bats may not be the central hosts of SARS-CoV-2, unless CoVs with nearly identical characteristics are found in bats in the future.
It is assumed that the midges of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wildlife species sold and killed in the Hunan seafood dump, where most of the first cases of COVID-19 are linked, suggesting an event of animal-to-human transmission.
Several recent studies based on metagenetic sequencing have suggested that a group of small, endangered animals known as manatees (Manias javanica) may also host the ancestral beta-CoVs related to SARS-CoV-2.
The CoV genomes in these newly isolated vertebrates share 85-92% of the same sequence of nucleotides with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with about 90% identification at the level of the nucleotide sequence.
They release two small strains of SARS-CoV-2 like viruses in a large genome, one of which has a receptor cell similar to SARS-CoV-2 and 97.4% amino acid sequence.
In contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 differ, although the same genome sequence is higher.
Recent studies studying infected bats have shown the presence of viral infection in lung samples that are similar to SARS-CoV-2.
The study used different assembly methods as well as fine-grained enlargement of any part of the gene, which accounts for about 86.3% of the virus's genome size.
We cannot count on rodents as the next hosts for SARS-CoV-2 transmission.
However, there is currently no evidence to support the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from the primate itself due to the sequential mutation between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in the primate.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 tends to be shorter than the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in mammals.
It is still not possible to establish the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, rodents and other mammals.
The highest sequence similarity was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and the SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest broad-spectrum sequence similarity.
There is strong speculation that the high degree of similarity between RBDs of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs in mammals and SARS-CoV-2 is driven by coevolution, which facilitates selection.
The proposed alternative is a combination of SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoV in mammals and RaTG13 in a third wild species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among beta-CoVs.
The jury is still out on the immediate genotoxic origin of SARS-CoV-2.
In addition to highly pathogenic HCoVs, the genotypic origins of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been studied.
Fungal evidence suggests that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from CoVs in mice, while the parent viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 were found in rodents.
It was reported that a CoV in bats called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian Ridge CoV) was found in a tricolored bat species in North America that showed similarities to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E has similar genes to another bat CoV named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008 found in Ghana and is also suspected to be a continuous transmitter in camels.
For clarity, current knowledge about the origin of HCoVs in known animals is summarized in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Human-animal analysis of plant fragrances has provided evidence for the historical animal-to-human transmission of HCoVs.
Outbreaks of respiratory infection were recorded when HCoV-OC43 crossed from domestic animals to humans around 1890.
The animal-to-human transmission of HCoV-229E is unclear.
It was found that alpha-CoVs in mice are closely related to HCoV-229E.
Among them is an alpaca alpha-CoV.
Much evidence identifies the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, humans, not alpacas, may be attracted to bats in shared biomes.
In contrast, humans have had close contact with alpacas.
Second, the HCoV-229E-related bat alpha-CoVs are variable and not pathogenic in bats, while the alpaca alpha-CoV causes respiratory disease outbreaks in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-CoV was not found in non-avian mammals.
Therefore, the possibility cannot be excluded that alpacas acquire HCoV-229E-related alpha-CoV from humans.
In fact, bats are a direct source of viruses that cause illness in humans, including rabies, Ebola, influenza and dengue.
It is therefore not surprising that bats can transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Furthermore, while alpha-CoVs in bats act as the agonists of HCoV-229E in alpaca and camel midges, they may act as intermediate transmitters of the virus to humans, as in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as a prime example of animal-to-human transmission, from bats to dromedary camels and from dromedary camels to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV from bats was known at its initial identification and was expanded upon by subsequent discoveries.
It is clear that bats provide a rich variety of viruses for the interaction of gene sequences and transcription from one species to another.
Longevity, large colonies, close interaction and high flight capabilities are the prerequisites for bats to become a viable 'viral transmitter'.
Moreover, MERS-CoV has been transmitted to camels for decades.
It has adapted well to these camels, which have evolved from medium-sized to normal parasitic reptiles.
MERS-CoV causes mild disease and maintains a low mutation rate in these animals.
Its non-constant transmission to humans is random, and humans remain the last strain of MERS-CoV whose transmission cannot be sustained.
If there is some overlap between the role of camels in transmitting MERS-CoV and the role of rodents in transmitting SARS-CoV-2, it is different.
In particular, the beta-CoVs of the spider are highly pathogenic in the spider.
They may be the final candidate for SARS-CoV-2-related beta-CoVs that resemble bats in the SARS-CoV case.
Many possibilities for animal-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 need to be controlled or eliminated in future studies.
Initially, bats may be the host of the SARS-CoV-2 strain, which is almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share an ecological role with bats through their hunt for meat or poultry.
Second, bats may be part of the mid-life crisis in which SARS-CoV-2-related viruses were first transmitted.
Humans contract the virus by killing animals and eating their meat.
It is possible that many pet carriers, including domestic pets, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Domestic and wildlife surveys for the zoo are guaranteed.
Third, as described above, recombination and replication of SARS-CoV-2 may occur in a third species in contact with bats and bats.
The search for the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in animals continues.
In addition to the different types of animal tissue, three major factors on the pathogenic side are also important in facilitating CoVs to cross the animal barrier.
First, atria are highly variable in terms of their RNA transcription.
In comparison to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated rate of mutation of CoVs can be considered to be medium to high, with an average replacement rate of 10 to 4 replacements per year per site 2 depending on the stage of adaptation of the CoV to the new strain.
CoVs have nucleoside isotopes that have the function of controlling deletion, resulting in high mutation rates and reduced or even no viability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide of Remdesivir is known to counteract the self-dissociation of CoVs by inhibiting the enzyme exoribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most successful anti-SARS-CoV-2 antiviral agents tested in clinical trials.
However, the rate of mutation in the morphology of these virus-CoVs is millions of times higher than the mutation in their host.
In addition, the rate of mutation is often high when CoVs are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV with a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is relatively low, indicating a high degree of adaptation to humans.
It is said to have adapted to other insects that are close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to a camel.
It is hypothesized that it is unlikely that the gene pool will be able to produce vaccines and antivirals for SAES-CoV-2 so quickly.
Second, the large RNA genomes in these CoVs are highly variable, which contributes to their differentiation and regeneration. Therefore, evolution from one species to another can occur, which contributes to the outbreak of CoVs at a relatively short time.
It is supported by a full-length, differentially expressed recall schedule and translated protein function that encodes towards the final third of the genome.
Third, CoVs change patterns at random and frequently during RNA isolation through different transcriptional selection mechanisms.
In the liver, which serves as a pathway, line translocation often occurs during the transcription of CoV RNA.
Strong similarities of full-length and xenome subunit RNAs can fuse to form a new CoV.
Evidence of the evolution of the natural recombination complex was found in both HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as animal CoVs such as the bat SL-CoV and the bat CoV-HKU9.
Viral and parasitic interactions are related to transmission.
In addition to the three viruses identified above, viral interaction with host-motivated receptor cells is another important factor influencing animal-to-human transmission.
In this regard, the recombination of SARS-CoV is accepted as a normal example, which also shows evidence of positive selection during animal-to-human transmission events.
Based on comparative analysis of human and mouse isolates of SARS-CoVs, SARS-CoVs are thought to undergo rapid adaptation in different host families, particularly with mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
Generally, RBD in the S-protein of CoV interacts with cellular receptors and is selected in response to human immunity.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is located on 318 to 510 amino acids on the S1 strand, which binds to human ACE2 as well as its coreceptors for viral entry.
SARS-CoV RBD has the ability to recognize ACE2 receptor agonists of various animals including mice, rats, rats, rats, and dogs, which allows the virus to be transmitted.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues were observed in isolation from human and civet viruses in RBD, and all 4 of them are located in the receptor binding band for interaction with ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV in mice has mutations in the K479N and S487T genes in its RBD, which can enhance the closeness of interactions of large-spectrum proteins with human ACE2 receptors.
Specifically, the replacement of these two amino acids may be important in human microbial transmission.
It is worth noting that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same genome as SARS-CoV.
The 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 isoform of the S protein suggests that the affinity of its S protein to humans with ACE2 may have changed.
In fact, cryo-EM studies have shown a 10 to 20 times higher correlation of this linkage than between human ACE2 and SARS-CoV S-protein.
It is also of interest to determine whether other receptor cells may be required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Interestingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different S-terminus.
There are several other receptors for HCoVs, such as aminopeptidase N for HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of CoVs in humans after animal-to-human transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to the neurons for the receptor, the outcome of animal-to-human transmission of HCoVs is also governed by other host-dependent and other limiting factors.
The differences in human host proteins and the natural host hosts of HCoVs such as mice, dromedary camels and rodents may be a barrier to transmission from one species to another.
HCoVs must acquire host-dependent and host-constrained factors for successful transfer of homologous transmissions.
In this sense, molecular markers in the main part of the virus' interaction remain identifiable and characteristic.
Non-specific genomic-wide monitoring of mosquito dependence and restrictive factors for SARS-CoV-2 using the advanced technology of CRISPR may have yielded results.
Emergence of new HCoVs: Back to zero
The diversity of CoVs in bats provides a great opportunity for the emergence of new HCoVs.
In this sense, bat CoVs act as the host of HCoVs.
In addition, slow mutation and gene replication also drive HCoV evolution and play two key steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or deletion of genes that encode new proteins has the potential to modify the protein gene significantly.
ORF8 among the various SARS-CoV proteins has been identified as important in human adaptation, similar to SARS-CoV isolated from mice but found to eliminate a different ORF8 protein.
They found deletion properties of 29-nucleotide SARS-CoVs in the lineage that was isolated at the beginning of the human outbreak.
This deletion cleaved ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, which is understood to be self-cleavage that promotes a disruptive (body-loading) change.
In addition, SARS-CoVs recombine with alpha- and gamma-CoVs, with a large number of small reservoir regions known in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
The reinsertion site is also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and various parts of nsp14.
Also, it was shown that the outbreak of MERS-CoV experienced a cross-linking event between different strains that occurred in dromedary camels in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recurrent events have also been observed in other HCoVs in which HCoVs combine with other animal CoVs in a non-structural manner.
Selection by arbitrary selection should be done with caution as it can cause deliberate genetic mutations of the virus, which can be caused by viral decline through selection pressures such as the immune system of the host.
An example of these effects is the complete loss of ORF4 in the HCoV-229E lineage, caused by deletion of two nucleotides.
While ORF4 is entirely possible to observe in the HCoV-229E-related mouse and camel viruses, the alpaca alpha-CoV exhibits a single nucleotide insertion that causes a deformation.
Finally, the evolution of new HCoVs is also driven by pressure selection in their host cells.
An unclear or symptomatic pattern is found when the bat is infected with CoVs, suggesting a crossover between CoVs and the bat.
It showed that the bats were well adapted to the physiology and biology of CoVs.
For example, errors in activation of the anti-inflammatory response in mice effectively reduced the pathogenesis caused by CoVs.
In addition, natural killer cell activity in rats was suppressed due to increased cellular responses of the NKG2/CD94 natural killer cell receptor and low levels of resistance of the concentrated first-order molecule of homology of the different genes.
In addition, highly reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from high metabolic activity of bats can inhibit CoV transmission and affect exoribonuclease diagnosis, thus providing selective pressure for the formation of highly infectious viruses upon entry into new tissues.
Many other pathogens of the CoV family can also evolve by recombination, leading to new proteins or proteins that are specific to their host.
It is therefore not surprising that three groups of HCoVs have emerged in the past two decades.
CoVs are not pathogens or they simply cause symptoms in infected tissues such as rats and camels.
They work vigorously without causing a strong immune response.
Here is the secret of detecting asymptomatic transmitting agents and the cause of serious human cases.
Most severe symptoms are caused by a decrease in the immune system and cytokine counts, with an increased immune response leading to more severe liver damage.
Conversely, if you are infected but have no symptoms, it means that the immune system is not yet active in the process of breaking down the CoV.
The same strategy of cutting down on immune system responses may be beneficial in treating SARS-CoV-2.
The response of the enzyme pherone is particularly strong in rats.
Therefore, the use of type I interferon-expressing proteins at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans should be beneficial.
Furthermore, activation of NLRP3 inflammation in mice was not effective.
For this reason, inhibition of NLRP3 inflammation with MCC950 may be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the prevalence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
The Beta-CoV shared 95% of the nucleotides that are similar to the SARS-CoV we found.
Other mammals and animals in the market have been found to have similar viral affinities to SARS-CoV, but the direct mediator for SARS-CoV-2 is unknown.
Beta-CoVs in bats were found to be highly similar to SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that bats could act as one of several hosts, or that Beta-CoVs could help provide genetic input to the next generation of SARS-CoV-2.
Although there are still doubts, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 was deliberately or accidentally created by humans.
CoVs have returned to normalcy due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of CoVs in bats and other animals has significantly changed our understanding of the importance of the origin of animal-to-human transmission and the location of HCoVs in human transmission.
Transmissive evidence suggests that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and were transmitted to humans via central nervous system.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from human-civet (snakes-like) contact in markets, closing markets selling meat and poultry and killing civets should have effectively ended the SARS outbreak.
For the same reason, bats should be removed from the market with a vaccine to prevent zoonotic (animal-to-human) transmission due to the multiple guest sightings of a genus of bats in which beta-CoVs of bats are closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, how and whether SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans through rodents and other animal hosts remains to be clarified in future investigations.
MERS-CoV, on the other hand, has long had dromedary camels.
These camels play an important role as a means of transportation as well as an important source of meat, milk, leather products and wool for the local people.
They have spread rapidly throughout the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is not possible to kill all camels to control MERS, as was done in the wildlife market in China to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To prevent a recurrence of MERS outbreaks, an approach should be taken to develop an effective vaccine against MERS-CoV for camels in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we cannot eliminate these viruses, new genotypes may emerge, causing an outbreak.
Animal-to-human CoVs are circulating in the wild.
In particular, the CoVs in bats that can be transmitted from animals to humans are different.
There is a high chance that these CoVs may evolve or re-occur, causing new CoVs that could cause transmission and death in the future.
China should abandon the culture of wildlife eating in some parts of the country to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Better preparedness and response planning should be in place with the painful experience of SARS, MERS and COVID-19.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time.
They hide in their normal dens until they have a chance to scare off the transmission.
Although bats have many characteristics that aid in the spread of the virus, humans can reduce the risk of contact with bats and other wildlife species at a minimum if they are educated to stay away from them.
Continuous monitoring of animal hosts is necessary for a better understanding of the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which will demonstrate benefits in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In short, an effective method of preventing zoonotic diseases is to keep people away from the ecosystems where the pathogens can be transmitted to humans.
Many fragments are still missing in the genome of the genome of SARS-CoV-2.
First, if bats transmit SARS-CoV-2 ancestor viruses to bats, it is interesting to see under what conditions bats and bats can be ecologically similar.
Second, if bats play a more direct role in transmitting to humans, they should monitor how humans interact with bats.
If the third animal host acts as a central host, they are only specifically stating how it interacts with other species, including humans, bats, and reptiles.
Finally, some pet owners, including pets, may also be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, and both surveillance and experimental infection should be done.
If a bat, a lizard, or another animal host, it is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or its nearly identical parent virus will be identified in its normal host in the future.
Further investigations in this area will help to reveal how SARS-CoV-2 evolves in animals, which is important for the prevention and management of COVID-19 in humans.
Updating the COVID-19 diagnostic characteristics of suspected and confirmed cases is necessary.
On 6 February 2020, our team published a Rapid Guidance for the Diagnosis and Treatment of New Coronavirus Infection 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guide provides our experience and a framework document for the fight against the pandemic worldwide.
But coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge are constantly increasing based on the results of ongoing research and practical experience. Therefore, the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are also constantly updated.
In this document, we respond to a comment on our guidelines and provide an updated assessment of suspected cases and infections in accordance with the latest Diagnostic and Treatment Guidelines for COVID-19 (Seventh Edition) issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, now officially named Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat the SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, our team quickly developed and published online guidelines in military medical research on February 06, 2020.
It has attracted a lot of attention since its release.
However, please note that COVID-19 is a new disease, our understanding and knowledge are constantly increasing based on ongoing research results and clinical practice experience, so the strategies of diagnosis and treatment are constantly updated.
For example, the Guidelines on Diagnosis and Treatment for COVID-19 issued by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (January 16, 2020 to March 3, 2020) issued a statement, a total of seven publications, some of which contain substantial changes.
Now our guidelines have been articulated by Zhou et al. They suggest a simple scoring proposition based on their clinical experience.
Their work adds new evidence to our guidelines and is a valuable reference document for the pandemic worldwide.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
But their work also needs updating in line with the latest guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 (seventh trial edition) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (March 3, 2020), to confirm a suspected case, it is necessary to combine one of the elements of the epidemiological nature of the disease with two elements of symptomatic manifestation to perform a comprehensive analysis, or the need to satisfy three symptoms if the epidemiological history is unclear:
Epidemic history: (1) history of travel or stay in Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities where COVID-19 cases have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with SARS-CoV-2 infection (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with a feverish patient or respiratory symptoms from Wuhan and surrounding areas or other communities with COVID-19 cases reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with a cluster of cases (≥ 2 cases and/or symptoms of infection occurred within 2 weeks, in a small area, etc.);
Expression of medical symptoms: (1) fever and/or respiratory symptoms; (2) with a characteristic picture of COVID-19 infection; (3) total blood cell count indicating normal decline or reduced lymphatic count at early onset.
Diagnosis of infection should be based on suspicion with any pathogenic material or evidence of the following: (1) timely PCR testing positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) the entire genome sequence of the virus shows high similarity to known coronaviruses; (3) positive for specific IgM antibodies and specific IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in serum testing; or change the specific IgG antibodies of SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive; or increase Ig ≥ 4 times in the recovery phase of the early stage.
We can see that the polymerase chain reaction test for interferon nucleic acid in a urinary tract or blood sample was included in the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
The detection of pathogens of blood samples was included in the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions, and then the evidence from blood analysis was included in the seventh edition.
These changes are based on researchers continuing to work to find the best nucleic acid detectors for rapid diagnosis, as well as samples from the respiratory tract, including blood samples, which increase the availability of different samples and help bring positive results of antibodies into the diagnostic profile.
In addition, there is a growing body of evidence that warns us to be cautious with patients who have abnormal and asymptomatic symptoms.
Therefore, the flow table of Zhou et al. should be updated because they consider people without clinical symptoms to be at low risk.
Scoring systems also need to be incorporated into further practice and clinical studies.
To conclude, we hope more direct evidence will come in and invite readers to provide their own feedback.
For diagnosis of suspected cases and cases of infection, we recommend that the latest guidelines of their country of origin be followed and followed.
Our team will update our guidance in a timely manner to provide assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest daily rate
Yesterday, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 on that day.
This is the highest number of deaths per day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Institute for Epidemic Control, Control and Research (IEDCR), Bangladesh, reported that the number of recorded cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were staying at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
Through an online briefing, the director of IEDCR, Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora, said the dead included four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years of age, two were between 51 and 60 years of age and one was 41-50 years of age.
She also said that the two victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a pandemic.
Hospital officials told Anadolu Agency, a local media outlet, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, head of the Bengali Anti-Corruption Committee, who was being cared for at Kuwait Ma'ariv Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video statement, Bangladesh's Minister of Transport, Roads and Bridges Obaidul Quader said public transport will be closed for a longer period than planned until next Saturday.
This public travel closure initially began on 26 March and is scheduled to end on Saturday 4 April.
Transportation of essential goods such as medical supplies, fuel and food are still permitted.
An initial report on 8 March showed that two people who had returned from Italy, one of whom was the husband's wife, had also been infected with Covid-19 in Bangladesh.
The three Canaries were cured as of 19 March.
SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than one million people worldwide
According to Johns Hopkins University data on Thursday, the number of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections has risen to more than one million worldwide.
At least 52,000 people have died in connection with COVID-19 caused by the coronavirus.
A major development occurred on the same day Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infection and Zimbabwe had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea claimed on Thursday that it was one of the few countries that remained free of coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, of which 79,332 were in the four hours before 10 a.m. central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 coronavirus cases have been recorded, with at least 5,900 deaths associated with the disease.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that more than 1,000 people died on Wednesday from coronavirus infections.
Around the world, many countries have declared strict measures to prevent the disease from spreading.
On Thursday, Moscow Governor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
Nationwide, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will be paid without having to go to work until April 30.
Portugal voted to extend the state of emergency by 15 days. The vote was passed with 215 votes in favour, ten against and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia has extended a day-long curfew in the main cities of Mecca and Medina.Previously, curfews were in effect between 3pm and 6am.
Thailand plans to implement curfews between 10pm and 4am.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state has extended its curfew until May 1.
Stores in Australia have a low rate of paper use per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian retailers Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchases of toilet paper to two and one pack per operation in all stores nationwide.
On Monday, ALDI also introduced a package limit.
These limits were posted as messages on checkpoints and on the Facebook channel.
Customers are reportedly buying items in reserve due to COVID-19 fears in case they need to stay in quarantine.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited its purchase of toilet paper for home delivery to one package per order.
These changes were made following the four-tiered restrictions on one-time purchases previously introduced by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 December respectively.
"In its media release on 8 March, Supermarket Coles reported that with the restriction of four packages, ""many stores were sold out of stock within an hour of shipping"" and called the demand "unprecedented", while Supermarket ALDI called it "unexpected" in a Facebook post on Tuesday".
According to a Woolworths spokesperson, sales "grew significantly" last week.
Costco's Canberra store also capped the number of allowed packs last week.
To reduce the shortage, Coles ordered large packages from suppliers and to speed up shipping, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI created stock for the project, which was planned for a special battery first.
Russell Zimmerman, president of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers were trying to stockpile the fuel, but local council restrictions on import trucks were causing problems.
He expects the initial production costs to rise as suppliers try to keep up with demand and have fewer specialised skills.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that after the initial stock release, some stores could not run Wednesday specials.
In a News.com.au report, Dr Gary Mortimer, a retail specialist from Queensland University of Technology, said these stores fill up every night.
He noted that toilet paper is a two-piece, hollow material that makes the quantity in stock small and when sold out, leaving room for large containers makes it feel scarce.
Russell Zimmerman told ABC News that "Colas and Volvo are of the view [that] if there are more items on the market, if products like toilet paper and toiletries can be bought and there are quantities, you can probably reduce the fear a lot".
Who Gives a Crap, a company that makes toilet paper made from recycled paper, said on Wednesday that it was out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex Toilet Tissue and Solaris Tissue brands and manufactures respiratory care equipment, confirmed that they are working 24/7 to maintain the supply, according to a report by News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that a real estate seller was giving away free toilet paper to the first bidder at an auction in Melbourne when a few bids were made because buyers were off on Labor Day weekend.
Thursday's edition of NT News, a daily print in Darwin, included eight pages of entries meant to be cut and used as toilet paper.
At first, stores were hesitant to impose the restrictions, according to a report from ABC Australia on 3 March, saying they had no plans to introduce such restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including face masks, sanitizers, dryers, hand dryers and shampoos.
Similarly, this Sunday afternoon outside Australia, the UK's Ocado online supermarket was observed to have placed a cap on the purchase of Andres brand toilet paper up to two 12-packets.
The World Health Organization has declared a COVID-19 pandemic.
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced an outbreak of COVID-19 caused by a virus caused by SARS-CoV-2.
Although the term "epidemic" refers to how the disease spreads and not just to specific cases of such a threat, the World Health Organization notes the need to urge governments to take action:
 All countries can still change the course of the pandemic.
Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director-general of the World Health Organization, said that if countries discovered a clinical trial, isolate them and mobilize their populations in response.
We are deeply concerned both by the emergency level of outbreak and severity and the emergency level of inactivity.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
In his speech broadcast by CNN in February, he said that "apart from influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced from its emergence until there has been a continuing global outbreak".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying, "We have never seen a coronavirus pandemic before".
"He continued, ""and we have never seen an epidemic that can be controlled at the same time"."
The new pandemic follows a decision by WHO in January declaring the spread of the disease a public health emergency of international concern.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said the outbreak "is going to get worse".
As of Thursday, the news agency reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 201920 coronavirus outbreak is a continuation of the outbreak of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19 disease), which is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported from 210 countries and territories, with approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people were cured.
The prevalence rate is estimated at about 4% in China, while for the rest of the world it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to .08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and severe respiratory symptoms.
From the time of contact to the time of onset of symptoms, they are usually detectable within five days, but can be detected between two and fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or treatment with specific antiviral drugs.
Early treatment is symptom-based and supportive.Recommended prevention measures include hand washing, mouth-covering when coughing, keeping distance from others, and monitoring and quarantining for those suspected of being infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, bans, workplace hazard monitoring and lockout.
The pandemic has caused global economic, social, and political disruptions, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political, and cultural events, and uncertainty, supply shortages caused by fear-based shopping.
Schools and universities have closed nationally or regionally in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4 percent of the world's students.
Fake information about the virus has spread widely online, and there is also a phenomenon of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese, other people of East Asian and Southeast Asian origin and similar appearance, and others from areas with cases.
Due to reduced travel and severe industrial closures, there has been a decline in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a case of pneumonia of unknown cause on 31 December 2019, and an investigation was launched in early January 2020.
Most of the cases have been related to the Hunan seafood market and thus the virus is thought to have originated in the Zuno.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to the rat coronavirus, the rat coronavirus and SARS-CoV.The first symptomatic individual was later found to have fallen ill on 1 December 2019, and the individual was not in direct contact with the virus group found in the spice market.
In the first cases reported in December 2019, two-thirds of the patients were found to have originated from that market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case on 17 November 2019, a 55-year-old from Hubei Province, was probably the first.On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization reported that new cases were reported to have declined in China, but that there was a sudden increase in Italy, Iran and South Korea, with the number of new cases outside China surpassing the number of new cases in China for the first time.
There may be no reported cases, especially among those with mild symptoms.
As of 26 February, some cases were reported among young people aged 19 and under, and 2.4% of cases worldwide.Patrick Vallance, UK's scientific adviser, estimated that 60% of the UK population would be infected before effective herd immunity was achieved.
Cases refers to the number of people who have been tested for COVID-19 and whose tests have been confirmed to be positive, according to the official ceremony.
As of 23 March, no country had tested three percent of its population, and many countries have issued official guidelines not to test for mildly diagnosed cases, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March found that in China, as of 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections were undetected, and unrecorded infections were the source of 79% of recorded cases.
A statistical analysis released on 30 March estimated that the number of infections in Italy was higher than the number of reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline sequence number (R0) for COVID-19 are 1.4 to 2.4.
A study released by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention concluded that it was likely to be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 have recovered.
For countries without a time of symptom development, the time to death is between 6 and 41 days, with a maximum duration of 14 days.
As of 10 April 2020, there have been approximately 97,000 deaths caused by COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of the deaths were over 60 years of age, and 75% were due to coronary artery disease and stroke.The official death toll from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to deaths that tested positive for COVID, according to official figures.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 could be higher because it does not include people who died without being tested - e.g. at home, in care facilities, etc.
Partial data from Italy found that the number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the total number of deaths covered by official services by a factor of 4-5x.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledged that "we know [the death toll] is an overestimation", a statement confirmed by reports of unreported deaths in the U.S. Such overestimates often occur during outbreaks, such as the 2009 H1N1 flu. The first death was in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on 1 February in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
As of 28 February, outside mainland China, several deaths have been recorded in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths on all continents except Antarctica.Many measures were used to determine the death toll.
These figures vary by region and time period, and are influenced by the quantity of testing, the quality of the health system, treatment options, time since the initial outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and general health.They reflect the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time period.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global death rate was 6.0% (97,039/1617,204) as of April 10, 2020.
The numbers vary by region.
In China, estimates of the ratio of deaths decreased from 17.3% (for those with symptoms beginning on 110 January 2020) to 0.7% (for those with symptoms beginning after 1 February 2020).Other measures included case-by-case mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of those diagnosed who died from the disease, and infectious mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infections (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from the disease.
These statistics did not time and track specific populations from infection through case resolution.
Some studies have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates the infection rate for the pandemic as a whole to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimates of this range are consistent with results from the first randomized test for COVID-19 in Germany and a statistical analysis of the impact of the test on the CFR estimates.
WHO claimed that the epidemic was manageable.
The peak and end times of the outbreak are uncertain and may vary by location.
Maciej Boni at Penn State University has shown that in the absence of general surveillance, outbreaks increase and then begin to decrease once the disease is eliminated.
But it is almost impossible to make a reasonable estimate at this time of when it will happen.
Zhong Nanshan, senior medical adviser to the Chinese government, claimed that it could be completed by June if all countries could be brought together to follow the World Health Organization's recommendations on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
"On March 17, Adam Kucharski from the School of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene suggested that SARS-CoV-2 ""could continue to circulate in one or two years""".
"According to a study by Imperial College led by Neil Ferguson, physical monitoring and other measures will be necessary ""until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or longer) """.
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it's probably impossible that this coronavirus, because it's already adapted for transmission, won't go away completely, and it can morph into a seasonal disease, potentially making it come back every year".
The intensity of the outbreak can vary depending on the immunity of the population and the extent of the variation.
COVID-19 symptoms can be uncertain, and infected individuals may no longer have symptoms.
The two most common symptoms were fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Rare symptoms include fatigue, phlegm production, loss of olfactory sensation, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, dry mouth, headache, cancer, cough, bleeding, rash or skin discoloration. WHO states that about one in six people have severe pain and respiratory distress.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists side symptoms as shortness of breath, chronic chest pain or sudden confused pressure, dizziness, and a blue face or mouth. Urgent medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present. Continued progression of the disease can lead to severe pneumonia, shortness of breath, diarrhea, diarrhea, and death.
Some infected people may not have symptoms, but there are test results that confirm viral infection, so researchers suggest that those who have been in close contact with infected people should be monitored and closely monitored to prevent transmission.
China's estimate of the non-exhibition ratio is low at 44%.
A typical incubation period (the time between infection and onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days, with a general duration of five days.An example of uncertainty is the estimated proportion of people with COVID-19 who initially lose their sense of smell at 30% and subsequently decrease to 15%.
Some details about how the disease is spread are still unclear.
The disease is believed to be spread primarily during close contact and by small fluidic secretions produced during coughing, sneezing, or talking, with close contact ranging from 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies have found that uncontrolled coughing can cause mouthwash to come out from 4.5 meters (15 feet) to 8.2 meters (27 feet).
Some have suggested that the virus can also be transmitted by small fluid droplets that remain in the atmosphere for long periods of time, which can be generated during speech.
Mouthwash can be dropped on the mouth or nose of nearby people or can be absorbed into the lungs by inhalation.
Some medical procedures, such as intravenous blood transfusion and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause breathing, which drains the lungs and can cause airway transmission.
It can also be spread when a person touches a hair surface, including the skin, and then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
While there are concerns that it could be spread by mosquitoes, the risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious in the first three days after onset of symptoms, although transmission can occur before symptoms appear and in later stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that infection is possible before the development of major symptoms.
There have been few reports of asymptomatic cases that have been laboratory-confirmed, but the transmission of Ebola has been limited by some countries during follow-up investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) stated that while it is not yet fully clear how the disease spreads, one person can transmit to two to three others.The virus can survive for hours to days on surfaces.
Specifically, the virus was found to survive on polypropylene for three days, 304 hours on inox, one day on paper, cardboard and up to four days on a flag.
However, this point varies depending on taste and temperature.Domestic and other animals have tested positive for COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities recommend washing your hands after contact with animals, such as after other external contact with infected humans.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus that was initially isolated from three people with pneumonia associated with a case of acute respiratory syndrome in Wuhan.
All of the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 are present in viruses related to the coronavirus in nature.Outside the human body, the virus will be eliminated by household soap, which can be digested under its protective cover.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV.
The disease is thought to have originated from animal infection.
Genetic analysis showed that the coronavirus is genetically related to the betacoronavirus belonging to the subfamily B of saproviruses, along with two species of bats.
It is 96 percent similar at the genetic level to other bat coronavirus strains (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers found that there was only a single amino acid difference in a specific part of the genome between viruses from reptiles and genes from humans.
Overall genetic comparisons found that almost 92% of the shared genetic material between bats and SARS-CoV-2 was insufficient to establish a moderate host bats.
Viral infection can be provisionally diagnosed based on initial symptoms, although final confirmation must be made by negative polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay of the material being copied or CT scan.
A comparative study of the reaction of polymerase to C in Wuhan showed that C is more sensitive to polymerase reactions, with many of its characteristics overlapping with hepatitis and other disease processes, although not specific.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that CT should not be used for diagnosis or be used as a first-line test for COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has published several RNA test protocols for SARS-CoV-2, with the first release on 17 January.
Testing using the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
Testing may be done on a sample of the respiratory tract or blood.
Results are generally within a few hours to a day.
Generally, this test is performed on nasal mucus, although nasal swabs can also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing a fluid test that detects a tumor.
As of 6 April 2020, these documents have not been proven to be accurate enough to be approved for general use.
In the United States, the silyl-developed test is approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristics of imaging on radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans of people with symptoms include a lack of light on the ground and a lack of glare.
The Italian Radiological Society is compiling international online data on imaging findings for confirmed cases.
Due to the overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, imaging without PCR is particularly useful in the identification of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared chest CT test results with PCR and pointed out that although the images are not as accurate for transcription, they are faster and more responsive, suggesting that its test is a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Neural networks based on artificial brain solutions were developed to capture images of viruses containing both X-rays and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent transmission include good personal hygiene, hand washing, avoiding unwashed eyes, nose or mouth, and coughing or sneezing with a tissue, and discarding the tissue immediately.
Anyone who may already be infected is advised to wear a surgical mask in public.
Isolation measures are also recommended to prevent infection.Many governments have imposed restrictions or recommendations to prohibit non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in large parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading in the community and some community members do not know where and how they are infected. Health care providers who are caring for someone who may be infected with the virus are advised to use standard precautions, contact and eye protection. Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to identify the source of infection and to prevent further infection.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issuing a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
Various mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 April 2020, several expert groups are working on privacy solutions such as the use of Bluetooth to locate nearby users.
Users will receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.Misintentions that are being propagated about ways to prevent infection; for example, rinsing the nose and mouth with mouthwash are not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although several organizations are working on developing one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least two seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when hands can be seen to be dirty before eating and after coughing, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by the household soap, which causes its defenses to explode.
The CDC further recommends using hand washes containing at least 60% alcohol when soap and water are not readily available.
WHO advises people to avoid eye, nose or mouth contact with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be washed and disinfected with a number of sprays (within one minute after application of the disinfectant to the stainless steel surface) including ethanol 6271% isopropanol 50100% sodium hypochlorite 0.1% hydrogen peroxide 0.5% and iodine polyolefin 0.27.5%.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chrohexidine gluconate are less effective.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that if a suspected or confirmed case of COVID is in a facility such as an office or day care center, such as a bathroom, a shared electronic device such as a tablet, touch screen, keypad, command line, or ATM used by a patient, it should be disinfected.
The WHO recommends that people cover their mouths and noses with their mouths under their arms or use a mouthwash when coughing or sneezing and discard the cloth immediately.
Medical masks are recommended for people who may be exposed to infection by wearing masks to limit the amount of infection and the discharge of fluid when speaking, coughing and coughing.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has issued guidelines on when and how to wear masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "wearing masks can reduce people's exposure to their contacts, a major source of infection, without proper hand hygiene". Masks are also recommended for those caring for those who may have the disease.
The World Health Organization recommends that healthy people wear masks in high-risk cases, such as those caring for COVID-19 patients, etc. However, they also acknowledge that wearing masks can help people avoid contact with their face.
Some countries have begun to encourage the use of masks by members of the public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing masks made from non-medical rubber.China specifically advises the public, especially for those in close contact (at a distance of 1 meter (3 feet) or more) with others, to use disposable medical masks.
Hong Kong recommends wearing masks when people travel on public transport or when in crowded areas.
Thai health officials encourage people to make face masks from paper at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia ban public access without masks or mouth and nose masks.
On 16 March, Vietnam recommended that you wear a face mask when going to public areas to protect yourself and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that everyone entering a supermarket must wear a face mask.
Israel has recommended that all residents wear masks when in public.
Taiwan, which has produced tens of millions of masks a day since mid-March, required passengers on trains and buses to wear masks on April 1.
Panama requires masks to be worn whenever outdoors and also recommends the production of handmade masks for those who cannot afford them.
Masks are widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (or known as social distancing) includes transmission control measures aimed at slowing the spread of disease by reducing close contact between people.
Methods include quarantine, travel restrictions, and closure of schools, workplaces, gyms, garages, or shopping centers.
Individuals can practice social distancing measures by staying at home, traveling, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact socialising and self-isolation.
Many governments are now imposing or recommending social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum gathering size recommended by U.S. government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 (if there was no local COVID-19 outbreak) to 50 and then to 10.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of two or more people. Adults and those with conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension, and compromised immune systems are at high risk of serious illness and have a variety of complications. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health organizations began replacing the use of the term "social distancing" with "maintaining physical distancing" to emphasize that the goal is to reduce the likelihood of physical contact while maintaining social contact near or far.
The use of the term "social distancing" has led to the effect that people should be in complete social isolation rather than encouraged to stay in contact with others through other means.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
These include recommendations to only have sex with people with whom you live who do not have the virus or symptoms of the virus.
Home isolation is recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected of having the disease.
Health authorities have issued detailed guidelines for proper quarantine.Many governments have ordered or recommended self-quarantine for all people living in areas where the disease is present.
Self-isolation advisories are issued for those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been in contact with a COVID-19 patient and those who have recently traveled to a highly infectious country or region are advised to self-isolate for 14 days from the time of last exposure.
The strategy in controlling the outbreak is to manage the outbreak, suppress and mitigate its severity.
This is done in the early stages of an outbreak and is intended to monitor and isolate those who are infected, as well as introduce other measures of control, transmission and vaccination to stop the disease from spreading to the entire population.
When the spread of the disease cannot be contained, efforts then move to the mitigation phase: Measures are taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health and social care systems.
A combination of both office management and severity reduction measures may be implemented simultaneously.
Suppression requires stronger measures to prevent outbreaks by reducing the number of seedlings to less than one percent of controlled outbreaks of infectious diseases, trying to reduce the peak incidence of outbreaks known as the outbreak threshold.
This reduces the risk of complicated health services and provides additional time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-drug interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, face masks and isolation; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling large gatherings; community engagement to promote acceptance and participation in such interventions.Many actions aimed at curbing the outbreak have been taken in China as the severity of the outbreak has emerged, such as city-wide lockdowns and strict travel bans.
Other countries have also adopted various measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea has imposed mass surveillance and quarantine at the base and issued a travel advisory for infected individuals.
Singapore has provided financial support to those who have been infected and have been vaccinated and has imposed severe penalties on those who do not comply.
Taiwan has increased production of face masks and tariffs on medical supplies. The figures for the UK and US show that reduction (slowing but not stopping the spread of the disease) and containment (slowing the spread of the disease) are major challenges.
The best mitigation policies can cut peak health care demand by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems are suffering.
Active containment may be optional and necessary while the virus is spreading to humans (or until a vaccine is available if available), when transmission has rapidly increased as measures are relaxed.
Long-term interventions to contain the pandemic have caused social and economic losses.
No specific antiviral drugs have been approved for use for COVID-19, but development efforts are underway, including testing of existing drugs.
Taking cold medication, drinking water and rest can help reduce symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be necessary.
Steroid use can make the outcome worse.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization has also confirmed that some traditional and home treatments can provide relief from symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
Capacity building and healthcare adaptation for COVID-19 patient care has been described by the World Health Organization as a basic outbreak response.
ECDC and WHO in Europe announced guidance for hospitals and primary healthcare services on resource transition at several levels, including a focus on laboratory services for COVID-19 testing, eliminating the timely selection process, making COVID-19 cases more accessible, isolating and isolating patients, and increasing the capacity for high-demand care by training staff and increasing the number of ventilation units and beds.
There are various theories as to where the first case (called zero case) may have originated.
The first known case of the new and distinct virus may have occurred on 1 December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
Within a month, the number of Zika virus cases in Hubei was steadily increasing.
Most of these patients were in contact with Huanan Seafood Market, which also sold live animals, and one study suggested that the virus came from one of these species of rodents, or rather, that it originated in animals.Pneumonia of unknown cause was diagnosed on December 26 and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixian at Hubei Provincial Hospital, who reported it to the Wuhan Center for Disease Control and Prevention on December 27.
On 30 December, doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues to SARS-like coronavirus.
Eight doctors, including Li Wenliang, were investigated by police for spreading false rumors, and another, Ai Fen, was charged with disorderly conduct.
The Wuhan City Health Commission later issued a public notice on 31 December and notified the World Health Organization.
Enough cases of unprecedented pneumonia were reported to health authorities in Wuhan to establish an investigation in early January.During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled in about seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other provinces in China, caused by Chinese New Year migration, and Wuhan is a major transportation and rail hub.

Despite this, the US had a late start in testing that obscured the true scope of the outbreak at the time.
Testing was hampered by federal-produced disease testing kits in February, a lack of federal approval for non-government testing kits (by congressional physicians, companies, and hospitals) until the end of February, and strict conditions for people with sufficient qualifications for testing until early March (physician orders are required after that).
As of February 27, The Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been performed in the United States.

The World Health Organization praised the efforts of the Chinese authorities to control and contain the outbreak.
The World Health Organization (WHO) noted the contrast between the SARS outbreak in 2002-2004, in which Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that prevented prevention and efforts to control the situation, and the current crisis in which the central government provided updates and consistency to avoid confusion before the Chinese New Year.
On 23 January, in response to the central authorities' decision to impose travel restrictions in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that while it "is not really a WHO recommendation", it is also a significant demonstration of the commitment to contain the outbreak in the place where the disease has the greatest concentration", calling the outbreak "unprecedented in the history of public health".On 30 March, following the confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and the rise in cases in other countries since 2009, the WHO Director-General declared the outbreak to be a public health emergency, the first of its kind since the International Health Organization (IHEA) declared a public health emergency in 2009.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said PHEIC was due to the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without robust health systems.
"In response to the implementation of travel restrictions, Tedros stated that ""there is no justification for measures that unnecessarily disrupt international travel and trade"" and that ""the World Health Organization does not recommend restrictions on trade and movement""".
"On 5 February, the World Health Organization appealed to the global community for a donation of $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, lifting the emergency to support those countries that do not have the systems to find people infected with the virus, even if it is blocked"."
"Tedros made further statements declaring that ""all nations, if one is weak, are equal to all weak"" and urging the international community to ""invest today, not lose more later"".In a press conference on February 11, the World Health Organization named the disease COVID-19".
On the same day, Tedros confirmed that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to give the entire UN system the authority to respond.
"The UN crisis management team was deployed, which resulted in a UN-wide coordination of responses that would allow the WHO to focus their attention on health responses while other agencies could bring their expertise to support the socio-economic and evolutionary impact of the outbreak"."
On 14 February, the WHO Joint Task Force Mission with China was established to provide international experts and WHO with a snapshot of the situation in China to help manage the disease locally and assess the severity and transmission potential of the disease, by setting up workshops and meetings with key national-level institutions and conducting field visits to understand the impact of response measures at the provincial and local levels, including at the local and rural levels.On 25 February, WHO announced that the World Health Organization should take more measures to prepare for the coronavirus pandemic, calling for a rapid response in all countries to prepare for the pandemic.

Mike Ryan, WHO Emergency Program Director, made the reminder in a statement: "This is a reality check for every government in the world: wake up.
"The virus may be on the way, so you must be prepared, arguing that the right response can help the world avoid the worst outcome".
"Ryan further stated that the current data is not officially confirmed for public health officials to declare a global pandemic, saying that such a declaration would mean ""we fundamentally recognize that everyone on the planet will be infected with the virus""".
On 11 March, the World Health Organization announced an outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic.
The director said WHO is "deeply concerned by the scale and severity of the outbreak emergency and the emergency of inaction". WHO has been subject to a number of strong criticisms for what it sees as insufficient response to the outbreak, including a strict declaration of a public health emergency and the identification of the virus as a pandemic.
The response included a petition for Tedros Adhanom, the director-general of the World Health Organization, to request his resignation, which had been signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed the importance of respecting individual human rights during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Experts say everyone has the right to life-saving intervention and that governments are responsible for this.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should not be considered a justification for discrimination against any particular group.
The experts point out that everyone has a right to health, including disabled people who are part of minority groups, the elderly, people who have been forcibly displaced across borders, the homeless, those living in emergency situations, those in detention, as well as refugees and other groups of people without identification who need government assistance.
The international community is addressing the economic and social impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has developed a system to provide timely and comprehensive information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as views and advice.
Through policies to strengthen global health and economic systems to address the impact of lockdowns and travel restrictions, the Digital Hub includes country policy monitoring programs and aims to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized by US Secretary of State Michael Gove and Eduardo Bolsonaro, the son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, for handling the outbreak, which began in China's Hubei province.
Some provincial Communist Party of China (CPC) level administrations have been blocked by the way in which they handle the exercise of mass evacuation in central China, a sign of dissatisfaction with the political response to the outbreak in those areas.
Some commentators believe the move is aimed at protecting Chinese Communist Party Secretary-General Xi Jinping from public outrage over the virus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, such as Zhao Lijian, have rejected prior acknowledgments of the outbreak, which began in Wuhan, but have supported the conventional hypothesis that COVID-19 originated in the United States or Italy.
The US administration under Donald Trump has labeled the coronavirus the "Chinese virus" or "Wuhan virus", saying that "China's cover-up of the virus, which has now turned into a global pandemic", has been criticized as racist and "a sign of his administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast received a wave of US government communications signals suggesting a communications ploy originating in the National Security Council, with the strategy being cited as "everything is about China".
We should try and convey this message by any means possible, including press conferences and TV appearances.News outlets like Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have argued that China's efforts to send aid to countries with the virus are part of a campaign to promote global influence.
"The EU's foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, stressed the geopolitical factors, including the difficulty of gaining influence through change and 'charitable politics'".
Borrel also said that "unlike the US, China has made a strong publicity message that it is a responsible and reliable partner".
China has also called for the US to lift its sanctions on Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to both countries.
Jack Ma's donation of 100,000 masks to Cuba was banned by US sanctions on April 3.
US authorities have also been accused of diverting aid left for other countries for their own use.
And there have been reports of mask-related conflicts between other countries, such as Armenia, Austria, Switzerland, the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey has seized hundreds of wind turbines bound for Spain.
In early March, the Italian government criticized the EU's lack of solidarity with Italy, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italy's ambassador to the EU, said: "Only China has responded bilaterally".
Of course, this is not a good sign of European unity.
On 22 March, after a telephone conversation with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian military to send military doctors, special disinfectants and other medical equipment to Italy.
Italy's La Stampa newspaper quoted an anonymous source as saying "80 percent of Russian aid is useless or only marginally useful to Italy".
The source accused Russia of launching a massive attack on geopolitics and diplomacy.
Attilio Fontana, President in Lombardy and Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio rejected the media reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
"Cremelian Palace spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, ""When providing aid to American allies, [Putin] assumed that as American medical and material manufacturers gained momentum, they would also be able to receive reciprocal benefits if necessary""".
NATO's 2020 Defenders' War, planned in Germany, Poland and the Baltic states, its largest war since the end of the Cold War, will be held at a low level.
Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament Secretary Kate Hudson criticized the 2020 defense campaign: "In the current public health crisis, it threatens the lives not only of troops from the United States and many European countries involved, but also the lives of the people in the countries where they are operating". The Iranian government has been severely affected by the virus, with about four-and-a-half members of parliament infected, as well as five other former and current political prisoners.
Iranian President Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help on 14 March 2020, stating that his country was experiencing difficulties in fighting the outbreak due to a lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions on Iran.The outbreak of the disease prompted the United States to make major decisions immediately to implement social policies that are commonly used in other wealthy countries, including universal health care, universal child health care, ending laws for families with disabilities, and providing high funding for the public health system.
Political analysts predicted it could negatively impact Donald Trump's chances of re-election in the 2020 presidential election.Diplomatic relations between Japan and South Korea have been strained by the pandemic.
South Korea criticized Japan's ineffective and vague quarantine efforts after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at a government-designated location.
Initially, South Korean society was divided over President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans have signed the petition as well as called for the impeachment of Moon around what they claimed was the government's inaccuracy to the outbreak or praised his response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow the government to consolidate its grip on power.
In Hungary, its parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule indefinitely, suspend parliament, as well as vote and sanction those suspected of spreading false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak has been blamed for a variety of reasons, from a lack of supplies, to increased use of equipment to fight the disease, to fear buying and problems with factories and operations, to the transportation of waste around the world.
The US Food and Drug Administration has issued a warning about a shortage of medicines and medical devices due to increasing consumer demand and supply constraints.
Many regions have also seen a shortage of supplies, which has led to all purchases of essential items from the stock market, such as food, toilet paper and sewage, leading to a shortage of supplies.
Some tech industries have been warned about the delay in shipping of e-waste.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment has increased 100 times.
This demand has led to costs rising up to twice the normal price and has also caused a four to six month delay in the supply of medical supplies.
It has also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, with the World Health Organization warning that it poses a risk to health workers.
In Australia, the outbreak has provided a new opportunity for ordinary consumers to sell domestic products to China.
This action led to a shortage of baby formula and milk in supermarkets and was eventually banned by the Australian government.Although the outbreak of COVID-19 cases was high in the northern regions of Italy and the Wuhan area, and demand for food products was continuously increasing, both regions were relieved of severe food shortages.
China and Italy's measures against trafficking in illegal and unregulated products have been successful in avoiding the severe shortages of fresh food that are expected in Europe as well as North America.
Northern Italy, its main agricultural production, has not suffered much decline, but prices may rise, according to industry representatives.
Food was temporarily out of stock even in Wuhan, as Chinese government officials released canned pork to ensure food supply to the population.
Similar laws exist in Italy, which require food manufacturers to keep a reserve for such emergencies.
The destruction to the global economy is being seen in China: According to media reports on March 16, China's economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to government measures to curb the spread of the virus and retail sales. Sales fell 20.5%.
With mainland China being a key sector for the economy and manufacturing, the outbreak is seen as posing a major threat to the stability of the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of the Economist Intelligence Unit predicts that the market will remain stable until a clear picture emerges on potential outcomes.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic downturn due to the global pandemic could exceed the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak.
One estimate from experts at Washington University in St. Louis provided an impact of more than $300 billion on global supply chains that could last up to two years.
The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) reported "confusion" following a sharp drop in oil prices due to low demand from China.
Global stock markets fell on 24 February due to a significant increase in COVID-19 outbreaks outside mainland China.
On 27 February, amid growing concerns about the coronavirus outbreak, various US stock exchanges including the NASDAQ-100, S&amp;P 500 Index and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted their fastest declines since 2008, with the Dow falling 1,191 points, the biggest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007-08.
The three interviews ended this week down more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed China's sovereign rating but maintained a negative outlook.
The stock market reversed again due to fears of coronavirus, with the biggest drop occurring on March 16.
Many people think that the recession is likely to be inevitable.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures taken by the central bank and the state.
The central bank has been taking action much more slowly than they did during the 2008 financial crisis.
The tourism sector suffered the worst among other sectors due to travel bans, closures of public places, as well as tourist attractions and government advice against global travel.
As a result, many airlines cancelled flights due to low demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while UK regional carrier Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise industry is at an unprecedented level.
Many train stations and ports were also closed.
The outbreak coincides with the Jun'an Festival, a major travel season associated with the Chinese New Year holiday.
Many large-scale events have been cancelled by national and local governments, including New Year's Eve celebrations, with private companies closing their stores and tourist attractions, such as Disneyland in Hong Kong and in Shanghai.
New Year's Eve events and many tourist attractions were closed to prevent large gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional brass fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, cities and municipalities, authorities extended the New Year's holiday break to February 10, instructing most workplaces not to reopen until that date.
These regions represent 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of exports.
Hong Kong has stepped up its response to the pandemic to the highest levels and declared a state of emergency, closing schools until March and cancelling all New Year celebrations.The retail sector has been hit globally with reduced hours or temporary closures.
Retail outlets in Europe and Latin America fell by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East saw a 50-60% decline.
This also resulted in a 3343% drop in foot traffic to the grocery market in March compared to February.
Modern market operators around the world have put in place additional measures such as hygiene, increased installation of heat scanners to monitor the temperature of market participants, and cancellation of events.According to estimates by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the crisis caused by the spread of the pandemic could place between 14 and 22 million people in extreme poverty in Latin America, more than in the situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the height of the outbreak in Wuhan, about 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million rural migrant workers have been confined to their homes in the mainland province or trapped in Hubei province.In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans lost their jobs and applied for government assistance.
The coronavirus outbreak could result in 47 million job losses in the United States, and the unemployment rate could rise to 32%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.Staying home in India has caused tens of millions of Indian migrant workers to lose their jobs (where they receive daily wages).A recent survey from the Angus Reid Institute found that 44% of Canadian families have experienced unemployment.About 900,000 employees in Spain have lost their jobs since the country imposed a stay-at-home order in mid-March 2020.
During mid-March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits, and 1 million UK workers applied for universal credit schemes. About half a million companies in Germany sent their employees into a government-sponsored short-term work scheme known as Kurzarbeit.
Armenia's short-term workplace compensation scheme was approved by France and the UK.
The arts and cultural sectors have been severely affected by the pandemic, affecting the organisation's operations as well as individuals, work and independence worldwide.
Arts and cultural sector organizations have sought to promote their mission (often publicly funded) to provide access to cultural resources to the community, to protect the safety of their employees and the public, and to support artists wherever possible.
As of March 2020, worldwide and at all levels, museums, libraries, theatres and other cultural institutions are completely closed, with their exhibitions, events and performances cancelled or postponed.
In response, a major effort has been made to provide alternative services through digital platforms.The decline of the disease has been slow and rapid, with recent cancellations of services, major sporting events and other social events such as concerts and demonstrations, technology conferences and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered a downturn.The Vatican announced that a Holy Week performance in Rome, which took place during the final week of the Christian holiday season, was cancelled.
Many Christian bishop-controlled areas have recommended that older Christians stay home instead of meeting on Sundays. Some churches offer services via radio, live internet or television, while others allow worship by open door.
With the closure of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome of its parish and minor churches, as well as St. Peter's Square, without a regular church, the Church and other Orthodox churches have also abolished the worship of the Lord and public gatherings are restricted to the churches, mosques, synagogues, mosques and temples of Sikhs.
Iran's health ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in areas affected by the outbreak, and later closed mosques, while Saudi Arabia imposed a ban on foreign pilgrims entering the country, as well as a ban on locals traveling to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic caused the most significant disruption to the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events have been cancelled or postponed, including the 201920 UEFA Champions League, 201920 Premier League, UEFA Euro 2020, 201920 NBA season, and 201920 NHL season.
The outbreak has hampered plans for the 2020 Summer Olympics, originally scheduled to begin in late July. The International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event will be rescheduled after 2020, but no later than summer 2021. Casinos and other gambling venues around the world have closed, and lotteries have been postponed or cancelled.
This action has led many gamblers to switch to online gambling, with many online gambling sites reporting a significant increase in new registration rates. The entertainment industry has also been affected, with various bands suspending or cancelling concerts.
Many major theatres, such as Broadway, also suspended all performances.
Some artists have found ways to continue producing and sharing work online, viewing it as an alternative to live performance, such as performing live online or creating a festival on a website for artists to exhibit, share and showcase their work.
On the internet, internet comics related to the coronavirus have become very popular, with many people enjoying the joke and distracting themselves in times of uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, an increase in xenophobia and racism has been noted in Chinese and people of East Asian origin, and in people from highly infected countries in Europe, the United States and elsewhere.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and insecurity have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February (when most cases were confirmed from China) showed racial expressions of concern towards various groups of Chinese people around the world that they deserve the disease or receive what is considered a punishment for what they have done.
Some countries in Africa have also seen anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many people in Wuhan and Hubei reported discrimination based on their local origin.
There is support for Chinese people both online and offline, and for those in the restricted areas where the virus is found.
With the spread of the disease to new countries, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience severe COVID-19 infections, have fallen into suspicion and xenophobia.People in countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have begun to register protests to ban Chinese from their countries to stop the spread of the disease.
In Japan, the #ChinaBan sign has been a hot topic on Twitter.
Chinese people, as well as other Asian people in the UK and the US, have reported increasing rates of racial and gender-based violence.
US President Donald Trump has come under fire for calling the coronavirus a "Chinese virus", a term thought to be racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attack a bus carrying Ukrainians and foreigners who are evacuated from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
Students from the eastern regions of India bordering China and students studying in major Indian cities have reportedly been harassed in connection with the outbreak.
State Bharatiya Janata Party head Dilip Ghosh in West Bengal said that the Chinese people have destroyed nature and that is why God has avenged them.
The remark was later denounced by the Chinese Consulate in Kolkata, calling it "confusing". In China, xenophobia and racism against non-Chinese people are affected by the epidemic, with foreigners being said to be "foreign trash" and defined as "waste".
Many newspapers that pay for access have removed this requirement for some or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Several scientific publications have made scientific research on the disease available.
Some scientists quickly shared their results on preprint servers such as bioRxiv.

Laboratory testing for novel infectious diseases of the respiratory tract (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 includes methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of the virus in the sample was confirmed by a transcriptional polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) that detected coronavirus RNA.
The test is specific and is designed to detect only RNA of SARS-CoV-2.
It is used to confirm recent infection or active.
Serology can be used for both diagnosis and population screening.
Antibody testing reveals the number of people with the disease, including those without symptoms and those with mild symptoms, that need to be reported.
The accuracy of the disease-causing mortality rate and the level of human immunity could be determined by the results of this test.
Because testing was limited as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the rate of the virus in their population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there was a significant variation in the number of tests being conducted across the country.
This variation is also likely to have a significant impact on mortality rates in reported cases, which are likely to exceed estimates in some countries.
Using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), testing can be performed on respiratory samples obtained by various methods, including nasal swabs, nasal swabs, or catheters.
Results are generally available within a few hours to 2 days.
RT-PCR tests performed with a colonoscopy are only reliable in the first weeks of the disease.
The virus can then disappear back into the intestine as it continues to grow to the lungs.
For infected individuals who have been tested in the second week, replacement swabs may be taken from the deep respiratory tract, with a cardiac swab or a cough drops (swab) used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at Charité in Berlin in January 2020, using real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), and created a base of 250,000 base units for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK also launched a test on 23 January 2020.The South Korean company Kogenebiotech launched a PCR-based therapy class of the SARS-CoV-2 (Coronavirus PowerChek) device on 28 January 2020.
"The method detects the ""E"" gene distributed by all coronaviruses and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene.In China, BGI Group was the first company to receive emergency approval for a SARS-CoV-2 detector based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from China's National Medical Products Administration.In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its 2019 novel strain (2019-nCoV) polymerase chain reaction diagnostic kit to public health laboratories for clinical trials".
Genetic testing of one of the three devices in the older generation of the test made the results uncertain due to errors and testing obstacles at the CDC in Atlanta, resulting in an average of fewer than 100 samples per day being successfully run throughout February 2020.
Dual-agent testing was not determined to be reliable until February 28, 2020, and it was not until that time that state and local laboratories were allowed to begin testing.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under a commercial laboratory with provisional use authorization.The commercial laboratory began testing in early March 2020.
March 5, 2020 LabCorp announced the nationwide offering of RT-PCR-based COVID-19 testing.
Diagnostics of the search warranty have been established nationwide, and COVID-19 testing services are available as of 9 March 2020.
No quantitative limits were announced, and sample collection and processing must comply with CDC requirements.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test is developed and produced by the state-owned VECTOR Institute of Biotechnology and Biotechnology Research.
On February 11, 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Agency for Healthcare Supervision.On March 12, 2020, the Mayo Clinic was reported to have developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.On March 13, 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that can be performed in 3.5 hours at high doses, thus allowing one machine to perform approximately 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On March 19, 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted an emergency use authorization (EUA) to Abbott Laboratories for testing on Abbott's m2000 system.In the past, the FDA has granted similar authorizations to Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cepheid received an EUA from the FDA for a test that took approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA approved a test that uses nucleic acid amplification technology instead of PCR technology.
Because it does not require a cycle of continuous temperature changes, the method can give a positive result in five minutes and a negative result in 13 minutes.
There are currently about 18,000 of these machines in the United States, and Abbott expects to ramp up production to provide 50,000 tests per day.The test, which uses a monoclonal antibody specifically bound to the N-protein of the novel coronavirus, is being developed in Taiwan with the expectation that it will give results in 15 to 20 minutes, as fast as a rapid coronavirus test.
"A March 2020 literature review concluded that chest X-rays are of little value in making early-stage diagnoses, contributing to the finding that CT [imaging of any body tissue] may be present even before symptoms appear. """
Common features on CT include the appearance of a double-sided mirror with a back division, misaligned shape, and a subject's eye.
Large amounts of excess under the lung, burned spleen and joint tissue evolve as the disease progresses.
A comparative study of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to CT in Wuhan, the source of the current outbreak, showed that CT was more sensitive than PCR, with many of its imaging characteristics correlating with pneumonia and other disease processes, although not specific.
"In March 2020, the American College of Surgeons recommended""CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19". ""In March 2020, the CDC recommended PCR for early follow-up"."
Part of the immune system's response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to induce an individual infection starting 7 days or after the onset of symptoms to determine immunity and in population monitoring.Testing may be performed in a laboratory-based clinical trial (CLT) or by a point-of-care test (PoCT).
High-throughput automated systems in many epidemiological laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but the feasibility of such systems will depend on the production rate for each system.
For single-cell clotting replacement, CLT is often recommended, although follow-up clotting can be used to monitor immune response.
For PoCT, a single blood sample is usually obtained by incision.
Unlike PCR, the download step is not necessary before the injection.On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that notified the agency as required and can now distribute their condensed body tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only a single test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization.In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Assessment received European approval for their test kits, which can protect IgG and IgA antibodies against viruses in blood samples.
The test is capable of hundreds of samples in a matter of hours and is therefore faster than the claims of PCR of viral RNA.
Normally, a test tube can be detected within 14 days of the start of infection.In early April, the UK found that none of the test tubes it had purchased were fit enough for consumption.
"Hong Kong has developed a scheme where suspected patients can stay at home, ""the fire department will provide a test tube to the patient"" they take a bath, send the bath back, and a few days later they will receive test results.The UK National Health Service (NHS) announced that they are piloting the scheme to test suspected cases at home, which could reduce the risk of infecting patients if they are hospitalised or if an ambulance with disinfectants is available, if needed.In order to test for Covid-19 in suspected cases, healthcare professionals should take extra precautions".
The driving centre has helped South Korea conduct the fastest and most extensive testing of any country.In Germany, the National Conditional Health Insurance Medical Center reported on 2 March that it had the capacity to test about 12,000 people a day in ambulance spaces and 10,700 were tested in the past week.
The cost is covered by health insurance when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the director of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has a total capacity of 160,000 tests per week.
As of 19 March, testing was offered in some major cities.
On 26 March 2020, the total number of tests in Germany was not known, as only positive results were reported.
Initial laboratory testing showed that as of week 12/2020, a total of at least 483,295 samples had been tested, including week 12/2020 and 33,491 (6.9%) samples that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2.In Israel, researchers at the Technion and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to test samples from 64 patients during the same time period, collecting samples and further testing only in cases where the collected samples were found to be positive.In the city of B, a laboratory of emergency screening with more than 10,000 samples was opened on February 5, 2020 called B-Fire, or B-GI, a Chinese language brand named after the Chinese word for fire.
With construction supervised by BGI founder Wang Jian and taking 5 days, the production of case-proofing samples in Hubei is already 47% higher, and the costs associated with isolating the problem are doubled if the testing capacity is not used.
The Wuhan lab was immediately followed by Hong-Yan labs in Shenzhen, Tangjin, Beijing and Shanghai in 12 cities across China.
On 4 March 2020, the total number of tests was 50,000 times per day.Open source, a modular design by Origami Assays was released that tested 1,122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests.These balanced designs can be run in small laboratories without the need for an automatic liquid catcher.
In March, the lack and insufficient amount of conversion became a barrier to large-scale testing in the European Union and the United Kingdom and the United States.
This led some authors to investigate a sample preparation protocol that involves heating samples at 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genes for further testing.On 31 May, it was announced that Saudi Arabia was testing its population more for coronavirus in one head than other countries and was on track to expand the scope of testing to reach the majority of the population.
"This is through a combination of lobbying and large-scale population-based lab purchases from Group 42 and BGI (based on their ""Hu-Yan"" emergency laboratory in China)".
Built in 14 days, the lab has the capacity to test tens of thousands of RT-PCRs per day and is the first in the world to operate outside China.
Different test formats that focus on different parts of the viral genome have been developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization has received a German patent for manufacturing equipment sent to low-income countries without the resources to develop themselves.
The German version was published on 17 January 2020.The protocol established by the US Centers for Disease Control is not available until 28 January.Extended testing is available in the US and the US has problems with the reliability of testing equipment at the early stages of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia do not have the capacity to supply sufficient equipment to meet the need and recommendations for testing by health professionals.
In contrast, experts say South Korea's extensive testing has helped slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.
Testing capabilities, mostly in private sector laboratories, were developed over many years by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for an increased testing program, the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic in advance.High demand for testing due to the spread of the virus has led to hundreds of thousands of tests in private laboratories in the United States and the supply of equipment for toiletries, disposable diapers and chemicals for testing has become strained.
In March 2020, China reported accuracy issues in its testing equipment.
"In the United States, test kits developed by the CDC were ""quality""".The government then exposed diplomatic missions that blocked private testing.Spain purchased test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but found that the results were inaccurate".
The company explained that inaccurate results could be caused by a failure to collect samples or use equipment correctly.
The Spanish Ministry said it would remove the kits that gave incorrect results and replace them with other testing kits provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy. 80 percent of the Czech Republic's test kits purchased from China gave incorrect results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million test kits from China that were found to be incorrect.
"Prime Minister Matovič proposed dumping them in the Danube River. Ateş Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said the test kits Turkey purchased from China had ""high error rates"" and ""did not put into service"".The UK purchased 3.5 million test kits from China but in early April 2020 announced that these kits were not available".
Follow-up testing with people who tested positive and follow-up with people who have been in contact with SARS-CoV-2 positive has resulted in positive results.
A team of researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing on an entire population of about 3,400 people who were isolated for about ten days.
About half of the people who test positive have no symptoms, and all detected cases are isolated.
With travel to the quarantine, this level can completely eliminate new infections.
With strict contact tracing, tightened domestic travel restrictions, testing, and quarantines in 2020, the global outbreak of coronavirus in Singapore is slower than in other developed countries, but without severe restrictions such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled and Singapore began advising people to stay home on 28 March, but schools reopened in time for the holiday on 23 March.
Many other countries have also managed the pandemic through strict contacts, domestic travel restrictions, testing and quarantine, but with less intrusive stay-at-home orders, such as Iceland and South Korea.
Statistical studies found that countries that tested more in terms of mortality had much lower mortality rates, perhaps because these countries were better at preventing symptoms.
The World Health Organization recommends that countries without testing capacity and national-level laboratories with limited experience with COVID-19 send their first five positive COVID-19 samples and first ten negative COVID-19 samples to one of the 16 WHO laboratories for confirmation testing.
Of the 16 clock labs, seven are in Asia, five in Europe, two in Africa, one in North America and one in Australia.
"In the table below, the column ""positive as a percentage of tests"" is influenced by the country's testing policy".
A country that tests only hospitalized people will have a higher percentage of positive tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, and the difference is the same.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the act of washing one's hands for the purpose of removing dirt, fat, excess excess, or other substances that we do not need.
Washing hands with soap and detergent at certain critical times of the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhoea and oral infections.
People can also catch respiratory illnesses such as the common cold or influenza, for example, if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (e.g., coughing).
The five most important daily situations to wash your hands with soap include before and after bathing, after washing your baby's feet or changing your baby's hands, before feeding, before cooking, and before or after preparing or cooking meat, fish and poultry.
The World Health Organization recommends hand washing: We can wash our hands with a hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.
Before, during, and after preparing meals.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing a diaper or washing a toilet-used child.
After brushing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, fish or animal waste.
Professional hand hygiene focuses on hand hygiene practices that are related to the doctor's instructions.
Hand washing before using medication or medical care can prevent or slow the spread of infection.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to cleanse the hands of pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
It is especially important for those who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important application for the general public.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases, preventing the transmission of infectious diseases, and reducing respiratory infections.
and reduce the mortality rate of home births.
A 2013 study showed that handwashing practices can make a slight improvement in the growth of children under five years of age.
In developing countries, child mortality rates associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhea can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes such as handwashing with soap.
These simple actions can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that promote handwashing can reduce diarrhoea by about a third, which is comparable to a clean water supply in low-income areas.
48% of reductions in acute respiratory illness can be attributed to handwashing with soap.Handwashing with soap is one of the most effective and cost-effective ways to prevent acute respiratory infection (ARI) and acute respiratory infection, which is a common behaviour in schools, workplaces and communities worldwide.
Pneumonia, a major ARI, is the number one cause of death among children under five years old, killing about 1.8 million children a year.
Sickle cell disease and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million infant deaths each year.
According to UNICEF, making handwashing with soap before eating and after using the toilet a lifestyle can save more lives than vaccines or any other medical intervention, by reducing deaths from tuberculosis by almost half and those from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Handwashing is usually combined with other hygiene interventions as part of the water, sanitation and hygiene programme.
Hand washing can also protect against hand dermatitis, which is transmitted through direct contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to dry skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive hand washing can cause diarrhea, a skin condition known as hand ulcer or hand ulcer disease, common among health care workers.
Frequent hand washing is also seen as a symptom of multiple mental disorders.
The five most important times of day when you need to wash your hands with soap are to reduce infection from contact with mucus and mouth: after using the bathroom (slip and shower), after washing the baby's feet (changing the baby's water bottle), before feeding the baby, after eating, and before or after preparing or cooking food, or handling fish or poultry.
Other opportunities when proper handwashing techniques are in place should be applied to prevent infection transmission include before and after treating a wound or splinter; after coughing, coughing, or flushing your teeth; after contacting animal waste or contact with animals; and after contact with feces.
In many countries, handwashing with soap is still low.
A study of hand washing conducted in 54 countries in 2015 found that an average of 38.7% of households practiced hand washing with soap. A 2014 study showed that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%, the United States at 77%, and China had the lowest rate at 23%. Some behavioral change strategies now are to increase hand washing with soap at the last minute.
The Essential Health Care Program implemented by the Department of Education in the Philippines is an example of an effort to promote children's health and education.
Insect repellent twice a year, plus daily hand washing with soap and daily tooth brushing with fluoride, are the highlights of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Exfoliation is the process of removing excess skin, usually by adding sunscreen or soap, from the skin.
The main activity of soaps and disinfectants is to reduce the solubility barrier and increase the solubility.
Water alone is not an effective skin cleanser because fats and proteins, the building blocks of soil organisms, are not soluble in water.
However, a strong flow of water can help to wash the pool.
Because in general, the non-solid soap that we can recycle contains bacteria that stick to the soap after it's been used once.
A few small studies that looked at bacterial transmission from soap containing soap concluded that the transmission was apparently not transmissible because it was already washed out with soap dust.
"The CDC still says ""Soap in a can with a pressure head is better""".
They have been widely promoted from antibacterial and anti-bacterial soaps to public health.
To date, there is no evidence that the use of any antibiotic or bacteriostatic agent is recommended for organisms that are resistant to naturally occurring antibiotics.
However, antibacterial soaps contain a common antibacterial agent, such as triglucan, which is moderate to high in body fat.
So if they don't select a specific strain of bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics, the antibacterial soap won't be as effective as it's advertised.
In addition to the real anti-inflammatory and skin-protective agents, the fake formula also contains acetic acid, ascorbic acid, low pH lactic acid, antibacterial agents, and skin creams (such as a spray, a vitamin, a mantle, and a natural extract). An analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health claimed that regular soap is as effective as a triclinic soap in preventing disease and killing bacteria on the hands.
Hot water with a high concentration of hand washing is not hot enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow very fast at body temperature (< 37 °C).
However, hot water, soap, and water are more effective than cold water and soap in natural oil-based solutions that contain soil and bacteria.
Scientific studies, contrary to popular belief, have shown that using hot water is not effective at reducing the microbiota present on the hands.
Alcohol hand sanitizer or hand sanitizer gel is a water-free hand sanitizer.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, water-free, alcohol-free hand sanitizers (known as alcohol hand washing, disinfectant hand washing, hand sanitizer) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isotrophin alcohol or ethanol, forming together with a crude agent such as carbonate (a polymer of acrylic acid), into a gel or other substance such as glycerin, into a liquid or foam body for ease of use and to reduce the pulmonary efficiency of the alcohol.
Adding a chemical component hydrogen-peroxide increases the activity of disinfection. Handwash containing at least 60 to 95% alcohol is effective in disinfection.
Alcohol washes away common bacterial infections, multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRSA and VRE), diarrhea, and certain viruses (including HIV, RSV, influenza, influenza vaccine, and hepatitis) and parasites.
Alcohol-containing hand wash disinfectant water with 70% alcohol kills 99.97%, a similar reduction of 3.5 (or 35 decibels) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after use, and 99.99% to 99.999% (or 4 to 5 locks) of bacteria on the hands 1 minute after use.Alcohol-containing hand washing water is most effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol handwashing is almost ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk), the most common cause of gastrointestinal infections. Adequate hand washing or alcohol brushing must be used to wet or cover the hands.
The toes, wrists, and between the ends of all the hands are brushed for about 30 seconds until the liquid material bubbles or dries.
Hands should also be washed, and if you cough, wash both hands.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing with an alcohol-based hand wash, especially when hands look dirty.
The increase in use of these agents is based on ease of use and quick killing activity versus hyper-well-being. But they should not replace proper hand washing unless soap and water are available.
Frequent use of disinfectant hand washes can cause dry skin if a skin conditioner and/or skin ointment is added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin and/or other skin conditioners to the formula.
In clinical trials, hand washes containing a skin conditioner caused significantly less skin inflammation and dry skin than soap or disinfectant soaps.
Skin inflammation from contact with allergens, allergic reactions, severe redness, or exposure to alcohol or other substances in hand sanitizer is rare.
Less practice, again, can cause inflammation of the skin caused by exposure, and inflammatory reactions have become a major attraction compared to handwashing with soap and water.
In addition to its effectiveness, non-water-based agents cannot wash hands with these bacteria, but can kill them easily.
For this reason, hand sanitizer is not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many of the bacteria that can cause pain, as the causative agent remains on the hands.
The efficiency of non-alcoholic handwashing is highly dependent on ingredients and textures, and has historically been with ineffective alcohol and handwashing detergents.
Recently, a formulation using benzalkonium chloride has been shown to have continuous and gradually increasing antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, which has been shown to decrease in effectiveness after repeated use, possibly due to gradually increasing skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford soap and use alternate soaps or soil.
Washing with soap or mud may be more effective than washing with just water, but it is not as effective as washing with soap.
One concern is that if soil or soil is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of disease more than slow it down.
The bark is also a disinfectant like soap because when it comes into contact with water, it forms an alkali solution.
The World Health Organization recommends using sand or mud as an alternative when soap is not available.
Proper handwashing techniques are recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent infection, which has the following stages:
Wash hands with hot or running cold water.
It is recommended to use running water because the water tank can be cloudy while the temperature in the water does not seem to vary.
Spray soap on the hands, rubbing them with plenty of soap, including the wrists, between the wrists and under the elbows.
Soap can remove germs from the skin, and studies have shown that many people are more likely to wash their hands thoroughly with soap than with water.
Repeat for at least 20 seconds.
Massage creates a lining that helps remove germs from the skin, and longer massages will help remove more germs.
Wash well under the incoming water.
A bath in a bathtub (with or without running water) can re-infect your hands.
Wash your hands with a clean cloth or allow them to air-dry.
Wet hands and hands with a bad smell are more susceptible to infection. Commonly affected areas are the hands, hands, interphalangeal area and under the wrist.
Artificial turf and turf drugs can be a refuge for the body's microbes.
Oily labels are often recommended to keep hands dry. Dry skin can lead to skin damage that can increase the risk of infection.
Many low-cost options can be made to facilitate handwashing in places where there is no available tap water and/or soap, for example, tap water from a tap tank or tap with a suitable tap and/or use taps if necessary in developing countries. In situations where water supply is limited (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water conservation solutions such as "tippy-taps and other low-cost options.
A tap water tank is a simple technology that uses a tank of water that is driven by a cable and you take a step to pour a small amount of water on your hands and a piece of soap.
Effective hand washing is an important part of the handwashing process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of handwashing in public restrooms.
A growing body of research has shown that toilet paper is more hygienic than hand sanitizers in many bathrooms.
In 2008, a study led by the University of Westminster, London and collaborated with the European Tissue Paper Industry Symposium to compare the levels of sanitary pads and hand sanitizers and other modern hand sanitizers.
After hand washing and sanitizing with a hand sanitizer, the total number of bacteria was found to be increased on the hand sanitizer, on average by 194% and on the palm by 254%.
Drying with a vacuum cleaner results in an average increase in the total number of bacteria on the washcloth by 42% and on the palm by 15%.
After washing and drying hands with toilet paper, the total number of bacteria was reduced on average on the hand washboard by up to 76% and on the palms by up to 77%.The scientists also conducted tests to determine whether or not the potential for infection of other bathroom users and the bathroom environment resulted from each drying procedure.
The vacuum cleaner, which vents out at 180 m/s (650 km/h, 400 mph), is capable of expelling microorganisms from the hand and the vacuum cleaner and can cause drowsiness to other bathroom users and the environment around a 2-meter-wide bathroom.
The use of a dryer can spread hyper-wellness (small body mass) up to 0.25 meters from the dryer.
Toilet paper did not show any evidence of blood microorganisms. In 2005, a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwel evaluated several different hand dryer protocols.
Observations of changes in bacterial counts after dry hands were found to be as follows:
Different manufacturers of hand dryers have emerged, and hand dryers have been compared to wiping with toilet paper.
Using hand sanitizer for hand washing is an option when we travel without enough soap and water.
Alcoholic hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in preventing infectious diseases in the hospital environment.
There are electronic devices available to remind hospital staff to wash their hands when they forget to do so.
One study found that infection rates decreased with their use.
Medical hand washing is at least 15 seconds long, using an appropriate amount of soap and water or gel to soak and dissolve each part of the hand.
We should be shaking hands with each other.
You should use a nose to remove the underarm patch if it exists.
It is important to wash hands thoroughly and dry them with a clean cloth as germs can remain in the water on the hands.
After hand washing, use a toilet paper to seal the water (and open any exit doors if necessary).
This is to avoid reinfection from the hands to the surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in healthcare settings is to eliminate infectious germs and prevent their transmission.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that the lack of hand washing remains at unacceptable levels in most medical facilities, with most doctors and nurses forgetting to wash their hands before contacting patients, leading to a transmission of well-being anxiety.
One study showed that hand washing and other simple procedures can reduce the rate of blood vessel-related infections by 66 percent.The World Health Organization has published a guideline document that recommends hand washing and hand rubbing in healthcare.
The organisation's hand hygiene guidelines are also available on its website for public comment.
A related review was done by Whitby et al.
Commercial devices can measure and sanitize hands if they demonstrate a requirement to apply general measures.
The World Health Organization has five main times for hand washing:
After contact with blood or body fluids
Before the operation, disinfect and
After patient care: Adding disinfectant chemicals to soap ("drugs" or "disinfectants") that can cause a disinfectant reaction in hand sanitizers.
Such disinfectant action may be desired before surgery or in areas where bacteria are highly resistant to antibiotics. Therefore, washing your hands during surgery requires a rubber hose that is open and sealed without touching it, using chlorhexidine or iodine hand wash, a clean cloth to wipe your hands after washing, a gauze for toothpaste, and a non-disease-resistant tool for cleaning under the wrist.
All garbage should be removed.
This form requires hand washing and wrist-to-wrist massage, usually for 2-6 minutes.
Long massage (10 minutes) is not necessary.
They must prevent water from flowing back into the hands when bathing.
Wash your hands with clean towels and dry them after washing and wear surgical clothes.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is advisable to wash or disinfect your hands before and after treating a patient.
For the management of staphylococcal infections in hospitals, it was found that the greatest benefit from hand washing was obtained from the first 20 percent washing, and the very few additional benefits obtained from frequent hand washing were increased to more than 35%.
Handwashing with ordinary soap still transmits three times more foodborne bacteria than washing with disinfectant soap.A comparison between handwashing with alcohol and handwashing with the same 30-second disinfectant soap showed that handwashing with alcohol reduced infection by 26% more than soap, which killed germs.
But soap and water are more effective than handwashing, disinfecting hands to reduce the H1N1 influenza, clostridium virus and influenza virus that originate from the hands.Meetings to improve hand hygiene in healthcare settings may involve educating staff on hand washing, increasing hand sanitization with alcohol, and providing detailed verbal and oral reminders to staff.
There is a need for more research to determine which interventions are most effective in different healthcare settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is recognized as a cost-effective, essential tool for good health and access to good nutrition.
But the lack of a reliable supply of clean water, soap or handwashing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces makes it difficult to achieve universal handwashing practices.
For example, handwashing facilities in most of the African deserts, near private and public toilets, are rare, despite being a costly option in the construction of handwashing facilities.
However, this low handwashing rate may be due to poor handwashing habits rather than a lack of water or soap.
Promoting and advocating for handwashing with soap can influence policy decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing, and lead to long-term behavioral changes in people.
For this work to be effective, monitoring and evaluation are essential.
A systematic review of 70 studies found that community-based approaches were effective in increasing minimal handwashing in LMICs while social marketing campaigns were ineffective.An example of the promotion of handwashing in schools is the "Three Key Steps" by UNICEF, which encourages schools to implement simple and low-cost initial steps to ensure students wash their hands with soap, among other hygienic measures.
When the minimum standard is met, the school can move from a one-star rating to the highest three-star rating.
Building more handwashing facilities is part of the promotion of handwashing, which provides a reduction in infectious disease and reduced child mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness-raising campaign that is trying to achieve behavioural change.As a result of the 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF promoted the adoption of handwashing as a sign of emotion.
A small number of studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of handwashing in developing countries associated with DALYs.
But one review found that promoting handwashing with soap was actually less costly than other sanitation and water interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, and especially for those in vulnerable situations such as a newborn mother or a wounded soldier in a hospital, was first recognized in the mid-19th century by two hand hygienists: the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Florence Nightingale, the British "founder of modern nursing".
At the time, most people still believed that infection was caused by bad smells called miasms.
In the 1980s, an outbreak of foodborne and healthcare-associated infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to actively promote hand hygiene, an important way to prevent infection.
Following the 2009 swine flu outbreak and the global COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, some countries realized that handwashing with soap was essential to protect themselves from infection.
For example, signs with the words "Technical hand washing properly" are hung next to hand washing facilities in public toilets and in the toilets of office buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "wash your hands to wipe something" means declaring no responsibility for something or sharing the sincerity in something.
It originated from the biblical text in Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washes his hands of the decision to crucify Jesus Christ, but has become a term of increasing use in some English communities.
The character of Mable in Shakespeare's play begins to force her hand by attempting to wipe away the traces of a fantasy that represents her sense of guilt regarding a crime she committed and encourages her husband to commit.
They found that people after remembering or thinking about immoral behavior tended to think about handwashing more often than others and tended to value handwashing devices more.
Furthermore, those who were allowed to wash their hands after such a thoughtful argument were less likely to engage in "shame washing" or other remedial activities as the volunteers did.
Some religions claim that hand washing is for hygiene and other symbolic purposes. The symbolism of hand washing using water but not soap is part of the specific characteristics of hand washing in some religions, including the Bahá'í Faith, Hinduism, tevilah and netilat yadayim in Judaism, Lavabo in Christianity, and Wudhu in Islam. All of those religions also emphasize the need to wash hands, especially after certain activities.
Hindus, Jews and Muslims require hand washing after using the toilet.
Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, Jews, and Muslims all require washing their hands before and after eating.
Workplace risk management for COVID-19
Occupational hazard management for COVID-19 is the implementation of occupational safety and health measures for the prevention of the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak.
Workplace risk monitoring is based on workplace and workplace risk assessment, source of exposure, severity of illness in the community, and individual risk factors for COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have minimal workplace contact with the public and other colleagues, recommended use of basic infection prevention measures, including hand washing, encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory symptoms, and maintaining normal hygiene and disinfection of the work environment.
Moderate-risk occupations include those that require frequent or close contact with strangers or suspected COVID-19 cases but may be transmitted due to ongoing community transmission or international travel.
This includes employees who have contact with the general public, such as in schools, densely populated work environments, and some high-end retail outlets.
Risk management for this group is in addition to basic infection prevention measures, including ventilation using highly efficient ventilators, cough suppressants, and personal protective equipment available in case of contact with COVID-19 patients.
OSHA considers health care workers and funeral homes with known or suspected COVID-19 infections at high risk for direct exposure to high-risk exposure if the workers perform a robotic autopsy or collect or dispose of samples from people known or suspected to have COVID-19.
Risk management for these workers includes engineering controls such as negative pressure air chambers and work-appropriate personal protective equipment.
The COVID-19 outbreak may affect some workplaces.
Employees may be absent from work due to illness, need to care for others, or fear of potential exposure.
The tradeoffs can change both in terms of what goods are demanded and the means of obtaining these goods (such as going shopping at peak hours or via a delivery or driver service).
Finally, the transportation of goods from geographic areas severely affected by Covid-19 is suspended.Epidemic response and preparedness plans may be used to guide preventive actions.
A plan addressing the level of work-related and occupational risks, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from home and community installations, and individual employee risk factors such as age or general health conditions.
They also outline the management necessary to address those risks and preparedness plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreak.
Preparation and response to an epidemic can be the responsibility of national or subnational authorities.
The objectives for responding to the outbreak include reducing dispatch among workers, protecting people at high risk for adverse health consequences, maintaining business operations, and minimizing negative impacts on other entities in their supply chains.
The community-wide disease crisis is due to the response of businesses in the affected areas.
Risk sequencing is a widely used framework in occupational safety and health for effective group risk management.
When the risk of COVID-19 is not eliminated, the most effective control is engineering control, followed by administrative control and last but not least, personal protective equipment.
Engineering management involves discouraging employees from work-related hazards without depending on worker behavior and can be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative change is a change in work policies or procedures that requires action by employees or employers.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some challenges.
All types of PPE must be selected based on the risk to workers, appropriately equipped as practicable (e.g. respirators), properly fitted and properly maintained, regularly inspected, maintained and replaced as necessary, and properly removed, cleaned and stored or disposed of to avoid transmission.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), low-risk jobs have fewer workplace interactions with the public and other co-workers.
The recommended disinfection measures for the workplace include frequent hand washing and flushing, encouraging employees to stay home if they are sick, respiratory symptoms including coughing and sneezing, providing lipstick and sanitary pads, preparing for telecommunications or changing diapers if necessary, not encouraging employees to use other people's tools and equipment, and maintaining the hygiene and disinfection of the work environment.
Identifying and isolating susceptible individuals is an important step in protecting employees, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) requires that employees with symptoms of severe respiratory illness stay home until they have no fever, cough, or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking antipyretic or other anti-symptomatic medications, and the sick leave policy is reversible, allowing employees to stay home to care for a sick family member, and that employees be aware of those rules.
According to OSHA, moderate-risk occupations include those that require frequent or close contact within six feet (1.8 meters) of a stranger or suspected COVID-19 patient but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 because of ongoing community transmission around a business location or because the individual has recently traveled internationally to a location with an outbreak of COVID-19.
This includes personnel who have contact with the general public, such as in schools, work environments, high population densities, and some high-risk retail settings. Engineering management for these groups and high-risk groups includes the installation of high-efficiency ventilation, ventilation, installation of protective barriers such as blinds, blinds, and window openers for consumer services; administrative controls for these groups and some of the most at-risk groups; personal or personal protective equipment; and training for those at-risk groups who are at high risk of exposure to waterborne diseases or who remain at home. In addition to meeting with the network, the network creates a unique interactive environment that provides the necessary restroom to prevent exposure to the workplace, provides a platform for people to work together to protect themselves and others from COVID-19, and provides training on how to protect themselves and their families from the risks of workplace and workplace illness and other workplace hazards.
Personnel in this risk group rarely require the use of respirators.
If a person becomes ill on board, proper monitoring to protect staff and other passengers includes isolating the sick person from others by a 6-foot distance, assigning a crisis member to serve the sick person and giving the sick person a mask, or asking the sick person to cover their mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.
Aircrew should wear disposable medical gloves after use when caring for sick passengers or when exposed to body fluids, and may have additional personal protective equipment if you have a fever, chronic cough or shortness of breath.
Handbags and other disposable items should be disposed of in a biofuel bag, and surfaces containing oils should be cleaned and disinfected. For commercial transportation, including cruise ships and other passenger vessels, risk management includes delaying travel while sick, isolating themselves, and notifying the onboard medical center immediately if anyone has a fever or other symptoms while on board.
In principle, medical monitoring should take place in a private room.For schools and child care facilities, the CDC recommends temporary closures to clean or disinfect if an infected person is in the school building, regardless of community outbreaks.
When there is minimal community outreach to the medium, strategies of social distancing can be implemented such as avoiding field trips, conferences, and other large gatherings such as physical education or band classes or food at the cafe, increasing the gap between tables, surprising arrivals and departures, limiting the number of unnecessary visitors, and using separate health office locations for children with flu-like symptoms.
When there is a high volume of transportation in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extended school training may be considered.For law enforcement personnel who perform daily activities immediately, health is considered low-risk by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must be in contact with individuals who have confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection are advised to follow the same instructions as emergency medical technicians, including appropriate personal protective equipment.
If contact is interrupted during this time of distress, employees should clean and disinfect their belts and sanitary towels before reuse using a radiator or washing machine, and follow standard procedures for storing and disposing of used sanitary towels, as well as for storing and washing clothing.
OSHA considers some health care workers and cemeteries at high risk of exposure risks.
High-risk jobs include providing healthcare services, laboratory support, and medical transportation personnel who are known to be patients with suspected COVID-19 infection.
These become a high risk if the personnel performs ventilation procedures or collects or receives samples from known or suspected COVID-19 patients.
Procedures for the separation of solids or liquids into gases include inhalation, coughing, lung imaging, and some dental procedures or open sample collection.
Funeral home jobs are high-risk, including workers involved in the preparation of human cadavers who knew or suspected a case of COVID-19 when they died. All of these positions are at high risk if they are undergoing autopsy. Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include such as isolation rooms for known or suspected COVID-19 patients, including when procedures to create devices where volatile particles can be ejected are implemented.
Specialised positive air pressure may be appropriate in some healthcare settings and cemeteries.
Samples should be stored with caution prior to level 3 biosafety.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be isolated into different waiting areas depending on whether they are suspected COVID-19 cases.In addition, other PPE OSHA recommends use of respirators for those working within 6 feet of known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 patients and anyone who is undergoing airway ventilation procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 or better respiratory mask is used in the context of a comprehensive, comprehensive respiratory protection program that includes appropriate testing, training, and clinical practice.
Other types of respirators can provide more protection and improve worker mobility.WHO does not recommend wearing over-the-counter gloves, as COVID-19 is a respiratory illness rather than a fluid-borne disease.
The World Health Organization recommends surgical masks for entry control personnel only.
For those who are collecting respiratory samples, caring for, or transporting COVID-19 patients without a solid or liquid-to-gas separation procedure, WHO recommends the use of a medical mask, eye protection or face shield, jacket and glove.
The process of separating solids or liquids into gases is used, and the masks are replaced by N95 or FFP2 masks.
Because the global supply of PPE is insufficient, WHO recommends reducing the need for PPE through telemedicine, physical devices such as clear windows, allowing only those engaged in direct care to enter rooms with COVID-19 patients, using only the PPE necessary for specific work, continuing to use the same respiratory equipment without taking it away while caring for multiple patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the PPE supply chain, and encouraging the use of barriers for asymptomatic individuals.

Subject LINE: [COVID-19] Burden reduction and preparation for the future
Date and time of posting: 14 March 2020 at 00:24 UTC
The following article will help you to understand how to use the Bible in your own life.
In this month, we realize that we are in a very interesting situation.
The COVID-19 pandemic is a clear indication of the interconnectedness between people and our world and the responsibilities we have for one another.
We don't have a model for its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on the kind of global understanding, collaboration and community building that is at the heart of this organization.
The photography and attention we see among all our colleagues through emails, phone calls and chats is a remarkable strength of the incredible people we are fortunate enough to work with.
I have nothing more grateful and proud to have you as my partners.
Last week, someone came to me and said they appreciated our work.
They heard from me what it means for the world to be able to go back to Wikipedia now and what a powerful signal this important resource is to be online and available to everyone.
Your work makes this possible, whether you keep this site up or our colleagues pay or our community is safe.
The world needs the information Wikipedia provides now more than ever.
This is a time when not only what we do, but how we do it will make an impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role, we will be making some adjustments to the way we work together starting next week.
We can also be confident that our work will be rewarded.
As Robyn mentioned earlier, Team C met last night to discuss our methodology and schedule for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we discussed what we thought was the appropriate response to what we were facing and the best way to make the organization sustainable during this time.
Moreover, we want to relieve tension and support our mission in the long term.
If you need to call back, that's fine.
For all employees, employers and contractors:
Our daily work expectancy will be approximately 4 hours per day or 20 hours per week until further notice.
We do not issue vacation days - if you can work overtime, the mission may need you.
However, the world is unpredictable right now, and whether you need to care for your loved one, buy a drug or see a doctor, your well-being is our priority.
We don't track your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It should go without saying, but we are talking.
No sick days or PTO required - just tell your manager and help your team of editors and schedulers to make sure the most important parts of the job are covered.
(If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, please notify Bryan in T&amp;C Ops so that T&amp;C can provide assistance and ensure that your condition receives proper attention from management.)
People's hours will be paid in full.
We have spoken before, and we are pledging again to honor our commitments to our chefs and co-workers every hour.
Everyone will be paid on the basis of their normal working hours under normal circumstances.
This includes if you are ill and unable to work.
If you work, we support you.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress with the world around us.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in times like these.
Again, this is your own personal care.
We recommend that you contact your supervisor so that we know what to expect and how to adjust accordingly.
A piece of work is considered necessary.
There are a few things we have to keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust and Security, and Organic teams (among other teams) do critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin working with all departments to evaluate current objectives and turn our attention to supporting what is necessary for our mission.
There is a lot of work to do for all of us, we just focus on the most essential projects.
Slowing down now won't hurt later.
We have no plans to double-track when the pandemic is over.
You will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are not currently realistic.
We accept the changed situation and will work on new targets and timelines that are appropriate.
What happened with the programme?
To adapt to new flexibilities and daily work hours expectations, we intend to adjust the timing for our 2020-2021 annual plan submission.
Our goal is to propose an extension to our 2019-2020 plan, allowing more time for budgeting to allow employees to prioritize critical tasks, care for themselves and loved ones, while accepting those who need or are willing to reduce analytics over the next few weeks.
This extension of the deadline greatly reduces the current planning workload and pressure across the entire entity.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update the executives and team on the next steps once we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for your leadership in this mission.
The following article will help you to avoid becoming a victim of such abuse.
Last week, we learned that one of our SF-based colleagues may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, we were very careful, hiring a virus sanitizer to clean up all the areas in the San Francisco office.
They used hospital disinfection solutions to disinfect all surfaces as well as waiting rooms and train banks to our floors.
The building is using a protocol of personal care obligations that uses products that support the safety of their customers.
We felt that the office would be well prepared when we decided to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 disease protocol with us and all DC base staff members.
As of last week, our DC office has moved to remote planning, following guidance shared with the City of San Francisco.
As some of my NYC-based colleagues know, we also discussed location rentals in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our remote colleagues know that this can be a correction and want to give you some tips:
Limit the duration of the meeting to a maximum of one or two hours.
If longer periods are required, consider how they can be broken down into several days.
Make sure that the meeting schedule, the format, and the reading materials are clear.
Create original video using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaborative and connected live streaming.
Lead to coordinate all meetings, someone to monitor discussions for questions and to keep track of lists of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or collaborate on notes).
Email technical support if you need a hard copy.
Healthy snacks.
#join the remote network in Slack to talk to your colleagues about work done.
The HR team is looking for technical guidance via the website to support the increased work of distributing funds across the board.
Last week, we suggested that all community donors cancel Wikimedia-sponsored public events such as editathons until the WHO declares the outbreak over.
We let them know that we understand that our proposals for cancellations and other restrictions may make it impossible to fulfill agreed relief activities and that no one will be penalized for delaying or modifying those targets.
In the coming weeks, we will be following up on further guidelines for Wikimedia and community conferences and local themes.
Common sense from around the world seems to be saddened by the disruption, but relieved by the clarity and ability to focus on their own Wikimedia and other communities.
Going forward, CRT is working on creating a Meta-Wiki page to provide a repository for the community to track impact and track our interactions with them.
Stay connected around COVID-19-related issues
We will send out an invitation to your representative for Thursday next week at 14:00 UTC/07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to share updates, answer your questions and spend some time interacting.
We all face these problems and we're here to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find information from these emails and all other important COVID-19-related information on the Office Wiki website.
CRT will keep these pages up to date and all information in one place.
We are working to maintain regular contact with staff living in the most affected countries at the moment.
If you have any questions about travel, major events, workflows, insurance problems, or anything else you need help with, do not hesitate to contact and work with the CRT.
We are here to help provide support and communication as needed.
If you have a problem or are having trouble, please email Bryan Judan, Global HR Director.
None of these changes should be seen as abandoning our jobs and responsibilities.
Rather, they are a recognition that now our jobs and responsibilities are likely to need to be aligned in ways that we didn't before.
These are steps we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, providing our movement with the support they need and the world with the services they depend on.
Our planned work will be there waiting for us when the time comes.
For now, it's time to support each other and create a warehouse for the important work that's coming in the coming weeks and possibly months.
We need all of you to make that happen, and so we need all of you to take care of yourselves and your families so that you can be the best you can be when you need to be.
Now wash your hands and don't touch your face.
Katherine, CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen D, Gregory V, Jaime V, Joel L, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the rest of the lead cast (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Robyn A, Ryan M, and Toby N).
ACE2 is an enzyme found on the outer surfaces of the cells of the lungs, blood vessels, heart, kidney, and stomach.
ACE2 opposes the action of actin-binding enzyme (ACE) associated with decreased levels of actin-II and increased Ang (((1-7) making it a successful drug target for the treatment of coronary artery disease. ACE2 also acts as an entry point into cells for certain coronaviruses.
The human enzyme generation is often referred to as hACE2.
Enzyme elimination kinase 2 is a metal-containing ring located on the surface of endothelial cells and other cells.
ACE2 is encoded by the N-terminal peptidase M2 domain and the acid transporter domain in the C-terminal collagen complex.
ACE2 is a type I protein-binding pathway whose enzymes act directly on the surface of lung and other cells.
The extracellular domain of ACE2 is cleaved from the transcriptional domain by another enzyme known as cadesis, while the resulting degraded protein is released into the bloodstream and eventually into the urine.
ACE2 is present in most tissues: ACE2 is bound to the cell walls of type II cells, the liver, small intestinal stem cells, venous and endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells of the arteries in most tissues.
ACE2 mRNA is also present in the outer membrane of the brain striatum, hypothalamus, and brain cells.
The main function of ACE2 is to act as a response equilibrium regulator to ACE.
ACE cuts the hormone anticoagulant I into the bloodstream by synthesizing anticoagulant II.
ACE2 cleaved the carboxyl-terminal amino acid from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and cleaved it into the vasodilator angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also kill some other peptides, including [des-Arg9] - the drugs bradykinin, apelin, neurotensin, dynorphin A and ghrelin.
ACE2 helps in the regulation of the expression of the amino acid transporters SLC6A19 and C in Hartnup's disease.
Because of this, the ACE2 crosslinking protein acts as a key entry point into cells for some viruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS) and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the mutation of the S1 proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 into the ACE2 enzyme present on the cell surface, resulting in the breakdown and localization of the virus and the enzyme entering the endosomes located in the cell.
This induction process also requires the S protein to be released via the TMPRSS2 protein receptor, an inhibition that is being investigated as a potential treatment.This activity has led some to speculate that lowering ACE2 levels in cells may help fight infection.
However, some social experts and institutions still recommend continued use of ACE inhibitors and ARB therapy.
A systematic review and analysis study published on July 11, 2012 found that the use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a 34% decrease in the incidence of pneumonia compared to non-users.
However, the risk of pneumonia was reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors who were previously at higher risk of pneumonia, especially in patients with cerebral palsy and heart failure.
Use of ACE inhibitors has also been linked to reduced mortality rates associated with hepatitis, although the results are not as strong as the risk of hepatitis in general.
The combination of ACE2 (rhACE2) is considered a highly effective treatment for liver disease and it leads to a positive evolution of blood circulation in the lungs as well as oxygen depletion, which is linked to lipopolysaccharide, which causes severe respiratory distress.
The half-life of rhACE2 in humans is approximately 10 hours, and the onset of activity is 30 minutes plus the effective duration (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhACE2 can be a successful drug for those who are intolerant to the habitual anti-associative system inhibitor (RAS inhibitor) or in patients in whom the activity of two anti-associative enzymes is enhanced.The induced rhACE2 was evaluated in clinical trials for the treatment of severe respiratory symptoms.
The b'COVID-19 app is a mobile application designed to help track contacts in response to the 2019-20 global coronavirus pandemic, for example, the process of identifying people who have come into contact with infected people.
Many applications have been proposed or made with the official support of some local governments and authorities.
Several frameworks for the creation of impact monitoring programs have been developed.
Privacy concerns have been raised, especially about systems based on tracking the geolocation of application users.
Options for less common intrusions include using Bluetooth waves to record the distance to another user's phone.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple jointly announced that they would integrate functions to support Bluetooth-based apps directly into their Android and iOS operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, in partnership with Alipay, has launched an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with someone with COVID-19.
It is available in more than 200 cities in China, and in Singapore, a program called TraceTogether is being deployed.
"The software was developed by the local tech community, released openly, and will be handed over to the government.North Macedonia has deployed the ""StopKorona!"" software, a Bluetooth-based application to track contact with potential infected people and provide rapid response to health authorities".
The programme was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
On 14 April 2020, the mobile app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
"On 12 April, the government confirmed that an exposure tracking programme was in development and would be rolled out in the coming weeks. "Similar programmes are planned in Ireland and France (""StopCovid"")".
Australia and New Zealand are considering using the TraceTogether and BlueTrace protocols of Singapore.Russia intends to implement a geographic barrier program for COVID-19 diagnosed patients living in Moscow, where the program was developed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, professor of engineering security at the University of Cambridge, lists the practical problems that can arise with systems-based software, including false positives and inefficiencies if the software is deployed to a small population.
To address concerns about the spread of "coronavirus" apps that cause confusion or harm, Apple has limited the categories of entities that can include coronavirus-related apps in its App Store, limiting them to "official" or "famous" entities only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Private campaigners have expressed concern about the impact of mass surveillance using coronavirus software, particularly whether surveillance schemes designed to address the pandemic will be dismantled when there is no threat.
Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement calling for limits on this type of surveillance.
The agencies announced eight conditions for the government's plans:
"Surveillance must be ""lawful, necessary and proportionate""".
Continued monitoring and surveillance will require a cease-fire.
Data use will be limited for the purpose of COVID-19
Data security and anonymity are protected and shown to be protected based on evidence.
Digital surveillance will avoid discrimination and hardship.
Any sharing of data with third parties will be regulated by law.
There must be protection against abuse and the right of citizens to respond to any abuse.
Meaningful participation from all relevant stakeholders will be required, including from public health experts and follow-up teams.The German Computer Club on the Move (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (RSF) have also issued a watchlist.
Google/Apple plans to address the issue of surveillance by removing tracking cameras from their devices' operating systems when not needed.
Some countries have used location-based network tracking instead of apps, eliminating the need to download apps and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, surveillance networks are allowed to be used.
Network-based solutions that are capable of using unanalyzed location data can have a significant impact on privacy.
However, not all systems with a central hub must have a connection to and location data of any individual. The system's password is designed to be used only to a single central hub in communication (see below).
In South Korea, software-independent systems are used to implement exposure tracking.
Instead of using a phone app, the system collected information from various sources, including mobile devices, tracking data and card transaction data, and combined this data to create a text message alert sent to individuals who may be infected.
In addition to using this information to report on contacts who have been missing, the government has also made information about the location public, which was allowed due to a significant change in privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through a number of apps and websites. Countries including Germany have also considered using both centralized and privacy-protecting systems.
As of 6 April 2020, details have not been released.
Private contact tracking is a well-established concept, with major research dating back to 2013.As of 7 April 2020, several groups of experts have been working towards a suitable solution for privacy, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) systems to record the distance near another user's phone.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort with a centralized and sophisticated approach and not a single procedure. The protocol includes proximity monitoring, which can maintain privacy, laboratory-based contact (DP-PPT/DP-3T), emergency contact number (TCN, fka communication event number, CEN), privacy-sensitive protocols and films for telephone communication monitoring (PACT), and others.
According to the protocol, no private information is breached from the device itself and all feeds are made on the device.
A private team at the MIT Media Lab developed SafePaths, a software application for using privacy-protecting technologies when collecting and using location or routing data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the official report, Misuse of Modified Apps: Maintaining Personal Privacy in the Face of Spread, released in March 2020. Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform by Enigma MPC, a privacy technology developer that was originally developed at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hard-core (computer-based) technology to allow users to share location and sensitive health data with other users and officials without compromising the privacy of the data.
On 5 April 2020, the Global TCN Alliance was formed by groups united around a common core of values, common procedures and most competing protocols, with the aim of reducing fragmentation and launching a global inter-operability of monitoring and early warning programs, which are key aspects of achieving universal adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace open source protocol used by the official government software.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the Android and iOS mobile phone operating systems, announced an initiative for virus exposure tracking that they claimed would protect privacy based on a combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy protection.
They also published technical specifications of the underlying technology used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be rolled out in three phases:
There is a government toolkit in place to develop a coronavirus surveillance program.
The integration of this feature directly into iOS and Android. Google and Apple plan to address the ongoing adoption and monitoring issues by first rolling out the feature through an operating system update, and then removing it in the same manner once the threat has passed.
Drug repositioning (also known as drug reuse, re-functioning, or treatment repositioning) is the use of a drug that has been authorized for the treatment of a disease or medical condition other than that for which it was originally created.
This is a scientifically based study that is currently moving forward to develop effective and safe COVID-19 treatments.
Other research directions include the development of a vaccine for COVID-19 and the administration of a blood plasma containing SARS-CoV-2 with approximately 66 different proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites.
Analysis of the site of infection can provide a valid reason in the development of anti-protein drugs for COVID-19.
Among the main target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 are proteins that are similar to papain protease RNA, RNA polymerase-dependent helicase, S-protein and ADP ribophosphatase.

The COVID-19 b'A vaccine is a prototype vaccine against the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has been completed, several trials are underway to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, a deadly virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccine candidates were in phase one safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread worldwide in 2020, leading to a massive investment and research effort to develop a vaccine.
Many agencies are using the promoted genes to develop a vaccine that could be effective against SARS-CoV-2.
The key actions of the CEPI initiative for vaccine development outlined in April are speed, manufacturing capacity, scale deployment and global reach.
In April, scientists from CEPI reported that 10 different technology platforms were under R&D in early 2020 to develop an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
The main objectives of the approaches to Phase I safety research include:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Phase one developer and trial vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
Viral agent (manufacturer and Phase 1 vaccine tester: CanSino Biologics, adeno-virus type 5 vector)
According to a report by a team of scientists from CEPI in April, 115 experimental vaccines are in the early stages of development, with 78 confirmed as ongoing projects (79 according to the Milken Institute) and 37 more announced, but little public information (assuming everything is in the planning and development stages).
Phase I-II trials conduct preliminary safety and efficacy trials, usually at random, with controlled drugs and in multiple sites, while defining a clear dosage and efficacy.
Phase II trials require multiple participants, including a control group, and test the effectiveness of a vaccine to prevent disease while monitoring for optimal adverse effects.
"Of the 79 vaccine candidates currently in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 are not yet in human evaluation (are in ""pre-treatment"" studies)".

In March 2020, the US government, three major industries and universities teamed up to deploy IBM's supercomputers along with the cloud storage facilities of Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have hereditary or so-called non-specific effects.
That means they can be more beneficial than the disease they prevent.
A randomized trial in Australia is enrolling 4,170 healthcare workers for the study.
A vaccine that is feasible to develop will not be safe or effective.
Recent studies of vaccine efficacy in inhibiting COVID-19 against ACE2-transgenic animals such as rats, other laboratory animals, and non-human hosts, all of which are for biosafety level 3 in live virus management and international harmonization to ensure standard safety procedures.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS have been tested in animal models, not humans.
As of 2020, there is no treatment or vaccine against SARS that has been shown to be safe and effective in humans.
According to research published in 2005 and 2006, identification and development of a vaccine or treatment for SARS is a top priority for governments and public health agencies around the world.
As MERS spreads, existing epidemiological research is believed to provide a useful model for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one MERS vaccine (DNA-based) has completed a phase one clinical trial in humans, and three other phase one clinical trials are underway, all of which are virulent-agent vaccines; two of which are adenoviral vectors (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one is the immunovirus vector (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media has promoted a conspiracy theory, claiming that the virus behind COVID-19 has been discovered and that a vaccine already exists.
Patents cited from social media posts cite existing patents on gene sequencing and vaccines for other coronaviruses such as SARS coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) causes severe respiratory distress caused by the coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, constipation, stomach pain, olfactory problems, and stomach pain.
The period from exposure to the first symptoms is about five days, but it can last from two to fourteen days.
While most cases cause symptoms, some develop into viral pneumonia and multiple organ failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is spread primarily from person to person when in close contact, often through small fluid-filled sores produced by coughing, coughing, or talking.
When these water vapours are produced, when exhaled, they usually fall to the ground or surface rather than passing over a long distance.
People are infected by contact with infected surfaces, then their eyes, nose and mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after onset of symptoms, meaning that infection may be pre-existing or at different stages of the disease.The standard diagnostic method is rRT-PCR (radioactive transcription polymerase chain reaction) counting taken from nasal and bowel samples.
Masks are recommended for people suspected of being infected with the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations for wearing masks in public places vary, with some authorities advising against their wearing, others introducing them and others requiring them to be worn.
There is currently no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local infections have been recorded in most countries across the six WHO regions.
People infected with the virus may experience no symptoms or develop flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include shortness of breath, chest pain or persistent pressure, confusion, difficulty waking up, and dark or blue face or lips. Immediate medical attention is recommended if these symptoms occur.
Upper respiratory symptoms include cold, fever, or pain.
Symptoms of abdominal pain such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are observed at different rates.
Some cases in China initially showed only chest tightness and chest pain.
In some cases, the disease can progress to liver disease, inflammation, multiple organ damage, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The symptomatic period of COVID-19 after infection with the virus is usually five to six days, but it can also be anywhere from two to 14 days.
97.5% of people who develop symptoms will have the condition within 11.5 days of infection.Reports indicate that not all people who become infected develop symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic transcription groups in transmission is not yet well understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of asymptomatic cases is currently unknown and under study, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reports that 20% of all infections remain asymptomatic during hospital stays.
China's National Health Commission began counting asymptomatic cases in its daily cases on April 1, out of 166 cases that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic on testing.
Both mouth and throat can carry a large amount of the virus.
Talking out loud releases more urine than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that a cough that did not stop the mouth could cause a water sneeze to travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not generally airborne, the National Academy of Sciences suggested that biogas delivery is possible, and air collectors were placed in large halls outside human rooms to generate positive RNA samples.
Some forms of medical intervention, such as ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause the external airway to stop, thus causing airborne transmission.
While there are concerns that it can be transmitted through mosquitoes, the risk is believed to be low.The virus is more likely to be transmitted when humans have symptoms, while transmission is possible before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) notes that while it is not yet clear how easily the disease spreads, in general, one person can transmit from two to three others.The virus can survive from hours to days on surfaces.
In particular, the virus was found to be detectable for up to one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on 99% of the material.
However, it varies depending on taste and temperature.
Soap and detergents are also effective if used correctly.Soap products damage the virus's immune system, rendering it inactive, and also cleanse the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate (antimicrobial drugs) were less effective.In a Hong Kong study, oral urine samples were taken on average two days after hospital admission.
Five of the six patients tested had a high viral load on the first test, and the sixth patient was shown to have a high viral load on the second test day.
Severe respiratory syndrome of SARS-CoV-2 is similar to the severe respiratory syndrome of the novel coronavirus, which was initially isolated from three patients with pneumonia linked to a cluster of severe respiratory illnesses in Wuhan.
All of the features of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus occur in coronavirus-related viruses.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which explodes its defences.SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the SARS-CoV parent virus.
The liver is the organ most affected by COVID-19 as the virus enters the host cells via antigen-presenting cells, converting to ACE2 (ACE2) which is secreted by small respiratory cells, the second type of the liver.
"The virus uses a special glycoprotein on the surface called a ""spike"" (peplomer) to bind to ACE2 and insert a host cell".
A mild heart condition was found in 12% of those infected and hospitalized in Wuhan, China, and most were severe.
The incidence of cardiovascular symptoms is high due to systemic inflammatory responses and immune system problems during the course of the disease, but mild cardiovascular injury can also be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac function.
High rates of pulmonary arteriosclerosis (31%) and venous thrombosis (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infection and may be associated with poor prognosis.Operations on people who died from COVID-19 have found alveolar damage (DAD) and inflammation carried by lymphocytes in the lungs.
Although SARS-COV-2 requires the ACE2 enzyme present on the cells of the respiratory tract, patients with severe COVID-19 disease have symptoms similar to full-blown inflammation.
Specifically, this GM-CSF pathogen secretes T cells that have been shown to be involved in inflammation as they are involved in IL-6 release from monocytes and acute pneumonia in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphocytic infiltration has also been reported with surgery.
The World Health Organization has announced several methods to detect the virus.
The standard method of testing is real-time polymerase chain reaction (rT-PCR).
This test is usually done on a sample from the respiratory tract obtained by urine. However, a nasal or a spinal sample may also be taken.
In general, results can be seen within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but these tests require two blood samples that are separated by two weeks and the results are of little immediate value.
Chinese scientists can isolate the coronavirus and sequence its genes so that laboratories around the world can independently develop polymerase chain reaction tests to detect infections caused by the virus.
As of 4 April 2020, a biopsy test (which can detect active viral infection and whether a person has been previously infected) is under development but not yet widely used.
Chinese experience with the test has shown accuracy of only 60 to 70%.
The Food and Drug Administration in the United States approved the first clinical trial of a drug on March 21, 2020, for use later that month.The diagnostic guidelines issued by Wuhan University Medical Center recommend a method of detecting infection based on the specific nature of the treatment and the risk of outbreaks.
A discomfort on the side mirror with uneven distribution of tools, equipment and back is common in early infections.
Subpleural rigidity control (a roughening of the lobular septum with alveolar filling as an ether) and fusion may occur as the disease progresses.
There is very little data on the microbiology and pathology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings during surgery are:
What we can see is fluid in the lungs, heart, lung, and lung fluid.
Four types of viral hepatitis can be observed in severity:
Mild pneumonia: pneumonia, subdural pneumonia, abnormal liver enlargement, internal inflammation with penetration of the urine and the formation of lymph nodes.
Severe pulmonary disease: Multiple ruptures of the pulmonary ducts with fluid discharge from the ducts.
DAD is a cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxia.
Treatment of pneumonia: preparation of exudates in the alveolar cavity and chronic pneumonia
Blood: DIC, leukoerythroblastic reaction
Precautions to reduce the risk of infection include staying at home, avoiding public places, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, maintaining respiratory hygiene, and avoiding contact with eyes, nose, or mouth when not washing hands.
The CDC recommends that you cover your mouth and nose with a lipstick when coughing or coughing and recommend using the inside of your wrist if you do not have a lipstick.
Proper hand hygiene after coughing or sneezing is encouraged.
The CDC recommends the use of face masks in public, as part of a measure to reduce transmission of the virus from asymptomatic individuals.Social distancing measures aim to reduce exposure of infected people to crowds by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings, etc.
The guidelines for keeping distance also include that people keep a distance of at least 6 feet (1.8 m) from each other.
No drugs are known to be effective in preventing COVID-19.Since a vaccine is not expected to be discovered until 2021, a key part of COVID-19 management is trying to reduce the peak incidence of the epidemic, known as "threshold cohesion".
The CDC also recommends that individuals wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the bathroom or when hands are visibly numb, before eating, and after coughing, sneezing, or coughing.
The organization further recommends using hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol by volume, but only when soap and water cannot be used.For areas where hand sanitizers are not available, the World Health Organization recommends two forms for local production.
All of these anti-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activities have increased activity from ethanol or isopropanol.
The chemical component hydrogen peroxide is used in the disinfection of alcohol, it is not an active substance for disinfection of hands.
Glycerol is added as a primary preservative.
People are administered supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygenation, and assistance with other vital organs that are affected by infection.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a regular mask.
Extracorporeal muscular oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to treat respiratory failure, but its benefits remain under consideration.
Personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle, as well as diet, are recommended to improve fitness.
Follow-up treatment may be beneficial for those with mild early-stage symptoms after infection.The World Health Organization as well as China's National Health Commission have issued guidance on how to care for hospitalized COVID-19 patients.
Emergency medical technicians and pulmonary specialists in the United States have been trying to link treatment recommendations from various agencies into the IBCC's free, accessible database.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen) instead of ibuprofen for initial use.
Care must be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in healthcare settings when using work forms that can produce gases, such as air conditioners or hand dryers.
Health professionals are deeply concerned about COVID-19 populations, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that patients be isolated in isolation rooms to prevent airborne infections (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and respiratory precautions.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also issued guidelines on the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended equipment is: personal protective equipment, respirators or masks, eye protection and medical gloves. If respirators are available, use them as a priority (instead of masks).
N95 masks are approved for industrial use, but the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authorizes masks for use under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).
They are designed to protect against airborne particles such as dust, but efficacy against any specific biological agent is not guaranteed for off-label use.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of face masks, at least using handmade masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require the use of a respirator, but a percentage of cases do.
A type of respiratory aid for individuals with COVID-19-related respiratory problems is being actively studied for people in hospitals, with some evidence suggesting that ventilation may be avoided with high-level nasal aspiration or bi-level positive airway pressure therapy.
Whether these two lead to the same benefits for people with chronic illness is not known.
Some physicians prefer to have a mechanical ventilation system that is diffused whenever possible because this technique limits the spread of airborne particles compared to a high-flow nasal cannula. Severe cases are more common in older people (those over 60 years of age and especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries do not have adequate hospitals, limiting the ability of health systems to deal with the sudden increase in the number of severe COVID-19 cases requiring adequate hospital treatment.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care, 2.3% needed medical assistance of ventilation, and 1.4% died.
In China, about 30% of people in hospitals with recent COVID-19 infections are admitted to ICU.
Mechanical ventilators become more compact as symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) progress in COVID-19 and oxygen intake becomes more difficult.
Airways with the ability to control high pressure and PEEP are needed to maximize oxygen supply while reducing the risk of liver injury and pneumonia.
High levels of PEEP may not be present on older wind turbines.
Research into potential treatments began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
The broad-spectrum antiviral Remdesivir appears to be the most successful.
Although new drugs may take up to 2021 to develop, some of the drugs being tested are already authorized for other uses or are undergoing advanced testing.
Antiviral drugs may be tested in people with severe illness.
The World Health Organization recommends volunteer participation in trials on the efficacy and safety of the treatment.The FDA has provisionally authorized treatment using serum blood belonging to a laboratory laboratory and clinical trial in some cases where patients face serious and fatal consequences.
It has not undergone the necessary clinical studies to show that it is safe and effective for this disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to combat the spread of the disease.
Users are asked to enter their name and ID.
"The application can detect ""close contacts"" using surveillance data and thus is aware of the risk of infection".
Each user can also view the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only advises the person to self-vaccinate, but also notifies local health officials.Big data analysis on mobile phone data, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and virtual signatures are used to track infected people and their contacts in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to monitor the mobile phone data of people suspected of carrying the virus.
Measures have been taken to strengthen quarantine and protect anyone who has come into contact with an infected citizen.
In March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared phone location data with the Federal Government Agency of Armenia, Robert Koch Science, to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia has deployed facial recognition technology to detect cybercriminals.
Regional health officer in Italy, Giulio Gallera, said he had received a notification via the phone company that 40% of the population was still walking normally.
The German government launched a 48-hour hackathon over the weekend, with an estimated 42,000 participants.
Estonian President Kersti Kaljulaid called on the world to find innovative solutions to the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may experience severe stress from travel restrictions, travel restrictions, treatment effects, or fears of infection.
"The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying, ""The rise in social isolation, isolation, health concerns, stress and economic downturns is a major storm in the threat to people's mental health and wellbeing""".
The disease can occur in mild incidence with few symptoms or in association with other common upper respiratory illnesses such as the common cold.
Usually, mild cases recover in two weeks, while those with severe or very severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at higher risk of severe infection with COVID-19 based on data from other similar viruses such as SARS and MERS, but data for COVID-19 are lacking.For some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs, causing pneumonia.
In those most severely affected, COVID-19 disease can progress to severe respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which causes respiratory tract damage, seizures, and bacterial or organ damage.
The complications associated with COVID-19 include blood microorganisms, abnormal blood clots, and damage to the heart, kidneys, and liver.
Abnormalities of blood clotting, especially prothrombin time increases, were described in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal renal function was seen in 4% of this group.
About 20-30% of people with COVID-19 show elevated liver enzymes (inflammatory).
According to the same report, the average time between onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five people requiring hospital stays.
However, patients transferred to the ICU had an average of seven days between hospital stay and death.
In the first case study, the average time from the onset of symptoms to death was 14 days, with a range of six to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), men had a mortality rate of 2.8% and women had a mortality rate of 1.7%.
A biopsy of a postmortem lung specimen showed alveolar lesions with fibromyxoid cells exudating into both lungs.
Viral mutations are observed in lung cells.
The lung image is a symptom of acute respiratory syndrome (ARDS).
11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Health Commission of China, heart failure was noted by elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of hospitalizations have the same medical conditions as before the hospital visit.The availability of medical and socioeconomic resources of a region can affect mortality rates.
Estimates of mortality from disease conditions vary because regions differ, but also because the methods in estimation are complex.
Failure to count mild cases can lead to miscalculation of mortality rates.
But the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may mean that current mortality rates are overestimated.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely to have severe symptoms of COVID-19 and about 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to nonsmokers.Conservation concerns have been raised for chronic illness.
Hong Kong hospitals have found a decline in lung health in some people who have recovered from the disease by 20% to 30% and lung scans have shown organ damage.
It can cause symptoms after severe treatment after recovery.
As of March 2020, it was not known whether past infections provided effective and long-lasting immunity to those who recovered from the disease.
The immune system is seen to be dependent on the behaviour of other coronaviruses, but in some cases, COVID-19 is caused by a positive test for the coronavirus at a later time.
These cases are believed to be more common in long-term viral infections than relapses.
The virus is thought to be naturally occurring and to have originated in animals through transmission.
The exact origins are unknown, but in December 2019 there was an outbreak of viral infection, which led to human-to-human transmission.
A study of 41 initial cases of COVID-19 infection published in January 2020 in The Lancet suggested an early date of onset of symptoms, December 1, 2019.
The official publication of the World Health Organization reported the onset of the earliest symptoms on 8 December 2019.
Some measures are often used to confirm the death toll.
These numbers vary by region and time and are influenced by the volume of testing, the quality of healthcare systems, treatment options, time since the first outbreak, and demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and general health.
In late 2019, the World Health Organization assigned the emergency ICD-10 disease code number U07.1 for deaths from laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 for deaths from clinical diagnosis or COVID-19 epidemic without laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection.The ratio of infection deaths reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed within a given time period.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global case fatality rate was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
These numbers vary by region.Other measures include the mortality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed individuals who died from the disease, and infectious mortality rate (IFR), which reflects the percentage of infected individuals (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from the disease.
These statistics have no time limits and follow a specific population from infection through case resolution.
While not all people infected with the virus develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about the number of people infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease was spread by carnivals and spread to young people, resulting in low mortality rates and not all deaths from COVID-19 can be officially classified.
Moreover, the German healthcare system is not covered.
In the Netherlands, about 3% may have immune antibodies when evaluating a blood donor.
69 (0.004% of the population) are claimed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and its mortality rates differed between men and women.
The mortality rate was higher for men in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The highest risk for men is in their 50s, with a male-to-female ratio of only 90.
In China, the mortality rate is 2.8 percent for men and 1.7 percent for women.
The exact cause of these sex differences is unknown, but genetic and behavioral factors may be responsible.
Sexual immune system differences, decreased prevalence of smoking in women, and men with co-occurring progression of conditions such as hypertension at a younger age than women all may contribute to higher mortality rates in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men, and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the US government had not monitored sexual-related data on COVID-19 infections.
Studies have shown that viral infections such as Ebola, HIV, influenza and SARS affect men and women differently.
A high percentage of healthcare workers, especially nurses, are women, and they have a high risk of exposure to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease is COVID-19.
World Health Organization head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO stands for corona, VI for virus, D for disease, and 19 for disease when the outbreak was first identified, December 31, 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid referring to a specific geographic location (e.g. China), animal species or human group in accordance with international norms for naming that aim to prevent susceptibility.The virus that causes COVID-19 disease is designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
In addition, the World Health Organization uses the COVID-19 virus and the virus that causes COVID-19 in public communication.
"In general, both disease and virus are referred to as ""coronavirus""".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as coronavirus and Wuhan coronavirus.
In January 2020, the World Health Organization recommended 2019-nCov and novel respiratory illness 2019-nCoV as interim names for the virus and disease, following the 2015 Guidelines against the Use of Disease Names and Viral Names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to limited capacity in the standard supply chain, some digital companies are producing healthcare equipment such as nasal springs and ventilation units.
In one example, when an Italian hospital needed emergency ventilation and suppliers could not supply the need in time, a local startup developed a reverse-engineered product and produced the required 100 ventilators overnight.
Immediately after the outbreak of COVID-19, there was a dissemination of false information about the origin, prevention, treatment and general status of the disease, and all of this information was widely circulated on the Internet.
Humans appear to have the ability to spread the virus to some animals.
The study found no evidence of transmission in pigs, chickens and mice.
There is no approved drug or vaccine for the treatment of this disease.
International research into a vaccine for the treatment of COVID-19 is under the direction of governments, academic groups and researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization launched a concept of a collaborative trial to evaluate the efficacy of four existing antiviral therapies and identify the most effective compounds.
There is no vaccine, but various agencies are actively developing vaccines.
Previous studies of SARS-CoVs were reused because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 can enter human cells via ACE2 receptors.
There are three vaccine trials.
Initially, researchers aimed to develop a fully immunized vaccine.
Using such viruses, whether inactive or contained, is intended to stimulate the human immune system's response to new infections with COVID-19.
The second strategy, subunit vaccines, aims to create vaccines that stimulate the immune system to specific parts of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2+, such research focused on S-spike proteins that help the virus penetrate the ACE2 enzyme.
The third strategy is the nucleic acid vaccine (a new technology for developing a vaccine).
An experimental vaccine derived from one of these strategies will be tested for safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first vaccine trial began with four volunteers in Seattle.
The vaccine has a non-infectious genetic code from the virus that causes the disease.Enhancing antibody dependence has been suggested as a potential challenge for vaccine development for SARS-COV-2, but it has been a controversial topic.
There were over 300 active direct clinical trials underway as of April 2020.
Seven trials evaluated existing approved treatments for diabetes mellitus, including four studies on hydrogen peroxide or chloroquine.
Most recombinant antiviral drugs have helped Chinese research, with nine Phase III trials of Remdesivir across several countries due to report in late April.
A consistent review of clinical developments for COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates has been made available and as of April 2020, several existing antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, Remdesivir, Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir/Ritonavir and Lopinavir/Ritonavir mixed with Interferon beta.
There was tentative evidence of efficacy with Remdesivir as of March 2020.
Improvements in disease status were observed in patients treated with remdesivir.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the United States, China and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat influenza, was studied in China in February 2020 with preliminary results.
But there have been calls for a review of the research.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, the Wuhan University Virology Institute recommends only one gram dose, and if you take two grams, you risk serious and potentially fatal complications.
On 28 March 2020, the Federal Agency for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an opening statement authorizing the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine-like drugs at the discretion of physicians in the treatment of patients with COVID-19.China's 7th Guideline also authorized the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir for the treatment of COVID-19.
Preliminary data suggest that high levels of ribavirin are necessary to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in clinical laboratories.
Nitazoxanide was proposed for further study after finding low inhibition of SARS-CoV-2.Other studies showed the release of a protein called serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) that is essential for SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells via ACE2 receptors.
Studies of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine for use with or without azithromycin are a major concern, as there is a medical association's defense that these treatments should be used without study.Oseltamivir does not prevent SARS-CoV-2 and has no role in the treatment of COVID-19.
This increase in cytokines may be a consequence of the late stages of COVID-19 severity.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine can inhibit the growth of cytokine cells.Tocilizumab has also been approved for clinical use, according to China's National Health Commission, after a small study was completed.
It is in phase 2 of a national non-randomized trial in Italy after showing positive results in critically ill patients.
Combined with serum fluorite blood tests to identify cytokine storms, it is meant to counteract such mutations, which are considered to be the cause of death in some affected individuals.
Interleukin-6 inhibitor was approved by the FDA based on post-case studies for the treatment of stress-induced steroid refractory cytokine syndrome, a variety of causes, in CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
To date, there is no randomized controlled trial evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transferring the hardened and collected antibodies produced by the immune system of a person who has recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them is being investigated as a method of immunization without vaccination.
This strategy was tested for SARS with uncertain results.
Viral immunity is a mechanism of action expected by therapy with inactive antibodies to facilitate immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as cytotoxin, cell-dependent antibodies and/or phacocytes.
For example, other forms of inactivated immune system therapy using generated monoclonal antibodies are in the developmental stages.
The serum production of recovered people whose blood comes from those who have recovered from the virus contains a specific antibody against the virus itself, which is being developed.
Coronavirus is a group of diseases that are closely related to the symptoms.
Li Wenliang, MD, Wuhan Central Hospital, who later became ill and died of COVID-19 after he spread awareness about the spread of the virus.
