Aristotelis, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and light.
Some of the most important are the states of matter (in most order): solids, liquids, gases and plasmas, as well as the physical processes that transform them and the new substances that form them.
Ligas are basically a mixture of two or more metals. They can be considered to be the most elementary element in the periodic table.
