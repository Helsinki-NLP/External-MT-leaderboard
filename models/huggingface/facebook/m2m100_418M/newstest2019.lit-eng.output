Ethics Guards: Liberal Alliance Board on the Law of Conduct of the Vilnius Department
"The decisions taken by the government are in accordance with the statutory", - after the commission meeting BNS its chief Vytautas Tamošiūnas.
“This decision was not something new.
The explanation as the commission had already been made in July, when the question was raised on Strength and Outdoor.
We then said that according to the Constitution, this is a matter of competence of the Board.
And if the board decides that any department can act as it wants - go with the committee and the board approves it, then the department can go, but if the board decides that there will be anywhere party lists, what the board has and has adopted, then it is the decision that all departments form party lists.
And if I do not agree with the board, then there is a possibility to suspend membership and go with the committee,” he added.
According to Tamoşun, the party’s board will now decide on further action.
On October 17th, the Parliamentary Liberal Alliance Board annulled the decision of the Vilnius City Department to participate in the municipal elections not with the party, but with the list of the newly held electoral committee.
According to the party board, the decision of the capital liberal to participate in the elections in the form of a public election committee violated the party's constitution, the rulings of the board.
By the 31st of October, the department of Vilnius had to cancel the wishes to participate in the municipal elections with the list of committees.
But the chapter did not.
The former head of the department, Aušrinė Armonaitė, has already withdrawn from the Liberal Alliance.
The mayor of Vilnius, former Chairman of the Liberal Union Remigiyus Shimašius, who promises to pursue another term of head of the capital, has already presented the team and ideas of the public election committee "Uz Vilni, on which we are proud!"
He also left the party.
The municipal council and mayor elections will be held next year.
In a village in northern India, residents carried a tiger with a tractor, which previously hit one man, officials said on Monday.
The forest surveillance officer Mahavir Kaudžlagis said that the tiger later on Sunday, when a man worked in the field, the neighbors surrounded the beast and, in an attempt to escape, carried it with a tractor.
The people say that this tiger about 10 days ago also attacked and scratched one young man.
The famous village is located in the Dudhva Tiger District in the Lakhympur Kher district, about 250 km south-east of the Utar Pradesh state capital, Laknau.
Hunting tigers in protected areas is prohibited.
Rameshas Pandey (Rameshas Pandey) said the case will be to the police in accordance with the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, in the district of Nighasan, Utar Pradesh, the neighbors hit another tiger; he suffered severe injuries.
The tiger is the national animal of India; according to the Wildlife Protection Act, the tiger is considered an extinctive species.
Last year’s government data show that at least one person died daily during the past three years in collisions with wild tigers or elephants.
People’s conflicts with tigers have gradually increased since the 1980s, when India launched the tigers protection program, under which the national parks were established by the disciplines, and the slaughter of big cats began to be considered a crime.
Though the methods of tiger calculation changed, the census would show that the then population of about 1,800 tiger increased to 2,226 individuals in 2014.
Dogs and cats must be tagged with microschemicals.
The Chairman of the Seymour Environmental Protection Committee, Kęstutis Mažeika, together with other Seymour members, registered amendments to the Animal Welfare and Protection Act, in which it is proposed that cats and dogs must be marked with submarine microschemicals.
“We propose that cats and dogs are mandatory to be marked with underground microschemicals, and their registration and labelling will be organized by the local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019, all dogs and cats will be labeled free of charge by state funds, and in 2020, cats will be labeled free of charge, so the population will not be concerned and the costs will be covered by the specially planned state funding," said Kęstutis Mažeika, Chairman of the Seim Environmental Protection Committee.
The amendments to the law aim to address the systemic need for labelling of pets.
It is expected that this will help to avoid problems caused by irresponsible pets, illegal reproducers or sellers.
It is forecastly estimated that, according to the expected average price for the supply of the microschems and services, which will reach around 5 euros, all pet owners will be compensated during the transitional period.
The total cost of all animal labelling can be up to 6 million euros.
The demand for these funds is planned to be distributed over three years and to reach 2 million euros each year.
It is expected that the funds for labelling programmes will be allocated through the Special Programme for the Environmental Protection of the Municipalities, whose revenue will increase significantly this year due to the increased tax and redistribution of natural resources.
The municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for the labelling of cats and dogs, but also for castration and other programs.
According to K. Mažeika, the mandatory labelling practice is common in almost all European Union countries, it allows to protect both the animals themselves (because the lost animals can easily be returned to the owners), and it saves the time of the pet cultivators themselves, where the search for the escaped and dismissed pet needs to spend a lot of time and funds.
In addition, EU legislation provides that travel is only possible with marked pets.
At the same time, the labelling requires responsible care of the animal throughout his lifetime.
Previous proposals were contraindicated because the relevant programmes were proposed to be funded by the population.
"The model presented now should avoid this criticism because animal protection is proposed to be funded by increased revenue in the environmental support program and the right to mark by granting not only veterinary doctors but also public, i.e. persons in animal care institutions who have attended special courses at the Veterinary Academy," the project authors say.
The draft law was registered by a group of members of the Seem that represent the various Seem factions - Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimant Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmund Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antan Vinkus and others.

"Women Lies Better" star actress B. Arsobaita is persecuted by liars
Probably it’s just a coincidence, but the charming brown actress Brigita Arsobaitė has already several times received roles related to lies.
First the series "Women Lies Better", then the show "Melagues" and finally the comedy "Melagues".
In this film, Brigita plays the square wife of the hero of the singer Kazlausko.
"I really liked filming in the 'Melagios' because I'm more a theatrical actress and I rarely appeared in the cinema.
A remarkable team of colleagues has promised a great result from the beginning.
This experience is very important and valuable to me.
But the most interesting thing that happened on the square was the dog Sunny!
I thought all my life that if I had a dog, he would be big and serious.
I have never admired those small, decorative "fif" quarters.
But during the filming Sunny so attached to me that sympathy became mutual and eventually I even ordered to buy it from the host, but failed," she smiled.
In the comic and intriguing peripeties of family members, a new Lithuanian comedy "Melagiai" has been introduced since the first minutes, produced by the Lithuanian film hits "Nepoken" and "Through us, boys..." producers Paul Virbick and producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimir Razarionov.
Your loved one just announced - she is waiting.
It would be a good news, but... your beloved is your brother’s wife!
But that’s not all yet.
Unfortunately, after the publication of the "good news" to everyone, parents suddenly declare - they are different!
After 50 years together...
And all this takes place just before the most beautiful holidays of the year - Christmas!
But the end will be even more surprising, because no one expected such atoms.
All heroes are not the same as they seemed at first glance.
In addition to B. Arsobaitės in the comedy "Melagiai" a good mood will be given to the viewers by four times movie stars: Giedrius Savickas, Songs Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedraitytė, Liubomir Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.
Comedy "Melagi" - in China since November 9th.
100 million euros of unpaid taxes for immigrants
The Seymour agreed on Tuesday to discuss the amendment of the Residential Declaration Act prepared by the "Citizens" leader Ramun Karbauski.
56 members voted for, 9 against and 25 resigned.
The debate will be held on December 6 or later after the Government’s conclusions.
According to Karbauski, these contributions are counted for people who have not declared their departure from Lithuania.
According to the parliament, in three years one person does not pay about 1,000 euros, and now there are about 100,000 such persons.
Social-Democrat Algirdas Sys regretted that in this way the Seim part of the people "will not comply with the obligations" - to declare the departure and then no taxes would be counted.
Conservative Antan Matulas, a member of the Health Affairs Committee, noted that the Lithuanians living abroad enjoy the fact that paying a small health insurance fee, they come to Lithuania for treatment - they are provided with the same services as those who pay this fee to the residents.
The amendments provide that those who leave Lithuania will be considered those who will pay social insurance contributions in the European Union, the European Economic Area or the Switzerland Confederation, and "Sodra" will be exempt from the payment of health insurance contributions in Lithuania.
"Sodra" chief Mindaugas Sinkevičius has previously said that such a step will facilitate both the lives of the migrants and the activities of "Sodra".
Video on the Internet reveals a serious problem
Nufilated as a mother's sheep falls in a straight snowed shell, and the little one keeps leaving, shining down, and again rigorously copying.
The video received a lot of reviews and comments.
The people admired the perseverance of the little sheep - repeatedly sliding down, he jumped again to his mother.
He does not succeed for the first time, but the boy does not even try to give up and ultimately achieves his goal.
The video really belongs to the attention, but it also reveals the human threat to animals.
Scientists argue that it is necessary to talk about the fact that the desire of people to know the wild nature can sometimes be harmful.
“It seems to me that the wolf drone was very scared.
Their movements show that they are in panic.
If the drone didn’t fly around, they’d probably have chosen a safer route or overcome it slowly or cautiously.
This is a great example of how drones should not be used," Ecologist Mark Ditmer told The Verge.
A while ago, Mr. Ditmer, along with his colleagues, studied how drones operate the wolves.
Animals have adapted the heart work measurements.
When the drone approached, some wolves were leaving to flee, others were not leaving anywhere, but their hearts began to beat more frequently from fear.
Scientists advise drones to film animals to use responsibly, do not fall too close, do not bring noise and do not fly where it is prohibited.
The President was told in a newspaper.
The court in Kiev on Tuesday invited the dismissed president, Viktor Janukovych, to attend the trial for his alleged state betrayal in an unusual way, the call was published in the state official newspaper.
In a court call, published in the government news newspaper "Uriadovoj kurjer", the former leader is invited to attend the criminal proceedings on 19 November, during which his final arguments could be heard.
The document indicates that Janukovych has the right to participate in the meeting via video.
On October 30th, the court of Kiev announced the conclusion of the debate in the case of Janukovych.
Janukovych's lawyer who works in Russia, Alexander Gorošinsky, was given the opportunity to register in the Foreign Lawyer Register until November 19, so that he could participate in a meeting where Janukovych is expected to see his last word by video.
The Kremlin-backed Janukovych was abducted and fled to Russia during the Maidan rebellion in February 2014, provoked by the President’s refusal to sign an association treaty with the European Union.
Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that the former Ukrainian leader was deported to Russia during a special operation organized by Moscow.
The struggle of that year was annexed by Russia to the Crimea Peninsula belonging to Ukraine, and shortly later in the east of the country there was a war between separatists supported by Kiev and Russia.
Since then, the struggles have killed about 10,000 people, despite numerous attempts by the international community to ensure long-term firearms.
The list of Conservatives will be brought to the City Council of Vilnius by Valdas Benkunsk
The candidate for the Conservatives for the year was approved by the former Minister of Economy, Parliamentary Deputy Dainius Kreivys.
Last week, during the conservative first elections, the members of the party ranked the list of candidates for the City Council of Vilnius.
As the party, the leader of the list of conservatives became the chairman of the meeting of the districts of Vilnius of the TS-LKD, V. Benkunsk.
In the first ten candidates were members of the Council of the Municipality of Vilnius, Paulé Kuzmickienė, Adam Bužinskas, Gediminas Švilpa, Audrius Skaistys, Rasa Baškienė, former member of the Seim, Liutaur Kazlavickas, President of the Youth Conservatives League, Mantas Benkunskas, Arūnas Valinskas and Goda Karazijaitė.

The Constitutional Court complains restrictions on cogenerative power
The Senate opposition, as promised, appealed to the Constitutional Court (KT) the ruling decision to adopt a law on the possibility of blocking the construction of waste burning power plants.
On Tuesday, the Seymen opposition group of the Federation of Fatherland-Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) announced that a group of members of the Seymen appealed to the KT, asking for the investigation of the compliance of the amendments to the Waste Treatment Act adopted by the governors with the Constitution.
“Parliamentari emphasize that the provisions of the law are aimed at questioning the projects of waste burning facilities that are already underway, by ordering the Government to set new restrictions (20 km distance from the residential area) until the entry into force of the law for the construction of waste burning power plants started in Vilnius and Kaune,” the statement said.
“Parliamentari notes that taking into account the way the law formulates the prohibition of building objects of state importance of waste management (i.e. the distance is determined and the concept of ‘living territory’ is defined), the conclusion is that this prohibition is disproportionately restricted or even denies the essence of the right itself to carry out agricultural activity related to waste burning for energy production, because the criteria are established to formulate in such a way that, by assessing the density of the population of Lithuania and the distribution in the country, building such objects would be practically impossible throughout the country,” he added.
The law is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
It has repeatedly stated that the legislation does not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurred before the entry into force of the newly adopted legislation.
In this case, the Government is empowered to apply the law back on a non-defined criterion.
The establishment of such legal regulation violates the constitutional principles of legal certainty, legal security, the protection of legitimate expectations, and thus the constitutional principle of the rule of law.”
It also notes that large financial investments have already been made in Vilnius and Kaunas cogenerative power plants.
The state would not only suffer a hundred million financial losses, massive losses and the people of Lithuania would increase the prices of heating, due to the increasing amount of waste removal in warehouses would increase environmental pollution.
The call was signed by members of the Seim TS-LKD, Liberal Alliance, Social Democratic Groups and the ruling Social Democratic Working Group Senior Deputy Algirdas Butkevičius.
A few weeks ago, the Seim was able to gather 71 votes in order to reject the President Dalia Grybauskaitė's veto to the amendments to the Waste Management Act, which provided the government's right to stop the construction of already started cogenerative power plants, and also set a "carantine" zone 20 km from the residential areas for such power plants to be built.
The repeated amendments to the law will enter into force from January 1, 2019 The governors already propose to refuse the 20 km limitation.
This proposal is planned to be discussed in the autumn session.
However, the government’s right to stop already launched projects is not planned.
The Court will consider the case in a row, not earlier than a year later.
Published Questioning LeBron James Statistics in Lakers Club
The start of LeBron James's career in the Los Angeles Lakers Club isn't what he himself, the organization and basketball fans expected.

With his seat on the ground, the Lakers earned 19 points more than the competitors.
Currently, Lakers is on the 13th place in the Western Conference, but a few victories can turn everything around with the high foot.

Greenpeace calls on China to create a favourable investment environment for EU
President Dalia Grybauskaitė calls on China to create a favourable investment environment for European Union (EU) countries’ investments, facilitating foreign import conditions.
During the opening of the trade and investment forum in Shanghai, Grybauskaitė said that seeing the signs of economic slowdown, the common objective of Europe and China should be "to unite efforts to stop the spread of protectionism in the world" by applying to the key causes of trade wars, "excess production and unfair competition".
"The European Union is critical for China's commitment to creating a more attractive, open environment for investment - this is important in negotiations on a trade agreement with China.
It is important to complete this trade agreement as soon as possible, ensuring that foreign feel awaited and safe here, as well as strengthening the protection of intellectual property," Grybauskaitė said.
According to her, the opening of China is important not only for Europe, but also for the country, as well as for global economic growth.
She emphasized that the transparency of investments should be "more than the interests of any business group."
"Clarity, the rule of law, the strict compliance with international treaties - this must be an essential element for the environment of new investment relations," Grybauskaitė emphasized.
“Corrupted capital flows should not be expected in any country in the world – not just here or in our countries,” she added.

Some officials are concerned that China’s investments in Lithuania may lead to unwanted political influence, while Beijing’s exclusive focus on Eastern Europe is disrupting the unity of the EU.

The cause of the Lion Air plane crash revealed: the victims' relatives are angry
The data in the black box of the crashed Indonesian airline Lion Air launcher indicates that at least four of its last flights occurred in the work of the speed meter, the researchers on Monday.
Chairman of the National Transportation Safety Committee (NTSK) Soerjanto Tjahyono said a similar rise occurred during the last four flights of the aircraft, including the decisive when the aircraft crashed in the Sea of Java on October 29 immediately after the rise from Jakarta.
All 189 people on the plane were killed.
Many media disadvantages during the previous Boeing 737 MAX 8 flight from Denpasar to the Indonesian capital.
"When we opened the black box - yes, in fact the technical problem was the speed of the air, in other words, the speed of the aircraft," Tjahyono said during a press conference.
"The Black Box data showed that in two flights before the flight Denpasar-Jakarta was the same problem," he added.
There are a lot of rumors on social networks.
Now we want to clarify that in the black box (the data remained) about four flights during which there were problems with the air speed meter," the head of the NTSK said.
During a meeting with the families of the deceased, Tjahyono said that the flight data recording facility’s information corresponds to the reports that the flight’s speed and height had changed irregularly after the last flight arrived.
The search teams have not yet found the second black box recording conversations in the pilot cabin.
Lion Air that a technical failure was detected during a flight from Bali to Jakarta and was corrected according to the manufacturer's recommendations.
One of the company’s founders, Rusdi Kirana, was not invited to talk to the transport minister, Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated the family members’ meeting with officials monitoring the search for the plane and the remains of the victims and the investigation of the disaster.
But he stood up and sinked his head when angry and passionate family members demanded that R. Kirana and his brother Kusnan, who founded the Lion Air in 1999, attend.
"Lion Air did not behave properly," said a man who was presented as the father of the passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who worked as a prosecutor on the island to which the plane flew.
“I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to draw attention,” he said.
“Lion Air has never contacted me since the beginning of the crisis.
We lost our child, but Lion Air didn’t show us any compassion.”
After this meeting, R. Kirana drove, avoiding questions from journalists.
Many families are waiting for the results of a long process of recognition of the dead.
Nearly 140 bodies have been transferred to police medical experts.
Only 14 victims have been identified.
Relatives raised the question why the two months ago launched launcher was allowed to fly, although a failure occurred during the October 28 flight from Bali to Jakarta, among other things, causing passengers fearful sudden crash of the plane down immediately after the rise.
Lion Air said that the failure was removed.
Is it true that the problem has been solved? - asked the son of one of the dead.
If not, the relevant technicians must be held liable.
The law is very clear, not they claimed that the plane was allowed to rise again.
These bad technicians must respond under the law so that aircraft crashes in Indonesia do not repeat.
S. Tjahyono said that the high amount of small slopes and the fact that the slopes spread in a relatively small area indicate that the slopes were likely to crash into the water by flushing at a very high speed.
“The plane was unified when it crashed into the sea.
He didn't fly in the air, and the aircraft's engines, when he touched the water, worked with large curves - that's what all the turbine's hints were shrinking," the official explained.
The Lion Air crash is the biggest aviation disaster in Indonesia since 1997 when a Garuda plane crashed near Medano, killing 234 people.
After the accident, the rescue man led: a minor was injured
On Monday night on the road Rats - Plungé, near Tilvikis crashed cars BMW and Mercedes-Benz.

The BMW driver was rescued by firefighters.
A Mercedes-Benz girl was killed in an accident.

President: No artificial facilities are needed for the referendum
After the parliament approved the proposal of the governors to reduce the referendum card for the first section of the Constitution, which is currently more protected, the president amended the veto, says her adviser Mindaugas Lingė.
More than half of the population voted for the Constitution, this is the requirement.
This and its change, especially the articles in its first section, should be not a minor majority.
It is not difficult to predict that the president will really veto," Dalia Grybauskaitė's domestic policy adviser told News Radio on Tuesday.
He emphasized that the first section of the Constitution defines the main matters of the state - language, flag, territory, capital, state sovereignty, and therefore, by reducing these articles to change the number of votes needed, according to M. Lingé, would create a "negative precedent" and "reverse the unmanaged risk".
“Presidents think there is no need for any artificial facilities, more need to prepare for the referendum itself, more need to dialogue with the people,” he said.
The House of Representatives will vote on Tuesday on the amendment to the referendum law.
It provides that a decision on the amendments to Sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution with higher protection shall be adopted if at least two-fifths of voting citizens are approved by a referendum.
Currently, more than half of all voting citizens can replace the articles of Sections 1 and 14 of the Constitution by a referendum.
There are approximately 2.5 million citizens in Lithuania who have the right to vote: half would have 1.25 million voters, two-fifth - a million voters.
The proposal came after the President’s veto was approved in September on the amendments previously passed by the Parliament, reducing the requirements for the number of votes for the change of citizenship, which defines Article 12 of the First Section of the Constitution.
The cartridge for the referendum is proposed to be reduced in the preparation for a referendum on double citizenship, it should take place on 12 May and 26 May of the next year, when the first and second round of the presidential election are scheduled.
Emigrants after the restoration of independence on March 11, 1990 at this time, with the exception of some exceptions, cannot have double citizenship.
The world’s Lithuanian community seeks double citizenship, but fears that the referendum will not take place under the existing conditions – enough people will not vote.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports are "broken", so they need to be renewed
Lithuanian airports and road infrastructure are beginning to broke, so it is necessary to renew it, said the Minister of Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, the renovation of the Vilnius airport is a minimum task that the state must carry out.
"The air transport infrastructure is already broken because it was planned for smaller passenger flows.
We are obliged to renew the airport of Vilnius - this does not even fall into remote planning, that is a minimum of what we have to do," Masiulis said on Tuesday at the Communications Conference held by the Democratic Development Fund and the State magazine.
According to the minister, the next decade will be extremely important, as important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of the Via Baltica, Rail Baltica, the construction of the outdoor port of Klaipeda, the renovation of the airports of Vilnius and Kauno, and the construction of a new airport.
“The next decade will be very important – we have to finish the construction of roads, rail integration, the construction of the outer port in Klaipėda, to arrange the airports, maybe to decide about the construction of a new airport.
We don’t have to sleep, we have to start projects that will take advantage of our potential in 10, 20 or 30 years,” the communication minister said.
Mr. Masiul repeated that the car maintenance has been spent too little in recent years.
“There are a lot of things that don’t improve because there’s not enough funds.
We hope to build new roads, but even the minimum maintenance, such as highways, is a lack of funds.
We have to determine the amount to be paid for road care if we want their condition to improve,” Masiul said.
He emphasized that Lithuanian transport sector services exports increased by 18.6 percent this year, and the largest export market became Germany, overcoming Russia.
Mr. Masiul has again criticized the European Commission’s proposal that EU countries will be obliged to periodically return the trailers to the country of registration.
“We have to try to make our exporters in Western Europe feel like at home.
I think the proposal for the drivers to constantly return home is absurd because emissions would be increased by empty trucks and fuel burning in Europe.
Most of this will succeed railways, as the costs will rise so much that part of transport will pass to railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our positions,” Mr. Masiul said.
According to the Ministry of Transportation, the transport sector is produced by 12.2%.
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of Lithuania.
It employs more than 118,000 employees and operates more than 7,500 companies.
Dispute with Hereditary
Last week, Mr. Masiulis in the Seoul Economic Committee announced that negotiations on the change of the cultural destination of the Vilnius Airport building had begun - this would allow the collapse of the old terminal and the construction of a new.
However, the temporary head of the Department of Cultural Heritage (KPD) Algimant Degutis called the discussions of Mr. Masiul a political pressure.
According to him, the building built in the sixth decade of the past century is a value, registered in 1993, and not politicians, but experts have to decide on its removal.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that the modern arrival terminal would contribute to the improvement of the image of Lithuania.
“To extract that old terminal from heritage would be a politically important step, so that it could be destroyed and built a new modern terminal of arrival, so that when Vilnius is separated, it can be felt in a modern country, rather than so interesting, truly unrepresenting our country as innovative,” Masiul said last week in Seime.
Mr. Masiul also said that Kaune is planned to build a completely new passenger terminal and connect the airport to Rail Baltica in cancer, building a subterranean station.
This transport hub is expected to operate in 2026, after the completion of Rail Baltica.
Last year the airport served about 3.7 million people, this year it is expected to reach 4.8 million passengers, and next year it is expected to reach 5 million.
The airport served a total of 1.2 million passengers last year.

Minister of Finance on the potential crisis: it is important not to talk about illnesses
“We always have to be prepared for the difficult times.
For the first time in the history of Lithuania, for the third time in a row, we are collecting reserves.
But the very important thing is not to talk about the illness," Shapoka said on Monday in a visit to Brussels.
ELTA reminds that on Monday and Tuesday, the Minister of Finance and Deputy Minister Miglia Tuskienė will attend the Eurogroup and the European Economic and Financial Council (ECOFIN) meetings in Brussels.
The ECOFIN meeting discusses issues related to the taxation of digital services.
This new tax aims to avoid fragmentation of the EU single market as some Member States have already introduced or intend to introduce a certain tax at national level.
In the short term, it is proposed to be agreed on how to tax the income received for the provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States until there is a global agreement.
The Eurogroup will review the budget projects presented to the European Commission (EC) in the euro area.
On 23 October, the European Commission rejected the Italian budget as incomplete with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact.
This is the first time the European Commission is taking advantage of this opportunity.
More information is requested for Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain.
The Euro Group will also discuss the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union: the possibilities of implementing the European deposit insurance system and the reforms of the European Stability Mechanism (ESM).
Lithuania supports the stronger role of ESM in financial support programmes, but it is believed that ESM’s functions need to be clearly defined in order to avoid duplication of ESM and other EU institutions’ functions.

Traditions and Practices of Lithuania
Recently, it is 120 years since the birth of the famous Lithuanian photographer and cultural photographer, ethnograph and landscapeist Balio Buračo (1897-1972) in Sidari, the province of Šiaulien, the former Government of Šiaulien.
Remembering the 100th anniversary of the state of Lithuania, we have a great opportunity to remember how the life-filled national resurrection called many of the people of Lithuania, including the brothers Buračus - Balí, Jon, Bronis - from the depths of the village, all the creative can engage in the cultivation, understanding and preservation of our cultural traditions.
Balys Buračas, who has travelled through his hometown for more than 50 years with a camera in his hands, has presented a broad and real picture of our country’s habits, traditions, folk art and material culture.
He sought to preserve the rapidly disappearance of the national culture and had a rare capacity to realize the survival value of his work.
In the photographs of Balio Buracho, the landscape of Lithuania, the pilacals, the daily and festive environments of our people in national costumes decorated the pages of Lithuanian newspapers and magazines.
This publication contains a significant part of the inheritance of Bali Burach, dedicated to the description of the national work habits and related traditions and, most importantly, their attractive iconography.
The material reveals not only the peculiarity and beauty of these traditions, but also the progress of our civilization over the past century, despite two world wars and severe occupation.
The book’s manuscript contains a great deal of the works of the intercourse of the Gemaitias, especially of the Kupischen, the Northern, the Telshias, as well as of the residents of the Upstaitias and the Dzukias, the descriptions of their celebrations and other traditions and habits written by Balio Buracho.
Of the remaining about 10,000 negative in the museums and archives, over 400 rare, mostly unpublished, photos have been selected according to the chosen texts.
They reflect the unique aspects of ethnic culture, characteristic of the Coupis, the Duchs, and other districts of the Highstitias and the Gemaitias.

The tragic fate of the couple: died just a few hours after marriage
In a helicopter crash in the southwest of Texas, a couple of previously married women died.
24-year-old William Troy's Byler and his co-wife Bailee Raye Ackerman Byler died on Sunday shortly after midnight a helicopter crashed into a mountain 16 km northwest of Juvalga and 129 km west of San Antonio, said local peace judge Steven Kennedy.
It is strange that the accident occurred at a distance of about 24 kilometers, just as much as the youth was a year.
The 76-year-old Gerald Douglas Lawrence was killed.
They studied at the Samo Houston State University in Hantsville, Texas.
They married on Saturday evening at the Biller family's hand near Juvald, and after the marriage party they went out with a family-owned helicopter.
The accident occurred when a helicopter crashed about 24 kilometers.
The young wives flew to the San Antonio International Airport, where they intended to sit on the plane and fly for the honeymoon, Kennedy said, without indicating the final destination of the couple's trip.
"This is a very rocky, uneven relief area, and that hill is about 120-150 meters high," Kennedy said.
G. D. Lawrence has been piloting the family’s aircraft for many years.
According to Kennedy, he piloted helicopters and served in Vietnam.
After autopsy, it should be clear what the pilot's physical condition was and whether it could not become the cause of the disaster.
The helicopter collapsed about 5-10 minutes after lifting.
His falls were seen by a wide radiation on the rocky mountain, and the corpus remained "dangerously hanged," the flight safety researcher Craig Hatch from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said on Monday at a press conference.
The researchers intend to take the slopes out and then thoroughly examine them, but the driver and truck will not be easy to reach that place, he said.
The cause of the disaster is not yet identified and the preliminary report of the NTSB should be published within two weeks.
Israeli Prime Minister calls the entry into force of new sanctions against Iran a "historic day"
"Today is a historic day," Netanyahu told members of his party's "Likud" parliament, his office.
“Today is the day when, under the leadership of President Donald Trump, the U.S. imposes strict sanctions on Iran, the strictest sanctions on Iran throughout the time that efforts to combat its aggression have begun,” the Israeli government said.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman said the new sanctions would reduce a "determined" blow to Israeli actions in the region.
The measures that Washington calls “the most severe sanctions of all time” have begun to be applied after Trump’s in May and controversial decision to withdraw from the world power agreement with Tehran on its nuclear program.
The sanctions are aimed at significantly reducing Iran’s oil exports, which have dropped by about a million barrels per day since May, and removing Tehran from international funding.
Israel has long opposed the agreement with Iran and says its scope and deadlines are too limited.
The Jewish state also says that the abolition of the sanctions allowed Iran to finance combat groups and its own military activities.
Israel is concerned about Iran’s actions in neighboring Syria and has promised not to allow it to be established there in a military view.
Other parties to the agreement with Iran – the UK, France, Germany, China and Russia – disagree with the US decision and says that the agreement, as planned, has so far prevented Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons.
The court reiterates the circumstances of the death of a young motorist.
After the death of a young motorcyclist in the Northern city of Vilnius, the court will hear the witness's testimony.
The district court of Vilnius decided on Tuesday that in order to clarify all the relevant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses will be interrogated in the next session on November 26.
The judgment has already been issued, but the Prosecutor’s Office does not agree with it.
On 22 August, the district court of the city of Vilnius, due to the death of a motorcycle driver's accident, justified the driver of the car, 79-year-old Eduard Osipov, announcing that the motorcycle driver was driving high speed in the city and committed a severe violation.
The District Prosecutor's Office of Vilnius asks the District Court to repeal the ruling of the District Court and claims that the biggest fault lies E. Osipov, and the conclusions of the District Court are unfounded.
The judgment was repealed by the lawyer of the motorcyclist’s family.
The accident occurred on August 11, 2015, at about 15 a.m., when E. Osipovo’s vehicle “Skoda Fabia” from the Lakun Street entered the Zirmun Street and met with a motorcycle on the main road.
Prosecutor's office accused the man of violating the road traffic rules and causing a traffic accident - a man who was driving on the main road on a motorcycle "Piaggo" died.
The police first that the driver of the motorcycle was killed, but later after the investigation, it was found that the vehicle was comparable to the motorcycle in terms of power.
The judge of the district court of Vilnius, Roland Bužinsk BNS, said that experts found that a motorcycle driver was driving at a speed of 89.2 kilometers per hour, although the permissible speed at that place was 50 kilometers per hour.
"The driver could not predict that the motorcycle would run at such a high speed," the judge said.
At that time, the automotive driver claimed he was driving only 5-6 kilometers per hour at a speed.
After seeing the obstacle, the motorcycle driver tried to stop and fell from the vehicle before colliding with Skoda Fabia.
The prosecutor believes that E. Osipov, who was driving from the side to the main road, had to give the road to the motorcyclist.
New Gazeta: Six Wagner Employers Killed in Syria
Among the dead are five soldiers of the Syrian military and six people belonging to the military company Wagner.
This is by a news source in Syria.
According to the source, one of the 5th Syrian Armed Forces Corps, with a number of Syrian volunteers and "military personnel" joined, was deployed in the territory.
"Novaja Gazeta" sent a request to the Russian Foreign Ministry with a request to provide information about the fate of the Russians.
The former Belgian king will have a paternity test.
This decision is part of the artist's Delphine Boel victory.
She has since 2013 sought to be recognized as the child of the former monarch.
A 50-year-old woman claims that her mother baronine Sybille de Selys Longchamps and Albert II had a short love novel decades ago.
The 84-year-old former king denies paternity.
According to the State RTBF, he may appeal to the Supreme Court against the DNA examination.
According to the Court of Appeal, Jacques Boel, the former husband of the Delphic Mother, is neither biologically nor legally the father of the artist.
For the relevant investigation, Delphine asked to be recognized as the daughter of "real" father Albert.
The CPC will distribute the money to the parties, but the social workers will not give anything.
The High Election Commission (HCR) intends to allocate a budgetary grant of 3 million euros to the major political parties this week.
The ruling Lithuanian Social Democratic Working Party (LSDDP), led by parliamentary deputy prime minister Gedimino Kirkilo, was established this spring and has not yet been scheduled to allocate funds from the budget.
However, they may be awarded in the near future by a separate decision of the CCP, if the legal environment regulating the allocation of grants to parties changes.
Laura Matjošaityte, Chairman of the CPC, said that "this committee meeting is scheduled for Thursday, in which it is planned to make a decision on the allocation of the budget of the semi-annual grants to the parties."
The decision on this issue must be taken by the CCC by 15 November.
It is expected to allocate €2,751 million to seven parties, six of which are parliamentary.
Opposition Patriot Union-Lithuanian Christians Democrats should receive more than 0.66 million Euros, the ruling State and Green Union - about 0.55 million Euros, the opposition Social Democratic Party - about 0.5 million Euros, the opposition Liberal Alliance - almost 0.4 million Euros, the Working Party without its group - about 0.23 million Euros, the ruling Party of Order and Justice - almost 0.22 million Euros, represented in Parliament, but neither the ruling nor the opposition unrepresented in the Polish election campaign - the Christian Family Alliance - about 0.18 million Euros.
In accordance with the current law, which will be governed by the CPC, by allocating budget money, subsidies are allocated to parties that meet the requirements laid down by the law and have received at least 3% of the votes in the last elections to the Seim, the municipalities and the European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation does not allow the LSDDP established only this spring to expect to get money from the budget.
The party has not participated in any of the elections.
It is true that the ruling coalition is trying to change the law so that social workers get at least a couple of hundred thousand euros in the coming year’s even three elections – the municipality, the president and the European Parliament.
The legislative amendment to the budget for this year was voted by President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The Senate has not yet decided on this veto, but representatives of the rulers Mr. Kirkil and the village-green leader Ramūnas Karbauskis are convinced that the parliamentarians will try to reject the president’s objections.
However, this will not be expected to be done before the meeting of the CCC on Thursday, and therefore, according to Mr. Matyošaitytes, "subsidies will be distributed in accordance with the existing legal order."
It is true that the CPC chief has not rejected that if the Seim rejects the presidential veto this or the next week and new amendments on the allocation of budgetary funds to the parties enter into force, the Commission may consider the decision on the allocation of additional grants to individual political forces, including the LSDDP.
“When we make the decision, we will take into account the entire existing legal environment, as we are the executive authority that has to implement the legislation,” she said.
If the Seim could refuse the veto and the new laws enter into force, the government would allocate the additional money to the parties, and the relevant amounts would be borrowed.
The subsidies already allocated to seven parties for such a decision would not be damaged.

Poroshenko: commander of activist Handziuk murder must be punished
"I want to say that no version - and more than 20 of them today - will be rejected.
Each of them will be thoroughly checked in accordance with the examination procedures.
As a president, I have no opportunity and I do not prefer to obtain information that could harm the course of the investigation.
But the authorities must ensure transparency, and the law enforcement authorities must work effectively.
Only so will it be possible to find out the truth and punish the evil," Poroshenko said at a meeting with the youth on Tuesday in Kiev.
He emphasized that he is most of all interested in K. Handziuk's murder to be clarified, and murderers, crime organizers and orderers "accept the necessary responsibility."
"After this case was re-qualified to murder, they are completely rightly and reasonably threatened to life imprisonment," the Ukrainian president said.
He called it right to the public’s demand to openly and indirectly investigate the case.
Poroshenko stressed that the speeches of law enforcement agencies in parliament should show that "the government is determined to bring criminals and murders to responsibility whatever they are."
He also said that political speculations on this topic will not help clarify the situation, but will further confuse everything.
“I urge all, both the authorities and the opposition forces, not to be wasted by unjustified arguments and, defend God, not to use this murder for public relations,” he said.
- On the contrary, now we have to unite and ensure that the research is effective, fair and transparent, fast - so that it raises public confidence.
There is no other way for us.”
“No one will be allowed to take advantage of this situation to destabilize the situation in the country,” he said.
K. Handziuk, who fought corruption in July, was attacked with acid in the city of Cherson.
She was a counselor of this southern Ukrainian city.
After the attack, the woman was hospitalized but died in the hospital on Sunday.
After the police and prosecutors did not explain the guilty of the attack, Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lucenka issued a resignation statement on Tuesday.
After her death, officials were accused by public activists of failing to properly conduct the investigation.
The activists also demanded the resignation of the Prosecutor General and the Minister of Internal Affairs.
"Today I submit my resignation statement," Lucenka told parliamentary members while reading his investigation report.
The Parliament still has to approve the prosecutor's resignation.
Lucenka accused the activists of pressing the investigation and leaving important information, making it difficult to identify the guilty of K. Handziuk’s murder.
Bill Gates introduced a toilet without water
Presenting a futuristic toilet, Bill Gates compared the transition from traditional such facilities to the waterproof with the eighth-century computer revolution.
Microsoft founder Bill Gates presented a high-tech toilet in the Beijing exhibition that doesn’t need water in the water pipes, Reuters.
The toilet without water works according to the principle of the separation of solid and liquid waste.
Both types of waste are processed into chemical fertilizers.
“The technology you see here is the biggest achievement in the sanitary sector in the past 200 years,” Bill Gates quoted Bloomberg as saying.
The technological toilet was created by the funds of a charity founded by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
Within seven years of work on an installation that could convert human waste into fertilizer or water, the fund spent $200 million on it.
In total, according to Bill Gates, about 20 toilet models were created.
Now the device is finished and can be sold.
However, in order to make such toilets produced massively, the Gates Foundation is ready to spend another 200 million dollars.
According to the Gates Foundation, 500,000 children under five years of age die every year due to poor health conditions in the world.
Combating poor sanitary problems, such as cholera and others, increases funds spent on health care, which already reaches 233 billion.
To better illustrate the sanitary situation that needs to be improved, Bill Gates in the toilet presentation in a glass with feces.
According to him, this is a good reminder of the fact that in a small example "there may be 200 trillion rotavirus cells, 200 thousand bacteria that cause infectious diseases, 100 thousand worms of parasite eggs."

Anxiety in France: People are worried about deaths
France’s health officials on Monday announced a permanent ban on widespread use of pesticides due to concerns about dozens of people who have recently been poisoned in the west of the country.
The health agency ANSES announced that the decision to ban all products with pesticide metam was taken after a new safety check started earlier this year, even before at least three waves of poisoning began in September in the department of Meno and Luar.
As a result of these cases, the government has already stopped the use of pesticide.
This soil disinfecting chemical should not be in contact with plants or farm workers.
To be effective, the product must be used in large amounts.
In France, it was used about 700 tons per year.
At least 70 people, among them a lot of farm workers, in the Anja region, where a lot of salad juice is grown, complained of eye and throat swelling, breathing problems.
"These episodes confirm the righteousness of our decision, but it didn't hurry," Francoise Weber, Deputy Director of ANSES, told West France on Monday.
Metam - one of the most commonly used pesticides in the U.S. and Europe - the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) considers it a "probable human cancerogen".
This pesticide, sold under such names as "Vapam" and "Sectagon", is allowed in Europe until 2022, when a new safety check is to be carried out.
"There was no other choice than to remove it from the market, regardless of whether there are alternatives to it," Weber told the newspaper.
"We understand the difficulties that will arise for salad juice farmers, in general farmers, but public health is more important," she said.
Farmers have already expressed dissatisfaction with the government's last month decision to stop the use of methane in the region, the economy of which is largely dependent on intense agriculture.
More than half of the 35,000 tons of salad juice consumed annually in Europe is grown near Nanto.
The next season will be "more less salad juices, ridicles and pairs," last month, after the government stopped the use of metam, Nanto Federation Chief Philippe Retiere (Philip Retiere) told AFP.

President Paul Biya has been appointed for seventh term in Cameroon after controversial elections
During the ceremony carried out by Parliament President Cavaye Yeguie Djibril, the 85-year-old Biya promised to preserve the West African state’s “friendship and unity.”
The oldest African president, who has ruled his country for 35 years, was declared the winner of the October 7 election, with 71% of the votes.
However, the elections were obscure by low voter activity, violence and suspicious fraud.
On the eve of the inauguration, 79 students and three school staff, including the director, were kidnapped in a presbyterian school in the northwestern region, where English-speaking separatists are conducting an armed campaign for independence.
Most of the 22 million inhabitants of Cameroon are French-speaking, and a fifth are English-speaking.
In 2016, in the northwest and neighboring southwest provinces, unhappy with the alleged discrimination in the fields of education, justice and economy, the demand for autonomy began.
In 2017, P. Biya refused to dismiss the radicals declared an independent state, the "Ambassy Republic", and lifted the weapons.
According to non-governmental organizations, at least 400 civilians and more than 175 security officers were killed during separatist attacks and government response operations this year.
More than 300,000 people have escaped from the violence: some through the border to Nigeria, but many are forced to live in half-bad forest.
In October, only 5 percent of voters voted in the northwestern region and 15 percent in the southwestern province.
In both parts of the country, Biya gathered two-thirds of the votes.
Conservative Elections: Errors Caused Uncertainty
“When there was a shortage of places, understand that the party organized everything with its resources.
Some municipalities allowed use of their premises, but there were not everywhere voting cabins because we can’t buy them ourselves.
“Thank you to those who have borrowed,” the politician said.
According to him, complaints have been received, but their content does not change substantially, and the infringements themselves are not of malicious nature.
“There were difficulties.
Not all of the people who participated in the elections were experienced - it was also a news for them.
Thus, from this uncertainty, not all actions matched our order.
Therefore, it was necessary to warn the CRK that the principles we described were followed.
These complaints don’t make any reason to doubt the results,” Anušauskas said.
According to the CPC chairman, there have been cases where the voting newsletters were not printed – after learning about this, the newsletters found in the voting without a stamp were cancelled.
Some towns were lacking, but according to Anušausko, complaints and violations are related to a few dozen newsletters.
"Well, since the difference is a few thousand, it is a substantial difference for the election results that does not do," Anušauskas explained.
It is estimated that the participation of the party members in the elections reached 55%, while the participation of non-party voters reached 69%.
Both candidates had 400 observers and 600 people worked in the committees.
The results announced on Sunday also don't change - for the winner Ingrid Shimonytha voted 79 percent of voters (16418 votes), while for Vygaud Ushack - 21 percent (4441 votes).
On the 17th of November, the Council of the TS-LKD will officially support the candidacy of Shimonytes in the presidential election in May of next year.
Trump says he won’t meet with Putin in Paris
White House National Security Adviser John Bolton said earlier that Trump will meet with Putin in Paris, where this week the 100th anniversary of the end of the First World War will be held.
But on the last meeting before the US Congress' midterm elections, Trump said he was uncertain to journalists whether it would be a good opportunity to meet with the Russian president.
“I’m not sure we’ll meet in Paris.
Probably not,” said the U.S. President.
However, the White House leader added that he will meet during the G20 summit and "probably will meet many times" after that.
Trump continues to try to "recharge" relations with Moscow, despite suspicions that Russia is interfering in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.
Sturgeon calls for the cancellation of the decision
Former Director General of the Santaras Clinics of the University of Vilnius, Kęstutis Strupas, asks for the cancellation of the decision of the Supreme Service Ethics Commission (VTEK) - it recognizes that the transactions have not been declared in time and thus violated the law.
K. Strupo's complaint was examined by the district administrative court of Vilnius on Tuesday.
The decision will be announced on November 26.
The applicant asks for the cancellation of the VTEK judgment of May 23, BNS the court representative Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduonė.

In May, VTEK announced that the then dismissed Director-General of Santaras Clinics, K. Strup, and the head of the ambulatory rehabilitation department of the Republican University Hospital of Vilnius, Silvia Strupienė, violated the provisions of the law regulating the declaration of private interests.
The investigation found that four transactions were declared in the absence of the scheduled deadlines: the loan taken from the bank with the spouse in 2010, the acquisition of securities from the bank in 2017, the gift given to the daughter in 2017 and the loan granted and not returned to the natural person in 1996 together with the spouse.
S. Strupienė also declared these transactions by passing the deadlines.
Persons who have violated the law on the harmonisation of public and private interests in the public service cannot be encouraged for a year.
The law requires the declaration of not only the personal data, but also the data of the spouse.
The investigation was carried out on the basis of Info TV television information.
It is clear whether K. Strup and his spouse, the head of the ambulatory rehabilitation department of the Republican University Hospital of Vilnius, S. Strupienė have properly and timely declared their transactions.
According to Info TV, last year Strup gave his daughter a real estate worth 125 thousand euros.
However, the former head of the Santara clinics and his wife did not indicate the above data in their declarations of interest.
The law enforcement K. Strup, along with at least ten other persons, has expressed suspicions of corruption in the investigation - according to law enforcement, for winning public computers, software purchases in clinics from companies demanded unlawful financial remuneration, he is masked as a support.
In this way, Strup is suspected to have served at least five times in Santara clinics during public procurement in the field of information technology.
Strup himself denies his guilt.
Professor K. Strup, suspected of corruption, was released from the post of director of Santara clinics in September.
According to the decision of the Ministry of Health and the University of Vilnius, the working relationship with K. Strupų will be terminated on his own request.
He has been in charge of the hospital since November 10.

Schools want to teach differently: promises fewer tests, more practice
Such changes are planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which on Monday presented them at the forum "Change of Education Content: Foreign Experience for Solutions in Lithuania" in Vilnius.
Education and Science Minister Jurgita Petrauskienė said that over 30 million euros have been invested in the updating of educational content over the last ten years, but the results are not seen.
"According to the results of the International Student Achievement Survey PISA, students' achievements are below the average in the OECD countries," said Education and Science Minister Jurgita Petrauskienė.
Phil Lambert, an OECD expert, said that Lithuania is too focused on the provision of knowledge rather than on the practical application of knowledge.

For four years, it was planned to allocate €7.8 million, with the first €1.3 million procurement announced in early October to search for educational programmes.
After experts criticized this procurement, it was suspended, the Minister of Education and Science J.Petrauskienė dismissed the Director of the Education Expansion Center Giedri Vaidel.
Lithuania: Exercises to React to Extreme Floods
On Monday in Lithuania, a ten-day training will begin to improve the responses of the institutions to the extreme flood.
According to the Department of Fire Protection and Rescue (PAGD), the training will check how state authorities are prepared to work in the country after announcing a state-level emergency situation, such as flood: to eliminate its consequences, to coordinate the search, rescue and emergency displacement of people from affected territories, to organize their supply of drinking water, food, to provide the necessary energy supply and to take care of other measures to protect the population.

On November 5-13 the preparatory stage of the exercises will take place, during which the municipalities, which have received information from the PAGD Hydrometeorological Service about the continuing floods and the beginning of the flood, will make decisions on the management of the emergency situation.
The active phase of exercise is scheduled for the 14-15 days of November.
During this period, the State Emergency Operations Centre will operate in the department, and in the state and municipal authorities, the institutions will operate in the Emergency Operations Centre.

The exercises will also demonstrate the common capacity of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia’s firefighters to pump a huge amount of water from depleted territories.

Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lucenka resigns
Ukrainian Prosecutor General Yuri Lucenka on Tuesday announced his resignation due to the resonance caused by the death of acid-covered anti-corruption fighter Katerina Gandziuk, Ukrainian news agency Unian.net said.
Under the law of Ukraine, the resignation request must be submitted by the general prosecutor to the president of the country, and this must be submitted to the Supreme Council to be approved by a majority of votes.
On Tuesday, Prosecutor General J. Lucenko presented the course and results of the law enforcement investigation on Gandziuk's murder order at the Supreme Council.
In a speech to the parliaments, he described the investigation as effective, but expressed anger that Gandziuk's death is exploited for public relations with politicians.
Gandziuk was an Ukrainian activist, an anti-corruption activist, who spoke publicly about police corruption in her native southern Ukrainian city of Cherson.
On 31 July, an unknown attacker K. Gandziuk sparked acid in his face.
On November 4, she died in a hospital due to injuries.
Protesters at the Ukrainian Ministry of Internal Affairs are asking for an answer who killed Gandziuk, AFP/Scanpix reports.
According to Lucenko, the law enforcement investigation identifies 12 persons potentially related to Gandziuk's murder order.
However, one of the most likely versions of the investigation was overwhelmed to the media, which threatens the success of the investigation.
According to the Prosecutor General, due to the information leakage, the suspects received them essential knowledge.
Lucenko added personally acquainted Gandziuk and is angry that some politicians use her blood for public relations.
"In order for no one to have any reason to say that someone is stuck holding the power, I want to declare that I am giving a statement to resign.
Today I will submit it to the President of Ukraine and you will have to discuss this issue in parliament," said Lucenko, citing the newspaper "Obozrevatel".
It is written that Lucenko added that "there is no possibility to allow the two-municipality in the country when the law enforcement system is broken without any evidence, even for the offences that have been revealed."
Lucenko is considered a close companion to President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed Prosecutor General on 12 May 2016 after long attempts to remove his predecessor, Viktor Shokin, suspected of corruption by top officials and politicians.
Energy Minister J. Vaičiūnas met with representatives of Orlen Lithuania
As the energy minister's adviser Aurelia Vernickaitė told Elta, the meeting will discuss the achievement of the renewable energy targets in the transport sector by 2020 and after 2020.
According to the European Commission (EC), transport is the only sector that currently does not reach the trajectory set out in the national renewable energy action plans at EU level – the renewable energy share in 2015 was 6%.
According to the EC, progress towards the obligatory 10 percent target in the transport sector is quite slow due to a variety of difficulties, including fairly high greenhouse gas reduction costs and unclear regulations.
Renewable energy in this sector is primarily derived from biodiesel (88%) and electricity has a lower role at this stage.

A. Shirinskienė referred to in the project “the possible representation of the interests of the pension funds in the legislative process or by appealing to the Constitutional Court or attempts to influence the decision-making processes of such significant independent institutions, such as the General Service Ethics Commission.”
The prosecution to the Constitutional Court on retirement was initiated by the opposition conservatives.
The ruling "Citizens" found that the Conservatives in their appeal largely based on the arguments of the lawyers of private pension funds.
Under the influence of the Supreme Service Ethics Commission (VTEK), the "Walts" leaders blame the former companion Povil Urbši.
According to them, the former Chairman of the Seim State Governance and Municipalities Committee could order members of the VTEK to dismiss the former Chairman of the Prevention Division of the Commission, Mindaugas Siauri.
At the end of September, the Parliament formed a commission to explain the potential illegal influence of stakeholders or their groups, the impact on the course of elections, the formation of coalitions, the work of parliamentary groups, individual politicians, the activities and financing of parties and public movements, the legislative processes, the selection and appointment of members of state-owned companies, the leaders of public bodies, the management or supervisory bodies.

The members are also appointed by two social workers, one "regulator", a liberal and a representative of the Lithuanian polish election action-Christian families union.
Conservatives and Social Democrats refused to participate in the commission's work.
The new investigation was initiated by the president of the ruling Lithuanian countryside and green union Ramūnas Karbauskis.
According to him, the National Security and Defence Committee (NSGK) investigation conducted in the previous session has shown that the investigation needs to be continued.

Moreover, last weekend it turned out that a few weeks ago in Warsaw meeting of representatives of European intelligence organizations, Maassen criticized Merkel’s “naive” immigration policy.
German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, who has long defended the head of intelligence, said on a press conference on Monday that Mr. Maassen's latest comments were unacceptable and "personally disappointed."
Seehofer himself, who was under pressure both for this dispute and for his party's poor appearance in the Bavarian local government elections, asked President Frank-Walter Steinmeier to release H. G. Maassen into reserve.

Close Girls Break Stereotypes About Wedding Dresses
Close a girl with a white pudding wedding dress - a mission (not) possible?
Can the white hole that flows towards the altar be greater than the size of S or M and still look attractive?
Plus size reality show "Diddy (r) evolution" participants already today will prove that the beauty and elegance of the bride really doesn't depend on the woman's pounds.
But that's not all - for one of the project girls this evening leaves tears of happiness - her boyfriend will appear on the filming square.
"There are also those who think that bigger girls don't get the guy's attention or eyes.
It's just a myth - my guy himself is an athlete, but he likes me what I am, from me he doesn't require any standard-friendly figure," - before the show with a wedding dress will speak the show participant Aurika.
Wedding dress is not easy, in every sense, clothing is a complex structure, it has a lot of material, dress hard, uncomfortable for movement.
Also, some women think that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bigger and therefore less self-confidence.
I can calm that a properly selected dress model will definitely solve this "problem", - explained one of the show committee members, fashion designer Robert Kalinkin.
The fate of the girls in the project is decided by R. Kalinkin together with the entire commission – plus the size of the fashion house opened by Erika Vitulskiene, photographer and social network star Nagliu Bierancu and TV producer Laura Pukšte.
“When we decide which girl has to say goodbye to the show, there is a lot of crackdown among the committee members – because we all represent different spheres and differently imagine the winner of the show.
The task of demonstrating wedding dresses was even more complicated and that - now I can already reveal - that two newborns appeared, which wasn't worse than the grandchildren.
This was a special evening in every sense,” says R. Kalinkin.
Newspapers - 23 years of scandalous behavior in one summer reality show celebrated Ieva and 31 years of exceptional beauty of two children's mother Doyle - like other girls participated in the "Doyle (r) Evolution" selection and went into the top twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first very open photo session of girls on the streets of Vilnius they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls returned to the show to the LNK viewers, voting for their favourites on the TV portal.
The international recognition of the beauty reality show in Lithuania takes place for the second week - here plus size girls compete for the first in the country plus size star name.
For now, only eight of them are left - and they all know that the winner will be only one.
The intriguing and unpredictable reality show "Digi (r) evolution" week begins this Monday evening at 20.30 pm in LNK.
Actor Elba elected the world's most sexy man
The American magazine People has announced the world’s most sexy man this year.
He became the 46-year-old British actor Idris Elba.
While the man claims that this message was unexpected, telling about the new title, he didn’t face the smell.
I thought, “It can’t be!
seriously?”
Then I looked at myself in the mirror and thought - yes, today I appeared sexually, - laughing sharing the actor.
Speaking openly, Idris mentioned that this title was a very pleasant feeling that struck his ego.
The British star claims that he has often received cheating words and turmoil, which made his childhood unleashed because, as he says, he was "very high and unrighteous."
The young actor was unbelievable to his fellow age and became an object of trouble because of his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
“I just grew my frogs and my muscles, and I became the best boy in my city area,” Idris smiled.
When a man loses to be a greatOse on the screens, Elba works as a discourse at the parties held in Spain, and in the especially shocking Ibiza.

Governors will no longer require a distance of 20 km to build waste burning power plants
We are building a cogenerative power plant near the Gariun market.
The governors are no longer able to maintain a distance of 20 kilometers from the settlements when building waste burning power plants.
The head of the Environmental Protection Committee "state" Kustut Mažeika on Monday registered a amendment to the Waste Treatment Act, which rejects such a requirement.
According to Mr. Mažeika, the “Walts” group, which has previously supported the provision on a distance of 20 km, promises to support the amendment due to its refusal.
The amendment of Mr. Mažeika provides that from January 2019 the waste burning power plants could be built with the environmental and public health requirements set by the law.
He acknowledges that the amendment has raised the president's doubt about such a ban.
"Given the definition of the residential area, it is obvious that such places where the above objects could be built would be almost impossible to find," the committee chairman said.
The ruling majority in October opposed the President's veto amendments to strengthen the construction of waste combustion power plants.
In addition to the insurance of waste combustion power plants to build more than 20 km from the settlements, the amendments provided permission to the Government to make decisions on the future of the two already built power plants, taking into account the public health interests.
The latter clause does not propose to be adjusted.
In Vilnius, the waste and biofuel power plant is built by the energy group “Lietuvos energija” and Kaune – together with the Finnish energy group “Fortum” company “Fortum Heat Lietuva”.
The latter is already burning waste.
It is about possible compromise in Brexit negotiations.
The leaders of Britain and Ireland on Monday discussed a possible compromise to address the difficult issue of Northern Ireland that strikes Brexit negotiations, Dublin.
In a telephone speech, British Prime Minister Theresa May proposed a possibility to review the so-called sanctions agreement mechanism, which would allow for an open border between the United Kingdom's Northern Ireland province and the European Union's Republic of Ireland.
Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar promised to consider the proposal, but rejected any possibility for Britain to unilaterally withdraw from the agreement, the Irish government said in a statement.
In the conversation, May "disclosed the possibility of reviewing the mechanism of sanctions," he said.
"Varadkar has made it clear that he is open to the review of new proposals, provided that the result of such a review will not involve a unilateral decision to terminate the application of the sanctions," the government said in a statement.
Brexit negotiators don’t find an acceptable solution to avoid checks at the UK-Irish land border when Britain leaves the unified market and customs union fight next year.
The two sides agree on "protective measures" to keep the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland open until a broader trade agreement is signed to ensure that no additional customs inspections at the border are carried out.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to comply with EU customs rules, but London wants them to be temporarily applied to the United Kingdom as a whole.
The Daily Telegraph on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab seeks to allow Britain to withdraw unilaterally from the sanctions agreement in three months.
However, Varadkar told journalists in Dublin that his government "can't support it."
“Three-month or limited-term sanctions are not worth the paper on which they will be written,” he said.
Earlier, London and Brussels did not confirm the information about the breakthrough in Brexit negotiations after a week-end announcement in Britain that the deal was hand-to-hand reached.

European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schin also told journalists, “We’re not there yet.”
Nobel Prize winners call for access to reliable information
A group of prominent thinkers, including Nobel Prize winners, on Monday announced a statement calling for the right to access reliable information in the internet era.
Among the 25 people who signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy are economists Amartya Sen (Amartya Sen) and Joseph Stiglitz (Joseph Stiglitz), Nobel Peace Prize winner Iranian lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi (Shirin Ebadi), and Nobel Literature Prize winner writer Mario Vargas Llosa (Mario Vargas Liosa).
“We encourage goodwill leaders on all continents to take action to strengthen democratic models and open public debates through which citizens can make decisions based on facts,” the group said in a statement.
They argue that the "global space of information and communication" is a common good that "must be preserved in order to strengthen freedom of expression and opinion."
“People have a fundamental right to access information that is freely collected, processed and distributed, based on commitment to the truth, approaches to the principles of pluralism and rational methods of determining facts,” the authors of the statement added.
The document asks for help from world leaders, including U.S. President Donald Trump, who often criticizes "fake news" but is regularly accused of distorting facts.
World leaders should express their position on this issue when they meet at the Peace Forum in Paris on November 11-13.
This declaration was prepared within two months under the leadership of Sh. Ebadi and Christophe Deloire (Christophe Deluar), the head of the media freedom and journalist rights organization Reporters Without Borders (RSF) based in Paris.
Other signatories include former Senegal President Abdou Diouf (Abdu Diouf), Chinese lawyer and human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama (Frensis Fukujama).
Parliament approves greater penalties for harmful products
The Parliament has approved amendments to the Product Safety Act, which provides for the increase of penalties for product safety violations.
The amendments were approved unanimously in the meeting.
As Senate Health Affairs Committee member Antanas Vinkus said, when it comes to the new project, it is grateful that the objectives set forth are related to better protection of consumers.
Furthermore, its provisions are adapted to the requirements of a decision of the European Parliament and of the Council.
"My head, the proposed bill is more perfectly and more specificly distributed to all operators involved in the supply and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
As practice shows, the current penalty system does not always prevent further infringements, as entities paying fines continue to repeat infringements,” Vinkus said.
The project was prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture, and after the Government’s approval, the Seim Economic Committee supplemented it with its proposals.
The amendments aim to increase penalties for infringements, strengthen the protection of consumer rights, give more powers to market supervisory authorities and create a clear system for supervision of product safety requirements and compliance.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the manufacturers are not currently obliged to properly label the product and thus ensure its traceability.
Furthermore, according to the Ministry, market surveillance authorities under the conduct of state product safety controls are not granted the right to enter the territory of manufacturers and suppliers, buildings, premises, to carry out inspections, which makes the work of the authorities difficult.
According to the Ministry’s assessment, the six-month deadline for penalty and warnings is too short to identify the infringement, to conduct an investigation and to impose a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the penalties set are not sufficiently effective.
Companies often repeatedly violate the requirements of the law - only in 2017 this was done by 14 companies.
The Ministry of Agriculture has proposed to establish a obligation for manufacturers to mark the product properly and thus ensure its traceability so that market supervisory authorities can make it easier to clarify suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed to grant the market supervisory authorities the right, by conducting state product safety controls, to enter the entities that produce, supplies products to the market, territory, buildings, premises, to carry out inspections.
Penalties for violations of the law will be increased.
The manufacturer, importer or authorized representative placing hazardous products on the market, and the distributor, the service provider or the service provider placing hazardous services on the market, would be charged with a fine of €150 to €2,500 (now €144 to €1,448).
If the State Service for the Protection of the Rights of the Consumers or any other market supervisory authority decides to prohibit the placement and supply of hazardous products or the provision of hazardous services, a fine of EUR 1 000 to EUR 5 000 (now 868 to EUR 4 344) would be imposed.
In the absence of the requirement to remove dangerous products from the market, recover them from consumers and destroy them, a fine of €2500 to €6,500 (now from €1448 to €5792) would be imposed.
If dangerous products have caused harm to the health of the consumer, a fine of €2,500 to €15,000 (now €1448 to €11584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused the death of a consumer, a fine of €6,500 to €25,000 (now €5,792 to €23,169) would be imposed.
According to the Ministry, in Poland and Austria for the violation of the product safety legislation, a fine of up to 25 thousand euros (the minimum amount of the fine is not established), in Belgium, a fine from 26 euros to 600 thousand euros, in Romania, a fine from 155 euros to 666 euros, in Bulgaria, a fine from 125 euros to 7,500 euros.
10-year-old kidnapped: a family member was raped
The incident in Colombia has affected millions of people.
A 10-year-old girl raped her older brother and gave birth to a healthy boy.
The baby sees the world thanks to the Caesar's cutting, but both the girl and her baby feel good.
They were monitored by doctors for a long time.
It has to take a little time until the young mother and the child are going to go home.
“With the information I received from police officers, the young woman became pregnant after she was sexually exploited by a family member – a brother,” the director of the hospital where the birth was accepted told a foreign television.
Police are investigating the case of rape and violence against children.
Norwegian armed battalion participated in NATO exercises in the most remote and distant areas
Soldiers from the Norwegian Armed Forces participated in a series of complex exercises in the mountains located north of the country’s capital, Oslo.
This is part of NATO's "Triple Joint 2018" exercises - the largest NATO exercises since the end of the Cold War.
Most soldiers from the second battalion of the Norwegian military after the 11th September terrorist attacks spent a lot of time away from their homes, in places such as Afghanistan - that is, in hot areas.
But most of them are skilled in waring in the Arctic conditions, and these skills are very helpful now that NATO changes its focus.
In recent days, in the mountains east of Tinset, often in the most remote and terrifying areas, soldiers participated in inscenated battles against real British soldiers.
Soldiers have the skills to survive in this cold wild nature, but in a terrible climate they have to put on their shoulders to a much greater weight - one cupweight weighs about 50 kg.
The soldiers in the command said that their skills, how to survive and fight in such conditions, they share with other NATO soldiers.
According to the soldiers, these exercises, which, like none of them, are very similar to real warfare, will teach them to be prepared if there is a serious threat.

“I want to focus on business.
I am a shareholder of several companies, and I also have ideas for new projects.
And most importantly, I will be pleased with the opportunity to spend more time on the family,” BNS said P. Mačiulis.
He also said he did not plan to participate in the upcoming municipal elections.
Mačiul has not yet had the opportunity to talk to V. Ušacko after this Sunday defeated the first elections of the Federation of Fatherland-Lithuanian Christian Democratic Union to Ingrid Šimonytei.
“If openly, we’re not yet working with him and the team to discuss the results in detail and talk about future plans.
It is obvious that with the withdrawal of Vygaud from the further election struggle this phase of my life is over,” Mačiul said.
He said he did not regret the decision to leave the Kaunas policy for the support of Ushak, only regret that "Lithuania lost the unique opportunity to have a real leader in the context of international relations."
P. Mačiulis worked shortly as deputy mayor in Kaunas in 2011, and later returned to these positions after the successful "United Beauty" elections in 2015.
He is a shareholder of the private school "Erudito Liceus" and several other companies.
Workers in the castle: what do they do here?
The gentlemen, who saw the workers fleeing in Kaunas Castle, said that the work of rebuilding of the remaining tower was finally ongoing.
On the portal kauno.diena.lt, the director of the Kaunas City Museum, Gabrielius Sužiedėlis, said that the work of changing the protective roof cover of the southwestern tower with a fragment of the defence wall is being carried out here.
According to the spokesman, the roofs will be scattered.
“The emergency shadow threatened the surroundings – people could collapse and hurt – so it was necessary to be replaced.
The roofs were no longer resistant to moisture, so the inheritance was damaged," the director of the museum explained.
Will these roofs be similar to those that were a few centuries ago?
"All works are combined with heritage and other institutions," - G. Injury added seeking that the result is as authentic as possible, but at the same time important and practical side - the roof values must be protected from moisture.
In the work with heritage, a universal solution is chosen.
Before that, the castle elements of Kaunas were covered in the Soviet years, so they had no longer historical values," said the director of the Kaunas City Museum.
The contract was signed on October 2.
It is planned that the work will not take more than three months from the signing of the contract.
“It is expected to be completed by the end of November,” the museum’s director said.
According to him, the value of the work is approximately 24 thousand euros.
This amount, according to the spokesman, was provided in this year’s budget.
The work is carried out by the state company.
It is written, according to the investigations carried out, that the castle could appear earlier.

The Centre for Eastern European Studies will collaborate with two major U.S. "brain centers"
According to Lino Kojalos, the head of the RESC, who is located in Vilnius and has been working for thirteen years, the confusion will allow the U.S. to implement the projects and will make Lithuania’s voice more heard on the other side of the Atlantic.
“We have been working in this direction for several months.
I am pleased that the two major institutions see us as partners and look for opportunities for joint activities.
I have no doubt that the niche activities will occur, as NATO, security, dezinformation, and the development of the Eastern Partnership countries are also priority themes we analyze,” Kojala said.
The agreements indicate that the RESC and the U.S. authorities will work together in preparing applications for international projects, exchanging expertise and knowledge, and preparing expert visits.
This should be beneficial for Lithuanian analysts, as both partners have a great international reputation.
FPRI has been operating since 1955 and unites almost a hundred top-level analysts.
In the latest ranking of the University of Pennsylvania’s global analytical centers, FPRI ranked seventh in its category.
At the time, the CEPA, whose analysts have been repeatedly invited to consult and work at the top U.S. political institutions, is ranked ten in the same ranking in its category.
“This will give more opportunities for Lithuanian analysts working in various institutions to enter the U.S. information space and will encourage us to raise the quality cartel up,” Kojala added.
One of the first practical steps should be the partners’ assistance in the dissemination of the soon appearance of the RESC analytical edition “Lithuanian Foreign Policy Review” among U.S. decision makers and in the public space.
The Centre for Eastern European Studies operates on the basis of implemented projects and does not maintain targeted grants.
The RESC partners with which joint initiatives are implemented include the European Commission, NATO, USAID, various international funds, etc.
