A doctor who worked at Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania will be charged with premeditated murder after her mother was found dead in the trunk of her car Wednesday, Ohio authorities say.
Dr. Malar Balasubramanian, 29, was found in Blue Ash, Ohio, a suburb about 15 miles north of Cincinnati, lying on the side of the road, wearing a t-shirt and underwear, after apparently ingesting several drugs.
He directed the agents to his black Oldsmobile Intrigue model car, which was 500 feet away.
There, they found the body of 53-year-old Saroja Balasubramanian, covered in blood-stained sheets.
Police said the body appeared to have been there for about a day.

The negotiators tried to solve the problem, but the demands made by the detainees were unclear.

Shortly thereafter, troops equipped with riot gear entered the courtyard and cornered the inmates using tear gas.
Fire crews managed to extinguish the fire around 23:35.

All the entrances to the caves, which have been called the Seven Sisters, have a diameter of between 100 and 250 meters (328-820 feet).
Infrared imaging shows that the temperature differences between night and day indicate the likelihood that these are caves.
They are colder than the surrounding surface during the day and warmer at night.
Their thermal behavior is not as stable as that of large caves on Earth, which generally maintain a constant temperature, but it is compatible with the hypothesis that they would represent deep holes in the ground, said Glen Cushind of the Astrogeological Team of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.

Chambers sued God for spreading death, destruction and terrorization of millions upon millions of Earth's inhabitants.
Chambers, who is agnostic, says his trial is frivolous and that anyone can sue anyone.
The story, presented in the French opera by Camille Saint-Saens, is of an artistwhose life is dominated by his love for drugs and Japan.
As a result, performers smoke cannabis cigarettes on stage, and the theatre itself encourages the audience to join.
Former Speaker of the House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich, Texas Governor, Rick Perry, and Congressman Michele Bachmann finished in fourth, fifth, and sixth places, respectively.

Perry said he would return to Texas to assess the outcome of the meeting tonight in order to determine if there was a path open to me in this race, but he later stated that he would remain in the race and run on January 21 in the South Carolina primary.
Bachmann, who won the Ames unofficial poll in August, decided to end his campaign.
The photographer was transported to Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center, where he later died.
He is believed to have been in his 20s. In a statement, Bieber said that[t]he fact that I was not present or directly involved in this tragic accident, my thoughts and prayers are with the victim's family.
TMZ Entertainment News website reports that the photographer stopped his vehicle across Sepulveda Boulevard and tried to capture images with police before crossing the street and continuing, prompting the California Highway Patrol police officer who was directing traffic to order him twice to turn over.

With only 18 medals awarded each day, a number of countries failed to reach the podium.

The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has given us is to provide us with much easier and faster transportation.
He brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.

Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging companion cats) that eat far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of a niche; each feline has its own role to play, so it's not in competition with others.
The lion is the most social of cats, living in large groups called herds.
Family is made up of one to three adult male relatives, together with up to thirty female and chicks.
Females are usually related to one another, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
The lion family behaves very similarly to the wolf herds or dogs, animals with surprising behaviour similar to lions (but not other large cats), and also very lethal to their prey.
Complete athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, make long jumps, and shoot with a force five times that of a strong man.
Tigers fall into the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars.
The tiger's roar is not like the roar of a lion's full voice, but rather a sentence of sharp, shouting words.

Scientists believe that ocelots hunt and find animals to eat (predation) by smell, sniffing the ground to find them.
Night vision allows them to see very well in the dark and move around undetected.Celote hunts their prey by camouflaging themselves in their environment and then throwing themselves on prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which they originate (for example, if they move across a mountain range or river or if they move to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they will often be found in an environment different from the one they were in before.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
The original population has not changed at all, needs the same adaptations as before.
As time goes on, as the new population adapts to the environment, its members begin to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other that we won't be able to say they're the same species.

We don't know for sure, but he could have had a fork tongue. His food included turtles, big fish, other species of mosasaurians and he might even have been a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that enters the water; not even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex could have faced it.
While most of their cuisine would be familiar to us, the Romans also had strange or unusual festive dishes, which included mustards, peacocks, snails, and a rodent called the parch.

The strategy has proven effective in cutting off the supply of vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted provisions of international law, enshrined in several international agreements signed over the past two centuries.
The UK has mined international waters to prevent any vessels from entering entire areas of the ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
The answer to this tactic being reserved, Germany expected a similar reaction in the case of its undefeated submarine war.

During these periods there were fierce wars between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying fighting to take the throne from the great Xian Palace.
He had many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from an absolutist system to a republican, nationalist system, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single leader.

Same goes for the military, because instead of the class-based military hierarchy, they now rely on caliber.

Hira, located on Mount Noor (light) in the mountains, was a cave where he used to meditate.
The cave itself, which has survived through time, allows us to form a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's hard to find even when you know it exists. Once you're inside the cave, you're completely isolated.
Only the clear and beautiful sky above and the mountains around can be seen. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.

Subsistence agriculture is agriculture done to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often ecological system that uses preserved seeds, originating from the same ecological region, along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel left out of society's standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or sex of members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinct and symbolic use of characteristic style, which includes fashion, manners and argo.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take inspiration from some unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
These children are called "unreared" or "wild children".Some wild children have been kidnapped by humans (usually by their own parents); in some cases, the child's abandonment was due to their parents' rejection, due to severe intellectual or physical disabilities.

If you happen to reset your alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get out of bed to stop it.
Other biorhythmic options involve drinking fluids (especially water or tea, which has diuretic effects) before bed, forcing us to get out of bed to urinate.

Anyone can touch the light. The only thing that stands in the way of this is their own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but the Mahayana path of love and many other techniques of Indian yoga have been added.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of Yoga Kundalini, meditation and the universal path of love.
Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga fasts, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central aspect of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga.  By visualizing the various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to a collaboration between the USSR and the US. Once the war ended, clashes of system, process and culture led to the two countries distancing themselves.
Two years after the war's end, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War was beginning.
It was to last forty years and be fought seriously, by the armies delegated, on battlefields spread from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.

The plans became useless almost overnight, however, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers were mobilized to create the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.

Traditionally, the role of the navy was to ensure a country's ability to move people and goods, while interfering with the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.

If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in occupying Britain, as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them near their homes to have easy access to milk, wool, meat and leather.
Domestic goats were generally kept in flocks that roamed the hills or other pastures, usually in the care of goats that were often children or teenagers, similar to well-known sheep.
Wagonway roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although these wagonways consisted only of parallel wooden stands, they allowed horses to reach higher speeds and pull heavier loads than they could on slightly more irregular roads of the time.
Travers were introduced early enough to keep the rails in place. However, gradually, it was concluded that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal band over them.

Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels.In 1767, the first railings made entirely of iron were produced.
The first known means of transport was walking; humans began walking in a vertical position 2 million years ago, with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning right man).
Their predecessor, the Autralopithecus, did not usually walk in a vertical position.
Bipedal specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils of 4.2-3.9 million years old, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus already walked bipedal seven million years ago.

After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten bill, signed by Congressman John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house, a few blocks away.
Over the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, known as Dunlap posters.
July 8, the first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap posters still in existence are the oldest surviving copies of the document.

gandak is the term used by entomologists specifically for this group of insects.
The term originates from the ancient resemblance to plumage, which are insects well adapted to parasitize humans.
Both killer beetles and bats are nesting beetles, adapted to life in their nest or host's home.

In the event of an adoption, the natural parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can become the parents of the child.
The main purpose of science is to understand how the world works using the scientific method, which is applied in most scientific research.
It is not the only one however, experimentation and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have used the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.

As knowledge of Greek declined, the West woke up separated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms, which are not mere responses to periodic external stimuli, have been observed in most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to function for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence in favor of the hypothesis that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, a type of virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They've actually done two experiments marking either the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or its proteins with radioactive sulphur.
The mutations may have a number of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the affected cells are germ cells or not.
Only mutations in germline-type cells can be passed on to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
The tourism organised around nature exploration attracts interested persons to visit natural environments to enjoy the landscape, including wildlife and vegetation.

Fortunately, the behavior of drivers tends to stay within reasonable constants; as a result, traffic flows tend to be reasonable constants and can be approximated mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, we need to establish relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.

Aristotel, a philosopher, issued a theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: water, earth, air, and fire.
He was referring to the four states of matter, in the same order: solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he had also theorized that it would transform into another substance to take the form we see.

Content theories are focused on identifying elements that attract people's attention or please them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized as they develop into maturity.
These theories study what makes some people want to do what they do and what their environment can make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of content are Maslow's pyramid of needs and Herzberg's two factor theory.

Often they have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet based on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local leadership.
The presence of a true invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of setting up a learning organization? One goal of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in an organization's functional departments, creativity and ingenuity can be freely expressed.
The process by which an organisation works together to overcome an obstacle can therefore lead to an innovative process to meet the needs of customers.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to bring together organisations to achieve higher performance.

Montevideo is south of the equator, so there's summer, and then there's winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone; in the summer months, temperatures often exceed 30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing point, but the presence of wind and high humidity have the combined effect of making the perceived frost more intense than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly wet or wet seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.

Apia is the capital of the state of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of nearly 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of the state of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a tragic naval confrontation in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for a British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the Mau Movement's struggle for independence, a peaceful rally in the city led to the assassination of supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, thanks to Auckland being between two ports.
North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district), on the shores of the Pacific Ocean, stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Nearly all of these are beaches where you can swim safely, and most have shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the market suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.

Local tap water is drinkable, but if you're afraid you can easily find bottled water.
flat white is unusual for Australians. A short black coffee is espresso, cappuccino comes full of eyeballs with a spoon (not foaming), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian quality standards. Fruit juices are cheap, but very good.

The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula.

The region in the south of the peninsula, which is bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea, is called Ellsworth Land.

For some, understanding something about how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can help in overcoming fear that is based on the unknown or lack of control.
