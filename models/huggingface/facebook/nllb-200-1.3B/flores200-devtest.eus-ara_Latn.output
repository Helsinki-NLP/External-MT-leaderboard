The feathers of dinosaurs do not have a well-developed covering (called the errakia) but they do have other feather features (feather-beards); therefore, researchers have concluded that the errakia developed later in evolution than the other features mentioned.
The structure of the feather may suggest that it was not used for flight, but rather to regulate temperature or to change shape. The researchers suggest that although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows mature feather, not the feather of a cub.
