below are medium-sized cats who eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat the smaller animals that are much larger in number, such as insects, reptiles, bats and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special role that each cat plays that keeps it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats, they live in large groups called herds.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
Females are usually very close to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion troops behave very similarly to wolf or dog troops, animals that behave surprisingly similarly to lions (but not to other big cats), and are especially lethal to their prey.

The tiger is in the same group as the lions, tigers and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can haggle.
The tiger's howling is not like the lion's powerful rattle, it's more like a sentence of words shouted with impatience.
e they can, they'll catch monkeys, snakes, reptiles and birds. Almost all the animals that the eucalyptus hunt are much smaller than them.
scientists think that ocelots find animals to eat and follow them by scent, by the smell of the soil they're passing through.
They can see well in the dark using night vision, and also sneak in the silence. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with the environment and then leaping on the prey.
When a small group of animals (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (such as if they cross a mountain range or a river, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily return) they will often find themselves in a different environment than they were in before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than they previously required to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all. They still need the same adaptations as before.
n ae n ae time, as a new population starts to adjust to their new surroundings, they start to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different from each other, you won't be able to see them as the same species.
This process we call speciation, which means the creation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen which humans breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide which humans exhale.
Plant produce their food from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes from plants and make our clothes from plants. Most of our food is plants. Without plants, animals can't survive.
Moussaurus was the great predator of his time, so he was not afraid to speak, except for other moussaurians.
Long jaws had more than 70 sharp teeth as a spade, and an extra set in the upper part of its mouth, meaning anyone who fell in its path could not escape.
We don't know for sure, but he may have had a half-tongue. His diet included turtles, big fish, other muses, and he may have even been a cannibal.
Plus, it attacked any creature that went into the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T-Rex couldn't stand up to it.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans did have some strange or unusual items for celebration, including wild boar, peacock, snails and a type of reptile called namamen.
Another difference was that whereas poor men and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have dinners where they would sit on their chairs while they ate their meal.
It's impossible that ancient Roman cuisine included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
i.e. They had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman of ancient times ever tasted turkey.i.e. they had no corn, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no Roman of ancient times ever tasted turkey.

Sometimes they built special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home didn't matter so much.
The majority of the Hebrew family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were just open counters facing the street.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was very expensive.
Greenland was inhabited by giants. In Norse sagas, Red Erik was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his western expeditions he discovered Greenland and gave it the name Greenland.

The Normandy landings and the ensuing battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the French of Vichy, who were the French who collaborated with the Germans in 1940 and sided with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
within just two weeks the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were heading towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a particularly large group of people who live and work together, as a society.
Civilization comes from the Latin word chibilis, meaning citizen, related to the Latin word chibis, meaning citizen, and chibitas, meaning city or city-state, which also defines in some way the size of society.
Culture of civilization implies the transfer of knowledge between several generations, the cultural footprint and the relatively large distribution.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.

Congressional power was no taxation and since there was no executive or judicial power, he relied on the authorities in the states, who were often uncooperative, to enforce his laws.
And it had no authority to circumvent the tax laws and tariffs between states.
The regulation must be unanimously agreed upon by all states before an amendment could be added, and states treated the central government so lightly that their representatives were mostly absent.

In 1624, the Dutch East India Company establishes a base in southwest Taiwan, which causes a change in traditional grain growing practices and the employment of Chinese workers in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1912-1644) took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Agreement, according to which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.

"For example, the world's most popular still camera format is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue film era".
still in production today, but more importantly, its height-to-width ratio has been inherited to the image formats in a digital camera.
The dimensions of the 35mm format are actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
So the width-to-height ratio of this format (twelve-digit to get the simplest integer ratio) should be 3:2.

The Law of Thirds, which has absorbed cycles of ridicule and abuse, is the simple guide to creating dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in the picture.
He states that the most effective place for the central subject of a photograph is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was under severe criticism.

Her penetrating power affected everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the core beliefs in Christianity is that capital should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church money is specifically intended for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether this principle has been preserved.

The strategy proved to be effective, blocking vital military and civilian supplies, although this siege violated accepted international rules signed in several international agreements over the past two centuries.

There are many social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, going from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the state belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Plus, after the revolution, jobs were open to any man who wanted them, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This is true for the military because instead of ranking the military based on rank, now it was based on ability.

The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plain, or the "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (of which the "Great Pyramid" is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of his wives and the members of Khufu's family.
"The up-arc sign looks like a V and the down-arc sign is like a pincer pin or square without its lower rib".
Up means you start at the end and push the bow, and down means you start at the end (in place of the hand holding the bow) and pull the bow.
A higher bow generally produces a softer sound, whereas a lower bow is more powerful and assertive.

To understand the Templars, you have to understand the context that led to the establishment of the Order.
The period in which these events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history that lasted through the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The height of the Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally accepted to have ended around 1500.
TECHNOLOGICAL DETERMINISM is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas and practices, ranging from push technology or technological dictation to a hardened sense that human destiny is based on logic that rises above natural law and their expression in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that technological development proceeds in a way that is not influenced culturally or politically to a large extent, and that technology has ""impacts"" on societies that are constructed, rather than social conditioned".

However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed in order to lower the cost of owning cars.

The Romantic movement included a large element of cultural determinism, inspired by writers such as Goethe, Pietta and Schuegel.
In the context of the Romantic movement, geography shaped people, and over time, customs and cultures associated with this geography emerged, and these, due to their harmony with the place of society, were preferred over the rules imposed by the rituals.

"Such children are called 'wild children.'" Some wild children were imprisoned by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the child occurred due to the parents' refusal to accept the child's severe mental or physical disability".
Wild children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others, it is claimed, were raised by animals; some were said to live in the wild alone.
When raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (under physical limitations) almost completely identical to those of the animal that has been raised, such as fear or indifference towards humans.

adoption care should provide for all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were taken in the past.
Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usability and access to content.
"For example, it is argued that ""learning"" and ""community"" are important motivators for using the Internet (James et al., 1995)."
"Personal engagement" and "persistent relationships" were also identified as new motivational hubs by Amy and Cord (1998) when they studied audience responses to Internet sites.
The use of video has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, which are facial movements that last for several milliseconds.

segregation and re-combination mix the differences back and forth between the two deposits with each generation.
In the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to humans to meet its amino acid requirements from available plant sources.
Plus, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most available plant resources were the cheap, tiny proteins available, but for primates like us, they're hard to digest unless they're cooked.
On the other hand, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easy to digest, but also provide a large amount of protein, which contains all the essential amino acids.
"Given all the data, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in about the same ways that chimpanzees use in the savannah today".
Sleep apnea is a process of deliberate waking during your normal sleep time and falling asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).

On 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses had been broken, and the only chance was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became irrelevant almost overnight, as over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops entered and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Accord, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most efficient way at great distances to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The role of the Marine Corps has traditionally been to ensure that your country can keep your people and products moving, while at the same time disrupting the enemy's ability to move their people and products.

Carriageways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Though the wagon tracks were only parallel wooden structures, they allowed the horses to pull them to higher speeds and carry larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.

It became the norm, but the iron further rubbed the wooden wheels of the carts.
Then wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels.In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.

After being approved by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to John Dunlap's printing house, a few blocks away.
"Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were produced, now called the Dunlop Sheets".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
one was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who called it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
25 Dunlop sheets that are known to still exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived. The original handwritten copy has not survived.

The internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are so general that immediate diagnosis is not possible.
The best indication for internal poisoning might be the presence of an open medicine box or or open bottles of household chemicals.
You should check the label for first aid instructions specific to this poison.
Entomologists use the term bug in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient acquaintance with bed bugs, which are insects that have largely adapted to parasitic relationships with humans.

The Hersh and Chase experiment was one of the first claims that DNA is genetic material.
Hershy and Chase used Pugs, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments where we tagged the DNA in Pag with radioactive resin or the Pag protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material and whether the affected cells are offspring of the germ layer.
Only mutations in the germ line can pass to children, whereas mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.

In this dynamic transportation vehicle, everyone is somehow connected and supportive of a transportation system based on private cars.
iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.

Why do transport systems get so much complaint, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are simple transport engineers untalented? Or is something more substantial happening there?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, learning traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict driver behavior with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, drivers' behaviour tends to stay within the range of logical consistency; therefore, traffic flow generally has logical consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, we've constructed relationships between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These links help with the planning, design and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them to evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects enjoy the advantage of being able to fold their wings back along their body.
Then they have a wider range of small places where they can hide like crazy.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the ferns and the rhinoceroses.

Content theories are all about finding the same thing that motivates people or enchants them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that they satisfy as they grow older.
These theories test what's in certain people that makes them want the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, two behaviors can break out when people become the managers of their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum tries to remain 'one of the guys.'"
This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, making disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibility, and demanding that people take responsibility.
At the other end of the spectrum, the individual becomes unrecognizable and feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often ends in rifts between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are required to the same professional standards as regular teams, but there are slight differences.
Virtual team members often act as liaisons with their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than conventional staff members, as their teams may meet in different time zones, which may not be understandable to their local management.
"The presence of a real ""invisible team"" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team".

Why would an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization? One goal for implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all the resources available in all the functional departments of an organization are used efficiently, creativity and resilience can arise.
As a result, a process of the organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a new innovative process that will serve the customer's need.
Before an organisation can innovate, leadership must create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the sequential approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognition research, so it narrows down the field of study and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It's long been known that different types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and study structures and processes in the brain that have never been seen before.
This provides us with much information and material needed to build blood models, which help us understand processes in our consciousness.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning and intellectual adaptation of machines.
