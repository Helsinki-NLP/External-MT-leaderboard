Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law introducing administrative responsibility for violations of the payment terms and conditions for goods (works, services) when purchasing for state and municipal needs.
This law is designed to solve the very acute problem of non-fulfilment of obligations by customers when carrying out state and municipal procurement.
Two years ago, the situation where entrepreneurs could not get paid for their government and municipal contracts was widespread.
At the same time, the Russian president instructed the Prosecutor General's Office to take the problem under special control.
Because the businessmen themselves could not cope with unscrupulous customers who signed contracts without backing, tried to evade their payment obligations and included illegal terms in the contracts.
The problem was systemic throughout the country.
Since 2015, in the interests of protecting the rights of entrepreneurs to receive payment on public orders, the prosecutor's office has submitted 9,7 thousand submissions, 4,5 thousand officials have been brought to disciplinary responsibility, 533 to administrative responsibility, 75 materials have been submitted to the investigative bodies for the organization of procedural checks, 46 of them have been prosecuted.
As a result, more than 66 billion rubles of debts were paid off.
And these huge sums were not accumulated by the failure to pay multibillion-dollar contracts.
The fabulous debts were caused by the numerous, systematic delays in paying the entrepreneurs for services of much more modest amounts.
That's a typical case.
A small company's head won a million-ruble competition for social transportation services.
The man has invested all his working capital, has fully fulfilled his obligations, but has not received the money in time.
The result is a growing financial debt of salaries, taxes, loans, which would have led to bankruptcy if the entrepreneur had not sought help from the prosecutor's office.
Now, in some regions, the problem has been reduced to a minimum.
Nevertheless, as of the first half of 2017, the total amount of debt under state and municipal contracts identified by the prosecutors of the Russian Federation's subjects amounted to about 27.4 billion rubles.
In regions where debt levels continue to reach critical levels, the prosecutor's office operates in a manual crisis management mode.
The Prosecutor General personally holds visiting meetings with local authorities to discuss all the violations and measures to remedy them immediately.
Such operational meetings have already been held in Yaroslavl and Yekaterinburg this year.
The implementation of the Federal Law No. 189-FZ "On introducing changes to the Code of the Russian Federation on administrative offences in respect of the establishment of administrative responsibility of the officials of the customer for violating the term and order of payment of goods (works, services) when carrying out purchases for the provision of state and municipal needs" which was signed by the President of Russia last week will improve the payment discipline of public customers.
The draft law was developed by the Russian Ministry of Economic Development on the initiative of the Prosecutor General's Office.
The new law will supplement the Code of the Russian Federation on administrative offenses with an article that provides a fine of from 30 thousand to 50 thousand rubles for violation by a responsible person of the customer of the term and order of payment of goods, works and services at state and municipal purchases.
If the official has already been subjected to administrative punishment for a similar offence, he is liable to disqualification for a period of one to two years.
All prosecutors of the Russian Federation have already received instructions to ensure the application of these legislative novelties in practice.
Civil rights group issues a travel warning in Missouri
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People issued a warning for people of color traveling to Missouri because of the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The group's statement reads: A travel warning from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, effective until August 28, 2017, urges African-American travelers, guests, and Missourians to be especially vigilant and cautious when traveling in the state in light of a series of suspicious racist incidents that have recently occurred throughout the state and are listed here.
According to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the group was prompted to issue a travel warning by a recent Missouri law that made it harder for people to win discrimination lawsuits, as well as the fact that state law enforcement disproportionately selects minority targets.
You have human rights violations.
They are stopped on the roads because of the color of their skin, they are beaten and killed", Rod Chappell, president of the Missouri National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, told the Kansas City Star.
We hear complaints more often than ever.
This is the first such warning issued by the organization in relation to the US state.
The group cited incidents such as the racially humiliating treatment of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of 28-year-old Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died under suspicious circumstances earlier this year after he ran out of gas while on a trip around the state, and the Missouri State Police arrested him without charge.
The warning also cites a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General's Office, which found that black drivers are 75 percent more likely to be stopped than white drivers.
"The purpose of the warning is to keep people informed and to warn their relatives and friends and colleagues about what might happen in Missouri", Chappell said.
People should be prepared in some way, whether they're taking the bail money with them or telling relatives they're traveling across the state.
According to the latest data from the FBI's Hate Crimes Reporting Program, Missouri had 100 hate crimes in 2015, making it the 16th state in the nation to have such a violation.
The move warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder to sue a legal entity for housing or employment discrimination.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings to Texas and Arizona after the states passed new immigration control laws requiring local law enforcement to arrest people for violating immigration laws, which the ACLU said should increase racial screening.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently, non-governmental organizations have resorted to this measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States.
Two people killed in police shooting in Egypt
Unknown assailants have opened fire on a police patrol in the Egyptian city of Isna, Reuters reports, citing the Egyptian Interior Ministry.
Two people, including one policeman, were killed, three people were injured.
All the wounded have been taken to hospital.
According to the agency, the police stopped the car, after which two armed men in the car opened fire on the law enforcement officers.
One of the assailants was arrested, the other escaped.
Rosturism supports law on cancellation of free baggage for non-returnable air tickets
The head of the Russian tourism Oleg Safonov said in an interview with the RBC television channel that he is "positively" regarding the adoption of the law on the abolition of free luggage transportation for non-returnable air tickets.
"We need to create conditions where a person who has no luggage can buy a ticket cheaper than someone who has luggage", he said (TASS quotes him).
Mr. Safonov noted that despite the citizens' fears, there will be no need to pay for carrying outer clothing and mobile phones in hand luggage.
"It would be right to reassure all our citizens and tourists and declare that it has nothing to do with the outer clothing, the umbrella, the mobile phone, the iPad or even some computer", said the head of the Russian Tourism Ministry.
Earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a law providing for the right of airlines to exclude the norm of free baggage transportation on non-returnable air tickets.
The airlines themselves can determine the number of seats and the weight of the baggage included in the non-refundable fare.
Vladimir Putin instructed to eliminate pollution of Lake Baikal
Russian President Vladimir Putin told a meeting on the protection of Lake Baikal that significant areas of the lake have been subjected to extreme pollution in recent years.
He instructed the authorities to identify funding sources, plans and implementers for the elimination of pollution.
Mr. Putin also ordered the full reclamation of the contaminated areas.
"We need to deal with the facilities that continue to work here, the treatment facilities of most of them are worn out", - quotes "RIA Novosti" the president.
He also added that the Russian Prosecutor General's Office should conduct an investigation to identify environmentally harmful activities.
According to him, there are problems in the area of the lake, related to the appearance of natural landfills and a number of violations in the field of ecology by the organizers of recreation.
"I want to emphasize this: not everything in a row to check, here too the measure needs to know, but it is - illegal and environmentally harmful activities and take appropriate measures", he stressed.
Earlier, the Prosecutor General's Office reported a reduction in fish stocks in Lake Baikal and proposed increasing the number of objects under environmental surveillance.
Recall that on June 15, Vladimir Putin stated during a direct line that the legislation needed to be changed to ensure the rights of citizens living in natural areas under special protection.
He was informed of the problems with the management of the economic activity by the residents of the island of Olkhon, which is part of the Baikal natural territory.
The head of the Ministry of Nature Sergey Donsky immediately proposed to solve the problem by clarifying the boundaries of the water protection zone of Baikal, but the government of Buryatia reminded that such a change is not enough, since the restrictions are connected with a number of regulatory acts.
Earlier, the Ministry of Economy proposed to solve the problem by changing the Land Code and the law on environmental protection.
A new temple will be built in Yugra
In the village of Sosiva, members of the community from representatives of the indigenous peoples of the North "Rakhtyny", together with the inhabitants of the Berezovsky district, take part in the construction of the Orthodox church in honor of the saint Nicholas the Wonderworker.
Its location is on the river bank, the temple will be well visible from far away, so it will serve as a travel beacon for fishermen.
According to the community, the construction work will be completed this year, now the domes have been installed, church bells are available.
The Igrim Navy SEALs provided transportation support.
The temple is named after Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker, as he is revered by the Orthodox Church as the patron saint of travelers, including fishermen.
In Sossusv, fisheries provide settlers with work and food.
Local residents are waiting for the temple to open its doors, and children even write about it in school essays as a local attraction.
Disneyland with the death penalty.
Why is Singapore law-abiding?
I'm talking to a local businessman, Chang, sitting in an open-air diner.
Commenting on the situation in Singapore, Chang smokes cigarettes one after the other, carefully storing the cigarette lights in an iron box he has stolen from the office.
After the conversation is over, the businessman heads to the nearest urn - a hundred meters away - and throws the bulls in.
The fine for garbage in a public place is 500 local dollars, Chang reports.
You know, I've had this reflex since I was a kid, you can't throw a candy fancy on a bridge, you'll get a ticket.
And now there are cameras everywhere.
And indeed, the city centre of Singapore has a clean, museum-like sidewalk.
Chang tells us that three months ago, his neighbor's 18-year-old son graffitied the wall of an old colonial building.
The court found the guy guilty of vandalism and sentenced him to a pork.
What?!
Just think about it.
He received ten blows to the buttocks with a wooden stick and spent a week in prison.
Corporal punishment is not uncommon.
The AIF commentator saw how Singapore combines the highest standard of living with the most rigid laws.
No one here is thinking of abolishing the death penalty, explains lawyer Victor Li Hong.
And the government has long been indifferent to the views of both the EU and the US on this issue.
If a person is carrying a large shipment of drugs or dealing in them, he is to be hanged.
In 2002, a 22-year-old Australian citizen was arrested at Changi Airport with 400 grams of cocaine.
He was defended by the Australian prime minister, who threatened sanctions, international human rights activists, and even the pope.
But the guy was hanged anyway.
After that, drug runners are scrambling around our country.
The point is, in Singapore, the law is supposed to be enforced by everyone, not just the modest and the poor.
It doesn't matter who you are - a millionaire, a vice-premier, a famous artist or a resident of the European Union.
Option one, if they find a pound of cocaine in your possession, you'll hang.
When you walk around Singapore and see signs with a lot of warnings, you're amazed at how much the city-state is forbidden!
For example, chewing gum is sold only in pharmacies, and it can be purchased strictly by doctor's prescription (!)
Tourists won't be stripped of their chewing gum, but if they stick a rubber band on the subway, they'll be fined 1,000 local dollars.
In four days, I met two people with white signs around their necks that said, "I've done garbage".
For throwing away the urns of cigarettes, in addition to the fine, they are often sentenced to "exile to the yard": a week to clean up parks and beaches.
6 thousand rubles is paid by the "criminal" who forgot to wash the water in the public toilet, and when trying to cope with a small need in the elevator of a residential house, a special detector is activated - the doors are blocked and a signal is sent to the police.
Among the most exotic laws are bans on feeding pigeons on the street, public singing, and even excessive watering of houseplants (!): it is believed that the abundance of water attracts mosquitoes.
To avoid fires, smokers are not allowed to carry lighters in the subway, otherwise they will be fined 5,000 Singapore dollars.
So, you get the idea that no matter how hard you try, you're bound to break something.
That's not true at all, trying to convince me of Muhammad Kabir-Kajaria, the owner of the local travel agency.
The most fantastic laws are only on paper, and I haven't seen anyone get caught for violating them in the last 20 years.
Why are they preserved?
So the citizens don't get too relaxed.
The basic rules are strictly enforced.
For example, if a minor is sold cigarettes at a newsstand, the chain will punish everyone: the owner of the store will pay a huge sum, the offender himself will be beaten with sticks in the "back", and the seller will also be beaten and put in prison.
It is because of the strict laws that crime is so rare in Singapore.
Is that justified?
Back in the 1970s, we had chaos on the roads - drivers ignoring traffic lights, driving as they pleased, getting drunk and driving.
After the fines were imposed for a year, everything calmed down.
Now the driver, after drinking a shot of whiskey, knows that if he is stopped, the police officer will not let him go for the bribe, he will be fined the price of the apartment and sent to jail for years.
To many foreigners, a city-state in Southeast Asia seems like a kind of concentration camp.
In 1993, American writer William Gibson called Singapore "Disneyland with the death penalty" - a visitor from the United States was appalled by the general wealth of the inhabitants, "the frighteningly clean airport" and "the multicultural nature".
They say that things like this are unnatural, they look artificial, and they shouldn't be.
First few days in Singapore and you're right, you're afraid to throw a piece of paper on the sidewalk, you're scared if you get on the subway with ice cream.
But then you come to Little India, and suddenly, there's a pattern breaker: plastic cups are falling at the bus stop.
"How is that?" you wonder.
That's how Singaporeans laugh.
It's all in the cards.
Not every "crime" like this gets caught on the spot, but you should know that if you get caught, you're not going to get away with it because you broke the law.
Most of the time, that's enough to make a person behave normally.
Of course, the Singaporean government is quite authoritarian.
But you know what?
In Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, I was very careful about my travels - motorcyclists often snatch smartphones and cameras from tourists.
Downtown Paris is full of dirty homeless men and beggars.
Not everyone on our streets is trying to throw trash in the bins.
Singapore, on the other hand, has become the most peaceful, cleanest and safest city on Earth thanks to a set of draconian fines and ruthless laws (even the death penalty).
You'll think about it.
It's human nature, remember, and in Russia, nobody was strapped to the wheel until they started to charge.
Although, in Singapore, it's not about fines, it's about voluntary compliance.
And you have to think, in Russia, people would also be happy with clean streets, no garbage in the subway, and would welcome the arrest of those who confuse the elevator with the public toilet.
That's corporal punishment, thank you.
The rest of Singapore's laws are worth a look.
Nothing sacred?
Now the Trump White House is targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most reliable sign of regime change is when it starts fighting the statues.
Americans understand this as well as anyone else, and that's why the theatrical demolition of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Firdous Square in Baghdad in 2003 was done.
Steven Miller, one of the key ideologues in the Trump administration, no doubt knew what he was doing when he brandished a symbolic ax over the Statue of Liberty during a fierce debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta over the president's proposals to drastically reduce legal immigration.
Let's be honest, Miller didn't try to get the statue.
A bunch of cruise ship owners and artists painting the Statue of Liberty would lynch him if he tried to do it.
But he was attacking its meaning, and especially the meaning that was attributed to it in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed, when Emma Lazarus' poems were added to the pedestal.
As Miller grumbled to Acosta, "I don't want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that lights up the world.
The poem you refer to was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty".
Miller's right about the facts, but as he said, it's not really about the story.
It is about the current sound of Lazarus's astonishing words, the only ones in which the state invites not just any immigrants, but the poorest: "Your tired, your poor, / your crowds, dreaming to breathe freely, / the unhappy waste of your abundant shores".
Never before has "unfortunate waste" been so visible on our screens.
Miller wasn't a literary scholar, he made it clear that Trump was not wanted in America.
This debate about the meaning of the statue is part of a larger political and cultural war: it's really a debate about the meaning of America.
Lazarus - and her friends, who fought to have her words placed on the base of the statue after her death - knew very well that they were committing a completely political act.
The sculpture was intended to represent the relationship between the French and American republics through a banal classic figure - the female image of Liberty.
Lazarus changed her meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract, she has a voice.
And she got a completely different name: Mother of the Exile.
The combination of poetry and image was a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And how Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right though change it back.
The loud-mouthed Rush Limbaugh, a sort of John the Baptist who announced Trump's arrival, argued in 2010 that Freedom is not inviting anyone, but rather an early neoconservative, carrying America's flame to a world in darkness: "Freedom is moving forward.
It carries the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
You don't need a torch to light the way into the United States".
Against the grain, Limbo really hit the nail on the head.
The meaning of the statue depends solely on the angle of view.
The great creative achievement of Lazarus was to see her as she would be seen by exhausted, unhappy, but hopeful people on the decks of ships after a long and often arduous voyage.
It literally means looking at the world through the eyes of people who are looking for refuge and a chance at a better life.
Her statue responds to them with the words of hope and hospitality they dream of hearing.
And that's certainly not a perspective that Miller and Trump will ever want to acknowledge.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to kindle the hatred that is their only source of power.
2017 World Cup: Neil Blake gives a high rating to the Scottish members of the Great Britain team.
Eileen Doyle recalls a time when there were only two Scotsmen in the England team
Neil Blake, Director of the UK Athletics Federation, said the 16-man Scottish World Cup squad would make a "significant contribution to the team's game".
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 London Championships, which begin on Friday.
Blake believes that something special is being born in Scotland and the UK Athletics Federation should take this into account.
"We know that and we're trying to understand and we're going to support them as long as they have the potential", Blake said.
"I've spoken to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport, and they think it's because of what they did.
The Scottish Athletics Federation thinks what they've done needs to be worked on.
British Athletics: What they've done, we need to work on.
And people on the street think the same.
I don't know why it's happened, but it's absolutely brilliant".
Some of the Scottish track and field athletes are in contention for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Bachert - who will compete with Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m; and Eilid Doyle has been chosen as the team's captain.
"Ailide is humble.
Her captain's speech was great", says Blake.
"Many athletes, whether they are Scottish or not, and wherever they live or train, have come out of this room feeling proud and eager to win.
The passion and the genuine feeling that Eileen put into it was wonderful".
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will run the 400m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says that 16 Scots on the British team is "incredible".
The previous record for the number of Scotsmen at the World Cup was seven, in 1983 and 2005.
Leading the way is Laura Muir, who specialises in the middle distance and who broke five British and two European records last year.
She's going to run the 1500 and 5000 meters.
Chris O'Hair, who will compete in the 1500m, is another Scot worth noting: he has a successful season, winning the British team qualifiers and the Annual Competitions.
Doyle recalls her first World Cup, when the only other Scot on the team was Lee McConnell.
The team captain says she is "incredibly proud" that so many of her compatriots have not only made the team, but in some cases will be competing for medals and fighting for a place in the finals.
"The captain of the national team is chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a huge honor anyway, but to know that your teammates voted for you and you were chosen is something very special to me", she added.
"Of course, I'm very proud of all the Scots who have made the team.
It shows how far we've come.
And they're all accomplished track and field athletes who will be striving to get on the podium.
What about my captain's speech?
Yeah, I think she was good.
I just noticed that we're very lucky to have the World Cup at home.
So it's just about how important it is to get the support from the fans and to take advantage of the fact that we're going to be at the Olympic Stadium again.
I get another chance to go out there and compete, and the atmosphere is just great".
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you're not prepared to listen to voter criticism
The founder of our country understood what a critical press was.
Americans loved George Washington, but that didn't stop them from criticizing him for everything from domestic policy to his political principles.
The criticism, of course, annoyed him.
But he didn't shut up about his critics.
Because back in 1783, Washington said, "you can take away freedom of speech and we deaf and dumb will be led like sheep to the slaughter".
Now I'm going to go to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who should try to be more like Washington.
Hogan's followers have blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who have expressed their views on his official Facebook page.
And this week, the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for that.
The governor's subordinates called the lawsuit a "simple" one, and the online commentary was written in the spirit of "well and what".
"It's just Facebook", many would say.
But that's important, too.
And that's especially important when it comes to a guy like Hogan.
He's a surprisingly popular Republican governor in a predominantly Democratic state.
He's second in the approval rating of the 50 governors in the country.
Hogan is not a stubborn reactionary.
He has shown a firm hand in running the state and a commitment to his principles.
He also is adept at using Facebook as his primary means of communicating with his constituents and jokingly displays his bald head after chemotherapy on his page.
So blocking people who visit the governor's page - which is billed as an official public forum and run by taxpayer-funded administration employees - is unnecessary and ultimately harmful.
In an interview with The Washington Post, spokeswoman Amelia Ches defended the governor's actions, arguing that blocking comments was simply moderation.
But it's too easy to use the image of trolls, spammers and haters doing evil on the Internet.
The Post spoke to some of the real people Hogan blocked.
And it's real people, not trolls, the teacher, the businessman, the pastor, who are addressing their elected leaders.
They all say their comments were respectful, meaningful, and not rude.
The pastor quoted the Bible, appealing to the fact that Hogan was a Catholic.
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramana of Bowie, Maryland, did not express hatred, but asked about hate crimes.
"I wrote a polite comment saying I was disappointed by his lack of reaction to hate crimes and other recent news", she wrote in the Post's comment section.
"I also don't like the idea that when a lot of people leave comments on the same topic, some immediately say it's a so-called twist, instead of admitting that they're dealing with a large group of disgruntled citizens".
What the governor's subordinates call a "concentrated spam attack", others would probably call an "active life position".
In the Facebook era, it's easy to edit your image simply by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It's a lot less dusty than it used to be, when it required sending people, collecting and burning newspapers with critical editorials, or arresting and silencing protesters.
But that's exactly what's happening now, only in numbers.
Hogan is not the first official to be criticized for not listening to Facebook and other social media.
President Trump has been sued by Twitter users who were banned from his Twitter account.
One of the first, pivotal decisions on this issue was made this week in Virginia.
According to U.S. District Judge James K. Casheris of Alexandria, the chairman of the Laudon County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment by banning a voter from her Facebook account.
And in Kentucky, Republican Governor Matt Bavin was sued by the American Civil Liberties Union for his behavior on Facebook and Twitter.
It shouldn't be that hard.
In Washington's day, the era of affordable mail was about as revolutionary as the Internet is today.
From 1776 to 1800, the number of newspapers quadrupled, and anonymous letters greatly eroded his reputation.
And even then, Washington was dealing with anonymous trolls.
People using the aliases "Uricola", "Valerius", "Belizarus", and "Porcius" wrote letters to the newspapers mocking Washington's decision.
According to historical documents compiled by the online project The George Washington Papers, his office was flooded with petitions criticizing his position on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce and Navigation.
But he didn't try to shut them up.
Freedom of speech, dissent and expression is at the very core of our state.
And true leadership is about accepting that.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for the comforts of home at the Renaissance Club .
Former European champion Ronan Rafferti is looking forward to the comforts of home over the next three days, as the East Lothian Renaissance Club hosts the 25th Scottish Open Senior Golf Tournament.
The Northern Irishman, who led the neighbourhood at the Archerfield Links and was on his way to the final round last year before losing to Paul Ilse, has been attached to the new venue and is acting as the tournament's representative on behalf of founder and club director Jerry Sarvadi.
"I saw the Renaissance Club being built, and we're watching it succeed with this event", Rafferty said.
The players will see this field at its best, it's in great condition.
Jerry did a great job setting this place up.
He's a big fan of the game and proud of his accomplishments here.
It's a great demonstration of this field.
The Englishman Ells is looking forward to defending his title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"It's a really special feeling", said the Southport player.
I failed to try to win the Extremadura Open again because it was removed from the schedule a year after I won it.
It's magical to come back to this part of the world.
This is a great place to play golf.
Memories of last year are coming back, and for me and my wife Sharon, it was a very special experience to win last year.
It was a really special time, and we'll always remember it.
Returning to the fight in his homeland, Gary Orr, who joined the European Senior Athletes' Tournament after turning 50 earlier this year, is a member of the European Team of the Year.
This event will be his first public appearance in Scotland since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"When you play at home, it's always a little bit more important", said Hellensboro resident Orr.
You want to perform well, but you feel this extra burden.
I enjoyed playing again, and I showed good golf.
I'm happy with how things are going so far.
The trio will be joined on the field by former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and Majors seniors champions Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are two of six Scotsmen on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen Macalester, Bill Longmire and Ross Drummond.
The tournament is free to enter and parking costs £5 per hour for a single person and £10 for two or more.
All proceeds go to the British Prostate Cancer Foundation.
UK roads will learn to absorb harmful emissions
Highway tunnels that can absorb carbon dioxide from cars are already being tested on UK roads.
The country's transport agency, Autocar reports, reported positive test results for a 100-meter tunnel installed on a highway in the north of the country.
The 20-foot-high tunnel is constructed of some of the latest polymer materials that are capable of absorbing the harmful substances contained in automobile waste.
However, the construction of a network of tunnels is only part of the wider efforts that the UK government is planning to make to improve the atmosphere.
In addition to the tunnel network, the British are going to expand the network of charging stations for electric vehicles, implement a number of measures to reduce the automobile flow on roads, expand the use of commercial transport on electric traction and modernize the park of heavy trucks.
Official statistics show that a quarter of all air pollution is caused by transport, and poor air quality is responsible for up to 40,000 premature deaths a year.
Moscow city court changed the sentence of the disabled Mamayev to a fine
Moscow city court changed the sentence of disabled Anton Mamayev, sentenced to four and a half years in a colony, to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
TASS reports that.
Earlier, the prosecutor's office asked the court to replace the term with a conditional one, explaining its request that Mamayev's illness "impedes his being in prison conditions".
28-year-old Anton Mamayev was sentenced to four and a half years in prison, serving time in a general regime colony, for robbery that killed a former special forces soldier.
On July 19, the court in a traveling session in the SIZO released the man from custody.
Poverty and Death in the Golden Land of Indonesia
When he cooks dinner, Bardina Degay doesn't use a stove.
She's not even used to it.
In her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of Paniay County in the rebellious Indonesian province of Papua, a housewife usually just puts a sweet potato, here called nota, right in the fireplace.
After half an hour, the charred club is pulled out and eaten with impatient, unwashed hands.
Degeie sits on the earthen floor  she has no furniture  and it is here that she does her housework, such as washing clothes with muddy water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket is used as a toilet in a room without a roof.
She is the youngest of her husband's four wives, and so she was not assigned to work in the fields.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, working late can be dangerous: many men in this village are unemployed, many drink, and there are soldiers.
"Nobody dares to walk around the village after five in the evening", she says.
It's a rare opportunity to look at everyday life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was annexed to Indonesia in 1969 after a questionable referendum, when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by publicly raising their hands in front of occupying troops.
The existing movement for independence from the Netherlands quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which maintains tight control over the region, not allowing foreign journalists and human rights activists.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua, with the independent state of Papua New Guinea occupying the eastern part of the island.
Enoratali is as remote as it is abandoned; the journey here involves a one-and-a-half-hour flight from Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, to Nabir, and then a five-hour ride in a rented car.
There's no public transport here.
The city of about 19,000 people consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences; the roofs are of corrugated steel and painted with rust in various reddish tones.
Few Indonesians, let alone journalists, and almost no foreigners have been here.
Before the arrival of Christian missionaries, the Papuans worshipped a god named Uga Tameye.
There were other changes.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes", says Degei, pointing to her bright, hand-woven turban, dark skirt and bright shirt.
We used to wear only leaves.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, with 28% of the population living below the poverty line, and infant mortality and literacy rates among the worst in Asia.
But it's also the land of Indonesian gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Phoenix-based Freeport McMoran, is just sixty miles from Paniay, a mountainous province about the size of New Jersey with 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport mined gold and copper here for about $3.1 billion.
In addition, Papua boasts forest reserves worth an estimated $78 billion.
This wealth, however, brings one disaster for the Papuans, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains its suffocating presence.
According to a 2005 New York Times investigation, between 1998 and 2004, Freeport paid local military personnel and units nearly $20 million, including up to $150,000 per officer.
The demands for greater autonomy by the Papuans threaten the existence of this golden vein and are being ruthlessly suppressed.
Human rights activists claim that since 1969, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed by Indonesian military forces, and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned.
The Asian Commission on Human Rights has stated that the mass killings in the highlands of Papua in the 1970s can be considered genocide.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
"We will lose everything", a report published in 2016 by the Diocese of Brisbane, contains evidence of atrocities committed in the previous year, such as executions without trial, torture - particularly frequent, as claimed in another report, rape and electrocution - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations.
"It's hard to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week", says Andreas Harsono, a researcher in Indonesia for Human Rights Watch.
The gaiki were delayed as Papua's resources attracted an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia.
The province's 3.5 million population is 83% Christian, but demographics are changing as Muslim economic migrants arrive from the densely populated Indonesian islands of Java, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
Javanese stalls, called warung, sell fried chicken and a mix of vegetables, called gadō-gadō, served with peanut sauce.
The locals are trying to keep up with the competition.
"Migrants have started selling chicken and vegetables at a traditional marketplace that is cheaper than the indigenous people of Papua", explains Abet Yow, a 24-year-old native of Paniay who moved to Jayapura, the administrative center of the province, for work.
Because of this, the indigenous people of Papua have lost their market.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Djokovic, vowed to address inequality and human rights abuses in Papua during his 2014 presidential campaign.
On his way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta, the former carpenter enlisted the support of 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniay.
But in Papua, almost nothing has changed, and the locals feel loyal.
"Our hearts are broken because in 2014 we voted for Djokovic, expecting him to fulfill our hopes of restoring justice", says Yow.
In fact, just two months after his October inauguration, Djokovic Paniai suffered a tragedy.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were out singing Christmas carols by a bonfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers on motorcycles broke out of the darkness.
The frightened children told them they should turn on the lights.
According to local pastor Javed Tebai, one of the soldiers was offended by their tone and returned with four soldiers after a while.
Victims and witnesses said soldiers who were drunk chased the children and beat them with rifle butts.
Then one of the soldiers shot a group of children.
One child, 16-year-old Julianus Aimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
A few hours later, someone set fire to the nearby government election commission building, and the next day the situation escalated.
About a thousand Papuan men, women and children gathered on a football field in front of the local police station and military command center to demand justice.
They brought their ritual hunting bows and performed the waita, a dance of the Mye Pago tribe of Papua, running in circles and imitating the song of birds.
Some protesters began throwing stones at the police station and military base.
When the situation escalated, soldiers were told over internal radio: "If the mob resists more than three times, shoot them", according to an official document seen by TIME magazine correspondents but not published by local media.
Jeremiah Kayame, 56, the head of the Kego Koto district in Enarotali, sensed the danger and called for calm, asking the crowd to disperse to their homes.
No one wanted to listen to him.
"When I turned around, I was hit by a bullet in my left wrist", he told TIME magazine, standing on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who fired the shot, but says the bullet came from the side of the soldiers' lines.
"There was a crowd, there was a lot of gunfire", he adds.
Local resident Alfie Yoava was shot three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran up to him and examined his body to make sure it was him", Johannes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, told TIME magazine gloomily.
I saw him dead... I kissed him.
General Yotje Mende, the chief inspector of the Papua police, told reporters that his officers were only "protecting" their base because it was under attack.
"We have to defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us", said Papua Police Commissioner Pujo Sulistio in 2015.
It's a matter of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five young protesters were killed and many more were injured.
News of the murders did not reach Jakarta until the next day.
Three weeks later, Djokovic delivered a passionate speech in Jayapura, expressing his condolences to the families of the victims and vowing to address the issue of historical abuse of power in Papua.
"I want this situation to be resolved immediately so that it never happens again in the future", he said.
In October 2016, Minister of Security Viranto said he would establish a non-judicial organization to end historic human rights abuses.
But the excuses almost immediately.
Most of the violations happened a long time ago.
Some of them were in the '90s or early '00s.
The fact is that we certainly want to deal with these violations, but there are procedures that need to be followed", he said.
Viranto then retracted his words, speaking to TIME magazine on June 5 in Jakarta, and said he had no plans to set up an organization to handle complaints in Papua.
Instead, he said, "It's going to be decided by the court".
Viranto, who was accused by the United Nations of "crimes against humanity" in connection with the deaths of more than 1,000 people during the 1999 East Timorese independence vote, said 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled, including the incident in Paniay.
The families of the victims in Paniay greeted such statements with gloomy distrust.
"I was interrogated four times in the last three years, but nothing changed", says Johannes.
I'm tired of it.
He says he's still living in fear years later.
"I'm scared", he says.
I'm afraid I'll be arrested by the military, I'm afraid I'll be shot.
His brother, Jacobus, also expressed the opinion that the people of Paniay are afraid to discuss the incident.
He said he was beaten up by the military after he helped bury four victims.
"After we buried the bodies, the military came for me", he says.
The shooting didn't stop.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police opened fire on villagers in the neighbouring Deia district of Paniay.
A clash between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help take the man, who was unconscious, to hospital killed one person and injured 17 others, including children.
A man, Ravianus Dowe, 24, drowned while fishing in a nearby river, and died on the way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the building site office, which was owned by the company.
According to police, villagers threw stones at officers, who responded with warning shots.
But locals claim that a mobile brigade (Indonesian special forces) opened fire on the crowd and killed one person.
"We were so panicked, we were afraid of retaliation", 29-year-old Dominggu Badiya, who lives near the hospital and saw the rush of the wounded, told TIME magazine.
I've been hiding at home for two days.
The Deia parliament demanded that the officers involved in the incident be called to account and the mobile police brigade be withdrawn from the region.
Panyai has always been a pain in the ass for the Indonesian government.
The lack of significant development is a source of dissatisfaction among the Meye, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes scattered throughout the green areas of the central highlands of Papua.
Many have joined the Movement for a Free Papua (OPM), a rebel army that claims to protect the rights of Papuans by staging sporadic attacks and kidnapping raids on Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the senior OPM executives are from Paniay, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Judas Kogoya.
In response, thousands of people have been arrested and detained by the military in recent years in Paniay under the pretext of "protecting national independence".
Some never came back.
Among the people of Papua, Paniay is considered a "sad, forgotten place".
Poverty increases discontent.
A small portion of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for the locals.
Bread is just as unavailable.
People here grow everything they eat: mostly nuts, but also some fruits and leafy vegetables.
Agriculture is the work of women, each of whom can tend four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
They usually save most of the crop for the family, and the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten blue notes are worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, the economic inequality between the indigenous Papuans and the new migrants increased, who arrived in large numbers after the introduction of new flights to Nabire Airport.
The few available jobs are usually available to more educated and wealthy migrants.
Papuan people rarely have the money or the skills to run their own competitive businesses.
"Young people don't want to stay in the village... because there is no work or money", says John Gobai, chairman of the Paniay Tribal Council.
Isolation keeps Papua out of the eyes of the rest of the world.
In addition, restrictions on the work of international media remain severe.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudy and Basil Lonshan were deported from Papua for "insufficient coordination with relevant organizations" despite being granted rare permits to film.
According to Felima Keene, deputy Asia director at Human Rights Watch, promises made during Djokovic's election campaign to lift restrictions on media outlets to promote transparency and development have not been fulfilled.
"Now foreign journalists trying to report from the rebellious eastern provinces of Indonesia, Papua and West Papua, face new dangers: visa denials and blacklisting", he said in a statement.
The lack of press coverage means that international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely confined to Papua's immediate neighbors.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - appealed to the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the "varied and widespread violations" in Papua, including the shooting in Paniay.
The same countries have supported OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arramana Nasir dismissed the group's statement, telling reporters in Jakarta that Indonesia still has a democratic system and a free press, so it would be difficult to hide evidence of human rights abuses.
The locals want more foreign governments to pay attention to the situation.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Dutch ambassador for human rights, Kees Van Baer, visited Jayapura on May 4, the locals broke their silence, pleading: "We want freedom", according to a source who was also present at the meeting but wished to remain anonymous.
Indonesia is set to hold a new presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans say it is unlikely they will vote for Djokovic again.
"Jokovic is a well-meaning man, but he is surrounded by people involved in the shooting in Paniay", said Ghobhai, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Djokovic to know that the people of Paniay, in addition to living in the shadow of the greedy army, are mired in poverty, and their education and health care are in a miserable state.
Gobai says that the people of Paniay, like other Papuans, consider their vote for Djokovic a debt that he must pay.
"They don't want money, they just want justice", he says.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Panay shooting carried out a last symbolic act of disobedience: they buried the body of one of the victims on a plot of land directly opposite the police and military station.
Knowing that justice is unlikely to prevail, they will at least prevent the guilty from forgetting their crimes.
"They killed a member of our family", Jacobus says, without raising his head.
What else could we do?
Fire engulfs Dubai skyscraper for second time
A fire engulfed one of the world's tallest residential skyscrapers in Dubai on Friday, forcing hundreds of residents to rush out of the 79-story, 337-meter-high structure.
This is the second fire to hit the high-rise building, which is coincidentally called the Torch, in two years.
The building was evacuated, no casualties were reported, and there was no operational news on the cause of the fire.
We were asleep and woke up to the fire alarm and people screaming.
We ran down the stairs and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the fiftieth floor", a resident of the skyscraper named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Department, fire crews extinguished the fire at around 4:00 local time (00:00 GMT) and were cooling the building.
The government has said it is working to provide shelter for the victims.
The incident could bring back the issue of the safety of materials used in the exterior of tall buildings around the world.
An investigation by the Fakal administration after the fire there in 2015 found that the most damaged were the outer panels used for decoration and insulation.
In the United Kingdom, police said they believed the insulation system and cladding panels at Grenfell Tower in London may have accelerated the spread of the June fire that killed about 80 people.
Tourism growth in Ida-Viruma in June was minimal
According to data obtained by the correspondent of the portal rus.err.ee from the Department of Statistics, in June 2017, a total of 20,519 local and foreign tourists used the services of hotel enterprises in the Northeast, which is 125 people or 0.6% more than in the same period a year earlier.
The number of local tourists has decreased, while the number of foreigners has increased.
Thus, the foreign tourist flow increased in June by 7.3% (544 people) to 7994 tourists.
The number of local tourists decreased by 3.2% from 12 944 to 12 525.
The number of Russian tourists increased most noticeably in the region - by 8.9% or by 318 people compared to June 2016.
In June 2017, a total of 3885 guests from Russia stayed overnight in Ida-Virumaa hotels.
Andrei Malachov made it clear to the fans who was to blame for his departure
Andrei Malachov has hinted to his Instagram fans who is to blame for his departure from the "First" channel.
He has not commented on the rumors, but today he posted a piece of the August 1 article in Vedomosti.
Malachov signed the photo with the tag "boss milksucker".
The article is about how to prevent a worker from burning out and pay attention to his condition.
If you recall the numerous reports that the host could not find a common language with the newly arrived producer, who took up the re-format of "Let them talk", it becomes clear what he so transparently hinted at, writes "KP".
As reported, TV presenter Andrei Malachov is currently on vacation and has not signed a notice of dismissal from the First Channel.
The situation with the dismissal could clear up in the next few days.
Five soldiers killed in car explosion in Afghanistan
At least five soldiers were killed in an explosion in the Afghan province of Hilmend, RIA Novosti reports.
According to police, a car bomb exploded near a military checkpoint in Girisk County.
We know about 20 dead.
There was another emergency in Giriska on Friday morning.
Armed criminals attacked the currency exchange.
The gunfight between the attackers and security forces continues.
Dwyer caught a shark biting his camera.
Diver and researcher Greg Skomal has captured a video of a shark biting his GoPro action camera.
The video was posted on Facebook by the US Marine Fisheries Agency in Massachusetts, where Skomal is an employee.
The incident occurred on August 2 near the coast of the Cape Cod Peninsula in the northeast of the United States, the Necn portal clarifies.
A man attempted to capture a shark while underwater with a camera he held on a special stick.
When he spotted a man, an animal over three meters long swam toward him.
The shark began to bite the camera, but did not attempt to attack the scientist.
Comal explained that the predator did this to determine if the gadget was edible.
The researcher added that the shark could easily destroy the device.
He also noted that this behavior of a sea animal was new to scientists.
The cause of the mass fight in the Ural military center has been revealed
A working group of senior officers from the Central Military District arrived at the Yelansk Training Center, where the mass fight took place, to investigate the circumstances of the incident.
Some details of the scare have already been revealed.
According to the Mash publicist, who appeared on the page of "VKontakte", the contractors of the Ural military unit number 31612 fought violently over an unfueled bed.
It all started when a private named Sayan demonstrated his ignorance of an officer's order to fill up a sticking sheet.
The soldiers of the sixth company took the officer's side.
Sayana was supported by the First Company.
In half an hour, 140 young men smashed the beds and sinks in the barracks, smashed the windows.
More than ten people were injured in the mass fight.
The C.I.O. denied the knife-wielding.
A study found that at least one in five passengers in the United States brings illicit items on board.
The study found that more than 20 percent of airline passengers knowingly or accidentally carried prohibited items in their luggage on board the aircraft through U.S. Transportation Security Administration checkpoints, including at least 6 percent who boarded the plane with prohibited knives or other sharp objects.
Nearly 1 percent reported that they later discovered that they had accidentally carried a firearm, ammunition, or explosives.
A study of more than 1,000 people by charter company Stratos Jet Charters, Inc., also found that younger passengers were more likely to break the rules.
Of those respondents who admitted to knowingly trying to fly with something that was prohibited by the ATB, 19.7 percent were millennials compared to less than 15 percent of Gen X members.
Often, the A.T.B. staff deliberately passes by with food and water.
More than 3 percent admitted to carrying sharp objects through the examination, and 2.2 percent of female and 3.7 percent of male respondents admitted to knowingly carrying illicit drugs on board.
The company said it was studying passengers across the country to see how many of them accidentally smuggled through airport security, and how many did so knowingly.
It is to be expected that the most frequent smugglers, whether consciously or unconsciously, are those who fly the most.
As the company points out, the ATB rules are quite complex and confusing.
People often do not know exactly what fluids they can carry and how much.
So it's no surprise that most of what the ATB is collecting is illegal liquids.
A while back, people thought the ATB might consider you a book-carrying person.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, but not on international ones.
EPA chief Pruitt is refusing to delay Obama 's emissions reduction rules .
The day after the 15 states sued, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency reversed his decision to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's regulations designed to reduce emissions of air pollutants and smog.
Pruitt explained his decision by saying that his agency is now more responsive to the needs of state environmental regulators than it was under previous administrations.
He didn't mention a lawsuit against his previous position filed in federal appeals court.
The dispute revolved around the October 1 deadline by which states must ensure compliance with 2015 land-level ozone standards.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance for one year to give his department more time to study the plan and avoid "inconsistencies with local solutions or impediments to economic growth".
Pruitt, who was Oklahoma's attorney general before being appointed to his current post by President Trump, has long been known as a consistent opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
After moving to Washington, Pruitt repeatedly blocked or delayed the introduction of norms that were opposed by the chemical or gas-oil industries.
Wednesday's unexpected change in course is yet another legal defeat for the policy pursued by Puyt to return to normal.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA chief had overstepped his authority by trying to delay the implementation of the Obama administration's rule requiring oil and gas companies to track and reduce methane leaks.
In a statement released Wednesday night, Pruitt suggested that by dramatically changing course on ozone standards, he was merely fulfilling the EPA's obligation to cooperate with the states in the complex process of timely implementation of the new standards.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often failed to meet deadlines, then waited for lawsuits from activist groups and others and discussed deadlines during the settlement process", said Pruitt, who filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA in his previous role.
"We don't believe in regulating through litigation, and we take the deadlines seriously.
We also take our charter and the authority it gives us seriously".
However, the EPA statement said Pruitt could at some point again use its "deferral powers and other legally-given authority" to make sure the rules are "on the clear and on all available information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader overhaul of the ozone regulations.
The bill, approved by the House of Representatives last month, seeks to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules for at least eight years.
The Senate has not yet voted on this.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led the coalition of states that filed a lawsuit against the EPA this week, said the group intends to continue legal pressure.
"The EPA's change of course - after our lawsuits - is an important victory in the fight for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that covers their cities", Schneiderman said.
New York's lawsuit was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, as well as the District of Columbia.
Ozone at the earth's surface is produced when conventional pollutants from cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants, and other sources react with sunlight in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in susceptible people, leading to thousands of premature deaths each year.
Health and environmental advocates have welcomed Pruitt's unexpected change of course.
"It's hard to imagine the pressure it took to make this absolutely logical move from a person charged with protecting the air we breathe", said Lori Anne Bird of the Center for Biological Diversity.
"We must continue to resist the ideological campaign of the Trump administration and protect those who pollute the air and their special interests".
IAAF Congress extended suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Athletics
The Congress of the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) voted to extend the suspension of the All-Russian Federation of Athletics (WFA).
Congress thus backed the IAAF's VFLA Restoration Council, which issued a report on Monday recommending that the suspension remain in place.
166 people voted for the extension, 21 against, TASS reports.
The IAAF Council report stated that the VFLA had made substantial progress towards meeting the conditions set by the Council for the reinstatement of membership, but those conditions were not yet fully met.
Due to the disqualification of the VFLA at the World Championships in London, Russian athletes were forced to compete under a neutral flag.
The team included 19 people who were allowed to compete in the IAAF championships.
The VFLA was subject to indefinite disqualification by the IAAF in 2015.
Then, the report of the independent expert of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) Dick Pound was published, which spoke of numerous violations of the WADA regulations by Russian officials and athletes.
Read more about the IAAF's latest report in the "IAAF extended sanctions on the VFLA" article.
The offensive defeat
In the 3rd round of the Russian Football Championship, the team of the PFL, the new Moscow "Chemical" played a away match against the club "Kaluga".
A little over 10 days ago, the rivals played each other in the Russian Cup, but this time the game was completely different.
"Chemic" was not inferior to the opponent, but the second relaxation at the end of the match led to an offensive goal and a fiasco.
After the recent 0-3 defeat by the Kalugans, many predicted an easy victory for the hosts.
However, from the beginning of the meeting, the New Muscovites made themselves count and acted from the defense, but from the position of strength.
In the 1st half, the Kaluzans were more constructive and had the advantage in the possession of the ball.
Another very good match was held by Alexei Sirotin, who several times repelled dangerous blows and gave his actions to the partners confidence.
Unfortunately, the attack of "Khemika" lacked the effort and luck to put in a dead end defense of "Kaluga" and score the first goal on the way.
After the break, the game began to play on opposite courses.
The Novoskovs are more active in the attack.
The alarm bells for our team were the defensive errors that allowed the Kalugaans to create a series of sharp moments.
Ten minutes before the end of the meeting, the Chemical intercepted the territorial advantage and launched several dangerous attacks.
But the experience of the Kalugians played its part, they were more competent and cool-blooded in the end, waiting for their moment to take the gate.
After a dangerous attack, "Chemic" transferred the ball to the corner, which the owners of the field without resistance transferred to the gate.
The goal was scored by Yuri Dubrovin.
In the reporting meeting, "Chemic" showed a good game, but suffered an offensive defeat.
Our team is waiting for another outing - August 11 at 19 hours in Moscow at the stadium "Torpedo" named after Edward Streltsov, the newcomers will fight the favorite of the group "Center" of the FC "Ararat", in which Roman Pavlyuchenko, Marat Izmaylov, Igor Lebedenko, Alexey Rebko.
Come and support the Chemical!
The meeting place and time of the new-Moscow residents - 18:30 near the store "Magnolia" (Eastern, d.2, corporate.
The composition of the film is as follows: Sirotin, Manochin (k), Romashchenko, Shayunov, Khumutov, Gogya (Oreshkin), Dudaiti, Ryzhov, Svyatov, Belyanin (Adoev), Andreichenko (Lygin)
Press service of the club "Chemic"
According to the released transcripts of the phone calls, Trump pressured Mexico about paying for the border wall.
The Washington Post has published decrypted phone conversations between US President Donald Trump and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On January 27, during a telephone conversation with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump insisted that he stop publicly saying that he would not pay for the planned border wall.
The president of the United States berated him for speaking out against the wall, and according to leaked information, told him, "You can't tell the press".
Trump began his campaign with a promise to build a wall along the southern border of the United States and vowed to make Mexico pay for the project.
A published transcript of his first telephone conversation with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull also revealed a heated argument.
Trump told Turnbull that the agreement that the US should take refugees to Australia was "ridiculous", "disgusting" and "stupid", and insisted that the agreement made by the Obama administration would make him look like an idiot because he was going to stop resettling refugees in the US.
Trump ended the conversation by telling Turnbull that it was the most unpleasant conversation of the day.
The bodies of the tourists killed in Abkhazia were sent by plane from Sochi to St. Petersburg
The plane belonging to the airline "Russia", on which the bodies of the Russian women who died in Abkhazia are on board, flew at 20:15 Moscow time from Sochi to St. Petersburg, TASS reports.
At the final destination, the ship will be met by the staff of the ritual agency, as well as representatives of the city's mayor's office, said Deputy Minister for Resorts and Tourism of Abkhazia Astamir Akhba.
Earlier, the representatives of the republic's Emergency Ministry stated that all the expenses associated with the delivery of the bodies back to Russia were borne by the Abkhazian government.
In addition, the official Sukhum intends to pay compensation to the families of the victims in the amount of 500 thousand rubles.
According to Ahba, the Abkhazian government expressed readiness to pay the relatives of the tourists who died in the blasts for their travel and accommodation in the republic, but the relatives sent only a power of attorney to the local authorities to act in accordance with the established procedure.
On August 2, at about 16:20 Moscow time, in the village of Primorsky of the Gudaut district, two explosions occurred at the missile-artillery weapons warehouse of the Ministry of Defense of the republic, after which the large-caliber shells and other ammunition stored there began to detonate.
As a result, a fire broke out in the warehouse, which caused uncontrolled explosions of shells of various modifications.
Two Russian citizens - Elena Polyakova, born in 1970, and Elena Timofeeva, born in 1962, who were on vacation near a sulfur-hydrogen source, were killed in the accident.
64 people, including 35 citizens of the Russian Federation and 29 citizens of Abkhazia, with various degrees of severity were taken to medical institutions of the republic.
There are seven people in the hospital now, the rest are discharged.
A grand jury will study Russia 's influence on the US election
Special Prosecutor for Russia Robert Mueller has convened a grand jury in Washington to examine Russia's influence on the 2016 U.S. presidential election, The Wall Street Journal and Reuters reported.
A grand jury is a group of ordinary citizens who gather evidence of potential criminal wrongdoing and have the right to question witnesses under oath.
The special prosecutor will examine the evidence and decide whether it's enough to charge.
The grand jury's call gives Mueller additional authority to collect testimony.
One of the themes of the jury's investigation, which began a few weeks ago, will be the details of the meeting between the son of then-presidential candidate Donald Trump and Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya.
Mueller himself had promised to check the details of the June 2016 meeting.
They've been investigated by the FBI.
In late July, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. had expanded his legal team.
Trump Jr. had previously said that he had been waiting for a compromise on the Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton's campaign, but no disclosure documents were presented, and the issue was ultimately about adoption.
In early August, several media outlets reported that Trump Jr.'s statement about meeting with Ms. Veselnitskaya was literally dictated by Trump Sr.
The White House clarified that the president was not dictating anything, but simply using his authority, as any father would.
Penza 's Vice Mayor was detained at work
The Deputy Head of the Pension Administration Irina Shirshina was detained for 48 hours at her workplace by the Investigative Committee, reports RIA Novosti.
No official reports have yet been received from law enforcement authorities, but the press service of the SC Security Service has assured that they will follow soon.
Penza City Hall has yet to comment on the incident.
Irina Shirshina is one of the five deputy heads of the Penza administration.
She has been in charge of urban planning and land relations since April 2015.
Before that, she worked for a long time as the head of the department of the State Housing Construction Inspection in the Penza region.
Irina Shirshina has three minor children, and it is noteworthy that when she became a mother a year ago, she refused maternity leave and returned to work.
Of course, Mexico has no spaceport or launchers.
But there's the space agency, which was founded in 2010, and the desire to develop their own space program.
And the installation of Yuri Gagarin's bust is a tribute to the first man in space.
Unlike the Soviet-era monuments that are demolished in some countries, Gagarin's monuments, on the contrary, "walk the planet".
In 2012, a monument was erected in Houston, Texas, near the former NASA headquarters.
In London, a monument was erected on the grounds of the Royal Observatory to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the first flight into space.
There's a Gagarin monument in Erfurt, Germany, where our astronaut was in 1963.
The monument in Karlovny Vary (Czech Republic) was saved from demolition in 1992 due to public protests and was moved from the city center to the square in front of the local airport.
In the year of Gagarin's 70th birthday, a monument to Yuri Gagarin was erected in Riga.
That's how the first astronaut's name and surname sound in Latvian, and he looks like he's 70 years old.
Morse Ford Murder: Activists lose Lynch trials on stage to call for justice
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed the crowd in Monroe, Georgia, and roared toward the little Morse Ford Bridge.
As the car, carrying four black passengers and a white driver, approached the bridge, a group of white men with guns blocked its path.
The chief - a middle-aged man in a thin-striped suit - pulled out a cigar and looked through the windshield.
The people inside were trembling with fear.
"We need that nigger, Roger!" the man yelled.
"Get him out of the car!"
The loud shouts broke the silence as a young black man was pulled from the front seat.
Fortunately, this terrible scene that occurred on July 22 is only a staging.
But when the noose was thrown around Roger's neck, almost everyone in the audience actually held their breath.
Since 2005, activists have been returning to the Morse Ford Bridge to recreate the night in 1946 when the Doll Clan lynched two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and May Murray Dorsey.
No one's ever been convicted of these murders.
"It's amazing that no one has been arrested over the years - even though we see them around us; even though we know who they are", says Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize the production.
"It's a stain on our history and a stone on our souls".
Brooks, 71, is a former Georgia congressman who has spent his life fighting for human rights.
To him, the play is a dramatic call to action and an annual reminder to the people of Monroe that injustice has never been rectified.
"We want investigations, we want completions, we want healing, we want reconciliation, but first we have to get justice", he says.
"We cannot move on to healing and reconciliation until we achieve justice".
A coroner covering the body of one of the victims of the lynching at Morse Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI materials obtained by NBC News, more than 50 people in Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected of involvement in the lynching.
But no one was ever charged.
Although the suspects have been out for decades, human rights activists say the city has always been well aware of the two interconnected motives of the lynchings: politics and sex.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court decision allowed black citizens to vote for the first time in the primaries that were to be held that summer.
Around the same time as the election, the FBI reported that black exploiter Roger Malcolm stabbed Barnett Hester, a white landowner, in a fight, apparently over a woman.
Brooks says that, according to rumors circulating in the city, Hester had slept with Malcolm's wife Dorothy, and that the child she was about to have was not from her husband.
According to FBI reports, on July 25, 1946, Loy Harrison, a large white landowner, paid $600 in bail to free Malcolm from prison.
He went to prison with Dorothy and their cousins May Murray and George Dorsey.
But as they drove from the prison and approached the Morse Ford Bridge, a mob of lynchers surrounded the car.
"It turns out that Harrison organized and ordered the murders", concludes one FBI report.
"It is also clear that there was collusion between state and city law enforcement, "who not only participated in the killings, "but also destroyed evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses".
Brooks calls it short.
"It was an attempt on the voting rights", he says.
"They were all killed to send a message to the black people in this town that if you register and vote, you will be the same".
For almost a decade, Cassandra Green has directed the annual performance of the lynching at the Morse Ford Bridge.
Her performance is visual, it captivates the viewer and it tells the story of a deep-seated racism that many would like to believe is no longer in America.
It's hard to look at, and it's harder to turn away, but Green thinks that's the point.
"We don't want to talk about lynch trials because they show us our own ugliness", she says.
"But I can't build a relationship with you if you don't listen to me or hear what I've been through".
This year's rehearsal began in June, and on the first day, nearly 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black - gathered in the room to listen to a refined review of the play over the years.
Wade Marbo was the co-director with Green.
He's been a key member of the clan for a few years, but he says the role has never been easier.
"I feel like I'm dirty because that's not the person I am", says Marbo.
"But I think it's really important to remember this story, because we don't want to go back to that time".
In the room, actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play Roger Malcolm and Barnett Hester, reprise their roles.
The play begins with Malcolm, furious that Hester is sleeping with his wife Dorothy, screaming and pushing him.
"I said, nigga, get out of my house!"
Rascon shouts back.
The blow is coming.
And at the same moment, everyone (at least all the black actors) is getting a little bit of a scratch.
Green is the loudest laughing person.
"What is it?" Asks Ascona.
He's worried and embarrassed.
Am I playing too much?
"No", Green says through laughter.
"I just don't think white people used to say 'nigga' back then".
"Yeah, yeah", one of the black performers laughs.
"You have to get through the solid 'r.'"
And so the energy in the room changes: discomfort is replaced by a sense of companionship.
Everyone has to do the right thing, not just for the play, but for the memory of the four people who were killed.
The scene starts again.
This time, when Rascona says the word with the letter "n", it's clear and sharp.
No one is laughing.
The play ends violently and quickly.
Screams, shots, and then silence.
A woman in a mourning black dress stands over the bodies of the actors and sings the sad song "Strange Fruit" by Billy Holiday.
Her voice is interrupted by a word.
A hundred yards away, half a hundred spectators wipe their tears and sweat from their eyes.
There's almost equal numbers of black and white in the audience.
One couple came from Ithaca, New York, to see the show; many live right next door.
They all endured the heavy spirit of Georgia for nearly eight hours while Brooks led them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Until then, the murders were just history, but now that they're standing in the same place where the people were lynched, it seems like their ghosts are just floating in the air.
When the last note of the song is silenced, Green invites people to come closer and examine the bodies.
The children lean against their heads, touch the paint that represents blood and still bodies, and whisper something to each other.
"They're not really dead", murmurs one little boy, as if to remind himself.
A few minutes later, Green is thanking the audience, and suddenly it's over.
Actors throw the ropes off their necks and wipe away the tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbo, the man in the suit who played the head puppet master.
Nick Rascona hugs the other two actors and suddenly, crying, falls into their arms: the emotional load of the play finally falls on him.
"It's all right", whispers one of the women.
"We know you have a good heart.
You had your reasons".
Later, the audience sits down to dinner with the actors.
At one table, a white couple from Atlanta are discussing a play with a black couple they've just met.
Denise Daplinsky is struggling to find the words to describe how she feels after the performance.
"It's hard to hear these horrible, horrible words and actions... from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you", she says.
"After that, I think lynchings still happen", she adds, "only now it's called the police shooting".
In another corner of the room, the attention was drawn to Tyrone Brooks, who, over dinner, recalls his work as a human rights activist.
He says he's already started planning next year's show.
"The play inspires us because it not only describes the horror of what we have experienced but also teaches us", he says.
"Because if you don't learn from this, it could happen again.
Those who do not learn their history, who do not know their history, are doomed to repeat it".
The court fined Navalny for violations at the "Aggigation Saturday"
Moscow's Simonovsky court fined Alexei Navalny 300 thousand rubles for violating the order of organizing the rally.
The oppositionist was found guilty of committing an administrative offence, as provided for in part 8 of article 20.2 of the Code of Civil Procedure of the Russian Federation "Repeated violation of the order of organizing a rally".
Earlier, Judge Hızır Mussacaev of the Moscow Simonovsky Court finished examining the administrative case against Leonid Volkov - head of the staff of oppositionist Alexei Navalny, who was prosecuted under the same article as Navalny.
Volkov was found guilty and fined 300 thousand rubles.
Judge Musakaev estimated the amount of money spent on distributing leaflets at the "agitation Saturday" that Navalny's supporters held in Moscow on July 8-9.
After seeing the campaign materials, the police who were following the participants of the Saturday thought that the organizers of the event had deliberately hidden its true essence - a public action (for which it is necessary to request permission from the capital authorities).
Leonid Volkov and his lawyers Ivan Zhdanov and Alexander Pomazuyev requested the suspension of the administrative proceedings due to the absence of the composition of the offence and pointed out that the police had made certain mistakes in the drafting of the protocol.
At the "propaganda Saturday" itself, Volkov was not detained, but he received a summons obliging him to appear at the police station to tell about the event, held with his active participation.
Navalny himself and another of his colleagues, Nikolai Lyaskin, received similar summonses.
In Mordovia , the man who shot the bride and three wedding guests has been arrested .
A Mordovian court has arrested a local man who shot four people at a wedding, including the bride.
This was reported in the republican department of the Investigative Committee.
The incident happened on the evening of July 29.
During the fight, a 42-year-old resident of Saransk fired several shots at the guests of the event, who came to the village pond to swim.
Three women and one man were injured.
A criminal case was initiated under Article 213 (1) (a) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Huliganism"), Article 30 (3) and Article 105 (2) (a), (e), (i) and (iv) of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Attempted murder of two or more persons committed in a generally dangerous manner, with a criminal motive").
According to Interfax, local media reported that the man opened fire because the wedding guests decided to swim and passed through his plot to the water pond.
Energy Ministry toughened requirements for electricity turbines
The Russian Energy Ministry will update the rules for providing information to suppliers of critical equipment, in particular, turbines for power plants.
When gas turbines, GES turbines, oil-pumping and oil-producing facilities are commissioned, equipment suppliers will be required to share access data with the Energy Ministry and the Federal Service for Technical and Export Control.
The draft government resolution is ready for public discussion.
The new requirements will only apply to "critically important energy equipment" being supplied to Russia.
The document identifies potential threats as obtaining information and access to the facility by foreign intelligence agencies, criminal elements and structures, unscrupulous partners and hackers.
The EU has extended anti-Russian sanctions over Siemens
The press service of the European Union stated on August 4 that the anti-Russian sanctions were expanded because of the scandal surrounding the supply of Siemens turbines to Crimea.
This was previously reported by "Arguments of the Week".
The EU Council's press service said that sanctions against Russia were expanded because of the scandal with Siemens turbines, which were allegedly delivered to Crimea to circumvent sanctions.
Today, the Council of Europe is considering all possible complaints and proposals from member states to expand anti-Russian sanctions.
It was previously reported that the final decision would be made by the end of the day, and now the decision has been made, the sanctions against Russia have been expanded.
Pearson is cutting another 3,000 jobs and cutting dividends to get the business back on track.
On Friday, the British education group Pearson announced that it would cut another 3,000 jobs and cut its upfront dividends by 72 percent as it embarks on another restructuring program aimed at tackling the challenges facing its businesses.
These job cuts, which CEO John Fallon said would mostly occur in late 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to the 4,000 jobs cut in the previous restructuring.
Pearson announced plans to cut another £300 million ($394 million) in May in its third cost-cutting programme to try to revive businesses hit by the rapid shift to digital learning.
The company, which agreed last month to sell its stake in publisher Penguin Random House to its partner, the Bertelsmann Group, said its forecasts for the year remained unchanged after it announced a 1 percent increase in core product sales in the first half of the year to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldier killed by suicide bombing
According to official sources, a suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Afghanistan's capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others.
Five soldiers and a translator were wounded, according to a NATO statement.
According to unconfirmed local sources, three civilians were also killed in the incident in the city district of Karabakh.
The blast is the latest in a series of bloodshed that has hit Afghanistan this month, with more than 30 people killed in a mosque explosion in Herat on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people outside the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said the explosion, which occurred late Thursday, occurred when a joint convoy with the Afghan army was attacked with a man-portable improvised explosive device.
According to the report, all the wounded are in stable condition and receiving treatment at the U.S. military hospital at Bagram Airfield.
Correspondents report that the growing power of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Karabakh is a major source of concern for NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to UN reports, in the first half of 2017, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan, with about 20% of those in the capital.
In late July, a suicide car bombing killed at least 30 people in the Shi'a district of Kabul.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
On May 31, a powerful explosion in the city center killed more than 150 people - the deadliest terrorist attack in the country since the United States-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in 2001.
The violence highlights the precarious situation in Afghanistan as US President Donald Trump assesses whether to increase the number of US military forces providing assistance to troops and police in the country.
According to the correspondents, the terror attacks in Kabul that have taken place over the past weeks have also created a crisis of public confidence in the government, its policies, and especially the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
Environmental Protection Agency after court action to cancel air pollution law
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has reversed its decision to delay passage of an Obama-era law requiring states to limit air pollution emissions, a day after 15 states sued the agency for the move.
On Wednesday evening, the Environmental Protection Agency announced its decision to implement the so-called "Ozone Measurement 2015", stressing that the move shows the agency's willingness to cooperate with the states.
"We believe in dialogue with our partners in the states and in being responsive to them", Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruitt said in a statement.
In June, Pruitt announced the Environmental Protection Agency's intention to delay ozone measurements, which measure existing air pollution in different parts of the country to determine where it needs to be reduced to meet stricter air quality standards, for one year, until October 2018.
On Tuesday, a group of 15 states, mostly Democrats, along with the District of Columbia filed a lawsuit claiming that the intent was illegal.
The administration of President Donald Trump is trying to roll back a wide range of environmental protections introduced by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader program that Trump says is aimed at brilliant economic growth.
But this move has been opposed by Democrats and environmental groups, who are concerned about the potential health effects of large emissions.
The Environmental Protection Agency website says that using ozone-containing air to breathe "can impair lung function and exacerbate respiratory symptoms", such as asthma.
European business association opposes new anti-Russian sanctions
The European Business Association has expressed disagreement with the US economic sanctions against Russia.
According to the AEB, such measures could lead to a serious reduction in production and the number of jobs.
The AEB statement says that business is one of the important links between countries and people, so the principles of free trade cannot be restricted.
European business brings together more than 500 companies from the European Union and the European Free Trade Association.
The association calls on the heads of state and government of the EU, the USA and Russia to develop a new line of conduct that would separate business from politics and find a common, mutually acceptable solution in the spirit of peace and harmony.
Deputies ask police to restrict traffic on Pskov 's waterfront
Pskov people's deputies sent a request to the head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the city Sergey Surin about the problem of movement along the banks of the river Velika.
The deputies of the city council Konstantin Bolotin, Grigory Stronenkov and Valery Lesnikov believe that motorists prevent people from walking and resting in this place.
They think that the control of the drivers will help make the area more peaceful and safe.
The problem is, the trespassers ignore the "Pedestrian" signs and skate freely on the waterfront.
It turns out that the major renovation and improvement was done for nothing.
Sports and playgrounds are becoming uncomfortable because of cars.
According to the Pskov Information Agency, patrols of the central embankment are carried out by PPS motor patrol officers and troopers in the evening.
They reduce the number of cars, but they do not stop the traffic completely.
Putin demanded that the investigators not take the hard drives
Russian President Vladimir Putin proposed banning the investigation bodies from taking servers and hard drives from working computers at enterprises.
The head of state said this at the meeting on investment programs for the development of the Far East.
According to the president, it is necessary to "prevent the use of measures in the interests of the investigation that lead to the suspension of the activities of enterprises, including the removal of hard drives from working computers and servers".
Putin noted that if investigators have such a need, "it is enough to take copies, verify them and use them during the investigation".
The head of state added that it is impossible to "create conditions that prevent the continuation of the company's activities to the point of impossibility of paying taxes".
Olga Buzova told how much she wanted to call her ex-husband
TV presenter Olga Buzova admitted that she really wanted to call her ex-husband - football player Dmitry Tarasov.
The celebrity is currently in the United States, where she is dealing with labor issues.
Just the day before, Olga was in Las Vegas, and decided to post on Instagram.
She said she never married, did not get new tattoos, and did not name her ex-husband as having ruined her life, even though she wanted to.
Buzova said she'll remember the trip forever because she had a great time.
The British actor Robert Hardy has died .
British actor Robert Hardy, who played the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge in the Harry Potter film series, has died at the age of 92.
The Independent reported on Thursday.
The actor's relatives told me about his death.
They said he had "a tremendous life, having achieved success in film, theatre and television over a career spanning 70 years".
Hardy was born in 1925 in the English resort town of Cheltenham.
In 1959 he appeared with Laurence Olivier in the tragedy Coriolanus at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre.
Hardy is also remembered for his repeated portrayal of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, including in one of Agatha Christie's adaptations of Miss Marple.
For his portrayal of Churchill in the BBC television drama Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981), he was awarded the BAFTA Award for Best Actor.
Robert Hardy also had the opportunity to play the role of U.S. President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
Something rotten in the Danish state: Prince Henrik, actually Henri Marie Jean André, Count de Labord, refused to be buried with his crowned wife, Queen Margrethe.
This year, the couple is having a golden wedding, but the agenda is not preparations for the celebration, but a funeral feud.
His Highness refused the title of Prince Consort, and he swore to the Queen that she had never granted him the title of King Consort.
Henrik lives in France, although he remains officially the Queen's husband.
Russia 's Foreign Ministry urged Washington to stop harassing Moscow
The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted to statements by Mike Pence, who accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Balkans.
The Foreign Ministry issued a statement to that effect some time ago.
In its commentary, the Foreign Ministry pointed out that the United States is increasingly using Cold War stamps that are inadequate to modern reality.
In addition, Russian diplomats urged the American authorities to stop bullying the Russian Federation.
As "Arguments of the Week" reported the day before, US Vice President Mike Pence accused Moscow of trying to destabilize the Western Balkans and orchestrating a failed coup in Montenegro.
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time, there's talk of a possible decisive match
Vasily Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, who appear to be on the verge of hosting the most exciting boxing match in the 147 pound weight class in the near future, met for the first time on Thursday.
They occupied separate rooms in the offices of ESPN in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, walked down the hall to greet Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization's second lightweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former world champion in four weight categories, Erien Broner, both boxers are among the top five regardless of weight category on Saturday on Showtime.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?"
Good luck with that.
Lomachenko defends his belt in a match against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ESPN.
When the boxers posed for the photo, Lomachenko's manager Aegis Klimas noticed that the potential decisive fight between them would be at the very moment.
"I used to be a lightweight", Garcia recalled.
I've been up to the Bronner category, but I'm not that big.
I'm too short for 140.
I want to go down to the half-light.
And he needs to get to half-light, and then we'll have a fight.
That's what the fans want.
Let's get them on it.
Lomachenko has agreed.
Boxing needs this fight.
Klimas asked if the fight should be broadcast via PPV as part of a strategy he is pursuing for Lomachenko to make his 135th-weight debut later this year to schedule a meeting with Garcia (37-0, 30 knockouts) next summer, who is also interested in fighting the winner of the match between Jorge Linares and Luke Campbell after their lightweight championship fight at the Forum arena on September 23.
"The fight could be on PPV because all the fans asked for it", Garcia said, later expressing his willingness to fight on the channel that would offer the best financial terms.
We're the main names.
No other name will be as interesting.
As soon as they're ready...
Garcia said he thinks Lomachenko is a "great fighter" and might attend his fight on Saturday.
But Lomachenko didn't immediately pour his praise on Garcia and said that he thought the Riverside three-weight champion looked "too slow, sorry, Mikey... you were begging for a knockout".
Garcia said he was focused on showing the power of the punch, and then the boxing.
They both said they felt the tension build up before their own fight.
This fight has to happen.
No other fight has attracted so much interest and conversation.
I'm more than happy to work on it", Garcia said.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for one of the top boxers, and here he is, Mikey".
It's going to be a great fight.

Putin instructed the Prosecutor General 's Office to check the Baykal
Russian President Vladimir Putin instructed the Russian General Prosecutor's Office to conduct an inspection of the territory of Baikal for illegal and environmentally harmful activities.

In addition, the Russian leader asked to take measures if the facts of violations are revealed.
New results of tests to assess the age of asylum seekers in Sweden
The latest results of the tests of asylum seekers in Sweden, who were subjected to a new medical age assessment method, show that more than 80 percent of those tested were assessed as being over 18 years old, but not everyone trusts the accuracy of these results.
The Swedish National Agency for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started testing earlier this year.
They were designed to make the age assessment in the asylum process more accurate after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticized for failing to determine the true age of some refugees who claimed to be minors.
At the moment, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases for testing, and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of 2,481 tests for the period between mid-March and 31 July 2017.
Eighty percent (2002) of those tested were rated as 18 years of age or older, and in 25 other cases, the forensic medicine agency estimated that the test subject was "likely to be 18 years of age or older".
In 432 cases, the verdict was that the person was "probably less than 18".
Tests are only done when the person's age is in doubt.
Johan Göransson from the forensic medicine agency said the results were consistent with the results from the previous months.
"We don't see much difference from the statistics of the previous months, the numbers are quite consistent", he told the portal The Local.
The high proportion of cases where people were assessed as over 18 does not necessarily indicate that asylum seekers lied about their age.
In May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and reported that 442 cases were "likely to be 18 years or older".
However, after reviewing 581 published results, the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet found that in 243 cases the person openly stated that 18 of them were coming to fruition this year.
The method of medical age assessment, which consists of taking an x-ray of wisdom teeth and a CT scan of the knee joints and giving them to dentists and radiologists for analysis, has also drawn criticism from some authorities.
One of the skeptics is Claude Marcus, an endocrinologist at the Carolina Institute of Technology, whose work involves assessing people's biological maturity to determine whether they have gone through puberty earlier or later than usual.
I had reasons to think about it, and I don't think we should use the measurement methods that we use now.
Biological age is thus determined very inaccurate.
If we can't identify it with certainty, we shouldn't pretend we can", he told Metro.
However, Göranssen of the Forensic Medicine Agency spoke in favour of the accuracy of the tests: In general, the risk of mistaking a child for an adult is low.
The greatest risk we face is when a person is about to turn 18, in which case it's about 10 percent.
I'm thinking about running for president.
During a working trip to Buryatia, Vladimir Putin said he was ready to think about whether he would run for President of Russia in the 2018 elections, Interfax reports.
This statement was a response to a request from residents of Cheremushki village in Buryat region.
During a video conference on the burning of Buryatia and Irkutsk regions, the interlocutor addressed Putin with the words: "Vladimir Vladimirovich, we have a request for you: when the next presidential elections are held, we all ask you to run for this post again".
"Okay, I'll think about it, thank you", the president said.
On July 28, the press secretary of the Russian president Dmitry Peskov commented on the statements of some media that the presidential administration of Vladimir Putin will be headed by Anton Vaino.
Peskov called these assumptions "baseless, hypothetical reasoning".
"There are no headquarters yet, the creation of headquarters is far away, the election campaign is far away", Peskov said.
"As long as it's not on the agenda", said Peskov.
The governor of West Virginia has announced that he's switching parties.
West Virginia Governor Jim Justice of the Democratic Party announced Thursday at a rally with President Trump that he was switching parties.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have distanced themselves from me", said Justice.
"Today, I speak to you with much prayer and much reflection... today I say to you, the people of West Virginia, I can no longer be of any use to you as a Democratic governor.
The rally exploded with applause.
"So tomorrow I'm changing my registration to Republican", Justice added.
As coach, I'd tell you it's time to play differently.
Trump has previously promised to make a major announcement at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won in West Virginia with a 42 percent margin, and Justice did not support the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who Forbes says is the only billionaire in the state, was elected in 2016.
Forbes notes that he owns coal mines in five states, as he inherited the coal business from his father.
His fortune is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night that Governor Justice's transition is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is in the way of making our country great again rather than working to.
"With just 15 governors and the fewest state legislatures in history, Governor Justice's statement is just another rejection of a party that has no top-down leaders and is unable to find a positive, unifying message", Ronna McDaniel, the Republican National Committee's spokeswoman, told CBS News in a statement.
The cat-eater named Mr. Handsome found a home through social media.
The Pittsburgh nursery in North Carolina has built a cat named Mr. Pretty Boy, weighing over 40 pounds (14 kg) after he became famous through the Internet.
This is according to Mashable.
In late June, a photo of a cat was posted on the Facebook account of the nursery asking to find its owner because "it was obviously fed by someone before".
In comments, users noted that the expression of an animal's beak could become a new meme.
The publication has garnered more than 3,200 likes and 15,000 comments.
Dozens of people have expressed interest in taking Mr. Handsome in.
As a result, he was handed over to Angela Frazee, who promised to take care of his excess weight.
In an interview with WNCN radio, the American woman said she had a similar experience: She took home a cat weighing about 10 kilograms, and now it weighs a little over five.
In July, Reddit users noticed an unusually long-legged cat from Australia.
The post with the animal's photo has garnered over 68 thousand views.
Commentators noted that she could have made a career in the modeling business.
Koo praised Russia 's " sincere " apology over the doping scandal
International athletics expert Sebastian Coe on Thursday praised what he called Russia's sincere apology for the doping scandal, but reiterated that now is not the right time to allow the country to compete again.
Russian athletics federation representative Dmitry Shlyatin told the International Association of Athletics Federations congress, held on the eve of the world championship in athletics, that his country's exclusion from the sporting competition was fair and that he is determined to fight doping.
He apologized to all the athletes whose gold and silver medals were stolen.
Despite his comments, the International Association of Athletics Federations congress voted to keep the suspension imposed in November 2015 after the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) published a report on the evidence found of state-funded doping.
"I thought today's response, today's report was very sincere", the president of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Koh, told reporters.
The whole council and the whole congress liked that the Russian Federation itself admitted that it had been through extremely hot times and is now doing everything possible to see to it that the Federation is rebuilt.
Coe said he also liked that Russia agreed to the criteria for its recovery.
"I think it's been a very constructive day and we're moving forward, but Congress supports the recommendations of the special commission that now is not the time to restore Russia to rights", Coe said.
In the next few months, we must do everything we can to resolve this situation.
Our guiding principle was our desire to separate clean athletes from the tainted system", he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes, who meet the strict criteria of the International Association of Athletics Federations, will compete under a neutral flag at the world championship in athletics, which will begin on Friday in London.
The head of the special commission of the International Association of Athletics Federations, Rune Andersen, said Monday that Russia still has a number of requirements to meet to rebuild.
He told reporters in London after a report made to the International Association of Athletics Federations council that drug testing was still not being done on a sufficient scale, and the suspended coaches were still quietly doing their jobs.
The court arrested a Ukrainian journalist suspected of statecraft
The detained journalist Vasily Muravitsky was sent to prison for two months, the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) reports.
An employee of the online publication "Zhornal Zhytomyr" is suspected of treason by posting his publications on Russian websites and of encroaching on the territorial integrity of Ukraine.
Russia does not support the measures of the Ukrainian authorities against the journalist, considering it a "barbaric policy" against the media.
Two years after the peak of the migration crisis in Europe, Italy decided to embark on a limited military operation in the Mediterranean.
The commandant of the Borsini patrol boat entered Libyan waters to join the Libyan navy in stopping the flow of illegal migrants.
The decision to launch the operation was made by the Italian parliament on Wednesday.
Rome agreed with the internationally recognized government of Libya, which does not control most of the country.
The opposition cabinet and the Libyan parliament based in Tobruk accused Italy of violating Libya's sovereignty.
And the commander of the Libyan National Army, Field Marshal Haftar, ordered his subordinates to counter the Italian ships.
Rome, however, said it did not believe the threats and intended to send another warship into Libyan territorial waters.
The situation was discussed last week at talks between Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni and the head of Europe-recognized Libyan cabinet Faiz Saraj.
The Italian authorities set up a maritime mission to combat illegal migration after statistics were released in July on the number of illegal migrants who have sailed into the country from Libya: 95,000 since the beginning of the year.
The government has said that the resources for the reception of migrants are exhausted.

Two leaders of the Ukrainian athletics team suspended from World Cup
Olga Zemlyak and Olesya Povch, who specialize in running short distances, are excluded from the Ukrainian team for the 2017 World Championships in London.
This is reported on the website of the country 's Athletics Federation (FLAU).
The decision was made by the executive committee of the organization in connection with the initiation of disciplinary proceedings by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF) against female athletes.
The coach of the team, Sergei Basenko, was also excluded from the Ukrainian delegation.
According to Sportarena, the IAAF suspects the athlete of doping.
Povch is the bronze medalist of the 2012 Olympics and the 2011 World Championships, the 2010 European champion in the 4 by 100 meters relay, Zemlyak is the winner of the 2012 European championship in the 4 by 400 meters relay.
The World Championships in Athletics will be held in London from August 4 to 13.
How the financial rules of football will affect Neymar 's move to Paris
Rules aimed at preventing unlimited spending by European football clubs will not prevent the world record holder from transferring Neymar from Spanish Barcelona to French Paris Saint-Germain.
Whatever the consequences may be, they're coming down the chain for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, the governing body that oversees European football, whose authority is to ban teams from participating in the prestigious Champions League.
The UEFA financial fair play rules introduced in 2011 suggest that PSG will eventually have to prove that Neymar's transfer was financed without major losses.
Barcelona paid €222 million ($262 million) just to release the Brazilian from his contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will reach tens of millions of dollars a year.
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.
The S.H.I.E.L.D. could certainly use the luxury of hiring Neymar and adding him to the galaxy of other stars, given the team's funding from the energy-rich ruling family of Qatar.
Clubs are allowed to spend large sums on player acquisitions, but they have to balance them against legitimate sources of income to reach the threshold of profitability in their football business.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007.
A former French footballer believed that clubs that got into huge debts in their quest for success were, in fact, cheating and risking bankruptcy if the banks or owners stopped funding them.
In 2011, the FFP stopped focusing on club debts and switched to tracking their losses instead.
As a result of this change, the business model that Roman Abramovich initially used at Chelsea in 2003 - to buy a club with good potential and then spend heavily to improve the team and create a global brand - became a difficult plan to implement.
During the current three-year assessment period, which covers 2018, clubs could suffer losses of 30 million euros.
And despite Platini's disgraceful removal from the presidency in 2015, his successor at UEFA, Alexander Ceferin, is still determined to curb excessive spending.
Of course, the FFP is alive and we will be tightening the rules going forward", Andrea Traverso, who oversees the FFP at UEFA, told the Associated Press last week.
Although the PJS will pay the ransom for Neymar's contract at once, he can distribute this amount over the entire term of his contract for the purpose of reporting.
Neymar signed a five-year contract, so the transfer fee can be shown in the annual report as a cost of €44.4 million over the next five years.
During the first wave of sanctions by the FFP in 2014, severe sanctions were imposed on the FPS and Abu Dhabi-owned Manchester City.
PSG was fined 60 million euros (at that rate it was 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros, and was ordered to limit the composition of its team in the Champions League during the 2014-1015 season to 21 players instead of the usual 25.
UEFA is monitoring clubs that may try to outwit its financial inspections by inflating their income at the expense of companies linked to club owners.
Although a Qatari company could have sponsored PSJ, if the amount of funding was considered to exceed standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be considered as legitimate income.
That's exactly what happened in 2014, when UEFA ruled that the amount of funding for the PSJ from the Qatar Tourism Authority was inflated.
It was reported that part of Neymar's earnings at PSG could have come in the form of payments from the organising committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
But PSG and Qatar-2022 deny that Neymar will be a World Cup ambassador, and such a maneuver could easily be detected by UEFA inspectors.
Previous sanctions imposed on the PSJ mean that UEFA will be even more vigilant in monitoring any attempts to circumvent the rules.
As people familiar with the situation reported on Thursday, UEFA had not held preliminary discussions with PSG over Neymar's transfer.
They spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity, as they are not authorized to discuss the PJS situation.
According to the latest published report, in 2015-1016 PSЖ received more than 10 million euros of profit with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.
The report for the last financial year has not yet been published.
PSG expect Neymar's arrival to be a breeding ground for sponsorship deals, sales of team-logo t-shirts and attributes.
The club expects turnover to increase by at least 30 percent as a result of the new player.
Undoubtedly angry at the departure of one of the best players, the Spanish league tried to prevent Neymar's transfer, saying that PSG would violate the financial fair play.
"This is an obvious case of financial doping, with the club and the state", La Liga president Javier Tebas told the Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the fact that Qatar is the ultimate owner of the PSJ.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by the American sports tycoon, shares La Liga's doubts about the club's state funding.
"This is all the result of participation, and it has completely changed the landscape of football over the last fifteen years", Wenger said on Thursday.
When the club belongs to the country, anything is possible.
It becomes very difficult to comply with financial fair play, because the country can have many ways and many reasons to be represented by such a serious player.
The President will determine the place and the procedure for swearing the oath .
Where and how new Russian citizens will swear allegiance to the Russian Federation will be determined by the president - such amendments to the second reading of the relevant law were developed by the State Duma Committee on Legislation and State Construction.
A week ago, the lawmakers were planning to directly define the oath-taking procedure in the law.
Children under 18 years old, as well as those who are incapable of working, will be exempt from taking the oath, according to the revised text of amendments to the draft law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation" (at the disposal of "Izvestie"), which the committee will consider on July 11 before the second reading at its meeting.
The idea of introducing the oath of citizenship instead of formal signing of documents was supported by President Vladimir Putin on June 6 during a meeting with the speaker of the State Duma, Vyacheslav Volodin.
The lawmakers formulated this idea as an amendment to the second reading of the bill, which provides for the abolition of the decision to grant citizenship to those who were subsequently convicted of a number of terrorist or extremist crimes: for example, for public calls for terrorism or its public justification in the media or on the Internet (part 2 of article 205.2 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation), as well as for the theft of an aircraft, a train or a water transport, but only if this act is connected with terrorism (part 4 of article 211 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
According to the bill, the logic was this: when a person signs a citizenship document, he promises to abide by Russian law - and by taking the path of extremism, he violates that promise.
The draft law was introduced in April by the leaders of the Duma factions Vladimir Vasilyev ("United Russia"), Gennady Zyuganov (KPRF), Vladimir Zhirinovsky (LDPR), Sergey Mironov ("Justice Russia") and the speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
On May 19, the deputies adopted it in the first reading.
Last week, the State Department's Committee on Housing and Legislation approved the bill for a second reading, but now it's been reworked.
Now it says that the order of swearing-in will be set by the president of the Russian Federation.
Earlier, the parliamentarians were going to describe the procedure directly in the law "On citizenship of the Russian Federation", indicating that the ceremony should take place in a solemn setting before the state emblem and flag of Russia in the presence of the representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
However, the text of the bill did not make it clear where such an event should take place - the list of places where the coat of arms of the Russian Federation can be placed is regulated by the relevant federal constitutional law.
These include courts, the cabinets of heads of state authorities, municipal entities, judges, prosecutors, heads of federal executive authorities, etc.
It could have been the ZAP.
Those who wish to become Russian citizens will take the oath after the officials check their documents.
But a Russian passport will only be issued after the oath, according to the revised text.
A week ago, the draft said that the oath should precede the signing of the decree.
The updated text says that the Russian will be sworn in at 18, not 14.
The rule that incapacitated or disabled persons, as well as those unable to pronounce, read or sign the text of the oath, would be exempt from taking the oath was retained.
In addition, the President of the Russian Federation has the right to exempt "other persons" from this procedure,
The updated bill also stipulates a special procedure for accepting Ukrainian residents who are native speakers of Russian as Russian citizens.
They will have to formally renounce their Ukrainian citizenship by submitting a request to the authorized body of Ukraine.
A notarized copy of the application will need to be sent to Russian officials.
The renunciation of "foreign" citizenship, as now, will not be required if it is provided for by an international treaty or if it is impossible "for reasons beyond the individual's control".
The amendment was proposed by a group of deputies, among whom were the first vice-speaker of the State Duma Ivan Melnikov (KPRF), Natalia Poklonskaya, Pavel Kresheninikov and Airat Farakhov (all - "United Russia").
I think many of you know that getting a certificate from Ukraine is not real, it's just impossible.
Accordingly, many people are waiting for their fate to be decided on the basis of Russian citizenship, - explained the head of the Duma Committee on State Construction and Legislation, Pavel Kresheninnikov (ER).
In addition, the text clarified that the restrictions on foreigners' employment in certain positions would not apply to those who had written a waiver of "another" citizenship and had submitted their previous passport to the Russian Interior Ministry, but "for reasons not dependent on it" had not ceased to be considered a citizen of another country.
Now foreigners are forbidden to hold positions in municipal services, to be employed in facilities and organizations whose activities are connected with ensuring the security of Russia.
A person with dual citizenship or a residence permit from another country cannot become a state Duma member or a member of the Federation Council.
The law is scheduled to enter into force on 1 September 2017, with the necessary legislative acts ready by then.
Nostalgia becomes a niche in Hot American Summer and Detective Comedy.
The current iteration of the story nostalgically recalls both the glory days of the characters in the '80s; the grunge era in the '90s (around the time when the great masters David Wayne and Michael Showalter made the sketch comedy The State for MTV); and the year 2001 itself, before its stars like Elizabeth Banks, Paul Emil and Paul Rudd moved on to bigger things.
As a cultural fact, it is both the elevation and the embodiment of our age with its constant reminders from Facebook.
But as a franchise, it seems anachronistic.
"First Day of Camp" was surprisingly good, and not just because of the absurd humor (including the original story about a talking vegetable bank voiced by H. John Benjamin).
The result is double the main joke: middle-aged actors play sexually-obsessed children who have just reached adulthood; this makes the impossibility of returning to the main joke part of the joke.
Ten Years Later, where adults played adults, has less deep emotional roots, and its parody is more disorderly and incorporates riffs from 90s stalker films like Hands That Rocked the Cradle.
In one episode, the character gets an Apple Powerbook, a four-wheeled roller skater, and "a bunch of other stuff from 1991".
A lot of the plot moves are the same.
Good-natured Coop, now a writer, still hasn't gotten a reciprocation from Kathy.
Victor (Ken Marino) is still a virgin.
And then there's the crazy and vile conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (aka Showalter), which is now being instigated by George H.W. Bush (a tried-and-true parody of Michael Ian Blake).
As always, the best part of a franchise is the withdrawal.
It's especially fun to see the ever-young Rudd singing Matt Dillon's "Lonesome People" song, whose character, the former big man Andy, now looks old-fashioned.
The franchise could have been a success in the spirit of the recurring series "Seven Up", until it reached what I think would be its logical conclusion: "Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", where the entire company would have gone to the cinema for the premiere of "Hot American Summer" in the final scene.
"Comrade Detective" in the Amazon addresses another type of nostalgia: Cold War memories from "Americans", "Blood Blower", or even "Blink" with its images of the struggle of East and West.
This comedy, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with director Riz Thomas, depicts a TV movie: a Romanian police drama from the 1980s about two police officers in Bucharest fighting for truth, atheism and the Marxist-Leninist path.
The main roles - the life-seeing Gregor and the idealist Josef - are performed by Florin Piersik the younger and Cornelius Ulich, and their dialogues in English are voiced by Channing Tatum (the same executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
That's a brilliant idea.
But it's just an idea.
There are a few visual jokes (police spending time watching a chess match, as Americans might watch football).
The team of famous voices behind the scenes - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershal Ali and Chloe Sevigny - makes it interesting to play "guess the voice".
But Comrade Detective is so attached to the truth of the awkward propaganda drama -- there's even a killer in the Ronald Reagan mask -- that it often looks like it.
Six long episodes are long, and funny is not very often.
If it had been shorter, Comrade Detective could have handled its agitprop satire better; for example, every time Gregor and Joseph come to the American Embassy, there are two fat men sitting in the lobby, devouring a bunch of hamburgers.
To the imaginary communist viewer, this image tells us that Western culture is capable of making a food trap out of anything.
The Romanian filmmakers are not so wrong: we do this even with our own recent history, and with theirs as well.
The prize fund of the match for the Super Cup of Russia in football between "Sparta" and "Lokomotiv" will be about 30 million rubles.
This was announced by the president of the Russian Football Premier League (RFL) Sergei Prydkin at a press conference.
According to the head of the RFPL, the winner will receive 70% of this amount, reports RT.
He also added that by now the tickets for the match are almost gone.
The match between Spartak and Lokomotiv will be held on Friday, July 14 at 21:30.
As TASS notes, "Spartacus" is the current champion of the Russian Federation, and "Locomotive" is the owner of the Cup of the country.
Two young people cleaned up a 200-thousand-ruble furniture shop
A 37-year-old man from Ufa, who owns a furniture company, recently turned himself in to the police.
The man reported theft of expensive tools from the workshop, causing serious damage to his production.
The thieves were captured tools worth almost 200 thousand rubles: two welding apparatus, a perforator, a hydraulic, a lever.
The police began searching for the criminals and soon came upon the residents of the Blagoveshchny district of the Republic of Bashkortostan, friends 23 and 24 years old.
According to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the republic, the accomplices penetrated the territory of the enterprise, broke the entrance door and took out the tools.
Right after that, the guys sold the stolen equipment to the first car service they could find.
A case of theft has already been filed against them, and law enforcement has only been able to return some of the stolen tools to the rightful owner.
The State Department commented on Medvedev 's words about the relations between Russia and the United States
The United States and Russia must be able to work together.
This statement was made by official representative of the state department Heather Nauert in response to the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev about the relations of the two states.
Earlier, the head of the Russian government said that by adopting new anti-Russian sanctions, the US had ended the hope of improving bilateral relations and declared a full-fledged trade war against Russia.
Commenting on the remarks, Nauert acknowledged that Russian-American relations were at a "low level", but noted that "areas for cooperation" needed to be sought.
"Look at the ceasefire in southwestern Syria, which has been in place for almost a month".
"This is an example of good cooperation between the United States and Russia", the diplomat quoted RIA Novosti.
The foreign ministry's spokeswoman declined to comment on the Russian prime minister's statement that sanctions amount to a trade war.
A bill to impose new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea was signed by U.S. President Donald Trump last Wednesday.
He admitted that the document was a failure and contradicted the U.S. Constitution.
Dior grew roses from amethyst and quartz
The jewelry division of the French fashion house Dior - Dior Joaillerie - has completed the collections of Rose Dior Bagatelle and Bois de Rose.
They have five new rings and three velvet ribbon necklaces.
The Rose Dior Pré Catelan line features two new rings and a pendant made of amethyst, rose quartz and diamonds, executed in gliptic technique (hand-carved stone) and pavilion and dedicated to the 70th anniversary of the house.
The head of Dior Joaillerie, Victoire de Castellane, was inspired by the roses grown at his Granville estate by the fashion designer Christian Dior, and by the gardens of Paris, Bagatel and Pre-Catalan.
Trump found the culprits in Russia 's deterioration
US President Donald Trump has issued a sharp criticism of members of Congress.
According to the American leader, their actions led to a deterioration of relations with Russia.
Our relations with Russia are at an all-time low and dangerous.
"Thank you to Congress, these same people can't even give us medicine", the president tweeted.
On the eve of the election, Donald Trump signed a bill to impose new sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea.
They will, in particular, affect Russian banks and energy companies.
The White House later released a statement from the president, in which he indicated that the law would prevent the United States from making profitable deals and would further bring Russia, China and North Korea closer together.
Belarusian entrepreneur refuses to buy Ukrainian subsidiary of Sberbank
Belarusian entrepreneur Viktor Prokopen has withdrawn an application from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) to buy a subsidiary of Sberbank.
The businessman explained his decision to RBC as his intention to "concentrate on our other planned investments and projects we are working on".
According to Mr. Prokopeni, this step would be "the best investment of time", despite the investment attractiveness of buying a subsidiary of Sberbank.
Mr. Procopenia became the main contender for the purchase of the Russian bank's unit in Ukraine after the NBU rejected the request of the NorvikBank consortium of Grigory Guselikov and the Belarusian company of Said Gutseriyev in July.
Russian banks began to leave the Ukrainian market after President Petro Poroshenko imposed sanctions on their subsidiaries in March.
One of these financial institutions - besides VTB and Vnesheconombank - was Sberbank.
Novak named the cause of the blackout in Crimea
The Russian Energy Ministry has named the cause of the blackout in Crimea.
The head of the department Alexander Novak gave explanations about what happened.
According to him, the peninsula was left without electricity due to a road traffic accident in the territory of the Krasnodar Territory.
The truck involved in the accident damaged the power line, which resulted in the disconnection of the Kuban and related Crimean networks.
Power outages in major Crimean cities were recorded last week.
The experts fixed the problems within hours.
Initial reports suggested that the blackout was caused by abnormal heat.
Bank of England to keep interest rates at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will not change after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have put an end to rumors of a possible increase.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would remain sluggish, and left interest rates unchanged amid growing pressure on household incomes.
The bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted 6-2 to keep rates at 0.25%, with fewer committee members in favour of raising rates this month because weak economic growth has weakened support for raising rates.
In its quarterly inflation report, the bank limited its forecasts to a rise of 1.7% percent in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on household incomes would continue, while inflation was still expected to rise to around 3% in the fall.
However, the bank warned that rate hikes in the next few years would be necessary to control Brexit-induced inflation, and said it was likely that borrowing costs would have to be raised more than expected in financial markets.
The committee also voted to abandon part of the massive economic development package launched a year ago as a result of Brexit.
Starting next February, the bank will close its emergency financing plan, which provides banks with cheap loans, although it has said it will now provide another £15 billion to £115 billion under the plan.
In the minutes of the decision on the rates, the bank said: According to the MPC's main forecasts, gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the near term remains slow, while pressure on household real incomes continues to affect consumption.
On the question of rates, he reiterated that in order to halt inflation, "some tightening of fiscal policy" would be needed, "somewhat more" than the markets expected.
At the moment, the markets are predicting a first rise in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020.
But the bank stressed that all increases would be "gradual" and "limited".
The bank's forecast for growth this year and next is lower than the forecasts made in May, which were equal to 1.9% and 1.7%.
The bank has kept its forecast of 1.8% unchanged for 2018.
After this news, the pound fell against the dollar and the euro.
The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.
The decision not to change the rate was made after recent disappointing growth weakened the rising expectation of a rise; GDP then grew by 0.3% in the second quarter against 0.2% in the previous three months.
According to the bank's representative, growth is likely to remain at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will start to increase slightly at the end of the year.
The bank's latest inflation report gave little reason to rejoice to households hit by high inflation and very slight wage increases: the bank said the pressure would intensify before it decreased.
The bank added that financial policy "cannot prevent" a rise in earnings over the next few years, but expects wages to "significantly" recover by the end of its three-year forecast.
The economy is also set to grow as a result of rising demand for British goods, driven by the low pound rate, which is offsetting some of the lower consumer spending.
The decision came a year after rates were cut to 0.25% last August following the shocking results of the referendum on leaving the European Union, which caused the pound to fall.
The bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully impact prices and the economy.
Before the bank made its final decision on rates, the rumor of a proposed rate hike was growing as inflation was increasingly pressuring the already heavily pressured households: three members of the expert committee asked to raise rates to 0.5% in July.
Inflation fell to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in July, although the bank said the drop was expected and will be offset in the coming months.
The higher rate of 2% compared to the planned rate is entirely the result of the pound's low exchange rate, according to the bank.
Andrew Montlake, director of Corec Mortgage Brokers, said: "Given the recent drop in swap rates, it looks like the mortgage market will once again become even more competitive as lenders demand business opportunities and look forward to a good year-end.
The market looks particularly favourable for those approaching the end of their existing contracts, as refinancing loans, often with the possibility of no commission and low interest rates, is becoming more popular than ever.
State health service will prescribe controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
Starting in September, patients will have access to the "revolutionary" HIV prevention drug after a high court battle over funding for the drug from the National Health Service.
England's National Health Service announced that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a pill taken before sex that has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in those at risk, on average, by 86 percent, will now be provided by the health service for an initial three-year trial period of approximately 10,000 people.
She agreed to fund the trial after an appeals court upheld a High Court ruling last year that the National Health Service had the ability to pay for the PRE despite her claims that it should be funded by local authorities.
The move, announced on Thursday, was called a "major innovation" by Simon Stevens, president of England's National Health Service, and the National AIDS Administration (NAT) called it a "turning point".
Before the programme is fully rolled out across England by April 2018, venereal dispensaries in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to register people, with even more dispensaries joining the programme in October.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PREP)  is a course of HIV medications taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Studies have shown that PREP significantly reduces the risk of HIV infection among people at risk.
When you take PrEP before sex, there's enough of certain drugs in your body to prevent you from getting HIV.
These medications can be taken daily or no later than two hours before sex.
Patients eligible for the drug include gay and bisexual men, transgender people, and people whose partners are HIV-positive and are not receiving successful treatment.
Dispensaries will select suitable participants who have agreed to participate in the study, including men, women, transgender people and those whose partners are not known to have been cured of HIV by antiretroviral therapy.
People living and registered with a general practitioner in England may also apply for potential participation at the nearest participating venereology clinic.
The programme will cost £10 million, and the NHS in England has signed a contract to supply the drug this week following an international tender.
The study is designed to evaluate all the potential of PREP by collecting clinical data on the target audience, its absorption and its widespread use.
This important innovation should complement and reinforce the large-scale and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.
This is another milestone in more than three decades of success in the fight against one of the greatest health threats facing humanity.
Deborah Gold, president of NAT (National AIDS Control Office), said: "This is a watershed moment in the fight against HIV.
PR, if properly targeted at people in need and at risk, has the potential to change the HIV epidemic in England.
Starting in September, people at risk for HIV, thanks to this study, funded by the National Health Service in England, will have access to a new, innovative tool that they can control themselves without having to discuss it with their partner, and that will improve many, many lives.
We warmly welcome this news.
Jan Green, president of the Terrence Higgins Foundation, said: "The first priority now is to make sure that the trial is rapidly rolled out nationwide, and that no one at risk for HIV is left behind.
Now that we have the experimental PrEP drug, we're moving on to protecting the more than 10,000 people at risk for HIV.
Shadow Public Health Minister Sharon Hodgson said: "We are very pleased with the start of the PREP trial, which has been delayed by months of delays and delays from the government".
The data demonstrates how revolutionary this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and stopping the transmission of this fatal infection.
This test will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PREP.
It is now important that the trial be rolled out nationwide as soon as possible to protect those at risk for HIV and to take us one step closer to stopping the spread of HIV in society.
World Congress of Tatars adopted resolution on supporting the Treaty of Tatarstan and Russia
The sixth congress of the World Congress of Tatars (WCC) adopted a resolution, in which it was noted the importance of preserving the office of the president in Tatarstan.
According to the document, the post is "a form of organization of the highest state power in the republic that has been positively documented and expresses the national interests of the entire Tatar people".
In addition, the congress stressed in the resolution the importance of the treaty on the separation of powers between Russia and Tatarstan.
According to the document, he "played a positive role in the ethno-cultural, social-economic and social-political development of Tatarstan and the Russian Federation as a whole".
Recall that the treaty between Moscow and Kazan was signed for 10 years, which was in force since July 24, 2007.
On July 11, the deputies of the State Council of Tatarstan appealed to the Russian president with a request to extend the agreement and to keep the name of the post of the head of the region.
Now Tatarstan is the only federation subject that has a treaty with Russia.
The head of the region is the only one whose position is called "president".
In Russia , difficulties arose in obtaining international driving licenses
The D.I.T.D. units are experiencing a shortage of international driver 's licenses .
To obtain such a permit, you have to wait in line for several weeks, which has become a real problem for holidaymakers who want to go on holiday abroad in their car or rent it there.
It should be noted that the situation with international driving licences remains controversial.
The MIA was introduced to make it easier for foreign police to understand what is written in the national identity card, as the information is explained in five languages.
International rights are enshrined in the 1968 Vienna Convention on Road Traffic, but in countries that have ratified the Vienna Convention, Russian rights are recognized as such.
However, in practice, it all depends on the specific police or rental agency: some require the MIA, and some have enough national rights.
To be insured, drivers still get international licenses, but it should be borne in mind that in countries that have not ratified the convention (for example, the United States, Spain, Mexico, Indonesia) the authorities have the right not to recognize either national rights or the Internal Affairs Office.
The problem with the forms is now observed in almost all the subdivisions of the GIDD, according to Kommersant, which conducted a study in several regions.
For example, in Moscow, the UGIDD units simply do not issue tickets, the blanks have been missing for four months.
You can book your appointment on the government website, but the line is already up until mid-August.
In Krasnoyarsk, it is impossible to get an MIA "for technical reasons", without going into detail, in the Samara region they honestly say that there are no blanks, the same situation is developing in other cities.
Many Muscovites have already faced the problem, and the following messages are increasingly appearing on social networks:
Irina Burmistrova: "Guess why Moscow is not allowed to get international rights?"
Right, because all the I.R.D. departments are out of forms.
Elena Podkolzina: "A question for people who know!"
We need to get international rights very urgently.
In Moscow, the time is always ahead, the place is not issued at all (button is there, but the ticket can not give).
Apparently the civil service portal shows that the SPB has a spare time to spare.
Has anyone tried to get in another city?
Will it work?
As explained in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation, the requirements for the international driver's license have changed, so the subdivisions of the State Auto Inspection are being delivered new forms.
This may be the reason for the deficit, although it is not clear what changes are involved, as this has not been reported before.
The blanks are purchased by the Road Traffic Safety Special Purpose Center (TSPC) of the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs and then delivered to the traffic police units.
In recent years, all contracts were concluded with "Goznak" JSC: in 2014-2015 almost 200 thousand blankets of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were made, in 2016 15 thousand blankets were purchased, in 2017 - 90 thousand, but the last contract was concluded on July 18 with the "First Printing House" LLC for the manufacture of 70 thousand blankets.
There is a version that the CSN simply did not have time to hold the tender in time, which caused the deficit.
However, there are other versions of the shortage of forms: because of the crisis, many people have started to travel on their own, not to Europe, but to cheaper Asian countries - China, Thailand, and so on.
It's not clear what kind of rights are being taken over there, so people are reinsuring, and so there's a heated demand for international "steps".
It has recently become known that professional drivers will have to pass an exam to confirm their qualifications.
The Transport Ministry made this suggestion.
The new international driving licence (IDC) is valid since 31 May 2011.
Ukraine 's Justice Minister refuses to believe in the construction of the Crimean Bridge
Ukraine's Justice Minister Pavel Petrenko said he doesn't believe Russia can build a bridge in Crimea.
He said this on Friday, August 4, in an interview with the portal "Observer".
No self-respecting international company would put a pin or a pin in there, because it risks losing its business in the EU, the US, Japan - in countries that have joined the sanctions against Russia over Crimea.
"I am deeply convinced that this project has no prospects", Petrenko said.
He added that he believes Russia is incapable of implementing a large infrastructure project on its own.
Russia can't build smaller facilities.
I know that after the Sochi Olympics, they've already started to destroy stadiums.
"So I think the best tool in this situation is sanctions against companies that have been so shortsighted as to join this project", the official noted.
On July 31, the builders completed the construction of the Crimean Bridge's automobile arch.
On the Kershaw shore, the enlargement of the Crimean Bridge's road arch has been completed: its vault will be locked at a height of 45 meters from the base of the structure.
"At the same time, bridge builders have prepared a railway arch for installation on the farwer pillars", the project's information center said.
In April, Transportation Minister Maxim Sokolov informed Russian President Vladimir Putin that the construction of the facility was ahead of schedule.
The Crimean bridge will connect the Crimean Peninsula and the Krasnodar Territory.
Spain fired an official who had not been to work for 10 years
What angelic patience (or total indifference to public service) was required of the Spanish official's superior, Carlos Resío?
The permanent absence extended for 10 long years.
Mr. Rasio was fired, though.
But not your immediate superior.
Which is not the case in the bureaucratic world.
The locals seem to have long been accustomed to all the tricks of the "people's servants".
Yet, officials consistently manage to surprise those whose taxes they live off.
This time, the sensation came from Spain.
There, Valencia archivist Carles Rescio managed to avoid work for a decade.
He was paid regularly.
And the whole thing is 50 thousand euros a year.
And now Mr. Rasio's "wonderful days" are over.
He was dismissed by the legislature of Valencia.
Investigation revealed that the angry stranger came to the office every weekday morning at 07:00 to log in.
And he went home right away.
He would show up at work again at 4:00 to mark it again in the system that he was gone.
It's been 10 years.
It was also revealed that the stroller spent all his free time drawing comics at home.
Now the deputies of the Valencia Legislative Assembly are thinking of how to punish Mr. Resio's immediate boss, who could not but know how to "actively work" in his workplace under his authority.
Judges are being offered protection from the chairmen .
The Presidential Council on Human Rights (PCHR) on the instructions of Vladimir Putin developed proposals to strengthen the independence of the judicial branch of government.
The ECHR proposes to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts and to introduce their electability.
For the courts of appeal and cassation instances, the ECHR wants to introduce special districts that will not be tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Supreme Court must also submit its proposals within the framework of the presidential mandate.
The ECHR has completed the development of proposals that will strengthen the independence of the Russian justice system.
The SPH carried out this work on the instructions of Vladimir Putin dated January 3, 2017, which the president gave after meeting with the members of the council.
At the meeting with the members of the council on 8 December 2016, some cases of arbitrary judgments, as well as the problems of public control in places of detention of citizens were discussed (see "Ъ" of 9 December).
The ECHR's work resulted in 25 proposals, which addressed issues of ensuring the independence of judges and identifying judicial errors, as well as financing courts and legal education.
One of the ideas of the Kremlin's human rights defenders is to limit the powers of the presidents of the courts to increase the independence of the other judges.
If the candidate for the position of judge has successfully passed the competition and has received the support of the judicial community, then the chairman of the court, in the opinion of the ECJ, should nominate him for appointment, without having the right to refuse, as the law now allows.
It is also proposed to deprive the chairman of the right to divide cases between judges.
Experts suggest that a specially written computer program may be able to do this.
The Supreme Court also held that the chairman is not entitled to "predetermine the results of the judge's qualification, initiate his disciplinary action, or make decisions on additional material payments".
The presidential council believes it is necessary to move to "electing the presidents of the courts by the judges themselves" and "to give them their powers for a relatively short period with mandatory rotation".
Now all the judges (from the republican to the district) are appointed for six years by the president on the proposal of the chairman of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.
To protect judges from the pressure of regional administrations, the ECHR proposes to reorganise appeals and cassation in courts of general jurisdiction.
Now their structure is tied to the administrative-territorial division in the Russian Federation.
The Special Special Court says that "it is necessary to ensure the organization of separate courts of appeal and cassation instances not at the level of regional judicial bodies in the subjects of the Russian Federation, but in judicial districts".
Experts are guided by the practice of arbitration courts.
They have "court districts" that do not coincide with the administrative division in the Russian Federation, but which guarantee greater independence from regional officials, who have difficulty using the "telephone law".
The ECHR proposes to strengthen the world's judges with people's judges to consider some "categories of civil and administrative cases".
For example, deprivation of parental rights, reinstatement at work, protection of honour and dignity, deprivation of driving licence, etc.
"These are just our proposals", explained to "Ъ" the member of the Supreme Court, retired judge of the Constitutional Court Tamara Morshakov.
She also recalled that the President's instruction did not only apply to the Supreme Court, but also to the Supreme Court (SJ), which has not yet disclosed its proposals.
The time for the implementation of the order is still available to the Armed Forces (among the co-executives - the Prosecutor General's Office and the Russian Commissioner for Human Rights).
Vyacheslav Lebedev, the chairman of the Supreme Court, has until September 1 to report to Vladimir Putin on how effectively the independence of justice is being ensured in the Russian Federation.
Living high: the half-floor and the ingenious design techniques have turned this little apartment in Earls Court into a spacious home.
Joan Lee, a former banker with a passion for real estate, moved from a spacious house in Knightsbridge to an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
The apartment is on the ground floor of a nice Queen Anne style house, and the fact that Joan hasn't packed her things and moved again is a good sign of the new design.
"I used to live with my ex in Knightsbridge on a much larger plot", Joan recalls.
I was looking for something comparable for my money.
They showed me this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.
I fell in love with her and offered the price the same day.
Since the first inspection, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
Originally it was a one-bedroom apartment with a complex layout - to get into the bedroom, you had to go through the kitchen - and Joanna wanted to add storage space and a basement to maximize the use of the generous height of the ceilings.
I wanted high ceilings, big windows, lots of light.
"That was my demand", she says.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill-based architectural design studio Duck & Shed to use the 12.5 foot ceilings and create a home that would not only be a successful project but also be suitable for Joan to live in.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate the two rooms one above the other, so the architectural task was to create a half-floor where one could stand tall.
Erfan had to think creatively to handle the brief.
"Working with steel structures is very difficult", he explains.
We needed to place the rooms so that they were on top of each other and didn't have to bend.
The idea was not to build a simple platform, but to bend the structures so that they were at the right height and allowed the use of the rooms above and below.
This solution allowed Erfan to arrange two full-sized rooms one above the other in the allocated space  and many other interesting things.
From the ground floor, through the copper windows of the Retrouvius, a view is available of the luxurious living room below.
The mirrored gold-finished furniture, silver accents and vintage lighting fixtures from Serge Muya set the style of the project.
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding spectacle, space, and light.
The short corridor is framed with mirrors to make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the mirrored guard panel looks like a window to another room.
The mirror cabinets at the entrance are used to store all Joan's dishes.
To create a more luxurious feel, the beauty of the living room can be a wall around the kitchen when it's not being used.
There's nothing new about folding kitchens.
The uniqueness of this kitchen is that it's a sliding door, like a garage.
"Here engineering was involved", Erfan says of the steel-armored wooden-fiber shield door.
It's got a counterweight, so when you push the door up, it slides very easily.
By using space and storage space wisely, Joan gained an additional 50 square feet [16 sq m], an additional bedroom, and improved layout.
"After all, floor space is what you're going to sell, that is, what your property is valued on", Erfan says.
Roughly speaking, a real estate agent will come in and do the calculations based on floor area.
Here they were able to increase the floor area by using high-quality materials that give the space a luxurious touch.
"Materials are things we touch, so they help us to create an emotional connection with the home", says Erfan.
Nobody falls in love with the wiring in the walls.
It's important, but it doesn't touch the strings of our hearts.
This is a testament to how, with good design and increased footprint, an apartment can go from being ordinary to being amazing.
In fact, like Joan, you may choose to stay.
The government approved the creation of a commission on cultural policy
The Russian government approved the creation of a commission on state cultural policy.
The relevant decree is published on the government website.
According to the document, the main task of the commission will be to develop and adjust strategic approaches to the implementation of cultural policy.
The Commission will also develop draft strategies for cultural policy, clarify the objectives and prepare new programmes for its implementation.
The head of the commission is appointed by the Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian Federation.
The commission will be approved separately.
In 2016, Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev approved the implementation plan of the state cultural policy strategy until 2030.
The plan includes 193 events and provides measures to expand the influence of Russian culture in other countries, to preserve the single cultural space and cultural heritage, and to create conditions for the development of culture in the country.
Inflation in G20 countries down to eight-year low
Consumer price growth in the G20 countries has fallen to its lowest level in eight years, reports The Wall Street Journal, citing data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
The OECD estimates that inflation in June 2016 was 2%, with lower rates in October 2009 when the price index rose to 1.7%.
Earlier, the Rosstat reported a decline in the consumer price index in Russia by 0.1%.
Thus, the agency recorded the first weekly deflation in 2017.
The inflation target in Russia, according to the calculations of the Ministry of Finance, is 4.1%.
The Ministry of Economy, however, believes that the target value has already been reached - according to the department, the figure is 4%.
Putin warned against illegal logging of the Baikal taiga
Russian leader Vladimir Putin warned against illegal destruction of forests during a meeting on the environmental development of the natural Baikal territory.
During the event, Minister of Natural Resources Sergey Donsky noted that a draft law had been prepared earlier.
It allows logging during fire fighting, and the government plans to adopt it as early as the fall.
In turn, the president said that this project should be monitored so that in the process of cutting "not everything is cut off".
Donsky noted that this bill implies control by the Ministry of Emergency Situations and supervisory agencies.
Media: Forces of the Armed Forces secretly negotiate with Donbass militias
There is a regular telephone line in the Donbass.
The combatants on opposing sides are constantly communicating with each other on mobile phones, and the headquarters are not aware of this communication.
The Donbass militia and the Russian Armed Forces have been communicating on cell phones, secretly from their high command.
This is reported by "Straina.ua" on August 4 with reference to the participants of the military operation in Donbass.
According to the publication, the commanders of the units know the names of their colleagues on the opposite side of the front and communicate with them daily by phone.
Communication is not routine at all: the commanders are trying to reach some "tactical agreements".
Often, such talks result in a truce at a specific point on the front.
Journalists became aware of cases when birthday greetings were received by a certain officer from outside the front line, from his formal enemy.
The armed forces and the DPR and LPR militias have been in the trenches on the border line since spring 2014, when Ukraine began its military operation against Donbass.
Foreign Ministry outraged by UN Security Council 's blocking of statements on attacks on Russian embassy
The Russian Foreign Ministry is outraged by the actions of some Western diplomatic representatives who block UN Security Council statements in the press condemning the terrorist shelling of the Russian Embassy in Syria.
This is reported by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
The ministry recalled that the territory of the Russian Embassy in Damascus on August 2 was fired upon by the terrorists of the "Heyat Tahrir Ash-Sham" (formerly "Jabhat al-Nusra", banned in Russia) and "Faylak Ar-Rahman" groups for the third time in a month.
Taking into account that the international community is unanimous in qualifying "Nusra" as a terrorist organization, and the UN Security Council resolutions call for countering this structure, the Russian Foreign Ministry noted that "it would seem, of course, that the terrorist attacks of "Nusra" should meet with universal unconditional and decisive condemnation, and in the evaluations of the outbursts against diplomatic missions should be no ambiguity".
However, as the diplomatic service stressed, "for the third time in a month, the diplomatic representatives of the United States, Great Britain, France and Ukraine in the UN Security Council, alternately, varying the tone of objections, hiding behind arguments about the alleged lack of necessary information, blocked the proposal of the Russian Federation to adopt the standard short draft of the Security Council statement for the press condemning the terrorist attacks on the Russian diplomatic mission in the Syrian capital".
The refusal to show diplomatic solidarity with us should remain on the conscience of these delegations.
"What is most disturbing is that the Security Council's failure to condemn the terrorist's actions encourages them to commit new provocations and attacks, gives them a sense of impunity", the Foreign Ministry said, adding that "it would be unwelcome for these barbarians to believe that someone in the Security Council is with them".
Vladimir Putin advocated limiting the number of business checks
Russian President Vladimir Putin said during a meeting on investment projects in the Far East that the number of unscheduled inspections of entrepreneurs should be reduced to 30% of the planned number, and also said that the inspections should be limited to ten days.
"Out-of-plan inspections are usually carried out without the appropriate agreement with the prosecutor's office; only 2-3% is agreed with the prosecutor's office, the rest goes on independently", TASS quotes the president.
Vladimir Putin also said that investigators should be banned from seizing servers and hard drives from enterprises.
In addition, the president believes that business associations should be given the right to defend their members' interests in court.
"I hope this will bring a certain positive in the consideration of cases related to entrepreneurial activity or related to violation of the law in the field of entrepreneurship", - said the head of state.
As "Ъ" reported, due to the moratorium on the conduct of planned inspections, the number of other types of inspections of entrepreneurs is increasing.
In May, a survey was conducted by order of the business ombudsman under the President of Russia Boris Titov, which revealed that in fact, the planned checks were replaced by extra-planned checks (the share of those facing them increased from 21.9% in 2015 to 30.8% in 2016), prosecutorial checks (from 16.9% to 21.8%), raids (from 7.9% to 13.3%), as well as checks on citizens' applications (increased from 15% to 19.5%) and administrative investigations (10.8% to 15.5%).
More about business checks in the material "Kommersant" "To small business came from the other side".
The brothers fight for a real estate empire worth over $ 500 million
Two brothers fight for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth over $500 million - 40 years after their Italian ancestors founded the dynasty.
Former Carlton football club director and developer Colin de Lutyens lives in the palace of Turak three doors down from his younger brother Paul, who filed a lawsuit against him in the Supreme Court for the division of property and assets.
Paul has been trying to get out of the family business since 2014, but the Supreme Court is still in a fierce dispute over the terms of the divorce.
Together with their mother, Anna, the brothers own 87 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, purchased since their family bought a store on Smith Street in Collingwood in 1973.
There the family founded Westco Jeans, which grew to a network of 160 stores.
It was sold in 1999 for $85 million.
The money was invested in real estate, and the De Lutyens' list of properties now includes office buildings, development sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and in Mount Buller, and shopping malls in the suburbs.
Under the terms of the agreement with his late father, Colin - whom Paul describes as the "main driving force and dominant personality" of the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company's assets, and Paul about one-third.
According to the court, that means Colin owns $316 million and Paul owns $176 million.
The division of property and money became a stumbling block for Paul.
"The division Colin proposed gives him, in my opinion, the best parts of the property", he wrote in his first deposition in 2015.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the Supreme Court held its first hearings.
The brothers are now arguing over who will control the existing business - which Paul believes Colin has excluded him from.
Colin claims that this is not the case, but accuses Paul of incompetent management of some facilities.
In the deposition Colin gave at the start of the trial, he says he hopes to resolve the dispute.
"My Italian roots make me consider my family a top priority", he wrote.
The legal costs are skyrocketing, with hundreds of pages of depositions, emails and reports from companies like Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and both sides have attracted the best lawyers, including the Queen's Counsel Alan Myers, and the best dressers.
Mrs. De Lutyens and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants; they ran dairy bars and food stores from the late 1950s, and in the early 1970s bought a store in Brunswick.
With financial guarantees, they bought a store in Collingwood, where Colin opened the family's first jeans store.
Colin says he started Westco when he was "in the last years of school, and Paul was a boy (about 10 years old)".
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass their property to their sons without conflict.
"Luigi often told me that he did not want the brothers to take the matter to court", she wrote.
The other two brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutyens group of companies; Colina says Mark received $10 million when he went out of business, and Luke received $26 million.
Paul said that both Luke and Mark were "dissatisfied with the financial conditions of their department".
Colin was not a public figure, although he was a former member of the board of directors of the AFL club and, according to a 2015 biography of Eddie McGwire, a best friend of the TV star.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul and their lawyers on Friday.
Only Colin responded, texting, saying that since the case had not yet been heard in court, "I really have nothing much to say".
"I am very, very sorry that my brother Paul decided to sue me and to trample our family's name in court", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in his deposition that he was trying to satisfy his brother's demands.
"Our father would not like to see Paul and I argue in court", he said, adding that he "is still hoping for a resolution".
On Friday, that hope seems to have dissipated.
"The court will soon rule on our case", Colin wrote.
The new Trump chief of staff is planning to restrict access to the president.
Others have tried to do so and have failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can really do it.
Then he'll be the first.
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including news reports from the media, in the hope of keeping the chief in a more calm state.
This is what reporter Josh Dawesy reports.
"In a meeting with White House staff on his first day in office, the new White House Chief of Staff, John F. Kelly, identified the main problem in the White House under President Donald Trump that he hopes to solve: poor channels of information to the president".
Kelly told staff that information should go through him - in paper form or through briefings - because the president will make better decisions if he gets the right information.
Kelly's diagnosis is perfectly accurate, but others have already failed to tame Trump by tracking his information.
President Trump's relationship with television dates back decades - and now that he's in the White House, his TV-watching habit is still strong.
"When Trump, as a candidate, was upset about unfair campaign coverage, it was helpful to show him that he was getting fair coverage in publications that could be persuaded", Sam Nanberg, a former election staff adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmer wrote in Politico that "six former election staff members said that to keep Trump's Twitter habit under control, it was necessary to ensure that there was a steady stream of praise in the personal information he received".
I'm good with that.
But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these election staff members know something we don't, like that if it wasn't for them, Trump's tweets would be even more provocative.
We may never know about the tweets that Trump didn't post.
If his associates had kept him out of trouble at least a few times, their efforts had been worthwhile.
But no one has always been able to keep Trump from adding fuel to the fire.
Part of the problem is that in a White House divided into rival factions, people are constantly trying to push their agenda forward by providing Trump with material, credible or not, that supports their views.
Politico, just in time for this story, wrote in May about the tendency of advisers to constantly feed the president questionable information.
Here is an example, as described by reporter Shane Goldmaher:
"Trump's current and former staff say that Trump may react very strongly to negative press reports, especially those containing dangerous leaks, and will not rest until he finds out who was behind them.
This happened in late February, when someone leaked to the president a copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of Internet provocateur Charles K. Johnson, in which Deputy Chief of Staff Kathy Welsh was accused of being "behind a series of leaks" at the White House.
It doesn't matter that Johnson is banned from Twitter forever for aggressive behavior, that he didn't present any specific facts, or that he made false accusations in the past and then denied them.
Trump read the article and started asking the staff about Welsh".
Goldmacher adds that then-head of the White House Reins Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter "tried to build a system to manage the flow of papers that Trump gets and document them".
How did that work?
Three months later, Kelly's trying to do the same thing.
He may turn out to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump still has an impulsive nature, and his aides are still fighting each other for influence.
These constant factors make Kelly's task very difficult.
Tyumen prosecutor 's office is fighting HIV dissident
The prosecutor's office challenged the decision of the Tyumen district court in Kaliningrad to terminate the criminal case against a local woman whose infant daughter died of HIV.
According to the investigation, the child died because the mother was HIV-dissident and refused treatment.
However, the court acquitted her of any responsibility for her reconciliation with the father.
The prosecution believes that the crime cannot go unpunished, so as not to set a precedent for other HIV dissidents.
The case against Tyumen resident was initiated under part 1 of article 109 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation (causing death by negligence) in April - after her three-year-old daughter died of HIV infection 4B stage.
According to the prosecutor's office, the mother herself is HIV-positive.
"The woman did not treat herself and refused to treat her daughter, believing that HIV infection does not exist", - explained in the prosecutor's office of the Tyumen region.
The criminal case was submitted to the Tyumen's Kalininsky district court, which on July 25 decided to terminate it.
The father of the girl who died filed a petition saying that he "forgave his wife, had no claims against her, she has compensated for the damage and apologized".
The prosecution disagreed with the court's decision and filed an appeal, demanding that the decision to terminate the case be reversed and sent for a new hearing.
The girl is dead, and the damage done by the crime is impossible to undo.
The HIV-infected mother, despite the recommendations of doctors, refused to examine the baby and treat her for a dangerous infection", the press service of the prosecutor's office reported.
The supervisory authority believes she should be punished or other HIV dissidents will follow her example.
According to the Tyumen AIDS Center, about 12 children with HIV in the Tyumen region are not receiving medical care because their parents refuse.
"The situation has improved - over the year of the special group's work, half of the parents who had categorically refused to treat their children for HIV changed their minds - they allowed the diagnosis to be made, they began taking medicines", said the spokeswoman for the AIDS Center, Elena Loseva.
According to her, it is impossible to influence parents by law, and as a result not all HIV-infected children are detected - mothers do not allow them to be examined, hide, run away with their children from hospitals.
What Danger Is in HIV Dissidents
At the end of last year, St. Petersburg sociologists presented the results of Russia's first study of the so-called HIV-dissident movement.
HIV dissidents are people who deny the existence of HIV and refuse to take medication.
Doctors and AIDS-serving NGOs call such views anti-medical and see their spread as a serious threat.
The gruesome photo shoot, which ended in tragedy, took place on Thursday, August 3, at the Grechani railway station in Khmelnytsk.
A cheerful company of drunken youths were walking across a railroad bridge, where a freight train was standing.
One of his friends had the idea to take an effective selfie on the roof of the car, the police communication sector in Khmelnytsky region told FAKTAM.
The guy started to get off the bridge to the train, but because of his carelessness he caught on to the power line and was instantly electrocuted.
Fortunately, the station dispatcher learned of the incident and immediately called an "emergency".
Before the doctors arrived, the victim was moved to a safe place, and then hospitalized in the burn ward of the Khmelnytsky Regional Clinical Hospital.
The man has been diagnosed with 1 to 2 degree burns.
His condition is stable.
Law enforcement officials point out that extreme selfies on rooftops, bridges, and moving vehicles are becoming increasingly popular.
Police urge people to be vigilant and not allow such photo shoots, especially among children and teenagers.
Scientists have suggested the existence of oceans on ancient Venus
There could have been oceans on ancient Venus.
French scientists have made this assumption.
Scientists have created a computer model that demonstrates the process of water formation on the surface of planets, reports Science News.
It turns out that Venus had formed oceans early in its history, with 10% more water than Earth has now.
Earlier, "Arguments of the Week" wrote that, according to the scientific hypothesis, the ocean could have existed on Mars 4 billion years ago.
Foreign experts in the course of their research came to the conclusion that the water object was located in the northern hemisphere of the Red Planet.
Three people were injured in a shooting in San Francisco .
Three people have been wounded in a shooting in San Francisco, the Associated Press reports.
The incident happened in Dolores Park when there were a significant number of visitors.
Witnesses said several men on the bridge began shouting threats.
One of them took out a gun and started shooting at people.
The perpetrators' appearance was unnoticeable, since they had everything but their eyes closed.
Another was treated and released.
The third victim is a minor, no details of his condition.
Dolores Park, located on the hill, is a popular spot for locals and tourists alike.
On July 1, at least 17 people were injured in a shooting at a nightclub in Little Rock, Arkansas.
Several other visitors were injured while trying to leave the premises.
Rock band Louna will present a new album in Barnaul
The concert of the rock band Louna will take place in Barnaul on October 17.
The musicians will present their new album "Wonderful New World", which has become one of the most anticipated releases of the year.
The band is preparing a concept show that will be the most spectacular in the band's concert history.
"Wonderful New World" is the fourth album by the Russian rock band Louna.
Its name is associated with the famous anti-utopian novel by O. Huxley "A Wonderful New World".
The new songs do not retell the book, but tell of a society that lives by the law of anti-utopia, "blindly believing in propaganda and imposed values".
The group was helped by listeners to raise money for the album: on the website "Planeta.ru" the project was supported by more than 1200 people.
Her first album, "Make More Noise!" was released in 2010.
Two years later, the musicians released the album "Time X", and in 2013 they recorded the album "We are Louna" (2013).
In the fall of 2015, Louna performed with the Symphony Orchestra at Crocus City Hall with the program "Songs of Peace".
The group is composed of Luisine Gevorkyan (vocals), Vitali Demidenko (bass guitar), Rubén Kazaryan (guitar), Sergei Ponkratyev (guitar), and Leonid Kinsbursky (drums), who also performs with the band.
The concert will be held in the Barnaul club "Faraon" on October 17 at 19.00.
Tickets are from 1200 to 2600 rubles.
Louna is one of the most popular bands on the Russian rock scene.
The collective was founded in 2008.
Their debut concert was held in 2009.
The group won several times in different nominations of the hit parade "The Devil's Dozen".
The gypsies have crossed the trenches and returned to the street of millionaires.
Some of the wealthiest homeowners in the West Midlands are once again in conflict with the determined gypsies who have overcome the municipal government's trenches to reclaim the fields next to their homes.
The gypsies parked 20 wheeled houses in a field bordering the affluent Solihull Street, jokingly called the Street of Millionaires.
Bringing with them horses, babies and many wheeled houses, they returned after being driven out no later than May, and were not prevented by a ditch dug by the municipal authorities to prevent their invasion.
This tactical company found a gap in the defensive structures and pushed their vehicles through the unfenced area to make room for a trail.
Angry residents attacked the municipality of Solihull, saying it was "unable to solve the problem".
An anonymous local resident said: "They arrived here on Monday night after being chased out of Bentley Heath where they threw rocks at passersby".
The municipality should be shamed and forced to act, because they are completely incapable of solving this problem.
The gypsies were here in May, they were driven out, and now they're back again.
Last night more gypsies came, and today, maybe even more.
"The City of Birmingham knows how to solve this problem, they get long-term court orders to protect their parks", she added.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I don't like that I keep paying the city tax, and the city can't even stop it.
One local resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "It's funny, we just saw these gypsies leave the last time, and here, please, this attack continues".
This time, they got bigger, and we even saw a horse grazing on the meadow.
A Solihull City Council spokesman said: "We are aware of an illegal camp on the ground near Streetsbrook Road and are cooperating with Solihull Police and are taking the necessary legal action to remove them as soon as possible".
To help us gather evidence, it's important that as many local residents as possible report any antisocial or criminal behavior to the police on the 101.
It gives us an idea of the situation that the court will consider when we present our case.
Crimea is taking over the "New World" champagne winery
The decision to take over the State-owned enterprise of the Republic of Crimea "New World Champagne Wine Factory" was made by the Ministry of Property and Land Affairs of the Republic of Crimea, by order of Anna Anyuhina.
100% of the company's shares will remain in the state ownership of Crimea.
The authorized capital of the joint-stock company will be 595.5 million rubles and will consist of 5.955 million ordinary shares of nominal value of 100 rubles each.
The Crimean Ministry of Agriculture stated that if funds for the modernization of the plant were not found within the next three years, the plant would be threatened with shutdown.
The wear and tear of the main equipment at the enterprise is about 60-70%.
The modernization of the enterprise requires 1.2 billion rubles. Due to the peculiarities of the organizational-legal form, it is obliged to give 50% of the profit to the budget revenue.
What's left is not enough to implement the modernization plan.
"It is difficult to get money from the owner, it is difficult to talk about attracting loan funds from large credit organizations", said Deputy Head of the Ministry of Agriculture of Crimea Sergey Petelin in April this year.
The Crimean Parliament has included the enterprise in the 2017 privatization plan .
It was proposed to hold its stock and put it up for auction.
A source for Interfax in the Crimean authorities estimated the possible cost of the sale of the enterprise at $40 million, and the investor's investment in the modernization at another $30 million.
"New Light" in 2016 increased the production of sparkling wines by 2.8% compared to the level of 2015 - to 1.52 million bottles.
In 2017, New Light was planning to release 1.6 million bottles.
The enterprise was founded in 1878 by Prince Lev Golitsyn as a winery for the production of sparkling wine in the estate he acquired, the New World.
The plant is located on 11 hectares of land.
The students of the third grade in Nizhny Novgorod destroyed more than 40 tombstones
The employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Nizhny Novgorod region identified the citizens who destroyed 46 gravestones in the cemetery of the city of Lyskovo.
The perpetrators were third-graders.
The first statement that the grave slabs were damaged by unknown persons came to the Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs in Lyskovsky district on June 27.
A total of 24 people have reported the matter to the police.
As a result, a criminal case was initiated under Article 244 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation "Destruction, damage or desecration of burial places".
Police have identified two suspects, an 8-year-old and a 9-year-old.
The juvenile offenders told the police that they were interested in seeing the monuments fall, which prompted them to take the bullying action.
Preventive measures have been taken with the children and their parents.
Italy is tightening its tone on NGO ships rescuing migrants.
Italy has warned the NGOs that own the rescue vessels in the Mediterranean that they will not be able to continue their work unless they comply with the new rules governing their activities.
"If NGOs do not comply with the new code of conduct, it is difficult to say whether they will be able to continue their activities", Interior Minister Mario Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily newspaper Stampa.
The warning from Minniti came the day after Italian authorities seized a ship belonging to the German humanitarian organization "Jugend Rettet", on suspicion that its crew was actually collaborating with human traffickers and facilitating illegal immigration.
The humanitarian organization, which has been in operation for just a year, has declined to comment on the substance of the detailed charges brought against it by Italian prosecutor Ambrosio Cartozio.
"Saving human lives is and will remain our top priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot continue our activities in the search and rescue zone at this time", the organization said in a statement on social media.
"We can only assess all the charges that are being brought now after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation".
The Italian authorities have been tracking the "Juventus" vessel, owned by "Jugend Rettet", since October.
His crew is suspected of taking on board migrants in whole lifeboats, which were sent directly to them by human traffickers, and allowing smugglers to leave with boats that they could reuse.
At least one such meeting is believed to have taken place just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the indictment materials, the contents of which were published in Italian media.
The crew is suspected of violating the orders of the Italian coastal authorities, who control the rescue operations in this area, more out of humanitarian zeal than any other motive.
The code of conduct essentially presupposes that Juventus-type vessels will have an Italian police officer on board to supervise their activities.
So far, only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the code: Save the Children, Malta's MOAS, and Pro-Activa Extended Embrace from Spain.
The latter said on Thursday that it considered the new rules unnecessary but acceptable provided they did not cause any "significant changes or disruption" to its rescue operations.
Among those who refused to sign was the Nobel Prize-winning organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).
Meanwhile, Miniti said the sharp decline in the number of migrants arriving in Italy as a result of rescue operations in recent weeks indicates that efforts to support the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors are bearing fruit.
"In recent days we have begun to see the light at the end of the tunnel", the minister said.
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
"In Libya, we do not want to be associated with any of the parties to the conflict"
The Russian authorities have recently intensified their policy in the Libyan direction, and visits to Moscow have been attended by delegations of the rival Libyan parties.
The head of the Russian contact group for the intra-Libyan settlement under the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma, the assistant of the head of the Chechen Republic Lev Denegov told "Ъ", what goals Moscow pursues in this region and who it bets on.
The contact group you're leading on Libya is virtually unknown.
Let's say the contact group on Ukraine -- everybody knows about it.
And here is the veil of mystery.
What exactly do you do, what are your goals?
The contact group was created on the initiative of the Russian Foreign Ministry and the State Duma.
Its activities are supervised by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Mikhail Bogdanov and Adam Delimkhanov (Duma deputy from Chechnya - "Ъ").
The latter is authorized to work on the Libyan direction by the Speaker of the State Duma Vyacheslav Volodin.
The group was formed after the arrest of the Russian tanker "Mehanik Chebotarev" in Libya (in September 2015, there were 11 people on board).
We've been thinking about how we can help the crew.
Then a contact group was formed from military specialists, representatives of the State Duma, and our work was supported by the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov.
How come you're the one who's running it?
Since I've been working on Libya since 2008, I've been asked to lead the team.
Our activities were not limited to the release of the sailors from the Mechanic Chebotarev.
We have been able to establish contacts with representatives of all the major factions that are opposed to each other in the Libyan conflict - both from Tripoli (where the UN-recognized government led by Faiz Saraj is based) and Tobruk (the residence of the parliament that opposes the government and supports Marshal Khalifa Haftar, who controls the eastern regions of Libya).
Thanks to the active participation of Ahmed Metig (Vice Prime Minister of Libya - "Ъ"), we managed to quickly negotiate the release of the Russian sailors.
So it was decided to use these contacts more effectively, to create a contact group.
Its task is to analyze the situation, identify key factors and players, dialogue with all parties to the conflict.
I want to emphasize that in Libya we do not want to associate ourselves with any of the parties to the conflict, we are in dialogue with all of them.
How many people are in the contact group and how many of them are permanently in Libya?
There are five people in the contact group now.
Among them are people with experience in law enforcement, including the Defense Ministry.
We also want to bring in a group of experts from the region, representatives of the RAS Middle East Institute.
None of our staff are in Libya at all, so there's no need for that.
Are there any Russian military advisers, instructors in Libya right now?
And if so, whose side?
There are no Russian military specialists in Libya.
All the talk and all the publicity about it is not true.
But your contact group includes ex-military...
Yes, and their presence is necessary.
Like when we visit hot spots.
Or closed cities like Misurata, which is home to militia units that played a role in the 2011 overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and have intensified in the years since.
We arrived in Misrata in January of this year.
We were scared, told that they were all Islamists, terrorists.
But it was important for us to assess the situation ourselves, to analyze the real military potential, who is responsible for what, why there are rumors, what is the role of Islamists in the situation.
In Misurata, we met with all the representatives of the detachments that were engaged in the destruction of ISIS in Sirte (in December 2016, this city on the Mediterranean coast was taken from the militants of the banned "Islamic State" - "Ъ").
We wanted to look at them, meet these people, verify the information that they were the ones who played a crucial role in the destruction of ISIS in Libya, not Khalifa Haftar, who was taking credit for it.
And what did you come up with?
Haftar didn't win the fight against ISIS in Libya?
He didn't do that.
Haftar was operating on the other front, in Benghazi.
And ISIS in Sirte was fought by the government-controlled structures in Tripoli.
And by the way, we invited the people who were running this counterterrorism operation to Russia.
And they came - the visit lasted from 19 to 23 April this year, the Libyan delegation was received in the Federation Council, in the Duma, the Foreign Ministry and the Russian Guard.
We understand that you've been to all the regions of Libya, and you probably have a sense of the mood of the local elites and field commanders.
Do you think that the ceasefire and election agreements reached in Paris at the end of July by Khalifa Haftar and Faiz Saraj will be implemented?
Or again, as has happened many times in the past, will the agreements be broken, fighting will resume, and the parties will try to seize power alone?
It's a good sign that Saraj and Haftar have agreed to meet again, which was impossible not so long ago.
In the recent past, both leaders have had extremely negative comments about each other.
As for Russia's position...
It is often written and said that Moscow actively supports Haftar, many believe it.
We encountered this situation when we were in Misrata, and Haftar was boarding the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov on that very day.
It was a coincidence.
But in Misrata, they didn't believe in coincidence.
They said, "You must be very brave people to come to us today".
But our task is to show that we are not just supporting Haftar, we are engaging with all the key players in the conflict in Libya.
You and Haftar have been in touch.
Does the fact that he studied twice in the USSR make it easier to understand Russian partners on a human, emotional level?
And by the way, does Haftar speak Russian?
Russian, if he knows, is very relative.
But what he learned from us, of course, makes it easier to talk to him.
And not just him, by the way.
When we talk to the military in Tripoli and Misrata, we meet generals who have either studied in Russia or the Soviet Union.
And they speak Russian perfectly.
And they're drawn to Russia, they're somewhat nostalgic about it.
Do you think it's possible to lift the arms embargo on Libya soon?
Are your Libyan counterparts interested in Russian arms supplies?
Interested, of course, but as I said, we are not on the side of any party in this conflict and we would not like to arm one against the other.
We'd like everyone to be in roughly equal positions.
As for the arms embargo, there are constant calls from the Libyans for Russia to help lift it.
The process of drafting a constitution is currently underway in Libya.
We hope the parties will reach a compromise, reach an internal consensus.
Then there should be elections, which was also discussed at the meeting between Saraj and Haftar.
If elections are held and a legitimate government is finally elected (and neither party has that status now), then the question of lifting the arms embargo can be raised at the UN Security Council.
Raising this issue now is pointless and dangerous, it will only escalate the conflict.
The other day, the media reported that Italy, faced with the problem of African refugees swimming from Libya, felt abandoned by its EU allies.
Can Moscow help its Italian partners in this situation by using its ties with the Libyans?
How realistic, for example, is it that Haftar's troops will take control of the coast and end the smuggling business that is smuggling immigrants to Europe?
That's a very timely question.
We're working hard on that.
The Italians need Russia's support because Moscow is in dialogue with Haftar, Saraj, Misurata and the south of the country.
And the tribes in southern Libya have a big role to play in this, and they're willing to cooperate with Russia.
Is this about the southerners stopping the migration flows at long range?
So, you mean, they turned back the buses that were carrying Nigerian migrants?
That's what we're trying to do.
But it's not easy.
Some clans and groups are interested in keeping these flows going.
We hope to help unite the southerners in the negotiation process between the Saraj, Haftar and the tribes in the south.
But first, we'd like to see a consensus on this issue between Haftar and Saraj.
Prime Minister Faiz Saraj is considered an Islamist, and supporter of the introduction of Sharia law in the country.
How radical is his views?
Would it be an obstacle to building relations with Russia or the West?
I'll give you my personal opinion of him.
In my opinion, he is, on the contrary, an opponent of radical Islam.
But the Islamists are in his coalition.
Yes, but he himself is of the opinion that Libya should be a perfectly normal country - moderately Islamic, open to the world.
And he's also actively fighting terrorists.
What is his reputation?
It was created by those countries that are not interested in Russia communicating with Tripoli.
Tripoli is the capital, the seat of the legislative, executive and judicial branches.
There's the national oil corporation, the national bank and other governmental structures.
Of course, some countries were interested in keeping us out of it.
We mixed up all the cards and started to actively communicate with both Tripoli and Tobruk.
And we're already reaping the fruits of that work: Rosneft has signed a cooperation agreement with the Libyan state oil company, NOC.
The director of NOC, Mustafa Sanalla, with whom Rosneft's head, Igor Sechin, made the deal, is himself directly from Tripoli.
And two weeks ago, the first shipment of Libyan oil from Rosneft took place.
What will Russia do with her?
I think I'm going to resell it.
What other economic interests does Russia have in Libya?
Plans to re-sign contracts signed under Muammar Gaddafi.
The agreement is based on previous agreements in the transport sector (construction of railways), energy (electrification) and a number of others.
Do the Libyans have anything to pay?
Well, they have oil.
So, like in the case of Iran, this is an oil-for-services scheme?
I don't know what the pattern is, these are not the issues I'm dealing with directly.
The economy is not really the main thing for Russia in Libya.
We're basically doing peacekeeping work there.
What's important to us is to stop the bloodshed, to help the Libyans come to terms with each other so that they can establish order in their own country and Libya ceases to be a conducive environment for the development of terrorism.
For Russia, that is the main task - to help the Libyan people and to drive the terrorists out of Libya.
Do you have any information about the presence in Libya (now or formerly) of radical militants from Russia or other countries of the former USSR?
One of the tasks of our contact group was to find out.
I met with a representative of the Libyan State Security Committee who said that there are no Russians or other former Soviet countries in Libya today.
He said he had about 50,000 phone records of Islamic and radical groups (in Libya. - "Ъ") and Russian language was not heard there.
What country are these militants from?
I wouldn't want to go into that detail.
Then we'll put it another way.
How many of the Islamist militants in Libya are Libyans themselves?
Libyans are barely even in the top five.
The rest are just a bunch of pricks.
Can Moscow conduct intra-Libyan negotiations on the model of Paris?
There are plans.
We are actively negotiating with the Libyans, several delegations from Libya have already visited Moscow, and have declared their readiness to come again - to Moscow or Grozny.
When can such talks be held?
It's hard to say now.
There are still a few more visits to be made, and then I hope we can get some clarity on when and where to hold the talks.
In the Czech museum, donors raised money for a expensive gift to a sick boy
In Moscow's Melikhovo Museum-Reserve, nine-year-old Sasha Matsola, who has cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus and total blindness, will receive a specialized running track as a gift on August 5.
A useful present will be presented to Sasha by the Minister of Culture of the Moscow region Oksana Kosareva and the director of the museum Konstantin Bobkov.
Money for the gym was collected during the charity marathon "Don't tire of doing good", which was held in Melihov on July 15 on the Day of the Memory of Chekhov.
On the eve of the marathon, the museum received a letter from Sasha, who lives in the village of Manushkino in the Chekhov region: "I have no eyes at all, so I asked my mother to write this letter".
"I would love to get a treadmill as a gift, so my legs will get stronger and I can learn to walk a little bit".
And now Sasha's dream has come true!
After the presentation in the museum-reserve will be held "Concert-post-scriptum" - the famous pianist, the Honored artist of Russia Alexander Gindin will perform poporri from popular classical works.
During the charity marathon in Melihov, the choir of the Vonezhenskaya Davydova Desert, the bell ringers of the workshop of Ilya Drodzikhin, students of the Moscow Conservatory named after P.I. Tchaikovsky and the Russian Academy named after Gnesin, the artists of the Melihovsky Theatre "Czech Studio" performed.
Auctions were held for visitors, a book fair and a charity sale of souvenir products with the logo of the marathon.
The museum-reserve "Melihovo" has taken the initiative to make the Day of Remembrance of Chekhov on July 15 a single day of charity in all museums of Moscow.
A 30-year-old resident of Olevsk, Zhytomyr region, near the local football stadium, fired several shots at teenagers who were there.
According to the suspect, he was angered by the noise, the communication department of the Zhitomir region police reported to "FAKTAM".
Afterward, the man went to a nearby café.
A conflict broke out in the building, during which a man fired a rubber bullet, injuring one of the visitors.
The 34-year-old victim received the necessary medical attention, there is no threat to his life.
Police and ambulance arrived at the scene, but the shooter had already disappeared.
Law enforcement identified him and arrested him on August 2.
The man could not explain his actions.
He's got a rubber bullets firing device that's been sent for an autopsy.
The criminal proceedings were initiated under Article 296 of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The prisoner is facing a prison term of 3 to 7 years.
Recall, in Kyiv on Lukyanovka in the area of Tatarskaya street in the night of 28 July there was a shooting attack.
Michelle Carter sentenced for messages that led to the suicide of Conrad Roy
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years in prison for encouraging her boyfriend, Conrad Roy, to commit suicide by texting and calling.
Michelle Carter, now 20, will serve 15 months of her sentence and five years of probation.
Carter was found guilty in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday: "My family is devastated.
My son was my best friend".
Carter was allowed to remain free until an appeal.
She was facing a maximum sentence of 20 years, but her lawyers said that both she and Roy suffered from mental disorders.
Carter, dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, was standing, holding hands and eyes closed.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy", the prosecutor told the court.
"She interrupted his life to improve her own.
She didn't take responsibility", she said.
"She showed no remorse".
But Carter's lawyer said it was "a tragic incident that she deeply regrets".
However, Justice Lawrence Moniz said that in his opinion, her "age, level of maturity or even mental illness did not significantly affect her actions".
The prosecutor read Roy's mother, Lynn Roy, a statement that said: "Not a day has passed that I have not mourned the loss of my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of me and how I'm coping - I'm trying to support his sisters despite all the pain that will stay with us forever", it says.
Roy's sister Camden Roy said she was haunted by the thought that she would never be able to attend his wedding or become the aunt of his children.
"Losing someone who has been with me since I was born is a pain that will stay with me for the rest of my life", she said.
This case is likely to set a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that holds a person liable for advising someone to commit suicide.
In 2014, when Roy was found dead in his car with symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning, Carter was 17.
The case attracted national attention when it was revealed that he was driven to suicide by a Carter message.
"You can hang yourself, jump off a roof, stab yourself, I don't know, there are many ways", she wrote in several messages sent two weeks before his death, when he was on vacation with his family.
Minutes before she killed herself, she wrote, "You must do this, Conrad", and "You just have to turn on the light, and you will be free and happy".
Judge Monis said Carter wanted to get attention with Roy's death, and he forbade her to talk to the press to keep her from getting what she wanted.
Lawyers are divided on this.
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted in 2007 of murdering her British roommate in Italy and acquitted two years later.
Knox, 30, wrote in the Los Angeles Times that "Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help, not prison".
Yevgeny Bogochov: "I let Langford go like a bird in high flight"
One of the best basketball players in the VTB United League, 33-year-old Keith Langford, has left UNIKS.
The departure of the American defender of "Izvestiam" was commented by the president of UNIX Evgeny Bogachev.
Kit made this decision due to family circumstances, - said Yevgeny Bogachev.
He has a little kid, a wife, who didn't want to move to Kazan.
Kit wants to be closer to home.
I decided to go to him.
Of course, I could have said no and extended his contract, but he deserved a different treatment.
He played three seasons in UNIX and showed a high level in every game, putting in 100 percent.
So I let him go like a bird flying high.
We thanked him.
We wish him success in his family life and his playing career.
Keith Langford played in the Kazan club for three years, winning the silver of the 2015/16 United League.
In the 2016/17 season, he won the award for the most productive player of the Euroleague season.
He averaged 21.75 points per game.
This is the second time since the award was established in 2004.
Langford, who won the award in 2014, became the second player in Euroleague history to win the award more than once.
Langford will sign with Chinese club Shenzhen in the near future, Eurohoops reports.
The American is expected to sign a two-year, $5 million contract.
Langford will be the second Euroleague star to advance to the Chinese Championship in July.
Earlier, ex-centre player of Panathinaikos Yannis Burusis moved to the Chinese CBA.
A tourist from Moscow who burned in the sun was evacuated by helicopter to Adygea
Adaghe rescuers evacuated a tourist from Moscow after he suffered severe sunburn.
The man rested in the shelter "Fisht", located at an altitude of 1,6 thousand meters.
The 27-year-old tourist had elevated blood pressure and difficulty breathing.
The initial diagnosis is a severe allergic reaction.
The head of the tour group turned to the rescuers, who told that the man had burns during the campaign.
Audi to modify up to 850,000 diesel cars
The day before the announcement, Audi and BMW announced that they would offer software updates for more than 350,000 vehicles.
The chairman of BMW stated that the company believes there are more intelligent ways than driving restrictions, referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is located - that have considered banning or restricting the use of diesel cars.
Daimler said Thursday it is modifying three million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions.
Neither company has called the move a recall.
European carmakers have been actively promoting the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to help comply with carbon emissions regulations.
But the nitrogen oxides that diesel engines emit are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to neutralize diesel exhaust is also rising, and it is becoming difficult for car manufacturers to maintain a competitive price for cars.
While German carmakers are under scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel's government has also been accused of coddling powerful carmakers and ignoring signs of the problem.
The companies are trying not to repeat the mistakes of the Volkswagen, which hid the use of so-called "defection devices" that could adjust the amount of harmful gases emitted during testing to conform to the rules, and in normal driving conditions turned off.
Several Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States, and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, a former head of the thermodynamics department at the Audi engine development group was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pameo, is Italian, and therefore not protected from extradition and could face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi came under German criminal investigation involving Volkswagen after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emissions rules and expanded an investigation that had previously focused on the United States.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could pose serious problems for Volkswagen: the elite car manufacturer is the source of a disproportionately large share of Volkswagen's income.
A cafe visitor in Astrakhan paid with fake money
Police received a report from a bank employee that when they counted the money from the general food point, they found a suspicious 5 thousand rubles note.
A study by the Crime Scene Investigation Center found it to be a fake.
According to the Ministry of Internal Affairs of Russia in Astrakhan region, one of the visitors to the cafe who bought a shourma paid with the banknote.
It should be noted that the cash register was not equipped with an instrument to determine the authenticity of the bills.
Currently, the police are identifying persons involved in the preparation and sale of a fake ticket of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation.
Such crimes are punishable by imprisonment for up to 8 years and a fine of up to 1 million rubles.
The Regional Office of the Ministry of Internal Affairs urges the residents of Astrakhan region to be careful when making financial transactions; employees of trade facilities are recommended to install instruments to check the authenticity of the money received.
Astronomers have found a "hellish" planet where even iron can melt
When astronomers first studied the stratosphere properties of a giant exoplanet called WASP-121b, they were surprised by its temperature, which can evaporate iron and other metals.
The researchers noticed that water molecules are so heated by the light of a star that they emit infrared radiation.
The Hubble Space Telescope has captured the glow of water molecules on this gas giant, the high temperature that causes the water in the planet's atmosphere to glow in the infrared range.
WASP-121b is a so-called "hot Jupiter" - a gas giant comparable in size and mass to the largest planet in the Solar System, but located tens of times closer to its parent star.
This makes the year on the exoplanet only 1.3 "Earth days", and its gas shell is heated to almost 2,500 degrees Celsius.
Climate change is threatening the lavender in Provence.
It has become a symbol of Provence and southern France, but now there are fears that it is threatened by climate change.
Lavender has been hindered by dry weather and disease-carrying insects, causing a constant headache for scientists and farmers who are trying to find a solution.
Eric Schess, an expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, says: "The lavender in Provence is really under threat because in recent years it has been affected by climate change, with much less rainfall in spring and especially in autumn.
It affects the life of the lavender.
And then there are the little cicadas, the insects that jump on the leaves, carrying micro-bacteria, and in very dry weather they become very numerous".
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender is not only popular with vacationers; lavender oil is also in high demand in perfumery and cosmetology.
Eric Schess says: "Instead of very long clusters with a large number of large flowers, we have small ones, underdeveloped, weakened, or none at all.
So we have fewer parts that contain essential oil".
Solutions that are currently being considered include improving water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil, as well as spraying plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and breeding varieties that are more resistant to drought.
Winter Universiade Ambassador met with the students of Krasnoyarsk
Twice world champion in hockey, Winter Universiade ambassador 2019, Alexander Semin met with the newcomers and handed out autographs to the fans.
The meeting took place in the tent of the Winter Universiade-2019 within the thematic week dedicated to ice hockey.
Anyone who visited the tent could skate on the artificial ice.
In addition, there were organized relay races, quizzes and games with the presentation of souvenir products of student games, and a warm-up from the aerobics federation.
50 schoolchildren participated in the event.
Alexander Semin advised the boys to do as much as possible on the sports fields and stressed that the most important thing at the initial stage of learning is hard work and a huge desire to play hockey.
"It's great that Krasnoyarsk has a platform like the Winter Universiade 2019 tent, where beginners can directly ask questions to the coaches of the teams", the champion said.
It should be noted that the ambassadors of the Winter Universiade-2019 help to promote student sports and healthy lifestyle among the Krasnoyarsk people.
The camp will be open throughout the summer season until September 25, the press service of the Winter Universiade 2019 directorate reports.
The State Department commented on Medvedev 's words
Official representative of the US State Department Heather Nauert, commenting on the briefing of the words of the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Dmitry Medvedev, said about the need to find "areas for interaction" with Russia.
She said such areas should be found to "improve bilateral cooperation".
Nauert cited the ceasefire agreement on Syria as an example of such successful cooperation.
We are two nuclear superpowers.
"And people around the world agree that the United States and Russia should be able to work together", the diplomat said.
Nauert declined to comment on Medvedev's claim of a full-blown trade war between Russia and the United States.
"If Russia said that, then of course it has the right to speak, but I can't say anything more on this topic", the State Department spokeswoman said.
Earlier, US President Donald Trump signed a bill to tighten sanctions against the Russian Federation.
Commenting on the new sanctions package, Russian Prime Minister Medvedev said Washington had declared a full-scale trade war on Moscow, ending hopes of improving bilateral relations.
Medvedev also said that the U.S. sanctions would last for decades.
In addition, the prime minister believes the American establishment has "clearly defeated" Trump.
Bodybuilder found in a dacha with memory loss
Bodybuilder Shamil Khanmetov disappeared on the road to Noginsk on July 25 under very peculiar circumstances: he left the car to go to the toilet.
For seven days, his friends and local residents searched for him without success.
And Shamil found himself in a strange country house in Ramen.
He was found completely naked in his bathroom by his owner.
The Dagestan athlete could not explain how he got here and what happened to him.
He couldn't even remember his name, and his passport was gone.
His missing persons reports helped identify him.
The doctors who arrived on the call recorded partial memory loss and a traumatic brain injury, reports Mash.
There are probably other surprises for the athletes.
The criminals who kidnapped Shamil probably already visited his apartment, from which he also stole the keys.
July oil and gas revenues exceeded forecast by 7.4 billion rubles
The actual oil and gas revenues received in July 2017 exceeded the estimate by 7.4 billion rubles, the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation reports.
The excess, the agency explains, was primarily due to the higher exchange rate of the U.S. dollar against the ruble compared to the average monthly value in June, which was used for the assessment, as well as the fact that the actual volume of gas production and the volume of oil products export exceeded the forecast levels.
"The deviation of oil and gas revenues of the federal budget from the monthly estimate, corresponding to the Federal law on the federal budget for 2017-2019, in August 2017 is forecast to be in the amount of +40,2 billion rubles", - said in the message of the Ministry of Finance.
Thus, the total amount of funds directed to the purchase of foreign currency on the domestic currency market in the period from August 7 to September 6, 2017 is 47,6 billion rubles.
Accordingly, the daily volume of foreign currency purchases will be equivalent to 2.07 billion rubles.
The Russian Bank will be involved in foreign currency purchases by the Russian Ministry of Finance.
Every working day during the specified period, the Central Bank will conclude foreign currency purchase transactions at the organized Moscow Exchange trades uniformly during the trading day.
The foreign currency purchased will be credited to the Federal Treasury's accounts at the Central Bank.
The murder of a journalist highlights the increasingly dangerous situation in Mexico.
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodose usually meet on Wednesdays to discuss plans to cover recent violent crimes in Sinaloa state, including organized crime, corrupt officials, or the ongoing drug war.
But today, overwhelmed by their own tragedy, they met to talk about safety.
They were told they had to change their habits.
Two senior journalists were discussing what seemed safer: taking the children into the office, which had already been bombed in 2009, or leaving them at home.
The security experts wrote on the board in the room three words: enemies, neutral people, allies.
They asked journalists to name names for each column -- no evidence needed, suspicion and gut feelings would do.
These are drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, journalists, suspected of being held by the government or the cartels, a whole list of villains who make it dangerous to cover the chaos in Mexico.
Violence continues, and among the bodies that are mounting in the country, there are more and more journalists: according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, at least 25 have died since President Enrico Pena Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 people are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and at least seven people have died in seven states this year.
Among the latter is their publisher and inspirer, "Ryodose" co-founder Javier Valdés Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is living in Mexico and being a journalist", Valdés wrote in one of his many books about violent drug crimes.
His absence is felt very acutely, though his presence is ubiquitous - a large photograph of Valdés showing his middle finger, with the inscription "Justice" hanging on the facade of the Riodose building; two reporters in their 30s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear T-shirts depicting his smile, face in glasses or his signature panama.
The seminar takes place less than two months after his death; the journalists discuss their shared trauma, their nightmares, their insomnia, their paranoia.
Although a special federal prosecutor's office was established in 2010 to investigate journalistic cases, so far, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, only two cases have been investigated.
As with most of the thousands of murders committed each year related to drug trafficking and organized crime, the killers of journalists are rarely brought to justice.
The Rios journalists insist on reporting on the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are dying of grief, even though the surroundings are much more dangerous now.
Without information about the killers, without justice, talking about security at meetings is of little use", says Ibarra.
"It's very stupid to waste time at this seminar", he says.
"Until we know the cause, we suspect everyone".
On the morning of May 15, Valdes left the Riodos office in the capital of the state of Culiacán.
He only managed to drive a couple of blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men; he was pulled out of the car and shot 12 times, probably because of the newspaper's name - which means "Twelve River".
The shooter drove away in his car and crashed it nearby.
Valdés was 50 years old.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
Rumors usually spread quickly around Kuliacan.
But Valdez is almost unknown.
Since Guzman was arrested and extradited to the US in January last year, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions fight to fill the vacuum.
Let's not talk about the fact that one or more people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloa, or that the cemetery is filled with decorated two-story drug king mausoleums that are larger than the houses of many living people.
Forget for a minute that a "calm" state is simply when one of the cartels takes control of a coastal state with important ports and drug trafficking routes leading to the United States.
Despite this and despite the fact that Valdes was well aware of the dangers of his work, Ismael Bohorquez, the 60-year-old co-founder and CEO of Riodose, is overwhelmed by guilt for failing to protect his friend.
He thinks two mistakes helped the murder.
First, an interview with Damasso Lopez, leader of one of the rival factions of the cartel that is fighting against Guzman's sons, was published in February.
The publication might have angered the sons; people who were supposedly gang members bought all the copies as soon as they were delivered to the kiosks.
The second mistake was that he didn't force Valdes to leave the country for his own safety after another newspaper was seized that was reporting the same story.
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder was seen as another milestone in the development of violence against journalists in Mexico.
He'd been out of harm's way for so long, his friends and colleagues thought he'd be forever.
He was a veteran reporter at Noroeste and in 2003 he and five colleagues founded Riodos, selling his $50 shares.
In Sinaloa, "it was impossible to do journalism without touching on the topic of drugs", Bohorkes said.
Over time, the paper earned a reputation for being bold and honest, and sales and advertising revenue grew.
Journalists liked that they could publish bold stories without fear of censorship, and readers were attracted by the fact that they could read about things that no one else dared to write about.
Eight years after its founding, Riodose received the prestigious Maria Mours Cabo Award for its reporting in Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award for his courage in investigating the drug trade in Mexico, wherever it led.
He was frank about being scared.
"I want to live on", he said at the CPJ award ceremony.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is "a way of life", he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
"You have to take the job that comes your way as a journalist - either that or you're just being a jerk".
I don't want to be asked, "What were you doing when there was so much death around... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The Riodos staff misses Valdes, the joker who cursed like a freighter in the harbor, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, the teacher who knew how to get by alive.
They relied on his order.
He had to wear his hat all the time.
He was supposed to go to El Guayabo, the bar across the street from the office, and always sit at the same table.
Now they ask, "Was he destroyed by the love of the established order?"
His death also made them question their calculations of how best to do their job and stay alive.
"They don't like you looking into their wives, their children, their legitimate business and their underground drug airfields.
"These things were over the line", Bohorkes said.
The result, even in the best of times, was a high level of self-censorship and a desire for self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
Stay away from anything that smells bad.
The problem, says Andrés Villarreal, editor of Rio, is that "the public can be fooled... and then what happened to Javier happens".
The old rules, he and others say, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where there is a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak state institutions and corrupt officials.
The landscape is constantly changing.
The room where the Rios employees were gathered for security training was suddenly forbidden to bring cell phones in: days before it was revealed that spyware, sold exclusively to governments, was being used in Mexico to spy on journalists and activists.
Outside, two policemen are hiding in the shade of a tree from the 104 degree heat (40 degrees Celsius).
They were given the task by the state government to guard the Riodos office, which is located in a four-story building in the bourgeois quarter of Culiacán.
Some reporters jokingly asked whether these officers were among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials the governor himself said could not be trusted.
A few months ago, journalists went to a mountainous area that is de facto controlled by drug gangs.
The next issue of "Ryodos" was based on three main themes.
This is the Sinaloa murder of the brother of former boxing champion Julio César Chavez.
They also had a revelation of government spending concentrated in the governor's hometown.
And there was a group kidnapping at one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the D.A.'s office.
There was no official announcement of who was kidnapped or how it happened, so it was prudent to write about what everyone in town knew: that it was a favorite restaurant of both drug dealers and the authorities.
One of their journalists learned from open databases that the restaurant was registered to a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of government for almost the entire last century.
Several governors from the PRI have recently been accused of corruption.
Villarreal asked reporters to report on previous incidents at the restaurant, including when Guzman's son, "El Chapo", escaped a military raid.
A few months ago, readers would have been looking for Valdes's column with the most reliable information on kidnapping.
"We would have known what happened before", says Villarreal, 46, who is nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slim build.
"All communication channels with our sources are cut off today".
Valdes' office is now used as a storage facility for posters and stickers protesting the killing of journalists, because the staff have become what they never thought they would be: activists speaking on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez took some posters and went the next morning to a demonstration outside the local prosecutor's office dedicated to another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared in the western state of Michoacán three days after Valdés was killed.
They found a burned body, and authorities said it was him, based on DNA tests.
Journalists across the country began to speak out, organizing protests and writing "SOS Press" on sidewalks and walls.
That day, Director Bohorkes was in Washington, D.C., trying to get international support for justice in the Valdés case.
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the murder of Valdes Ramirez accused the authorities of spying on journalists and ordering their deaths because they tell the truth.
After that, she asked not to be given any more government coverage, fearing that anger would damage her objectivity.
Valdes has said many times that journalists in Mexico are "surrounded" by organized crime, its accomplices in government, and an indifferent society.
In his latest book, "Narco-Journalism", he wrote that reporters are not just killed by drug gangs; they are killed by politicians and security services who are in league with organized crime.
The Article 19 Committee for the Protection of the Press believes that half of the attacks on journalists last year were ordered by police and government officials.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to shut you up", says Ramirez.
Of course, murder scares people.
Everyone remembers the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias six years ago in the northern border state of Tamaulipas.
A note was found on her body, presumably written by a Zetas cartel representative: "I'm here because of my articles".
The computer keyboard and headphones were lying next to her severed head.
Some newspapers chose to shut down, like El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after its correspondent Miroslava Brech was killed in March.
Others continue to hold on, like the El Mania of Nuevo Laredo after the murder of its leader in 2004.
In 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juárez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page entitled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have left their home states or even the country.
It's a painful decision.
In exile, it is difficult to find work, and they still look for danger in the streets.
And sometimes they're killed, as apparently happened to photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was killed in 2015 along with four other women in an apartment in Mexico three months after fleeing Veracruz.
Those who stay and continue to work are balancing risky decisions every day.
Ibarra, who once dreamed of being a poet, admits that he is afraid to write about the drug trade.
"Mexico is going to hell", he says, "and that's why I became a journalist".
Last Friday at midnight, when the last issue was ready for printing, the editors of Riodosa were sitting on the sidewalk next to their office, drinking a beer, when suddenly their phones rang at the same time.
A series of shootings between rival gangs and security forces near the resort town of Masatlan left 19 bodies, according to confirmed reports.
The war continued to rage, as promised in a series of cartel messages found in the area.
Sitting on the sidewalk, they posted the news on the website of Riodos on their mobile phones.
The next day, we had to redo the front page.
Sirens go off nearby, another shooting in the vicinity.
Bohorkes checked to see if the police were ready to defend them.
If they were scared, they didn't show it.
Sitting under a huge portrait of their newspaper's late founder, whose middle finger was exposed to the entire Sinaloa, the Riodos employees continued his work.
"How can you think of closing", Bohorkes said, "if on the very day that Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her out to do a story?"
The dinosaur used camouflage to avoid enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, though it is terrifying.
The researchers said that the first remains of an incredible creature the size of a rhinoceros, discovered by a Canadian miner, were so well preserved that experts called it the "Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
It was so well preserved that they were even able to determine that the color of his scaly skin was reddish-brown and say that he had, in a way, a dark past.
A report published in the journal Modern Biology described it as "the best preserved Tireophore in the history of discovery and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world".
This is a fossil -- a recently discovered specimen of a nodosaur that lived in the middle Cretaceous period, between 110 million and 112 million years ago.
Its incredibly good condition has stunned researchers, who call it "really remarkable".
This herbivorous thyreophore is the best-preserved fossil of its kind in the history of discovery, according to an article in National Geographic magazine.
It was found by Sean Fank while working at the Sancor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
He stumbled upon something that seemed to be different from the surrounding breed, and decided to take a closer look.
The fossil he found was sent to the Royal Paleontological Museum of Tirrell.
For the next six years, work was underway to find an animal inside a mass of 2,500 feet (1100 kilograms).
Now that all this hard work is done, the finished product can be demonstrated.
"It's only a little bit of a pinch, and you can almost believe it's asleep", says lead author Caleb Brown, a research associate at the Royal Tirrell Paleontological Museum, where the creature is on display.
It will go down in science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens.
By studying its skin, researchers found that it was a herbivore, and although it was covered in armor and resembled a walking tank, it was apparently in considerable danger from carnivorous dinosaurs.
This powerful armor-covered dinosaur used red-and-white camouflage to hide from predators, and it employed a defensive technique known as defensive dyeing, which is also used by many animals today.
This would allow it to blend in more quickly and avoid encounters with enemies, experts say, suggesting that larger dinosaurs were hunting it.
This 110-million-year-old creature from the family of nodosaurs was widely covered in the press in May, and is now on display at the Royal Tyrrell Paleontological Museum.
Scientists have already studied the animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli in honor of museum lab technician Mark Mitchell, one of the team members who spent more than 7,000 hours digging it out.
The remarkable preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of the scales and plates on his body.
They found a protective dye, a common method of protection in the animal kingdom, which means the top of the creature was darker than its underside.
Although protective dye is well-established, the discovery came as a surprise because the size of the Borealopelta is far larger than that of any animal with protective dye currently in existence.
It's possible that this dinosaur was so actively hunted by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution preferred the disguise of confrontation as a way of survival.
But most of the modern protective-colored animals - such as deer, zebras, or armored cats - are much smaller and more accessible prey, suggesting that the nodosaur had to fight hard to survive.
"The serious predator threat to the massive, powerful armor-covered dinosaur shows just how dangerous the predatory dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period were", Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic compounds in the dinosaur's scales also suggests that its skin must have been reddish-brown.
Scientists continue to study the animal, looking for information about its life, including the preserved contents of its digestive tract, to find out what it ate during its last meal.
They believe that when the dinosaur died, it fell into the river and was swept into the sea, where it sank and lay back down on the ocean floor.
Alberta was as warm as southern Florida is today, and the rivers and oceans likely extended farther inland than they do now.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable in that it's completely covered in preserved scaly skin, and at the same time it's completely preserved in three dimensions, preserving the original animal form", Brown said.
As a result, the animal now looks almost exactly as it did in the Early Cretaceous.
You don't have to use your imagination to recreate it, you just have to look at it a little bit, and you can almost believe it's asleep.
The Cretaceous is the time when giant theropods, two-legged carnivorous dinosaurs, roamed the Earth.
Although the most remarkable of them, Tyrannosaurus rex, lived millions of years later than Borealopelta, the tyrreophorus could have been hunted by one of its formidable ancestors.
They include the acrocanthosaurus, a monster that is 38 feet (11.5 meters) long and weighs six tons.
Scientists whose latest findings are published in the journal Modern Biology believe that Borealopelta was taken to the sea after death and mummified in the seaweed.
The creature was found by Sean Funk while working at the Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in northern Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved thyreophore in the world, along with the skin and armor, and it is intact from the snout to the femur.
On average, these creatures reached about 18 feet (five meters) in length and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1300 kilograms).
Their distinctive feature was two twenty-inch spines protruding from the shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivorous tyreophore struggled to find its way across what is now Canada until a flooded river washed it into the open sea.
But the dinosaur's underwater burial preserved its shell with precision down to the smallest detail.
The fossil remains of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover the furry armor plates along the dinosaur's skull.
As Michael Gresko wrote in an article for National Geographic magazine, the degree of preservation is "seldom as much as winning the lottery".
The longer I look at it, the more amazing it seems.
Fossil remains of the skin still cover the scaly plates that line the animal's skull.
His right front leg is extended along the side, with five toes on it bent upward.
I can count the scales on his soles.
Mikhail Saakashvili managed to get into Poland without documents
Mikhail Saakashvili, who had previously led Georgia and then the Odessa region in Ukraine, flew to Poland.
He did so without any documents confirming his identity and citizenship.
Saakashvili's arrival was reported by the Polish publication Telewizja Republika, which posted a video of his speech on its YouTube channel.
Saakashvili spoke at an event to mark the anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising against Hitler's troops in 1944.
Since the politician does not know Polish, although he tried to start a speech in that language, he had to speak in English through a Polish translator.
During his speech, the politician touched on the topic of cooperation between Georgia and Poland, and also spoke about Ukraine.
The dangerous politician learned that the Ukrainian immigration service had stripped him of his citizenship while he was in the United States.
How he managed to make the transatlantic flight without papers is still unknown.
Earlier, former Odessa region governor Mikhail Saakashvili said that his signature on the application for Ukrainian citizenship was forged.
The politician emphasized that he had not filled out any forms.
Weinsichere and Olkhovik 's case is pending until January .
The preliminary investigation of the case of the co-owner of the Renova group of companies, Evgeny Olkhovik, and the head of the T Plus energy holding company, Boris Weinziher, has been extended until January 2, 2018.
On Thursday, August 3, the Basman Court will hear the question of extending the defendants' house arrest.
The representative of the SC at the meeting announced the decision to extend the preliminary investigation period for the last time.
"The special complexity and duration of the investigation is due to the need to extract and conduct an examination of a large number of documents, as well as conduct investigative actions on the territory of several subjects of the Russian Federation", - said the investigator.
He added that the suspects regularly gave bribes to the Komi leadership.
Their total size is estimated at at least a billion rubles.
According to the investigation, Weinziher, Olkhovik, as well as the former head of the "Complex Energy Systems" ZAO, Mikhail Slobodin, who until September 5 headed the "Vympelkom" company, handed over bribes to high officials of the Komi Republic for setting the most profitable tariffs for heat and electricity, as well as for creating favorable conditions for business.
Weinziher and Olkhovik were arrested, staged in Syktovkar and arrested for two months, Slobodin escaped from the investigation and was declared a federal wanted.
How did one activist find the answer to the question "Whose streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell was shocked to the core.
Just a day after arriving in New York City on a tourist trip, a St. Louis native was sitting on a bed in an Airbnb-rented apartment, watching Facebook on her phone.
She ran into a post from someone in high school.
It said, "Police just killed an 18-year-old boy, and he's still lying in the middle of the street".
Noticing that no one else in her video had posted the information, she was puzzled, and closed Facebook and started Twitter.
Her video had a lot of user posts with the nickname @TheePharoah.
A rapper from Greater St. Louis tweeted the real-time death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old teenager who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's lifeless body lying in the middle of the street, where it would be for four hours.
"This is wild", thought Ferrell.
But death was nothing new to her and her circle.
She put her phone down, and later that night, she went back to tweeting about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
There were pictures of the signage and the screaming people and a man claiming to be Brown's father holding a poster that said, "A Ferguson cop just killed my unarmed son!"
She watched a live broadcast of a police officer standing in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, another policeman, she said, took the hook of his rifle and shouted: "I'll kill you all... animals!"
"This is an unusual situation", Ferrell recalled.
This is not the kind of murder we're used to and can call typical.
At that moment, I felt a chill.
I was angry and I cried.
She took a return flight and flew home the next day.
She landed at 11 p.m., picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father's house, and decided that they would both leave for Ferguson the next morning.
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the subject of a new documentary, Whose Streets?, due out August 11.
It's a story of survival and protest, of love and loss, of strength and resilience from the perspective of people living in communities and filling the streets demanding answers.
As Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter, dressed in a flowery dress and a wreath of color, they recalled a conversation they had had countless times up to that morning, about the black experience and their plight.
She remembers saying, "Remember when I told you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?
We're going to Ferguson now because a cop killed an 18-year-old boy, and it was wrong.
"I couldn't help it", Ferrell said later.
What's happening today is the culmination of what happened before.
She needs to know about it, see it, and be educated about it.
She needs to not only be good at activism and organization, but also understand the different levels of black experience and their situation and what we need to do to become free, to be free.
Even if I can provide her with an environment where she doesn't personally face obvious racism, she's no different than any other black girl.
I feel like I'd be doing her a disservice if I shut her out.
When they arrived in Ferguson, their first stop was South Floresant Road, a site across the street from the police station that had become a tent camp, while activists waited for reports of the eventual acquittal of Officer Darren Wilson.
There, Ferrell and his daughter joined a local entrepreneur who was preparing lunch packs.
They collected the packages and helped distribute them to the protesters.
Little by little, Ferrell's mind took on a new type of activism.
"My activism completely changed after August 9", she said, noting that as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the National Minority Health Students Association, and worked on food justice and health inequality in black communities.
I had no experience organizing.
It came by itself.
A few weeks later, at an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Saba Folian, one of her co-directors.
Folian said she and her chief cameraman, Lucas Alvarado-Ferrari, were simply trying to document the events.
Ferrell had a question in his head: "Do you want to document, or do you want to find a story that you can play on?"
This skepticism was fueled by numerous people, often white, who came to the community to profit from his pain and endurance.
As Folian explained in a recent interview, "We heard that the voices of people who were born and raised in Ferguson are not getting the attention, and we wanted to do it differently".
Folian had already teamed up with co-director Damon Davis, a local artist known for his activism on death row.
His involvement sparked sympathy for the project among Ferrell and six other local residents, with whom the Whose Streets? project team maintained contact for years after Brown's murder.
"In this documentary, no one is speaking for us or with us, we are speaking for ourselves", Davis said.
It was the most important thing to me how these people would be presented, because that's how I would be presented.
And while the goal of the project was not to focus on Ferrell's experience at all, in an effort to show that the movement is not about the leader-savior, but about how the community comes together, as Foley said, she was the most open-minded of the film's participants.
As a result, Whose Streets? shows unexpectedly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, such as how she fell in love and married his wife.
"I felt naked", Ferrell said, laughing about seeing the finished product for the first time.
But I knew that when you do this kind of work and you humanize black people, there has to be some level of vulnerability.
In addition, Ferrell's story again discusses and emphasizes the role of the black homosexual woman in the broader context of the Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement who created the #BlackLivesMatter hashtag on social media after the murder of a black teenager, Trevon Martin, in 2012 - identify themselves as homosexuals.
"Black lesbian women in leadership positions are supporting this whole movement", Ferrell says. "It's because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black gay women have to bear all this burden.
Folian agreed with this statement, noting that the movement is actually supported by black women and many homosexual black women.
However, she insists that this is not a case of positive discrimination, and that Ferrell was not chosen as the central character of the film because of her distinctive features.
"She was the person who was awakening that energy", she said.
On the other hand, it's no coincidence that she came to the forefront because when
You can feel her energy through the screen.
Meanwhile, Ferguson has long since been without cameras, but there are still complex racial ties between the community and the police.
Ferrell will be on probation for another two and a half years for blocking the highway during the demonstration.
She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the place she calls home, simply: Bardack.
She's still holding on to the slang she learned when she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
We must fight for our freedom.
We have to win.
We should love and support each other.
We have nothing to lose but our chains.
Two Salvadorans disqualified for biting U.S. players
El Salvador national team players Henry Romero and Darwin Seren received lengthy suspensions for unsportsmanlike conduct.
During the quarterfinal match of the Gold Cup of the North and Central American and Caribbean Football Confederations (CONKAKAF), the Salvadorans bit American players.
The first to stand out was defender Henry Romero.
The El Salvador man bit the attacker, Jose Altidor, and then pinched him in the chest.
Then, midfielder Seren, in his penalty area, bit the USA defender Omar Gonzalez.
As a result, Romero was disqualified for three matches and Serén for six.
The match ended with the Americans winning 2-0, Goal.com reports.
The origin of the resemblance: artist creates portraits using Chelsea Manning's DNA
In the middle of the hall in the Friedman Gallery in New York, there's a ceiling wire hanging people's faces -- white, black, brown -- all in some subtle way similar to each other.
These 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Harborg from cheekprints and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent me clippings from Fort Leavenworth, where a former intelligence analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for the infamous transfer of confidential diplomatic cables on the WikiLeaks website.
The new exhibition, which opened August 2, is called "The Origin of Similarity".
This is the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey Harburg, whose art blends technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and a famous dissident whose sentence was commuted by Barack Obama just three days before his presidency ended.
By analyzing the DNA obtained from Manning's computer program and using it to create three-dimensional portraits of the individuals who might have had such a genome, Dewey Harburg created a profound, though difficult to grasp, manifesto, not only about the plasticity of DNA data - the various ways of interpreting it and the inherent determinism of those interpretations - but also about the notion of identity.
Manning, who was born Bradley Edward but has openly identified herself as a woman since she was a teenager, was convicted in 2013 of 20 counts, including six counts of violating the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.
Her photos in prison were not available, so only one photograph of her was known: a grainy black-and-white selfie of Manning in a platinum wig, clearly feeling embarrassed, behind the wheel of a car; this is the photo she became associated with.
In 2015, Dewey-Harborgh successfully completed her 2012 project "Visions of Strangers".
In it, she created portraits of unknown people using forensic evidence like pickles and gum, extracting DNA from the rubbish and creating images of what those people might look like.
And then she got an e-mail from Paper Magazine.
"They interviewed Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted some portrait to illustrate the article", Dewey-Hagborg explained at a preview of the new exhibition for the press.
Chelsea wasn't allowed to visit and be photographed at the time, so they contacted her and asked if she wanted a portrait made from her DNA.
In this unusual way, the artist and her imprisoned muse became correspondence friends and exchanged several letters over the course of two years.
They even wrote a comic book, "Repressed Images", illustrated by Sholey Cango, which depicted how the future president would mitigate Chelsea's punishment and allow her to visit the exhibition in person.
That Obama actually decided to release Manning just days after the book was published was a pleasant surprise after seven grueling years in a military prison in Kansas.
There's something profound and powerful about the fact that the exhibition opens right now, when Donald Trump is declaring war on government whistleblowers, and inventing new ways to fuel the hostility on Twitter that he's designed to mitigate.
When Dewey Harburg was asked about the coincidence of all this in time, she said that "nothing happens by chance".
In a statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's huge signature at the bottom (with a heart instead of a dot above the "i" in her last name) calls for an end to "automatic segregation based on gender, race, sexual orientation and culture".
On the opposite side is her mitochondrial DNA, a long caterpillar made of C, G, and A pencils.
By including 200 letters (or nucleotides, as the artist so elegantly puts it scientifically), Dewey-Harborg hoped to show how remarkably similar we all are, at least in our biological structure.
"I hope to explain to people that our genome doesn't define what we are, how open the genetic data is to interpretation and how subjective it is", said Dewey-Harborg, whose 2007 video work "False Memories" is also on display here.
"DNA data can tell us a lot of different stories, and 30 of those stories are here".
The last piece of the exhibition, which fits in one room, is the comic book novel mentioned above.
It shows Manning in a King Kong style over the U.S. Correctional Facility building with a loudspeaker in his hand.
"If they kill your speech, they win", it says.
"So never shut up".
"This is a direct quote from a letter she wrote me", says the artist who greets us from Philadelphia.
"I still get wrinkles when I say it".
Manning hasn't seen the exhibit in person yet -- as it was prophetically portrayed in the comics -- but when she does, she'll be greeted by masks in the center of the room, her own genomic simulacrum, gathered like a crowd of protesters.
This is also done on purpose, as is everything in the exhibition up to the height of 5'2, Manning's height, where the genetic haplogroups were drawn with pencil.
"I used to hang them on the walls, but now I wanted them to look like a crowd", says Dewey Harburg of the portraits.
"I wanted them to be like the mass movement that formed around Chelsea, as a movement that stood for her liberation".
A Northwestern University professor and Oxford University employee is wanted by police on suspicion of murder.
Police say a national search is underway for a Northwestern University professor and an Oxford University employee who are wanted as suspects in connection with the stabbing death of a man in a Chicago luxury apartment.
According to Cook County court records, warrants were issued Monday for the premeditated murder without bail of forty-two-year-old Wyndham Latham and fifty-six-year-old Andrew Warren in connection with their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton G. James Cornell-Duranlo.
According to the documents, twenty-six-year-old Cornell-Duranlo died after being subjected to multiple stab wounds.
A notice issued by the Chicago Police Department says the body was found on July 27.
The police got a call, they came to the Grand Plaza apartment complex and found the victim with multiple wounds on his body.
Cornell-Duranlo was pronounced dead at the scene, officials said, and detectives are now investigating the stabbing death as a homicide, while police are intensifying their search for two suspects.
Latham has been an adjunct professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Kabbage, the university's vice president of communications, said in an emailed statement that Latham was on administrative leave and was barred from entering Northwestern's campus.
"This is a criminal case that is currently being investigated by the authorities and Northwestern University is cooperating with the investigation", Kabbaj said.
Warren is a senior fellow in finance at Oxford University.
A spokesperson for the university and Somerville College said in an emailed statement: "We have contacted the UK police and are ready to provide any assistance necessary to the US law enforcement agencies".
The statement also said that Warren's colleagues were in shock and wanted him to surrender.
Chicago Police Department communications chief Anthony Gulliemi said he strongly advises suspects to turn themselves in.
"The police have suspicions about their whereabouts, but our efforts to find them are intensifying", Gulielmi said.
According to Gulielmi, local, regional and federal authorities are helping to find the suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police were called by the administrator of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received a mysterious message that something had happened in room 1008.
The police called the scene horrible.
Ghulemi said it was unclear whether the incident occurred on July 27.
He said the security camera data confirmed that Latham and Warren were in the building.
"We believe that Professor Latham and the victim were related", Guglielmi said.
The Grand Plaza management issued a statement to the guests, which said: "At this time, the police are working on the timeline of the incident, collecting information about the victim and considering a number of motives, including a possible domestic incident".
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko: "We will fulfill the requirements of the WADA road map in the near future"
Russian Vice Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) conditions for the resumption of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) will be fulfilled in the near future.
"A certain stage in the fulfillment of the requirements was passed, RUSADA got the right to plan and conduct tests together with UKAD (the UK anti-doping agency).
The WADA road map has been updated accordingly", Mutko said on Thursday.
The Prime Minister commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to restore compliance with the Code, which lists the conditions for the resumption of RUSADA's work and was recently published on the organization's website.
According to Mutko, it contains nothing that could pose difficulties for Russia.
"Everything has been announced, everything will be done.
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future", he added.
However, one of the requirements included in the list implies that Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly acknowledge the results of the WADA-commissioned investigation by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren, which claimed that doping in Russian sports is controlled by the state.
On this issue, Mutko said: "We are investigating because our anti-doping system failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there was no government program, and we're not going to admit what wasn't there".
Mutko repeated the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian independent public anti-doping commission.
In an interview with Russian publication Rsport on the same morning, Smirnov acknowledged that there had been problems in the Russian anti-doping structures, but added: "We have repeatedly said that the report contains certain controversial positions and provisions.
No one is going to accept this report", Smirnov added.
WADA suspended RUSADA from conducting doping control in November 2015 following a doping scandal.
However, in June this year, he was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
After visiting the organization's Moscow office in July, WADA Director General Olivier Nigli said that RUSADA was "moving in the right direction" to restore its work.
Fire extinguished in a 79-story tower in Dubai
A major fire in one of the world's tallest residential buildings, The Torch Tower, has been extinguished, Reuters reports.
It is noted that firefighters managed to cope with all the fire to 4.00 local time (3.00 MSK).
Local authorities said no one was injured in the incident.
The streets adjacent to the skyscraper were closed during the fire.
The cause of the incident is still unknown.
Earlier, it was reported that the 79-story residential skyscraper The Torch, one of the tallest buildings in the world, is on fire in Dubai.
All the residents were evacuated in time.
Buzova's incredible outfit shocked fans: pants that don't cover her panties
The scandalous reality show host of "Dom-2" Olga Buzova has amazed the audience of the Europa Plus Live festival with her dancing in her underwear.
In front of thousands of fans, the new singer performed the song "We'll Be Hot" in a duet with Nasty Kudri.
Both girls came on stage in provocative "breeches", sewn in such a way that the singers' underwear was visible.
The pants were marked Buzova and Kudry.
Earlier it was reported that the changes in Buzova's appearance were commented by a specialist of one of Moscow's plastic surgery clinics.
Stoltenberg acknowledged the deterioration of relations between NATO and Russia
This was reported on Friday, August 4, by the news service "Radio 4" with reference to foreign media.
According to him, the Russian authorities are responsible for the deterioration of relations between the West and Russia.
In an interview with CNN, NATO Secretary General also criticized Russia for the situation in Crimea and "destabilization in eastern Ukraine".
At the same time, Stoltenberg assured that dialogue with Russia is nevertheless possible, and further escalation of the situation will not benefit any of its participants.
Earlier on Thursday, US President Donald Trump said that relations between the US and Russia were at a dangerously low level, and blamed the US Congress for this.
Yekaterinburg Metro is learning a new way to pay
In October, travel in the Ekaterinburg metro will be possible to pay with a bank card, said the general director of OJSC "I-Net" Pavel Vedernikov in an interview with the "Obstnaya Gazeta".
Our goal is to introduce the same system of paying for the subway fare for the 2018 World Cup as in other major cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Novosibirsk.
"We want fans from other countries, guests of the World Cup, to be able to use the metro using their bank cards, without buying tokens and standing in line", he said.
Startups that will help your company not become another Uber
Aimee Hermette wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but the polls didn't work.
The answers were often vague, useless, or worse, insincere.
And even though she promised anonymity, some of the staff didn't trust the process.
"He was never consistent or objective", said Errett, who runs Madison Reed, a 75-person e-commerce hair care company in San Francisco.
So she turned to third parties for help.
Now, a new kind of human resources startup is emerging that helps companies find out how their employees feel.
By developing and licensing software that measures employee engagement, they enable companies to do quick surveys, target specific teams and demographic groups, offer employees anonymity and a hotline for complaints, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to bypass top management and contact management directly.
"Now we have tools like Strava and Fitbit for health monitoring, where is Fitbit for your company?" says Jim Barnett, co-founder and president of Redwood City startup Glynt, whose analytics software is used by companies to measure employee engagement.
Errett said she gained a greater understanding of what her employees think and feel over the three years she spent using Glint.
In addition to express surveys and questionnaires of specific teams, the product offers a heat map of the company and shows in visual form which departments have more complaints and which managers have low approval ratings, allowing it to understand why.
Companies are beginning to realize that they need to control the workplace or they will become another Uber that got caught up in the scandal when a former employee posted a blog post describing an aggressive environment in which those who expressed dissatisfaction were punished.
For startups like Glint, this desire to control the situation is an opportunity for profitable business.
The financial technology portal Let's Talk About Payments estimates that the global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020.
Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior, saw a slight increase in interest and activity earlier this year amid a downturn in Uber's reputation.
Convercent has nearly 600 customers, including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
Recently, Uber has become a popular choice.
Like Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized staff opinion polls, collect confidential responses in real time, and view heat maps of problem areas.
It also provides an anonymous text message hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.
And if the top manager is involved, the complaints go straight to the board.
"The court of public opinion has seized power from the inspectors", said Patrick Quinlan, founder and president of Convercent.
If a company is found to be mismanaging or behaving unethically, even if inspectors do not intervene, the company could face costly consequences in the form of customer boycotts, employee outflows and lawsuits, Quinlan said.
Ruby Tuesday, a restaurant chain with over 25,000 employees in 500 locations, has been using Convercent for over a year to make sure employees are aware of the rules and procedures and to offer a simple way to contact the company's headquarters.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she would have to look up a phone number or an email address at the head office, file a formal complaint, and hope that it would be taken seriously.
It was often a scary and awkward experience, said James Vitrano, chief legal officer of Ruby Tuesday, who said there was no normal way to track employee complaints.
Now, when a company uses Convercent, problems that were previously hidden from managers in offices in other cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment, and unfair pay - can be detected and addressed more quickly.
"I can get closer to a holistic, comprehensive understanding of the situation of employees", said Vitrano, who heads the Ruby Tuesday network risk management team.
And we protect our shareholders from employee lawsuits.
According to Quinland, companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement more seriously in 2002, after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed due to ethical violations as a result of the Enron Affair.
But it wasn't until social media became widespread that companies realized they couldn't keep their dirty laundry from spreading online.
"Before technology was used to control ethics, people used hope as a strategy", he said.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service, charging companies regular fees for using their products.
It's a business model and an opportunity that has been embraced by venture capitalists who have backed both startups.
In February, Convercent received $10 million in funding from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, bringing the company's total capital to $47 million.
Glint received $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners, bringing the company's total capital to $60 million.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.
A growing body of research shows that employees today expect more from their jobs than ever before.
In highly competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high wages and exciting projects are just the bare minimum.
Employees want to feel accepted and appreciated, and that they are giving their time to a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy working at a company, when they feel heard, and when they feel that the work they do is productive, they are more likely to make the company successful", says Nina McQueen, vice president of global benefits and employee satisfaction at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors get a return when their portfolio companies do well; companies do well when their employees are committed and engaged.
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase employee loyalty and engagement, it's no surprise that they're finding support.
Workplace culture experts say it's important to have data on employee engagement.
But the data is useless until the trustees take action.
In fact, if a company asks employees for feedback, it can create the impression that change is coming.
And if change doesn't happen fast enough, or doesn't happen at all, it can lead to frustration and employees losing interest.
"If you're going to ask for 4,000 suggestions, you should be prepared to have 4,000 conversations", says Russell Rutt, president of consulting at management firm Kotter International, who has seen companies make the mistake of relying too much on data collection.
Because if you don't go all the way, the staff will think, "Did you really hear me?"
You don't care about that?
If you don't care, why shouldn't I?
According to Errett, Madison Reed, which now conducts monthly employee surveys, is able to take action the same day someone reports a problem using Glint.
And, after collecting feedback from employees who were unhappy with the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and introduce communication training to solve the problems.
Ruby Tuesday is learning more about its employees and hopes that in the long run, this knowledge will help it retain employees more effectively in an industry known for high turnover.
"If you don't try to create a culture of transparency, you're going to lose people", Vitrano said.
If you lose people, you lose customers.
And if you lose customers, you lose the company.
In Barnaul , a new asphalt is being laid on the Red Army Avenue
In Barnaul, drastic measures were taken to eliminate the cause of asphalt failure on the Red Army Avenue.
The place where twice there were holes on the recently paved road (crossroad with the street Youth), decided to "open".
A small section of the road near the tramway tracks collapsed because of a landslide in the area of the unused land.
According to the deputy chairman of the city committee on road, land use, transport and communications Ivan Garmat, for detailed examination and elimination of the prerequisites for the collapse will conduct a detailed examination.
Depending on the results, the necessary measures will be taken.
It is expected that the unmanned communications will require the restoration of the embankment and their concrete.
This is reported on the official website of the regional capital.
The Bruins are having to work longer because the National Student Athletic Association has canceled practice twice a day.
As the time approaches 11 p.m., a crowd of UCLA football players lingers to chat on one side of the team's new training grounds located on campus.
Some of them were pulling their T-shirts, their backs shining with sweat after a tense first day of camp.
For many team players, these minutes of idleness are a midday break.
Players who are enrolled in summer training will return to their dormitories after three hours of training to prepare for final exams, and return to the Wasserman Football Center the next morning for a 6:30 meeting.
Just before Monday turned into Tuesday, Bruins coach Jim More said, "These guys are gonna get a meat cleaver in the next three days".
The fact that the National Student Athletic Association canceled practice twice a day, which was designed to reduce the burden on the players, actually extended their workday  at least until the end of the exams on Friday.
So the UCLA team's first three games were set for 7:15 p.m. to fit in with the already tight schedule.
A side effect of not having two workouts a day has been more days with one workout, with the Bruins moving the start of camp almost a week from last year and training during summer school for the first time in More's six seasons at Westwood.
The team is scheduled to play 18 games through August 20 before officially preparing for their first game of the season against Texas A&M in September.
Mora said he supports the National Student Athletic Association's rule change, despite the fact that it has added another item to the tight schedule.
"For three or four days we give them this huge load, it's a serious test", said Mora.
And they just got over it, they're working, they're great guys.
I think when we get to Saturday and we have more time, it'll be really great.
When the camp ends, the University of California, Los Angeles will make the practice field closed, a difficult task, since its fields are in direct view from the adjacent parking lot and from the nearby Laskin Center, an expensive hotel that has already been bombarded with footballs that have overrun the security grid behind the gates.
The Bruins are due to be booked into the hotel this weekend, but Mora admits that when the rooms are available during the season, there may be a problem.
"We'll have security", said Mora.
This is a serious problem, and I'm not exaggerating the danger by suggesting that someone could rent a room and sit there and record the workout on video.
If you have a video of a training session, it's pretty serious.
But we'll have security there and security at parking lot number eight.
We'll do everything we can with what we have.
I'm not gonna worry about it too much.
We have a plan.
All victims of the St. Petersburg terror attack have been discharged from hospitals
All victims of the April attack on the St. Petersburg subway have been discharged from hospitals.
This was reported in the press service of the vice-governor Anna Mityanina.
According to data at the end of July, three people remained in the hospitals, reports "TV Center".
The explosion in the St. Petersburg metro took place on April 3 of this year.
The bomb was detonated by suicide bomber Akbarjon Jalilov.
The attack killed 15 people, including the perpetrator.
The criminal case has led to the arrest of 11 people, including the alleged organizer Abror Azimov.
Recall that the day before, the Rospotrebnadzor recommended the St. Petersburg metro to review the plan of measures to ensure transport safety, in particular, increasing the number of metal detectors.
Facebook is stepping up fact-checking in the fight against fake news
Facebook will more often send texts suspected of being falsified to independent experts and show their conclusions under the original posts, the world's largest social network said on Thursday, as it tries to combat so-called fake news.
In a statement on its website, the company said it is starting to use improved machine learning algorithms to recognize possible spoofs, send them for verification, and possibly show the fact-checking results below the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main channels for the spread of so-called fake news, which many believe influenced the 2016 US presidential election.
The issue is also being debated in Europe after French voters were misled by false reports ahead of the presidential election in May, and Germany, ahead of the September election, said it supported a plan to fine social media if they did not promptly remove hate-mongering posts.
In a separate statement in German, Facebook said Thursday it was testing a new fact-checking algorithm that has been launched in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing which posts are disputed by independent reviewers, people want a broader context to make informed judgments about what they read and share", Sarah Sue, Facebook News Feed Manager, wrote in her blog.
She added that Facebook will continue to test the "linked articles" feature and work on other changes to the news feed to address the issue of fake news.
To create a comic novel: One castle in English history
In the recent past, the tiny Scottney Castle was featured in the music video "Squeeze", and in the '70s and '80s, it served as a safe haven for Margaret Thatcher.
But 700 years from his cozy home in the Beule River valley in Kent, he's been watching the tumultuous history around him, and now he's inspired Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with a bearded hair and a penchant for historical documents, to write a comic novel.
"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of a man who died 300 years ago", he says enthusiastically.
"You feel it so personal when you hold that letter in your hand".
"A Castle in England" covers the period from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian era and tells of the families who lived in Scotney; each story was illustrated by one of the young British artists - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Bryony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not Rhodes' first book to be based on archival data: in 2014 he wrote Dead Man's Teeth and Other Stories, a collection of British Library documents, a project that unexpectedly touched him deeply.
"I could be torn apart by a fingerprint on the edge of a letter written in the 1700's by a double agent working for the Jacobites", he says.
"This is his fingerprint".
And letters always smell like smoke, because in those days, they used to light a fire.
And 300 years from now, in the future, you feel like you're there too.
Oh, how I love the archives!"
For someone so obsessed with old paper, getting a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Arts Council of England and living in a castle for four months ("I've been staying there a little bit, to be honest") seems too good to be true.
Rhodes spent days studying the "new" Victorian castle, going through the archives and examining the estate's many treasures and antiquities - such as the heads of hyenas on the walls or bottles that had been lying in a ditch for centuries.
He walked through the park and the ruins of the old castle, talking to foresters, gardeners and sometimes the artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
Then at night he "drunk whiskey and sat down to write".
The history of Scotney Castle is not well-studied, because the National Trust only gained full access to it in 2006, when the last heiress, Elizabeth Hassey, died.
When Rhodes arrived ten years later, the staff had only begun to dig into the archive, which he describes as "something aristocrats have been dumping in the attic for centuries".
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps showing who owned what: "You might think land disputes are boring", says Rhodes, "but here's a birch that two families fought over.
It happens, you guys!"
In some stories in the collection, the castle becomes a starting point for broader searches into English history: for example, in The Workman, the hero leaves the newly built castle to join the Peasant Revolution of 1381.
"There is a record of a rebellion that took place in the castle in 1380, in a book called The Knights of Kent and Sussex", says Rhodes.
"The peasant uprising started in these places, and I thought that the uprising was a good start.
Maybe they were connected?"
Other plots are strongly connected with the castle's history - for example, "The Priest", which tells of a Jesuit priest whom the Darrel family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or "The Smuggler", about 18th-century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who is believed to have faked his own funeral by stuffing his coffin with stones (this was discovered years later when the coffin was dug up).
The Darrells are the Rhodes family's favorite of all Scotney residents: "The gentlemen seem to have been complete swindlers, always in debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
In different generations, the Darrell men have solved their debt problems by marrying wealthy older women - I imagine them as a company of handsome young men who know how to look after the heirs of great fortunes".
After completing his work at Rhodes Castle, he looks for other opportunities to gain unique writing experience.
He spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness, where he wrote a graphic novel about Elamyanmäki - a place where in the early 20th century there was a sanatorium, and then it was again covered with forest.
But Scotny is still a special place for him.
"I was sad to leave", he says.
"I was like, 'Oh, shit, I need to get back to real life again.'
Fifteen of the largest banks are choosing Russia.
The conflict in the Association of Russian Banks (ARB) is developing: after Sberbank, VTB, VTB-24, Alfa-bank, Gazprombank, Rosselkhozbank, Binbank and FC "Ockrytie", seven more credit organizations are going to leave this public organization.
Thus, the share of the outgoing organizations will be at least 80 percent of the market.
But this is not a simple solution - all the banks that have announced the break with the Russian Development Bank are negotiating with another public organization that unites credit institutions, the Association of Regional Banks "Russia", headed by the famous politician Anatoly Aksakov, chairman of the State Duma Committee on the Financial Market, recognized, by the way, by the results of the last session and the most effective head of the Duma committee and a deputy by the number of draft laws.
The beginning of the conflict within the ARB was laid during the discussion in the Federation Council, when the Interregional Banking Council was considering new draft laws, in particular, suggesting a new classification of banks depending on the size of the authorized capital.
Then Garegin Tosunyan, the president of the ARB, stated that, in the opinion of the association, this bill is adopted in the interests of the largest banks, which are thus trying to limit the opportunities of small and medium banks in the regions, intercepting their clientele.
Among other claims, criticism was made of the Central Bank, which, according to Tosunyan, does not always justifiably revoke licenses from some banks, which, however, was followed by an objection from the representative of the Central Bank: many of the heads of the banks that have been affected, in particular, Vneshprombank, were in the governing bodies of the Asian Development Bank.
Apparently, this exchange of mutually exclusive opinions in a very sensitive relationship with the main regulator of the banking environment and became a visible reason for the fifteen largest banks, saying disagreement with the policy of the Russian Federation, began to prepare for joining the association "Russia", noting that "the efficiency of the work of the Russian Federation is at a low level, and constructive dialogue within the banking community is not actually carried out".
The depositors will be better off.
How does it end?
Let us answer the main question that arises at the slightest breakdown or conflict in the banking sector or near it: depositors are not threatened, rather, on the contrary, the reliability of the banking system will increase.
Anatoly Aksakov, known for his meticulousness in everything that concerns the interests of banks and their clients, is the head of "Russia", a high-level professional who is highly valued in the Central Bank: almost all the leadership of the Central Bank is present at the annual events of the association, and all the significant legislative initiatives of the regulator pass through the expert evaluations of "regionals".
There is no doubt that the personnel and organizational situation will not be particularly challenged.
Undoubtedly, the ARB is in a difficult financial and managerial situation after losing such powerful and influential players with their contributions and lobbying opportunities.
However, this oldest banking community organisation, established in 1991, has considerable potential to continue to improve banking legislation and the wider area of money-lending.
It is not to be said that even the "Russia" association is ready to accept new members with open arms, judging by the reaction of its head, Anatoly Aksakov ("maybe they want too much"), who said on July 21 at a briefing in the press center of the Parliamentary newspaper that "literally the next day, representatives of the banks that left the Russian Federation asked me to consider the possibility of increasing the potential of our association "Russia".
Their proposals are to strengthen the voice of bankers in the Association Council, as well as to pay more attention to new banking technologies.
The negotiation process is underway, the proposals of both sides are being studied, the agenda of the extraordinary congress of the association is being prepared, which will be held in Sochi in mid-September within the framework of the international banking forum.
That's where we'll decide.
Also, Anatoly Aksakov, stressing that "he does not hold a chair", named Georgy Luntovsky as a possible new head of the updated "Russia" association, who leaves the post of Deputy Chairman of the Central Bank in September, highlighting his business and human qualities.
On August 18, Anatoly Aksakov, who is currently on vacation in Crimea, plans to break off his vacation for one day and arrive in Moscow for the extraordinary meeting of the Council of the "Russia" association, where it is planned to consider the agenda of the extraordinary congress of "Russia".
The entry of cars with petrol engine in Russia 's major cities will not be limited
Deputy head of the Ministry of Transport Nikolai Asaul said that, contrary to media reports, the entry of cars with a petrol engine into the major cities of Russia will not be limited.
It's a more radical form of our concept.
Our concept is to gradually raise the green class.
And there's the concept of going zero-emission right away.
I don't think we're technically ready for that.
The question is, since when?
It's like a slogan, let's ban it.
Where and when?
What about tomorrow?
Shall we lock down the whole town?
"In 20 years - I don't know, maybe it will happen", Prime quotes the minister.
Earlier, the newspaper "Izvestia" reported that by August 17, Vice-Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich was instructed to study the proposals on possible options for state support of electric transport, submitted to the government by the General Director of PJSC KamAZ, Sergei Kogogin.
Among the proposals, according to the newspaper, is the use of cars with DVR in major cities and resorts.
Washington is changing the rules for green cards.
According to media reports, President Donald Trump has announced that a new U.S. immigration plan will be adopted, which will change the rules for obtaining a green card.
The plan includes reducing the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 a year, stricter rules for obtaining temporary work visas and restrictions on obtaining family visas.
The new rules are proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the president.
The bill will be debated in both houses of Congress.
This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages, and save taxpayers billions of dollars, and it will do so by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will reduce chain migration and replace the existing scheme.
The new application process will give advantages to candidates who speak English, have the financial resources to support themselves, and have the skills to benefit our economy", Trump said, according to US media.
Sex robots are real, and we should be concerned.
Just before we thought 2017 could be the worst year ever, a new report came out on the technological advances in sex robots.
- I know.
Sex robots are the focus of attention.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.
According to Noel Sharkey, professor emeritus of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we need to take their emergence seriously.
Users will be able to choose the color of the robot's eyes, the shape of its nipples, and the type of its nails.
"People are giggling about it, but companies are already sending them to consumers in large numbers, and we're going to see a lot more of them soon", Sharkey said at the launch of the new report.
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable counterparts into silicone-skinned robots, warm to the touch, with near-human replicas controlled by artificial intelligence.
Users can also customize their robots to their liking, choosing everything from the color of the robot's eyes and the shape of its nipples to the shape and color of its nails.
But the fact that many robots have an "identity" that would make the Stepford Woman seem very progressive is even more disturbing.
Modern sex dolls have become silicone-skinned robots.
For example, RealBotix robot allows users to customize in their robots qualities that they find attractive, such as shyness.
There are also Roxxxy Gold sex robots designed by True Companion, which come with a pre-programmed personality - for example, Cold Farra is shy, and Wild Wendy has a bold personality.
"Roxxy Gold has a personality that fits you perfectly", reports the website True Companion.
So she likes what you like, she doesn't like what you don't like, and so on.
She's in a mood during the day, like a real person!
She might want to sleep or talk, or she might be in the mood!"
There are many concerns about the advent of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the most disturbing is the subordinate image of the woman, the associations with rape that are caused by the possession of the Cold (read: Resistant) Light.
The True Companion website compares Roxxxy to a vibrator, only for men.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?" the website says.
But these sex robots aren't just fetishes or just new sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing complexity points to something darker and deeper in our culture, a shift away from the ideal of gender equality toward the desire for sex with submission as an optional addition.
Most men will not buy sex robots, of course, and while FRR notes their growing popularity, they remain on the periphery of consumer culture for now.
But what is being reported to us from the periphery can be very instructive about the meaning of the age in which we live.
And many people aren't bad or aggressive until the free market gives them the opportunity.
It's no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots emerged at a time when women's rights around the world were under threat, with a president in the White House who boasts of harassing women.
The scariest thing about "The Handmaid's Tale" isn't the graphic images, the twisted bodies and the squinting eyes, but how realistic the vision seems.
The Republic of Gilead is an exaggeration, but it doesn't seem so big now.
The goal of the sex robot industry is to achieve the physical resemblance to real women (only with the proportions of porn stars) that technology allows.
Their creators want them to look human by touch, to copy the movements of the human body.
But it's the characteristics that make robots different from real women.
They can't break up with their partners or walk away from them.
They have no life, no biography, nothing that would indicate independence or anything else that would destroy the illusion of total dependence.
In other words, they're beautiful slaves.
Or, as they say in 2017, maids.
Los Angeles native Eugene (Puh) Jeter, who has been playing for the Ukrainian national team since 2013, will not help our national team at the European Championship in basketball, the final part of which starts on August 31.
This was reported by the general manager of the "blue-yellow" Andrey Lebedev in an interview with the portal BeBasket.
We tried to arrange with Jeter, but unfortunately he's not coming due to family circumstances.
We're going to EuroBasket without a naturalized player, because we don't want to take someone we don't know.
"This situation will give opportunities for the development of our young players", he said.
I'll remind you: with the direct participation of Jeter, the Ukrainian team took a record sixth place at the EuroBasket-2013 and for the first time got to the world championship in basketball, where the "yellow-blue" could not overcome the group stage, and the native of the USA scored an average of 15.4 points per game, made 3 selections and gave 5 passes.
Jeter has not played for the Ukrainian national team since the departure of the head coach of our national team, the American Mike Fratello, who left this position in 2015.
The 2017 Men's EuroBasket will be held simultaneously in four countries: Turkey, Romania, Israel and Finland.
The Ukrainian team will play their group matches in the Promised Land.
Evgeny Murzin 's team will play five matches in group B: against Germany (August 31), Italy (September 2), Georgia (September 3), Lithuania (September 5) and Israel (September 6).
In the framework of preparation for the tournament, our men's team held two control matches, in which they lost to the Dutch and the Belarusians.
The great feat of Trump?
Playing Mitt Romney seems reasonable.
In the Trump era, it's become commonplace that the political disputes that have polarized the American electorate have broken up some families on a micro level.
Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, the American newspapers were full of columns on how to deal with the terrible relatives voting for Trump.
I think we're all so tense, we're about to explode.
There's less talk of Trump's ability to bring families together.
I'm writing this because my cousin, a left-wing poet from Chicago who's been at odds with Republicans in her family for a long time, came to see me in New York this week.
It reminded me that uniting against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
With Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including her Republican brother, with whom she's had decades of political arguments, suddenly and strangely finds themselves on the same side.
At dinner, it's certainly good; but I can't help but think that in a broader context it can be quite dangerous.
Trump has infused power into the left flank, but the deforming effect of his rule could shift us all to the right.
When we talk about Trump and normalization, we mean the unlikely possibility that one day we'll stop being amazed by his antics.
There is, however, an even more dubious scenario in which Trump "normalizes" the most right-wing Republicans, who, against his standards, will suddenly appear to be a model of common sense.
I caught myself missing the old-fashioned craziness of Mitt Romney today -- with a dog on the roof of a car and a 14 percent income tax (but we at least knew what his tax return looked like) -- compared to Trump, and both seem like very minor evils.
When Trump leaves, the next Republican candidate will just have to be in his head to see a huge leap forward.
When my cousin went downtown, we took the kids to the Central Park carousel -- the largest carousel in the New York City Parks Department and the best way to spend three dollars in the city if you don't need caffeine.
The horses are formidable and huge, the fiberglass figures on the central drum - the grimacing clowns and the animals who, bent over, stare in terror at their backs - are extremely sinister, and the ringing music, strangely enough, is delightful.
So many things are disappointing about this city: the views from the skyscrapers are getting old, the building silhouettes are too crowded to cause a tremor, and the reality of the city is not keeping up with the dream.
Thirty-five years later, I still remember the day I found out that the Swiss Cottage district was not really a Swiss chalet (not counting the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage themed pub), but a large circular crossroads in North London.
And the carousel in Central Park is still an unusual, magical place where a two-year-old, an eleven-year-old, and two women in their forties can have a great time.
If I could give the carousels a grade, I'd give them an A, but luckily, nobody asked me to.
And at the department store this week, I was asked to rate my shopping experience on a scale of one to five stars before I put the card through the terminal.
The coffee shop on the corner of my street is the same plus the option to keep the rate of 15% is by ordering from the counter.
As a result, not only is the neutral interaction slowed down, but you have to bring personal touch to a situation that doesn't require it.
The poor shopkeeper at the department store was smiling confused as I tiredly rated my experience of giving her a five-star credit card.
Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital for chest pains
Pistorius is leaving prison for his second doctor's visit.
Last year, he was transferred to a hospital for treatment of cuts to his wrists, which prison officials say were caused by a fall in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of premeditated murder after the prosecution appealed the original verdict for manslaughter.
He killed Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine's Day 2013, shooting her multiple times through the bathroom door of his Pretoria home.
Pistorius claimed that he mistook his girlfriend for a night thief who was hiding in his bathroom.
The prosecution has announced its intention to file another protest, this time against the six-year term of Pretorius, which it says is too lenient.
The Attorney General's Office said it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal would be heard this year.
The pretorious's term could be extended by 15 years if the prosecution succeeds.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
Suspect in NTV journalist beating picked up no-go subscription
The capital's law enforcement officials have chosen a restraining order in the form of a no-go letter for the man who attacked NTV journalist Nikita Razvozzzayev during a live broadcast from Gorky Park on August 2.
This is reported by TASS with reference to the official representative of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation Irina Wolf.
"In the investigation of a criminal case initiated under Article 116 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation ("Fighting") against a 32-year-old man who hit the face of a correspondent of one of the TV channels in the Central Park of Culture and Leisure named after Gorky, the suspect was chosen a measure of restraint in the form of a subscription not to leave and proper behavior", - said Volk.
The Interior Ministry spokeswoman added that an administrative protocol was drawn up against the suspect for disobeying the police.
On Wednesday, August 2, during a live broadcast of the VDV Day, an unstable man approached the reporter and slapped him in the face.
As it turned out, the bully had nothing to do with the VDV.
According to Razvozzzayev, the paratroopers, on the contrary, tried to detain the Muscovite.
Two Bulgarian citizens detained in Greece for illegal tent-parking
According to the Bulgarian Foreign Ministry, two Bulgarian citizens were detained in Greece for illegal tenting.
On the morning of August 1, a group of people, including two Bulgarian citizens, were detained in Sitonia for setting up tents in a wrong place.
They were released the same day while the investigation was still ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the TV channel Би-Ти-Ви that the Bulgarian citizens were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camping and are already imposing heavy fines on anyone caught parking in a non-camping area.
The tests will be conducted throughout the season.
According to the ministry, the court can impose a fine.
Russian Foreign Ministry accused US Vice President of Cold War rhetoric
Statements made during the European tour of US Vice President Michael Pence were criticized by the Russian Foreign Ministry.
"With regret, we have to state that Washington is increasingly falling back on the primitive ideological stamps of the Cold War era, which are completely detached from reality", the Russian foreign ministry said in a statement.
This is how the Foreign Ministry reacted to Pence's words about the "Russian threat" and attempts to forcefully re-create the borders, which he said in Podgorica.
The Russian Foreign Ministry pointed to the destructiveness of the choice "either with the West or with Russia" and the lack of clarity of the thesis about the allegedly alternative entry of all South-Eastern Europe into NATO.
Russian diplomats also recalled that it was the United States that violated international law by using force to push Kosovo away from Serbia and thus created another hotbed of tension.
"We urge our American colleagues to stop shaming Russia and its foreign policy, which is based on respect for partners and readiness for constructive work, on mutual consideration of interests", the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
A paramedic was injured in an accident with an ambulance in Moscow.
The accident occurred in Stupinos, near Moscow, as a result of the collision of the car with the ambulance, the ambulance was injured.
Today at around 08:10 a Mitsubishi car collided with an ambulance in the city of Stupinos, Moscow region.
"As a result of the collision, the car "speed" overturned", - said TASS in the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Moscow region.
Law enforcement is on the scene, and the circumstances of the accident are being investigated.
In Odessa, a woman threw her newborn son off the construction site, wrapping him in a cellophane bag.
On the evening of August 3, a local resident reported to the Razdelnyan police station that he had found a baby in a private house that had not been rebuilt.
"Law enforcement officers and doctors arrived at the scene and quickly took the child to the medical facility", the Odessa National Police headquarters said.
M.E. determined the boy was born hours before he was discovered, as evidenced by the presence of the umbilical cord.
During the first-stage investigative measures, the identity of the 36-year-old local woman who gave birth was established.
It's also been established that the woman has three other young children.
The family had not been in the eyes of law enforcement before and had not been on special record.
The police are currently investigating the circumstances and reasons that led the woman to commit the act, and a procedural decision will be made.
The baby is under medical supervision.
As previously reported, a 21-year-old woman in Nikolayev threw her unborn child into a garbage can.
Grigory Leps: "I'm going to fight, even though 55 is not 30"
One of the most successful artists of the Russian stage, Grigory Leps, will celebrate his 55th birthday next Sunday.
Before the celebration, the singer chatted with the commentator of "Izvestia".
I remember you celebrating your "pilgrimage".
A special tent in the "Luzniks", Gloria Gaynor sang for the anniversary, a powerful salute over the Moscow river.
You must have been pretending to spend your next five years.
Did you get the plan?
Professionally, it was a good time.
I worked hard, toured the country three times, gave 120-130 shows a year.
He's put out two good albums.
Of course, I'm not the same person I was 20 years ago.
The biological clock is not a trick.
Singing the way I did in my 30s is getting harder.
But I'm going to fight, I don't want to stop.
I think I'm getting to a whole new level with new people.
You're recording a new album with them, your first in three years.
Yeah, we're working on it now.
Actually, we've already recorded it in my studio and we're sending it to LA for review.
It's called "Why Are You So Serious?" after the song of the same name, which was co-written with Timati.
It's not quite ready yet, so we haven't put it out yet.
We'll do it later when we get the video.
And the album will be released in November, for my anniversary concert series at the Crocus City Hall in Moscow.
Your new record has been hand-picked by the great American drummer Chris Coleman.
You were gonna bring him on your tour, weren't you?
I think Coleman is one of the greatest drummers in the world today.
He'd come to my studio, record his songs.
I offered him to join my band, and Jeremy Coulson offered.
But for a long-term job in Russia, they put forward, to put it mildly, excessive conditions.
The fees were between €35,000 and €45,000 a month.
I thought I'd find some decent musicians in the post-Soviet space.
And I found a great drummer, Max Malyshev.
It's better to feed your own.
Sometimes I want to get on one of them, and I don't know why.
For example, guitarist Fyodor Dosumov is highly cited internationally.
He's in Western music magazines, he's invited to various guitar festivals.
Steve Vai, after hearing him play, said that "a new generation of guitarists has arrived, with a different performance technique".
Your album is being recorded in Los Angeles, American musicians are collaborating with you, but you still can't come to the U.S.
Are you trying to lift that ban?
I'm not doing anything right now, to be honest.
There are a number of lawyers who are dealing with this issue.
As a musician, I'm really sorry that I can't get to America.
I told you I was going to school there.
The more you interact with real professionals, the more useful it is.
We're not as stupid as they are, but we don't have that kind of experience, school.
For 70 years, our popular music performers have not been faced with the challenges that American musicians have always faced.
They were trying to get the best sound possible.
And I try to follow the same principles.
Now, for some reason, the UK has refused me entry for ten years.
But I'm still going to apply for a visa every year to the British embassy to be allowed to go back and, most importantly, to work there.
The rest of Europe is treating me favorably.
And you're planning a concert in Monaco in August, not a custom one, but a poster one, right?
Yes, there's a nice gym in Monte Carlo, I've played there once.
They've invited me back, and as far as I know, all the tickets to the concert are sold out.
Are you going to the Lyme Waikoule Rendezvous, which starts on July 20th in Jurmala?
She invited me, and I, of course, accepted.
Lime is a wonderful singer and a wonderful woman who can give herself both a beautiful vocal and even a whisper.
After the tours and the anniversary concerts, as far as I know, you're looking for a new artist.
You've got two albums of his songs in your catalog.
When's the third coming out?
Probably next year.
But it's going to be made completely different.
I want to record about 80 or 90 of Vysotsky's songs in about the same way he did.
Just the voice and the guitar.
No other arrangements.
I will be accompanied by our famous musician Timur Vedernikov.
I'll try to get Alexander Yakovlevich Rosenbaum to play on the album.
I've been talking to him about it, we have a good relationship, but he's a busy man, so we'll see how it goes.
You and Boris Grebenshchikov's songs have gradually entered your repertoire.
Maybe you could do an album of his stuff later?
Boris Borisovich is a wonderful man and a great musician.
I met him several times and asked if I could sing one of his songs.
He would say, "Gregory, I write songs to be performed".
Please try it. Sing it.
I think it's interesting to record an album like that.
I don't have a project like this yet, but in the future, in a year or two, if Boris Borisovich doesn't mind, I might do one.
Unless you're focused on your production center.
I assume you haven't realized its potential, signed all the artists you're interested in?
There are a number of performers I wish I had under my wing, but they're independent, accomplished people.
You mean Sergei Lazarev?
Serja is a brilliant singer, I invited him.
I may disagree with his repertoire, but he's a professional and he has his own development strategy.
And at my center now is Alexander Panayotov, whom I led in The Voice.
We've got a contract with him and we're working.
In our pop music, singers like that are rare.
It will be a real shame if he doesn't reach the heights he deserves.
I'm trying to get him a repertoire, I'm making videos.
I hope it's a good result.
I also try to promote other artists at my center: I buy them songs, I pay poets, sometimes their tracks get in the rotation of TV and radio channels.
If they don't reach great heights, I'll still bring our cooperation to a logical conclusion.
They'll get a recording, a couple of videos.
And then, if they want to, they can go their own way, and I'm not going to insist that they get their money back.
Although I'd be happy if one of them was commercially successful and paid me the interest we agreed on in the contract.
But if that doesn't happen, I'm not gonna cut off anyone's oxygen.
Let everyone work, make it, prove it, like I once proved it.
If you were offered a tour of Ukraine tomorrow and guaranteed entry, would you go?
I'm still invited to it.
It's mostly closed events.
As for the big tour...
I am a citizen of my country, a Russian, and I believe I flew to Syria on the same plane that crashed.
If they tell me tomorrow to fly somewhere else for the good of the country, I'll fly.
And I don't care what the bloggers and other critics think of me.
I'm really sorry that this is the situation we're in with Ukraine.
Because I believe we are one people and we should be together.
I'm afraid that's unlikely to happen, at least not for a while.
I used to give 40-50 concerts a year in Ukraine.
We met like we never met.
A very grateful audience.
And he worked with several Ukrainian artists: Ani Lorak, Svetá Loboda, Artem Loik...
There are a lot of talented people in Ukraine, and it is a real shame that they cannot now fully unleash their talent on a broad Russian audience.
Music should unite and entertain people.
I would be happy to invite some great Ukrainian artist to Russia, like Slav Vakartchuk, and do a concert with him.
But I think it's unlikely at this point...
Andrei Okhlopkov was transferred from the spaceport
As it became known to "Ъ", the technical director of the East cosmodrome Andrey Ochlopkov started working at the State Space Scientific-Productive Center (GKNPC) named after Hruchnitchev.
Previously, he de facto engaged in the construction of the East spaceport, but due to disagreements with the management of the Center for the exploitation of terrestrial and space infrastructure (CENKI) was transferred to the enterprise in Moscow Filhas, where he will coordinate production.
Mr. Ochlopkov will not have a shiftman: the post of technical director will most likely be abolished, and the functional will be dispersed among the units of the Central Election Commission.
The technical director of the Eastern and the deputy director general of the Central Scientific and Technological Institute for Technological Development, Andrey Ochlopkov, has moved to work at the Khruchnitchev-named State-owned Nuclear Power Plant, top managers of several space industry enterprises, as well as a government official, told "Ъ".
"He has been working on the new post for several weeks", the industry source told Kommersant.
The Central Intelligence Agency failed to get an operational comment on Thursday, and Mr. Ochlopkov himself was unavailable for comment.
However, the information "Ъ" officially confirmed in the GKNPC.
He decided to move to the position of director for production coordination, - said the company. - Andrei Ochlopkov fully fulfilled the task set before him to ensure the launch minimum for the first launch at the Vostokny spaceport.
Mr. Ochlopkov joined the Central Intelligence Agency in 2013, having served in the space forces, in particular at Baikonur, and in Plesetsk - at the "northern" spaceport, holding the post of first deputy commander in the rank of colonel.
In 2009, Andrey Ochlopkov became a defendant in a criminal case.
The investigation accused him of bribery: allegedly from his submission, regional commercialists received state orders for refusal, but did not fulfill their obligations to clean up the separated parts of the launchers in the Arkhangelsk region and the Komi Republic.
In 2012, a jury found him not guilty.
The tasks assigned to him in the CENKI for technological development were extended to different projects, but the main one was the construction of a spaceport in the Far East.
Oleg Ostapenko, then head of the Federal Space Agency, said in an interview with "Kommersant" that the situation in the Eastern "was critical already in October 2013".
The fact is that a strategic mistake was made in the planning: the completion of the construction and the first launch of the Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle were planned for the same time - the end of 2015.
To complete the start-up before the end of the year, the construction was decided to be completed six months earlier and the deadlines were moved from December to July 2015.
To speed up the process, the experts of the Central Electrotechnical Institute began to carry out parallel installation of technological equipment on unbuilt objects.
The main proponent of this idea was Andrei Ochlopkov.
Despite the risks and the postponement (instead of December 2015, the Soyuz flew on April 28, 2016), the idea proved to be a good idea, says a source at the spaceport: "Otherwise we would not have made a single launch from the Eastern, but would have been building".
Vice-Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, who oversaw the creation of the spaceport, jokingly called Andrei Ochlopkov his "cosmic Susanin", but it was almost always him who requested information about the progress of construction.
Mr. Ochlopkov also remembered the directness: for example, in an interview with "Kommersant" he proposed to deprive the Federal Agency for Special Construction (Spekström) of the status of the only contractor in the Eastern Region and to work directly with subcontractors: "Why should we put all the eggs in one basket of Spekström?"
This idea has found support in the government.
Since 2017, CENKI has taken on the duties of the general contractor to complete the construction and installation work on the start-up and technical complex by the scheduled fourth quarter of the start-up.
According to "Ъ", the reason for Mr. Ochlopkov's transfer to the new place of work was disagreements with the management of the CENKI regarding the methods of completing the construction of the structures and complexes of the spaceport, as well as the methods of working with subcontracting organizations.
"It was decided that this would be best for everyone", says one of the top managers involved in building the Oriental.
A government official, for his part, called the decision strange: "He was one of the best specialists, and it will be difficult to find an equivalent replacement".
According to "Ъ", this will not be necessary: the position of technical director of the spaceport will be abolished, and its functions will be spread across the subdivisions of the CENKI.
Music schools will be taught two specialties
In the future, children's music schools will be able to study two subjects at the same time.
According to the Deputy Director of the Department of Science and Education of the Ministry of Culture Sviatoslav Golubenko, for this purpose, students can read the repeated disciplines, and the issue of paying for the rest of the classes on the second specialty can be solved with the help of special grants, reports "RIA Novosti".
"The Ministry of Culture has taken this matter under control, and we will develop a mechanism with the expert community that will allow you to master two specialties, but at the same time will not contradict the current legislation in the field of education", Golubenko said.
Last Friday, during Vladimir Putin's "Children's Talk" with the students of the Sirius Children's Center, student Maria Andreeva reported that she had to pay for the repeated subjects in the second specialty at the Moscow Conservatory.
The girl said that she is studying violin and piano in class and has awards in both competitions.
The head of state recognized the issue as very urgent and promised to help.
In Mexico , a 17-year-old Russian climbed a skyscraper
In Mexico, a 17-year-old Russian man, Kirill N., was arrested after climbing a wall on the roof of a high-rise building, El Universal reported.
The incident happened in Mexico City, the capital of the country.
With the help of two unknown men, the young man climbed over a 10-foot fence into the Nestle office complex and climbed onto one of its towers.
He did not use any special equipment, safety net or rope.
They've got a young man on the roof.
Public Safety officials brought him down on a helicopter.
After that, he was sent to the National Institute of Migration.
They're checking to see if the boy's in the country legally.
Meanwhile, a video of a young man climbing to the top of a mountain has gone viral.
Users called the young man "spider-man".
According to media reports, he has a hobby in doing experiments.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate can help ease the effects of HDL.
Red meat and chocolate are considered a nightmare for your digestive system.
But recent research suggests otherwise: A diet rich in meat proteins and dairy products may help alleviate symptoms in those with inflammatory bowel disease.
This incurable disease, which affects an estimated 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, causes colic and bloating, chronic or bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Usually, people are advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate symptoms, but researchers at the University of Washington have found that the main amino acid in protein, tryptophan, helps to produce immune cells that increase intestinal tolerance.
Leading researcher Dr. Marco Colonna explained that immune cells in the gut keep harmful microbes from entering the body when they come from food.
The cells that trigger the inflammatory process are balanced by cells that increase tolerance, protecting the body while not harming sensitive tissues.
If the balance is too much disturbed in the inflammatory direction, it can lead to inflammatory bowel disease.
The experiments showed that mice that had a certain bacterium in their intestines had a cell tolerance booster.
And this bacterium needs tryptophan, one of the building blocks of the protein, to trigger the cell formation.
Professor Colonna said: "We have established a link between a species of bacteria, Lactobacillus reuteri, which is part of the normal gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that increase tolerance.
The more tryptophan in the mice's diet, the more of these immune cells they had".
He suggested that the same would work in humans: a combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet could promote a more tolerant and less inflammatory environment in the intestine.
Dr. Louise Cervantes-Barraganvas, a postdoc, studying a variety of immune cells that increase tolerance, found that one group of test mice had these cells, and another group, which belonged to the same line but was kept separate, did not.
She suggested that the difference could be caused by the gut microbiome of mice - communities of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.
So we sequenced the DNA of the intestinal cells of the mice, and we found six types of bacteria that were present in the mice that had immune cells, but not in the mice that didn't have them.
Mice raised in sterile environments, which didn't have a good microbiome and didn't develop this type of immune cell, got L. reuteri, and they had immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, the researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid medium and then transferred small portions of the liquid - without the bacteria - to underdeveloped immune cells secreted from mice.
The immune cells have turned into tolerance-boosting cells.
When the active ingredient was separated from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of the processing of tryptophan, known as indole-3-lactic acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan levels were halved, the number of cells also fell by about 50 percent.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explains that humans have the same cell tolerance-enhancing genes as mice, and most of us have L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri promote cell development in humans as they do in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
She says, "Perhaps we need to increase the development of these cells, because they are the ones that are responsible for the inflammatory processes on the inner surface of the intestine.
High levels of tryptophan in the presence of L. reuteri could potentially lead to an expansion of their population".
According to Jose Mourinho, Manchester United has hired the genius in the form of Nemanja Matić.
Manchester United have hired the genius in the form of Nemanja Matić, according to Jose Mourinho after the midfielder made his debut in a match against Sampdoria on Wednesday night.
The £40 million player, who started with a 2-1 win in Dublin in United's final pre-season match against Real Madrid on Thursday, impressed as a midfielder, while players such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira pushed forward when they wanted to.
However, as Matic did not take part in Chelsea's pre-season tour of Asia, he was seriously lacking in preparation for the game, and he only lasted 45 minutes, which, according to Mourinho, requires work-up before the start of the Premier League season.
"He needs time, but his experience, his mind, his genius is in the way he thinks, he thinks about football", Mourinho said.
We'll help him get ready sooner rather than later.
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started the game at the Aviva Stadium when Mourinho began forming his main squad for the start of the following season.
The Independent reported this week that Mourinho wanted to sign three more players, but stressed that the club had already achieved fantastic results by hiring three of the four players he wanted to sign first.
"I'm grateful to the club for getting three out of four", he added.
I'd be even happier if they got me four out of four, but they've already done a lot for me.
Former leaders of the Lithuanian Social Democrats are persuading them to stay in the ruling coalition
Former chairmen of the Social Democratic Party of Lithuania, ex-prime ministers Algirdas Butkovičius and Gediminas Kirkilas, as well as former speaker of the Sejm from the social democrats Cheslovas Yurshenas appealed to their fellow party members to remain in the ruling coalition.
As reported by the "Parliamentary Gazette", due to friction with partners - the Union of Peasants and the "greens" - the Social Democratic Party initiated a discussion on whether to remain in the ruling coalition.
And three senior experienced comrades addressed their party colleagues with an open letter, in which, in particular, they said: "It is understandable that the party comrades are disappointed with the election results, but the coalition with the "peasants" has created for us, although not very easy, but still conditions for further implementation of the goals of social justice, which are provided for in the government program on our initiative, and for maintaining the political dominance of the left center over the right parties".
According to former party leaders, the discussion so far "has been dominated by emotion-based opinion expression without concrete arguments".
The authors of the letter fear that their party's rash actions could lead Lithuania to political, economic and social instability.
Anton Mamayev , a disabled man , was fined
Moscow city court reduced the sentence of wheelchair-riding disabled Anton Mamayev from four and a half years to a fine of 200 thousand rubles.
Earlier, the judge of the Timiradze court released him from the detention center.
The Moscow City Court confirmed that the accused is a criminal, as he organized the robbery and the kidnapping of a motorcycle from a former special forces soldier.
Moscow city court reduced Anton Mamayev's sentence to 200 thousand rubles.
"Mamaev is the organizer of the robbery, which also forms the composition of the crime, and, accordingly, such a person should be brought to criminal responsibility", - explained to "Ъ" the press secretary of the Moscow City Court Ulyana Solopova.
In this case, the court took into account the state of Mamaev's health, the actual circumstances of the case, the absence of aggravating circumstances.
In addition, the court applied Article 64 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation, which allows for a lower sentence.
As for assistant Mamayev Vasily Seroshtanov, the court did not find any circumstances that would be grounds for changing the severity of the offence and changing the sentence.
Anton Mamayev himself said that he was dissatisfied with the decision of the Moscow City Court.
I'm disappointed in the court's decision.
The only legal solution would be an acquittal, with the intention of continuing to fight for justice.
His lawyer Andrei Orlov did not rule out appealing the sentence in the Moscow City Court and the Supreme Court.
"We will use all the levers up to the European Court of Human Rights", he told RIA Novosti.
We will remind, 28-year-old Moscow Anton Mamayev, suffering from spinal muscular atrophy, became a defendant in a criminal case last autumn.
The invalid claims that he bought a scooter from his acquaintances for 160 thousand rubles, to sell later.
However, the owners of the motorcycle, among them a former special forces soldier, said that the disabled man and his assistant Vasily Serostanov had confiscated their property, threatening to use violence.
On June 30, the Timiryazevsky District Court of Moscow sentenced Vasily Seroshtanov to three years in a penal colony, and Anton Mamayev to four and a half years in prison, serving his sentence in a general regime colony (part 2 of article 162 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation).
After the disabled man was placed in the detention center, the Public Chamber, the Prosecutor General's Office, the Commissioner for Human Rights under President Tatyan Moskalkov, joined the case.
As a result, in mid-July, Anton Mamayev was released from the detention center by the same decision of the Timiradzev court.
The defense, in turn, appealed the decision of the first instance in Moscow City Court.
The UNF will prepare a report on ecology
The final "Action Forum" of the All-Russian People's Front (ONF) in 2017 will be dedicated to environmental issues, a source in the ONF told "Izvestia" and confirmed by the head of the executive committee of the movement Alexey Anisimov.
According to him, the "frontmen" plan to prepare a report to the president on the problems of the national ecology, as well as to propose a strategy for their solution.
The interlocutors of "Izvestia" in ONF note that the report to the head of state will contain a "deep analysis" of the situation in all federal districts of the country.
According to "Izvestia", the final forum of the ONF will take place in the autumn.
The exact date of the event is not yet determined - as a rule, it is timed to the schedule of the president, who is the leader of the movement and traditionally attends key events of the ONF.
The Front held several interregional environmental conferences, one for each of the two federal districts - in Rostov-on-Don, Kaliningrad and Kirov.
The conference will be held in the capital of the Republic of Buryatia, Ulan-Ude.
On the basis of the proposals that were and will be expressed at these events, we will form systematic proposals to solve environmental problems, - told "Izvestie" the interlocutor in ONF.
Co-chair of the Central Staff of the movement Olga Timofeeva, who heads the State Duma Committee on Ecology and Environmental Protection, reported that the "frontmen" will report to the head of state on the work carried out within the framework of the Year of Ecology in Russia.
The final environmental forum and the NGO Action Forum will likely be combined.
In one year, we've grown into a powerful team of environmental experts, seen loopholes in legislation, stopped dozens of violations.
It's all part of a report we're preparing for the president as leader of our movement.
In addition to this document, the "frontmen" are also reported on the work on the priority projects of the ONF, - said Olga Timofeeva "Izvestie".
According to her, the special representative of the head of state on environmental protection, ecology and transport will be invited to the forum.
He has previously participated in the Media Forum of the ONF, which took place in St. Petersburg in April.
In a few months, the Year of the Environment will be history, and the most important thing we need to do today is to get environmental mechanisms up and running so they can work for years to come.
These issues should not be left off the agenda, added Olga Timofeeva.
Head of the regional policy laboratory of the Expert Institute for Social Research (EISI) Andrei Kolyadin noted that the ONF is acting in line with the presidential agenda by raising environmental issues.
They have offered many things as experts at various forums, and these initiatives have received the support of the president, - said Andrey Kolyadin to "Izvestia".
He stressed that the economic potential of the environmental agenda cannot be excluded today, which can give the regions an additional impetus for development.
In the future, with the help of the ONF, regions will be able to lobby not only for the solution of their environmental problems, but also for the development of ecotourism, - added the expert.
The relevance of environmental issues was demonstrated by a "straight line" with Vladimir Putin in June.
In particular, the president was asked about the garbage dump in Balashchy (already closed) and about the coal dust in the port of the city of Nahodka (already developed a law project on the prohibition of open coal transshipment in settlements, one of the authors - Olga Timofeeva).
Experts in the field of ecology believe that the legal framework for solving environmental problems in Russia is created in general, the question is in further law-enforcement practice, as well as in the position of civil society.
The state needs to implement the decisions it has made, says Leonid Bochin, head of the charity foundation "Ecology for All".
The head of the non-governmental organization "Greenpis of Russia" Sergey Tsıplenkov, in a conversation with "Izvestia", stressed that for successful solution of environmental problems, a responsible approach of society and business is necessary, only legislative efforts are not enough.
Once the society and business realize that the solution of environmental problems is a much more profitable step in the strategic perspective, the situation will change, - said Sergey Tsyplenkov.
The expert stressed that it is necessary to reverse the trend that violating environmental legislation is an economically advantageous solution for business.
A British inventor has implanted a microchip to get into a house and a car with a wrist-slap.
A British inventor became the first person in the country to have a microchip installed so that he could open the door of his house, enter an office, and even start a car with a simple wave of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Stephen Northam has implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and forefinger and now, through his firm BioTech, offers this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology.
He teamed up with Dr. Jeff Watson, a consultant anaesthetist at Royal in Winchester, to ensure that the implantation procedure was carried out according to medical standards.
The technology is like a microchip that you implant in cats and dogs, and it takes only 30 seconds.
Northam also replaces locks in homes and cars with chip-compatible ones at a cost of £300 per lock.
A married father of one has already installed the technology in his home and in his BMW Z4 that starts when his hand is at the wheel.
The White House prop cost the taxpayers thousands of dollars.
According to military records provided to TIME magazine, the White House's decision last month to fly a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event dedicated to American manufacturing cost taxpayers as much as $24,000.
The white-green Sikorsky VH-3D, known as the Marine One when the president is on board, was the centerpiece of a July 17 event at the White House that showcased American construction programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials examined technology products from all 50 states.
The Connecticut-made helicopter was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a truck from Mississippi.
According to records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron (HMX-1), the unit responsible for helicopter control, the White House War Department ordered the helicopter's presence in a private order, or FRAGO, just 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn for an unusual event.
"I just wanted to make sure you were aware because this is an unusual, widely reported event", the commander of HMX-1 wrote in an e-mail to his superior, the first deputy chief of aviation of the Marine Corps, on the eve of the event.
The letter stated that the helicopter would arrive at the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on July 17 for an event scheduled for 3 p.m. and would remain there until the lawn was cleared between 6 and 9 p.m. that same day.
The letter adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed, a second crew will be needed for the return flight in accordance with the restrictions on hours of operation.
The first crew escorted the helicopter during the event, and the unit's security personnel remained near the aircraft while it was on the ground.
From the recordings obtained by TIME magazine, it remains unclear whether a second crew was eventually needed.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using public property for political purposes.
According to the records, HMX-1 has clarified whether the event is in violation of this order.
"We asked among other things if this was a violation of Hatch's law, and we were told no", the commander wrote.
"Looks like you have nowhere to go", the deputy chief replied.
The event was declared an official event by the White House, and was not covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
During the event, the president made efforts to advance the health care reform that was in the Senate's pipeline at the time, and praised attempts to regulate government regulations.
The use of airships known as Marine One and Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents are required to use them for travel.
But asking them for the sole purpose of being able to photograph is unusual.
Trump already became a subject of discussion in February when the presidential plane flew in the background during his first election rally in Melbourne, Florida, and his Twitter account was flooded with complaints about the use of the presidential plane by his predecessor.
"The White House is thrilled with the Made in America show, which showcased products from all 50 states made by American workers using American materials", said White House deputy press secretary Lindsey Walters.
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights around the Washington metropolitan area and the South Lawn to train transporting the President of the United States to the White House with accuracy down to an inch.
When Trump was at the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 made 58 training landings outside the White House.
According to one official, the flight performed for the Made in America event was counted as a necessary training flight for the crew for a month.
The unit's helicopters also flew 11 additional hours that day as part of the "non-presidential support mission".
According to the White House, the taxpayers did not pay for any of the other exhibits on display.
A representative of the company Sikorsky reported that the company did not participate in the organization of the demonstration of the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep track of the budget for presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact amount spent on the event.
But according to the Department of Defense's hourly rates for fiscal year 2017, the Department of Defense's rate of compensation for a VH-3D is $24,380 per hour of flight.
The unit records show that the time the aircraft spent in the air was 30 minutes each way from its airfield at Marine Corps Air Base Quantico in Virginia.
The White House claims the real cost of using a helicopter is far below that rate.
"It is completely wrong to calculate the cost to taxpayers on the basis of an estimated rate of compensation", says Walters.
These approximate rates include staff, maintenance and many other non-refundable costs that are included in the annual appropriations.
According to a 2015 RAND study, the compensation rates do not include the cost of personnel, but do take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract expenses.
At the time, former White House press secretary Sean Spicer spoke out in defense of using a helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to showcase things that are made in America this week", Spicer said.
And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of the fact that they are contributing to national security, and that there are, I'm guessing, hundreds if not thousands of people whose jobs depend on it.
And I think like most Americans, we're all proud of this helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans worked tirelessly to create.
So, of course, it's perfectly appropriate to pay attention to this.
It was unclear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter while surveying the South Lawn during the event, but he was definitely in the driver's seat of the fire truck.
Inside the White House, Trump addressed representatives of the company Sikorsky, joking with the press about his own fleet of products from the company.
"I know Sikorsky well", said the President. "I have three of them".
Moscow to grant grants to rehab units
Every year, grants from "Save Lives" will be allocated to the intensive care units and resuscitation units of the capital's medical clinics.
The money will go to encourage doctors and nurses.
Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin visited the City Clinical Hospital named after Yudin.
During the clinic inspection, he handed a thank-you letter to the doctor-traumatic orthopedist Viktor Prozko, under whose guidance the most complex operation on the reconstruction of the foot of the teenager was carried out.
Sergey Sobyanin also spoke about the decision to allocate grants to the intensive care units and rehab centers of the city clinics every year.
The money will be used to encourage doctors and nurses.
According to the mayor of the capital, the clinical hospital named after Yudin is one of the largest in Moscow today.
In recent years, the clinic has received new modern equipment that allows its doctors to perform unique operations.
The clinic was opened in 1961 on the basis of the Kolomna village hospital.
At present, the medical facilities are designed to receive over a thousand patients.
In addition to the intensive care unit and the hospital, there are day-care units.
The hospital has a staff of 2,800 people.
The total area occupied by the medical clinic is 23.7 hectares.
In February this year , the medical institution became a participant in the pilot project to organize short-term stay hospitals (SKP).
They're designed to perform relatively small operations.
The surgical procedures use advanced medical equipment, which significantly reduces the rehabilitation time of patients.
They only spend a few hours in the hospital after surgery.
In the first half of this year alone, 36 thousand patients were provided with hospital care.
The clinic's medical staff performed 15,800 operations of varying degrees of complexity.
NBU reported the absence of buyers of Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank
The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) reported that there were no applications to buy the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
This is reported by TASS on Friday, August 4, citing a representative of the press service of the NBU.
The NBU confirms that on August 3, 2017, a package of documents from the citizen of Belarus and Cyprus Viktor Prokopeni for the agreement of the indirect acquisition (through the Parietetbank) of 100 percent of the shares of Sberbank was withdrawn.
"Documents from other potential investors to buy shares of Sberbank in the NBU did not come", - noted in the message.
On August 3, the Belarusian businessman Viktor Prokopen withdrew his application to buy the subsidiary structure of Sberbank.
On July 28, it became known that the National Bank of Ukraine refused to Russian businessmen Said Gutseriev and Grigory Guselnikov in the acquisition of the Ukrainian "daughter" of Sberbank.
The regulator justified its decision by the fact that the businessmen did not provide the necessary documents for verification of their compliance with the requirements of Ukrainian legislation.
Sberbank announced the sale of its Ukrainian "daughter" to the Norvik Banka consortium and a private Belarusian company in March this year.
The majority shareholder of the consortium was Said Gutseriev, son of Russian businessman Mikhail Gutseriev.
Sanctions against the "daughters" of five Russian banks in Ukraine, including Sberbank, were introduced in mid-March.
They're not allowed to take capital out of the country for the benefit of their parent organization for a year.
Season 3 trailer: The Cali cartel is central to the popular Netflix series following the death of Pablo Escobar

Democracy in Afghanistan depends on women's role in politics, the UN has said.
Elections can only be representative when they involve all members of society, including women, the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
According to Nicholas Haysom, acting head of the UN Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, hundreds of women are running for provincial councils, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
"The role of women cannot be overstated", he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative when women are fully involved and included in all stages of the electoral process.
Provincial council elections and presidential elections will be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban threatens to derail the election process, which coincides with the transition of international forces from combat operations to advisory roles.
This year's election marks the first time that power has been transferred peacefully from one democratically elected government to another.
Haysom said that increasing the role of women would contribute to the success of democracy in Afghanistan.
According to the Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan, of the total 3.6 million registered voters, 1.2 million are women.

Venice toughened fines for tourists for inappropriate behavior
The Venetian authorities have increased the fines for swimming in canals from 50 euros to 500 euros.
Walking around the city in a bathing suit or with your torso naked will now be fined 200 euros.
100 euros will be required from those who will have a picnic in a public place or ride a bike through pedestrian areas, TASS reports, citing the Russian Association of Tour Operators.
In addition, the authorities are charged a fine of 400 euros for inscriptions on the monuments and 25 euros for rubbish.
Tourists will be informed about the need to observe the rules of conduct in Venice through the special "Enjoy Respect Venice" campaign (#EnjoyRespectVenezia) on social media, as well as through announcements and posters on the city council website, billboards and in places where tourists are most concentrated.
The campaign will be conducted in 10 languages.
According to the Venice Tourism Adviser, Paula Mar, the fines will be sent to the embassies of the violators' home countries to warn their compatriots of similar mistakes.
"The problem is that Venice is perceived as a beach", she noted.
In April, the Italian city announced plans to limit the flow of tourists.
In Venice, restrictions on the number of tourists visiting the city center have already been successfully implemented.
Instead of 100,000 people wanting to watch the Festa del Redentore, only 60,000 guests were allowed to the venue.
In addition, a moratorium was imposed on the construction of new hotels and fast-food restaurants in the historic part of Venice.

The SF released Ozerov from the post of committee chairman
The Federation Council on Wednesday supported the statement of the chairman of the Committee on Defense and Security, Viktor Ozerov, and relieved him of this position.
He remains a senator from Khabarovsk Territory.
A petition to relieve him of his position was written by Ozerov last week.
He explained his decision to the need for rotation and his desire to "change the rhythm of life".
The senator also noted that the decision to leave was not immediate.
Victor Ozerov has represented the Habyarka Legislative Assembly in the Federal Assembly since 1996.
The Senate Defense and Security Committee has been chaired by the senator since 2001.
Electricity is cheaper for Buryatia's residents and producers
The decades-long efforts of the Soviet and post-Soviet authorities of the Republic of Buryatia (Eastern Siberia) to establish fair tariffs for electricity consumers are beginning to bear fruit.
From 1 September, the cost of low-voltage electricity for industrial users is reduced by 25%.
The Federal Antimonopoly Service of the country in accordance with the Resolution of the Government of the Russian Federation "On making changes to the Rules of the wholesale market of electric energy and power and to the aggregate forecast balance of production and supply of electric energy (power) within the framework of the Unified energy system of Russia for the subjects of the Russian Federation" (from 17.07.2017 No. 842) established indicative prices for electric energy and power for industrial consumers of the Republic of Buryatia.
As a result, the cost of electricity for Buryat producers is reduced by a quarter, which will significantly ease the life of small and medium-sized enterprises and individual entrepreneurs.
For many decades, the heads of the republic have been on the threshold of Moscow's cabinets in vain attempts to level the region in tariffs with the neighboring Irkutsk region with the cascade of hydroelectric stations on Angar, which flows from Baikal, for which Buryatia is the main water catchment area.
And it's only this year that the movement started.
In March, electricity tariffs for the population of the republic were reduced from 4.24 rubles per kWh to 3.93 rubles per kWh, or by 7.3%.
With the inclusion of Buryatia by the decision of the federal government in the List of territories of price zones of the wholesale market, for which the peculiarities of the functioning of the wholesale and retail markets are established, the turn of industrial consumers came.
According to analysts, this is just the beginning, as the population of the Irkutsk region pays 1.01 rubles per kilowatt hour.
But no one dares to give even an approximate date for the new tariff moves towards a lowering for Buryatia.
Scooter didn 't scare the Prosecutor General of Ukraine and flew to Crimea
Legend of electronic dance music, the Scooter group flew to Crimea, not fearing threats from the Ukrainian Prosecutor General's Office.
"The flight went well, and tomorrow I have a concert", - quotes RIA Novosti the words of the frontman of the group H. P. Baxter.
Earlier, the German edition of Bild cited Deputy Prosecutor General of Ukraine Yevgeny Yenin as saying that for coming to Crimea, which is considered by Kiev to be temporarily occupied territory of Ukraine, musicians could face up to eight years in prison.
Scooter's performance at the Balaclava festival, which is called #ZBFest, is scheduled for August 4.
#ZBFest is organized by Golden Balka to celebrate International Champagne Day.
Scooter, one of Germany's most famous bands, was founded in 1993.
Ace's last album was released in 2016.
In addition to Scooter, Sergey Galanin and his group "SerG" will be guests of the festival, as well as Garik Sukachev with "Brigade C".
The new season of Game of Thrones will premiere in the Moscow metro
The Russian premiere of the seventh season of Game of Thrones will take place in the metropolitan area of the capital.
This is reported by the website "Komsomolskaya pravda".
The first episode will be shown on the night of July 18 at one of the stations as part of the "Night in the Metro" campaign.
In the lobby, the soundtrack will be accompanied by actors dressed in white.

According to the first deputy head of the Moscow Metro, Roman Latypov, the show will be the first underground series in history, which will help the audience to better experience what is happening on the screen.
The National Union of Unskilled, Municipal and Boiler Workers (GMB) is concerned about the investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow.
The union is demanding guarantees from the managers of biscuit maker McVitie's in connection with its long-term commitment to manufacturing at the Glasgow plant.
GMB Scotland reports that the company has been silent about its future investment in the Tolkross facility.
The factory, which produces, among other products, Hobnobs cookies and Rich Tea, employs more than 500 people.
Pladis, the owner of McVitie's, says it has invested more than £5 million in the property over the past few years.
The company adds that if there are any changes in the facility's work, employees and union representatives will be the first to know.
In a letter to the head of the company's owned facility, the Scottish branch of GMB demanded McVitie's reaction to concerns that funding would not be allowed for the modernization of production lines.
Senior organizer Drew Duffy said: "Our union members are deeply concerned that we are unable to get clarity from the general manager of the facility on the business needs and investment plan for the future of the Tollcross".
Families have worked here for generations, and the concentration of workers is high in the local community and in the Greater Glasgow area; it is a crucial pillar of decent work in a territory of high unemployment and social deprivation.
So in terms of jobs, wages and prosperity, and against the backdrop of Brexit, rising living standards and chronic decline in production, the East End of Glasgow desperately needs a booming manufacturing at McVitie's.
A spokeswoman for Pladis said: "The manager of the Tolcross facility just received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday and the company will respond immediately as we appreciate our ongoing cooperation with employees and union representatives".
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with GMB employees and representatives at Tolcross, where we discussed a number of issues openly.
We talked to our employees about how, like all companies operating in a highly competitive and volatile economic climate, we are constantly reviewing our actions  and this applies to all our facilities and areas of activity  to remain competitive.
Over the last few years we have invested over £5 million in our wheelchair facility, particularly in production lines and improved performance.
We fully appreciate the value of the Tolcross as a manufacturing facility, and if there are any changes to the work at this facility, the employees and union representatives will be the first to know.
Putin said that the authorities will not give instructions to Rosneft and Gazprom
Vladimir Putin said that the Kremlin and the cabinet of ministers should join the issue of gas supplies to the Eastern Petrochemical Company (VNHC), but no one will give instructions to "Gazprom", as well as "Rosneft".
This is how Russian President Vladimir Putin responded to Igor Sechin's request to help resolve the differences.
The Head of State drew attention to the fact that relations between Rosneft and Gazprom should be decided exclusively on the basis of market principles.
Earlier, the head of "Rosneft" Igor Sechin at a meeting on the implementation of large investment projects in the Far Eastern Federal District told that the lack of agreement with "Gazprom" on gas for VNHC puts the project's implementation period at risk.
Sechin noted that the dialogue with Gazprom on this issue continues.
Gazprom offers to find gas resources from the perimeter of Rosneft, but we do not have such resources", Sechin added.
Recall that Rosneft asked permission to use gas from the Kirina field of Gazprom, located on the Sakhalin shelf, for the Eastern Petrochemical Company.
In June, Gazprom said that negotiations on the issue were ongoing and that "there are no sharp corners there".
Did he warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
A La Liga player may regret his interest in Marco Verratti .
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop pursuing Neymar after the club offered £189 million for his ransom, but did they warn Barcelona of the world record-setting attack three years ago?
The sensational offer revived the summer transfer window, when the Ligue 1 club were poised to break a world record for transfer fees, more than doubling the previous mark linked to Paul Pogba's return to Manchester United last season for £89 million.
When the transfer is complete, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player, as well as the highest paid professional athlete in the world, as PSG offers him a salary of over £500,000 a week in net terms.
Barcelona are known to be furious about the way the offer was made and how Neymar broke the contract, despite the fact that, as a source close to the Catalan club's management insists, the club has always done everything possible for the player since his move from Santos in 2013.
But wasn't the football world warned of this possibility three years ago by President Bush?
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaze Matuiidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaify issued a stern warning to any club that wanted to lure one of PSG's best players.
"I don't worry because they know that if they touch one of our players, then we will go against them, we will make offers to their players", Al-Helaifi said.
We respect all clubs.
But if they try to recruit one of our players, there will be consequences.
Barcelona seem to have crossed that line when the Spanish club expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti earlier this summer.
PSG have made it clear that they will not release the Italian player under any circumstances, and now Barcelona are probably feeling the consequences of their offer in the form of losing one of their most valuable players, Neymar.
Putin has ordered the payment of the forest fires.
