Welsh MPs to vote on the future of the city
Some MPs are concerned about the proposed change to the MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament) title.
This has come up as there are plans to change the name of the thing to the Welsh Parliament.
The politicians are worried that it will make money off of them.
A member of the Labour Party indicated that his group was concerned that it was a rhyming combination of Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh twp means divided and pwp means shit.
A Plaid official said the group was "totally disillusioned" and had looked at other possibilities.
One Conservative party official said his group was "disappointed" by the name change, but noted it was a brief verbal move from MWP to Muppet.
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced the same as the letter u in Yorkshire English.
The committee currently convening the legislature to introduce the name change has stated: "The final decision on the wording to describe the committee will of course be taken by the members themselves".
The 2017 Welsh Government Bill empowered the Welsh Parliament to change its name.
In June, the committee announced the results of a public consultation on the proposal, which said that the majority was in favour of naming the parliament a Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of the people, the committee was for Welsh Parliament Members or WMPs, but the MWP option received the most support in a general consultation.
Members of Parliament have apparently explored other options, but the fight to secure a deal could be a key focus for the Speaker, Elin Jones, who is expected to table a legislative proposal on the changes within weeks.
The bill to reform the House will also include other changes to the way the House operates, including rules on the separation of powers and the deliberation of the committee system.
The Senators get the last vote on the question of what they should name when they discuss the legislation.
Macedonians go to a referendum to change the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday on whether the country's name should be changed to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The appointed man was a man worthy of being so, and he caused a great uproar among the Greeks in the region of Macedonia.
Athens has long maintained that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory, and has repeatedly offered membership in the EU and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the referendum, has said he will not attend the vote.
However, supporters of the referendum, including the current Prime Minister, Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is necessary for membership in the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's Cathedral ring while the Harlem Churches are being destroyed
"In the past, people I have spoken to have said that there was a bar and a church on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
There is no today.
He said the disappearance of the bar was shocking.
"People don't socialize in the same way" these days, he said.
"The bars are no longer in the neighborhood where people regularly go".
As for the churches, he is so worried about the money to sell that they won't last as long as the leaders expect, and sooner or later they're back where they started.
Churches, he added, could be replaced by condominiums with accompanying governments, full of people who have no intention of helping the remaining poor in the neighborhood.
"Unless the majority of people who buy property in these buildings become white", he said, "and therefore want to be white, then these churches will be all white, because it is unlikely that more than half of these people who move into these properties are members of the churches".
Both churches were built by white congregations before Harlem became a black Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The original, white, Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A mob that had recently passed through the building destroyed it.
St. Martin's was overrun by a black congregation under Sir John Howard Johnson, who stood in front of a row of shops on 125th Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, opposed to employing or working for blacks.
After a fire in 1939, the building was badly damaged, but because people in Johnson's father's family were planning to rebuild, they carved the clock tower.
Mr. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to the St. Martin's trust, called the bell ringing "the poor man's clock".
The expert who played the bell in July called it something else: "A cultural treasure" and "your undying, historical poetry".
Specialist Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first bell to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who moved to a larger bell in Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mrs. Merriweather said that St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin's in recent months has been a complicated story of architects and builders, some hired by church leaders, others by the diocese.
The Church Council - the lead agency in the search, made up of church leaders - wrote to the Diocese in July with the concern that the case would try to get the costs passed on to the Church Council, even though the Council had not been part of the hiring of architects and architects sent in by the Diocese.
Some in the crowd grumbled as many shadows from the bishop's throne.
Loosely based on a 13-year-old lobster hunt in California.
A 13-year-old boy was locked and unlocked by a mob Saturday while hunting for lobster in California on the first day of lobster season, officials have reported.
The accident happened just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been chatting with friends for about a half hour on Saturday morning when he heard the king crying for help, and then went with a group to help him out of the water.
Hamel said he initially thought it was the thrill of catching a lobster, but soon realised that he was yelling, "I'm bitten!"
I'm being bitten!
The ossification was disturbing, so Hamel saw it, and went over to the girl.
I called everyone to come out of the water. "What's wrong with the water?" Hammel retorted.
The boy was flown to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is listed in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
Chief Survivor Larry Giles had said at a news conference that a hare had been seen in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was thought to be a non-threatening type of hare.
Giles added that the ransom had been for the injuries caused to the bull.
Officials closed the entrance from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and security reasons.
Giles noted that there are about 135 species of owls in the area, but that most are not harmful.
Sainsbury's is planning to move into the beauty market in the UK.
Sainsbury's offers Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with department store-like beauty courses managed by specialized assistants.
As part of a major takeover of the UK's $2.8 billion beauty market, and growing steadily as fashion and apparel sales decline, the larger beauty trends will be trialled in 11 stores across the country and implemented for several years to come if it receives good reception.
The decline in beauty comes as retailers look for ways to fill the aisles that were once filled with showcases, microwaves and furniture.
Sainsbury's has said it will double its selection of beauty products to 3,000, including now brands like Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
Already available brands such as L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees are also gaining more space with brands similar to those found in stores such as Boots.
The wholesale market will re-emerge with a boutique range of make-up products, with most products becoming vegan-friendly - something that is widely embraced by younger shoppers.
Following this, the seller of fragrance, the Fragrance Shop, will be testing its fragrances in two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, South London, last week, while the other will open in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift to buying small portions of food daily from neighborhood stores mean that supermarkets must do more to attract visitors.
Mike Coupe, CEO of Sainsbury's, has said that retailers are going to be like department stores, as supermarkets are trying to fight back against the discount stores Aldi and Lidl with more service and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has added Argos stores to hundreds of retail locations, and has also introduced several Habitat stores, following the acquisition of both chains two years ago, which is said to have supported retail sales and made the chain even more profitable.
The first attempt by the department store to sell the drugstore and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's attempted to partner with Boots in the early 2000s, but the relationship ended after a dispute over how the pharmacy revenue from the stores would be split.
The new plan comes after Sainsbury's sold its pharmacy business, which operated 281 stores, to Celesio, the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain, for £125 million three years ago.
It was then said that Lloyds wanted to play its part in the scheme with an expanded range of luxury leather goods brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, sales manager at Sainsbury's, said: "We have redesigned the look and feel of our beauty brands to improve the environment for our customers.
We also have a number of skilled workers who are qualified to provide services.
Our range of brands is designed to suit everyone, and the attractive environment and convenient location enable us to be a true beauty shop that offers the old-fashioned way of shopping.
Peter Jones in the area after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million deal.
Dragons Den star Peter Jones is in a state of despair after television presenter Holly Willoughby withdraws from her £11million contract with his lifestyle brand to fund her new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time for their brand and label, Truly.
The couple's acting was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she was resigning.
Holly Willoughby has made the star of Dragons Den, Peter Jones, a little uncomfortable by withdrawing from the lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute - to collect on her new, unusually lucrative contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources say Jones was "deeply distraught" when the TV personality, at a late-night meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of the trading empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, admitted that her new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had time to invest in their luxury brand, Truly.
The brand was compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop, and was thought to double Willoughby's estate with a value of £11 million.
When Willoughby, 37, took to Instagram to announce his departure from Truly, Jones fled the UK to one of his summer homes.
A source has said: "Truly was by far Holly's highest ranking.
It was going to be her long-term future, which would carry her through the next decades.
Her choice to take the stand shocked everyone present.
No one understands what happened on Thursday, it was so close to being clear.
At the headquarters in Marlow is a multi-layered array of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning host, one of the most influential stars in the UK, could cost the network millions due to heavy investment in products ranging from codes and lights to clothing and bedding, as well as multiple potential delays before it is cleared.
And it may bring an end to an old friendship.
The mother of three, Willoughby, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been estranged from Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby started Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, took over as chairman in March.
The pair travel together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby becomes the face of M&S and saves Ant McPartlin from hosting I'm A Celebrity on ITV.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We have no idea what he's up to".
Hard to say and we fell in love
He was embarrassed by the sensations he would get for making comments that some thought were foreign and for being so critical of the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Trump said in his angry, angry voice.
I have not given up anything.
He added that Kim is interested in meeting again after their first meeting in Singapore in June was described by Trump as a major step in a nuclear-free North Korea.
But talks on nuclear disarmament have been suspended.
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday that the North did not see any "commensurate" reaction from the United States to North Korea's imported weapons.
Instead, he added, the US continued with sanctions measures to maintain pressure.
Trump expressed a more optimistic view in his speech.
"North Korea is doing well", he said.
We were on our way to war with North Korea.
Many millions had died.
Now we have this good relationship.
He said his efforts to improve relations with Kim had yielded positive results - the end of missile tests, the rescue of hostages and the return of American troops.
And he was unusual in his way to talk about his relationship with Kim.
"It's so easy to be the president, but instead of 10,000 people outside trying to squeeze into this packed hall, there are about 200 standing right there", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastates one island, hundreds killed
After the Lombok earthquake, for example, foreign German-speaking companies were told that they did not need to.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was evacuated, it was not declared a national disaster, a prerequisite for triggering international aid.
However, in many cases they have been very determined that they do not need all the support, so it is a bit of a challenge", Ms. Sumbung said.
While Save the Children is assembling a team to travel to Palu, it is unlikely that foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
Ms. Sutopo, the national spokesperson, said Indonesian officials were monitoring the situation in Palu to see if international companies would be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
The continuous earthquakes in Indonesia make the country sinfully unprepared for the wrath of nature.
While tsunami nets are built in Aceh, they are not commonly seen on other beaches.
It is true that despite the widely circulated tsunami warning messages in Pali, a warning was issued, but it has claimed lives.
Travel between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult during peak times.
Natural disasters make the process even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was in Lombok to treat earthquake victims is on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the devastating earthquake.
President Joko Widodo made the transformation of the country's infrastructure a key issue in his election campaign, and he has wasted money on roads and railways.
But a foolish gamble has plagued Mr. Joko's government, and he is now running for re-election next year.
Mr Joko is also troubled by the sectarian tensions in Indonesia, where members of the Muslim majority have adopted a more traditional form of faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands were displaced, as Christian and Muslim mobs fought in the streets with masks, bows, spears and other heavy weapons.

Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat at Chelsea with an 89th-minute goal on Saturday at Stamford Bridge in London.
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri 30 metres from Chelsea's goal as the score was 1-0.
He moved the ball to his left before hitting the hand-stones.
The probe landed high above the breakwater with a cushion directly against the right corner of the net.
The ball was about to end up in a leaky Kepa Arrizabalaga and into the net.
"I was just trying to get in the position of the ball, to get on the ball, and players like Shaq always play forward when it's possible, so I was just trying to make the best time for myself", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and throw the ball, didn't think much about it and just tried to make a shot.
Chelsea took a 1-0 lead in the second half after a goal in the 25th minute from Belgian star Eden Hazard.
The Blues' forward returned the ball to Mateo Kovacic in the game before he snapped and went full-throttle into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic made a quick one-two in the middle.
He then struck a beautiful running ball that led Hazard into the break.
Hazard ran from the back and skated into the left-footed side net ahead of Liverpool's Alisson Becker.
Liverpool face Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 3pm on Sunday at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy.

Death toll from Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has risen to 832, the country's disaster agency reported early Sunday.
Many people were reported to be trapped in rubble from collapsed buildings due to the 7.5 on the Richter scale earthquake that struck Friday and uplifted the dam to a height of up to 20 feet, spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho said at a news conference.
The city of Palu, with a population of more than 380,000, is strewn with the remains of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old man on suspicion of murder after stabbing a woman to death
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead in Merseyside this morning.
The 44-year-old was found at 7.55am with knife wounds at Grayson Mews on John Street, where a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have ordered people in the area who have seen or heard anything to come forward.
Undercover police officer Brian O'Hagan said: "The investigation is just beginning, but I would like to make an appeal to anyone who was in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead and saw or heard anything malicious to contact us.
Also, a credit to anyone, especially cab drivers who may have had something on record, to contact us, as they may have information that is of great importance to our investigation.
A police spokesman has confirmed that the woman whose body was found is from Birkenhead and that she was found inside a fire.
Some of the neighbors, who thought to know the woman, came to the place and asked her where she had been this morning.
Investigations are ongoing and police say they are in the process of passing the information on to the families of the victims.
A tow truck driver living in Grayson Mews has just tried to break into his apartment, but is informed by police that no one is allowed to enter or leave the building.
When he heard this, he was speechless.
Now the inhabitants will know that it will be hours before they can enter again.
A police officer is heard to have told a man that the whole area is now being treated as a crime scene.
A woman from the city came crying.
She keeps saying, "It's so horrible".
At 2 p.m., two police cars were inside the courtyard and another just outside.
Several policemen stood outside the fence, watching the apartment blocks.
Anyone with information is asked to send messages to @MerPolCC, call 101, or contact Crimestoppers at 0800 555 111 and refer to file 247 as of September 30.
The statue of Parliament by Cromwell is the last monument to be struck by the rewrite of history.
The revelation was intended to be scathing justice for the Taliban's destruction of so many English cultural and religious objects carried out by their devout, puritanical followers.
However, the Cromwell Society described Lord Crick's idea as "a fraud and an attempt to rewrite history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said: "It is not escaped in the present dispute over the removal of statues that the creation of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster should be made an issue.
The moral order in the English civil wars was neither suppressed nor destroyed by Cromwell.
Perhaps that same Cromwell was sacrificed for his ancestor, Thomas, made in the previous century.
The free agent of Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft by Cromwell is a testament to nineteenth-century thought and the story-writing of a man who, however, many think is worthy of celebration.
Mrs Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph that: "Cromwell is seen by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today, as a guardian of Parliament against external pressures, in his present monarchy, of course.
Whether it is a purely accurate description is still a matter of debate in historical scholarship.
One thing is certain, and that is that the wars of the seventies have created a successive culture of our country, and Cromwell is a singular figure, recognizable as the man who occupies the other side.
His works as Lord Protector are also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
Killing rice wounds the Chinese farmer to the Dey
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in the Outsyn region, according to local folklore.
The man, known by his surname Yuan, was found dead with a bloody stretcher near a window in the market in Liupanshui, Guizhou province, reported the South China Morning Post on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject smallpox into pigs on a pig farm May 30, 2005, in Xining in Qinghai province, China.
It is said that he had traveled with his nephew from the neighboring province of Yunnan on Sunday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, the brother-in-law found the corpse and saw that the door to the nearby shed was open.
He found a large, blood-stained pig in the pig's mouth.
A convicted felon allegedly stabbed the 550-pound-tall pig to death, according to the report.
The nephew's bones were bloodyly cut apart, the Guiyang Evening News reported.
Security cameras showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. to feed his pigs.
The body was found about an hour later.
The beast that killed the man had neither Yuan nor his nephew.
A firefighter at the market told the Evening News that the pig was hidden away to prevent it from hitting anyone else while police collected evidence at the scene.
Yuan's family and the market authorities negotiated a settlement for his death.
Although the hands themselves, there are examples of pigs leaping on humans before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in their Massachusetts farmhouse, leaving the man with life-threatening injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 650-pound pig had been kept by a Welsh farmer fasting on his tractor until his wife came and tore the animal apart.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer from Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are usually not healthy, but that the taste of blood can be helpful.
They are just jokers.
They're ignorant, they're very curious... they're not after you.
You will only play with them with the right amount of respect, he said.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa will bring heavy rainfall to the United States.
According to the researchers, the Rosa River is shrinking as it moves over colder waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
In short, Rosa is going to bring a flood of rain over Northern Mexico and the panorama of the United States in the next few days.
Winds on Rosu were 85 mph, a Category 1 storm, at 5 am, and were measured at 385 mph in a view from Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Pink is flying northward on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low-pressure area begins to take shape across the Pacific Ocean and move eastward toward the west coast of the United States. As Rosa approaches the Baja California peninsula Monday, as a tropical storm, she will push deep, tropical moisture northward into the expanse of the United States.
Rainfall reached 10 inches in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical moisture and the subsequent low-pressure air will in turn create a widespread rainfall pattern over the next few days.
1 to 4 inches of rainfall in increments, will lead to floods, sewage flows and possibly landslides in the desert.
Deep, tropical moist rivers provide a rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in places, especially in areas of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Heavy rainfall of up to 2 to 4 inches is expected in areas of the landscape, especially over a large portion of Arizona.
Floods can occur and quickly dry up because of the flashes of tropical rain.
It is advised not to venture out into the wilderness to escape the threat of tropical rain.
The rocks can become harsh and the stormy winds can turn rivers into hurricanes and dust storms.
The incoming low-pressure wind brings heavy rainfall to coastal areas of Southern California.
Accumulated rainfall amounts of more than half an inch are possible, which can result in less dust storms and higher road surfaces.
This will be the first rain in the region this bad season.
Some predicted tropical rainfall will approach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday, before rain becomes more widespread late Monday and Tuesday.
Stopping will be extended to Four Corners Tuesday lasting all day Sunday.
In October, large heat waves may occur across the United States, as the Arctic cools while the tropics remain warm.
It can sometimes lead to dramatic changes in temperature over short periods.
One such example of heat stroke will occur in Central America on Sunday.
There are more than 20 degrees of separation between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will try to rebuild itself and grow again.
Many areas of Central and Eastern America are expected to experience a hot start to October, with upwards of 80 degrees from the Southern Plains to parts of the continental crust.
In New York City, the heat can reach 80 degrees on Tuesdays, which is 10 degrees higher than average.
The long-term study indicates the outlook for above-average temperatures across the Eastern United States in the first half of October.
More than 20 million people watched the Brett Kavanaugh trial
More than 20 million people watched the wedding day after the high-profile court case of Brett Kavanaugh and the woman who accused him of sexual assault, allegedly in the late 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
Meanwhile, police calm continued as news outlets disrupted the usual Friday tapes in the last-minute surprise: an agreement was reached with Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that she has no doubt that Kavanaugh drunkenly raped her and tried to break her out, leading to a student dispute.
Kavanaugh, in a fiery deposition, said he had no doubt that it did not happen.
It was probably watched by more than 20.4 million people, according to Nielsen on Friday.
The company counted the average viewership on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
The numbers were not immediately shared by other broadcasters that aired it, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has trouble counting people who watch TV.
By comparison, a crowd similar to hers watches a football game in the playoffs or the Academy Awards.
Fox News Channel, whose hosts supported Kavanaugh's nomination, led all broadcasters, with an average of 5.69 million viewers, during the legal proceedings, which lasted all day, Nielsen said.
ABC was next with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million, NBC had 2.94 million, MSNBC had 2.89 million and CNN had 2.52 million, according to Nielsen.
The zeal for righteousness was great.
Flake was the main character in the exciting event on Saturday.
After the Republican-controlled state Senate announced that it would vote for Kavanaugh, he was spotted by CNN and CBS photographers Friday morning as protesters cheered him as he attempted to take an elevator to a court hearing.
He did not look upset, while for several minutes he was found harshly beaten, live on CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think that he speaks the truth about the country?
And one said to him, How strong is thy strength! so many women are weak.
Flake said his administration had told him before the elections were rescheduled that he had more to say to the commissioners.
Television stations broadcast live hours later, when the judiciary was due to vote to move Kavanaugh's nomination to a full Senate vote.
But Flake said he would only do so if he knew the FBI would be investigating the charges against the nominee before next week, as a Democratic rally has suggested.
Flake was convinced by a couple of conversations with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
After a discussion with Coons and several senators later, Flake made a decision.
Flake's election was a landslide, as it was clear that Republicans did not have the votes to approve Kavanaugh without the investigation.
President Trump has been placed under an FBI investigation into the charges against Kavanaugh.
UK Prime Minister May blames critics for playing politics over Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May blamed her opposition to leaving the European Union for "playing politics with Britain's future and damaging international interests", in an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper.
British Prime Minister Theresa May arrives at the Conservative Party conference in Birmingham, UK, September 29, 2018.
In another interview, on the front page of the newspaper, her former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, stressed her Chequers Brexit plan, saying a proposal that the UK and EU should collect each other's taxes was "totally absurd".
The shooting of Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson under suspicion of the death of the LSU player.
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU quarterback.
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and booked on a charge of involuntary manslaughter, the Baton Rouge Police Department reports.
The officers released a recording of the collision between Sims and Simpson, and police say Sims lost his glasses in the fight.
The police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police said he confessed to shooting and killing Wayde.
Bail is set at $350,000, the prosecution reports.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office issued a preliminary report Friday, saying the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head and neck.
The department is awarding the Louisiana State Police escape unit, the State Police Crime Lab, the Southern University Police Department and other local agencies to assist in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU athletic director Joe Alleva thanked the police in the area for their "concern and desire for justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6'3" 201 lb power forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played football for LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU's basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "for nothing" and "saddened" by Wayde's death.
"This is what you're always worried about", Wade said.
Elf-Eyes shark on the Mexican coast
The ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern suburbs of Mexico's capital.
The National Emergency Management Agency said on Saturday that Mexicans were trying to stay away from the volcano after activity began in the area and 183 outbursts of gas and ash were recorded over 24 hours.
The earth shook with a violent uproar and an earthquake.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash falling on the front of cars in a Mexican city, one now Xochimilco.
Geologists have warned of a surge in activity in the volcano, located 45 miles (72 km) inland from the capital, after an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo has been active since 1994.
The police are breaking out in loose Catalan, a year before the census.
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-democracy protesters clashed with police, and thousands of people marched in procession near the stadium to mark the first anniversary of the bloody vote for independence.
A group of masked revellers, restrained by the law of the jungle, were eating black eggs and powder after them, causing darkened dusts in the streets that had usually been crowded with passers-by.
The fighting continued into the next day, with police using their batons to stop the fighting.
For several hours, groups of liberators chanted "Don't hide, don't forgive" against the "Leaning against Spain" cries of the Commonwealth.
Fourteen people were treated for minor injuries by rioters, local media reported.
Tensions remain high in the liberal region a year after the October 1 referendum was deemed illegitimate by Madrid, but the celebration of the referendum by the Catalan liberals was a success.
Voters overwhelmingly chose to remain independent, although the turnout was low, as those opposed to secession mostly boycotted the elections.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were dismissed last year after police, in violent clashes, tried to stop elections in regional offices across the country.
Groups of libertines had camped out the night of the Sabbath to avoid a demonstration before the police.
The rebellion took place, of course, but it was forced to go another way.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who attended the protest with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about the prospect of Catalonia's unfreezing.
Last year we had one of the best moments.
I saw my parents crying with joy because they didn't have a vote, but now we are fasting", he said.
Despite a small victory in the December local elections, Catalan liberation groups have resisted the ongoing protests this year, with several of their leaders arbitrarily expelled or detained pending trial for their role in organising the referendum and the subsequent threat of self-determination.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who recorded the protest on his phone as a support to the police, said the clash was reported by politicians on both sides.
"It's going to get harder", he said.
On Saturday, one of the nine Catalan leaders who have been detained since late last year, Oriol Junqueras, announced that he would stand for the European Parliament next year.
"Being a candidate for European elections is the best way to celebrate the decline in democratic values and the repression that we have seen from the previous government", he said.
Londonderry: Men arrested after car ramming into house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after a car rammed into a house in Londonderry.
The scene took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 19:30 BST.
Detective Bob Blemming said there was damage to the doors and the houses themselves.
A laser arrow is also likely fired at the car.
The goal gave Livingston a 1-0 win over the Rangers.
Dolly Menga's first case for Livingston secured the victory
The Livingston-based expansion club threatened Rangers to give Steven Gerrard his next loss in 18 games as manager of the Ibrox side.
Dolly Menga's goal proved to be the difference, as Gary Holt's team moved up to level with Hibernian in second place.
Gerrard's side are yet to win a Premiership away game this season and face Hearts, who are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Before that, Rangers take on Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on the weekend.
Livingston, on the other hand, extends his undefeated streak in the league to six games, and head coach Holt is still missing a losing effort after taking over for Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston abuses the chances against blunt gestures
Holt's team should have been in the lead long before they scored, as their bone caused major problems for Rangers.
Scott Robinson converted the ball, but sent it in front of the goal and Alan Lithgow could only steer the ball past the goal after slipping in to meet the scorer Craig Halkett in the back.
The hosts were happy to let the Rangers have the ball, as they knew they could cause trouble for the visitors in the de-balling situations.
And so the case came to a head.
Rangers made a free kick and Livingston found a hole, and after a play between Declan Gallagher and Robinson a plan came to Menga, who made a move and scored from the middle of the break.
Rangers had kept control of the ball throughout the match, but could not break through the tight guard and the goalkeeper, Liam Kelly, had little to do.
The pattern continued into the second half, however, with Alfredo Morelos forcing Kelly into a save.
Scott Pittman was dismissed with his feet by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow went on to score another dead-ball for Livingston.
Inserts were continually introduced into the Livingston breakaway and were continually eliminated, while two requests for a breakaway kick - one for a tackle by Halkett on the Glenn Middleton interchange, and the other for a hand on the ball - were eliminated.
The first of the Livingston novels
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
An excellent piece of land and a result of Livingston.
They were all as one, unable to move, and they were going up hopelessly on the rampart that turned up.
Their style and personnel have remained almost unchanged since their return to the top division, but great credit must go to Holt, for the innovation of the team since his arrival.
He had so many heroes.
The commanding officer, Halkett, was the commanding officer of a well-organized guard, while the commanding officers Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall commanded the entire squadron.
The Rangers, however, didn't have much to offer.
As good as they have been in the past with Gerrard as coach, they disappointed them well and respectably today.
The last episode was lacking - they managed to outplay the opposition just once - and it is a serious blow for Rangers, who are in the middle of the division.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
There were smiles and blue clouds on Saturday (September 29), when Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is meant to soften the relationship between NATO countries.
There is a riot over issues of human rights, freedom of the press and the EU's membership of the Turkish state.
Erdogan then went to Cologne to open a large new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside of Turkmenistan.
Police announced that the security was the reason for a crowd of 25,000 people was prevented from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters gathered nearby to see their president.
Several hundred anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurdish - were heard in their condemnation of Erdogan's policies, including the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The controversy highlighted the rift between some Turkish Turkish nationals welcoming a guest while others find the same gesture hard to accept, such as a monarchist.
Combined in Deptford: Sugar dies in combination with alcohol
A sugar man has been killed in a car crash in London
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, in a view of the city, at about 10:15 BST.
The driver of the car was parked and the paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
The collision comes just months after another soccer player was killed by a speeding car on Childers Street, about a mile from the Saturday collision.
The police in the capital have ordered the police to work to find the man's body and send his family.
Roadblocks and bypasses at bus stops are in place and motorists are being asked to avoid the area.
Long Ladin Prison: Six police officers injured in a riot
Six prison guards have been released in a crackdown at a high-security prison, the Prison Service announced.
The rioting began in HMP Long Lartin in Worcestershire at about 9.30am on Sunday and is still ongoing.
The Special Tornado Police Force has been called in to investigate the unrest, which involves eight prisoners and is only on a section.
The officers were treated first to a small loose in the face of the place.
A prison spokesman said: "A number of prisoners' uniforms have been used to understand the events at HMP Long Lartin.
Six workers have been treated for their injuries.
We do not find it hard in our prisons and have been determined that the guilty ones be brought to the police so that they may be held longer.
HMP Long Lartin houses more than 500 inmates, including some of the most dangerous offenders in the country.
In June it was reported that the prison warden was being treated in hospital after being assaulted by a prisoner.
And last October, the police were called to the prison to investigate a serious disturbance in which workers were beaten with pole bullets.
The flooding of Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City
It's natural that a tropical depression will sweep through Arizona, but that's exactly what's likely to happen early next week, as the Rosa Wind turns its residual power over the Desert Southwest, creating flood hazards.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona into Southern and Eastern Nevada, the landscape in California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa is expected to take a direct route over Phoenix on Tuesday, and as she approaches late Monday it will rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that only 11 tropical cyclones have been named tropical storms or tropical depressions within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane within 40 miles of the AZ threshold.
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center expect 2 to 4 inches of rain, in places up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the Desert Southwest, including the middle of the Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, can expect 1 to 2 inches, possibly up to 4 inches in elevation.
For those outside the flood zone, the rain of Rosa may be a blessing, as the region is affected by the turkey.
Although flooding is a serious issue, the rainfall is likely to be helpful, as it is so dry in the Southwest at the moment.
According to U.S. Drought Monitor, just over 40 percent of Arizona experiences at least extreme drought, the second-highest recorded, according to weather.com.
To begin with, the Rosa River flows across the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, still with strong southwesterly winds of 85 mph, is 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico and moving north at 12 mph.
The cold ocean of the Pacific Ocean is getting colder every day and my brain is getting smaller.
It is therefore expected to make landfall in Mexico by a tropical storm late Monday or early evening.
Rainfall over parts of Mexico is likely to be heavy, which is a significant flood risk.
"Rain of 3 to 6 inches is expected from Baja California into the outer Sonora region, with up to 10 inches possible in places", weather.com advises.
Rosa then moves northward across Mexico as a tropical storm before touching the Arizona border early Tuesday as a tropical depression, then moves north through Arizona and into the southern part of Utah late Tuesday afternoon.
The largest expected hazard from Rosa or its remnants is a major flood in Baja California, the extreme southwest of Sonora and the U.S. Desert Southwest, the National Hurricane Center has stated.
These torrential rains will bring life-giving streams and streams of water in the wilderness, including torrents in the mountainous region.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrests for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found with knife wounds in Somerset.
The boy was found unresponsive in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton, at approximately 04:00 BST on Sunday morning.
He was rushed to the hospital where he remains in a critical condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested overnight in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset police said.
Police have urged anyone suspected of having phone records to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh is being targeted by the Democratic Party's enmity and anger.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to denounce the irresponsibility and shameful actions of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanaugh was "inundated with the anger and hostility of the Democratic Party all along" during his nomination.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on the day of the wedding, truthfully and sensitively denying Christine Blasey Ford's claim that he had sexually assaulted her years ago, when they were both teenagers.
Ford also testified to the justification of her preference.
The president said Saturday that the American people saw the courageous, skilled and brave Kavanaugh that day.
"A vote to impeach Kavanaugh is a vote to impeach one of the most generous political minds of our time, a lawyer with a distinguished record of public service", he told the West Virginia crowd.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination while discussing the importance of the Republican nomination for the midterm elections.
Five weeks from one of the most important decisions of our lives.
I'm not standing up, I'm really standing up", he said.
That's why I always fight for good candidates.
Trump wanted to be the one that the Democrats are in the dark to oppose and prevent.
The first significant Senate confirmation vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is not expected until Friday, a GOP aide told CNN.
Hundreds killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, numbers rising
At least 384 people were killed, many stranded, and many elderly people stranded on the beaches after a massive earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said Saturday.
Several hundred people gathered for a beach festival in the town of Palu on Friday, when a storm as high as six meters (18 feet) crashed onto the beach, killing many and destroying everything in its path.
The tsunami was followed by an earthquake measuring 7.5 on the Richter scale.
"When the threat of a tsunami emerged yesterday, people were still doing their jobs on the beach and did not immediately evacuate and were therefore killed", said the spokesman for the disaster management agency, BNPB, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, at a press conference in Jakarta.
The tsunami did not come by itself, it swept cars, trees, houses, it hit everything in its path", Nugroho said, adding that the tsunami had traveled across the open ocean at a speed of 800 km/h (497 mph) before hitting the coast.
Some people tried to climb into trees to escape the tsunami and survived, he said.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 locations in Palu.
The ruins of the disaster site show many destroyed buildings and shops, ramshackle and dilapidated bridges, and a moss surrounded by water.
The next day, an earthquake shook the city of Playa.
The magnitude of the earthquake was felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released in Friday's massive earthquake was about 200 times the energy of the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The city's layout, which lies on the edge of a long, narrow bay, may have made the tsunami even bigger, it said.
Nugroho described the damage as "devastating" and said that thousands of homes, hospitals, stores and hotels were razed to the ground.
Some bodies were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were freed and 29 missing.
Nugroho said the damage toll is likely higher as 300 km (190 miles) of beaches lie north of Palu, an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter.
The exchange was completely blocked with no information from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
'This is already a sad game, but it can be done much worse,' they said.
The library was found on Saturday to have failed to report that a tsunami had hit Palu, although police said the storm had hit before the warning was issued.
In private recordings shared on social media, an elderly man on the top floor of a building is heard warning people on the street below about the coming tsunami.
Within minutes, a wall of water washes ashore, sweeping away buildings and cars.
Reuters could not immediately confirm the recordings.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a widespread power outage that cut communications around Palu, making it very difficult for authorities to communicate rescue messages.
The military has begun sending medical aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, but many refugees still need food and other basic supplies.
The city's airport has reopened, except for emergency services, and will be closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation sites in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia is now estimated at 800.
It's not good.
While World Vision staff had safely reached Palu from Donggala, where workers were huddled in clouds of snow in the garden outside the office, they reached the destroyed sites, Mr Doseba said.
And they said, We have seen a great many houses left desolate.
It's not good.
Even when the soldiers began to make unwelcome advances, some of them complained that foreigners were being prevented from serving Paul.
According to Indonesian authorities, foreign coercion, manipulation and harassment can only occur if the site of the disaster is declared a national disaster area.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It is still a national tragedy", said Aulia Arriani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
 When the government says, No, this is a national disaster,  we can open for international aid, but there is nothing new yet.
On the second evening in Palu, after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, friends and family were still hoping for the miracle of their loved ones surviving the ordeal.
On the Sabbath a little boy was pulled from a well.
On the first day of the week, rescuers found a female lamb, which had been hidden under a brick wall for two days, with the body of its mother lying underneath it.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, won two of the four games for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
The other prisoners at the Roa Roa Hotel, including Lord Mandagi, were his disciples.
"As a paragliding enthusiast, I have my own burden of emotions", he said.
Mr. Gendon reported that within hours of the announcement of the Roa Roa Hotel's cancellation, he had sent a message on WhatsApp to the participants of the Palu festival on the beach.
But the command was just a grim flying-leg, not a double-leg.
"I think it means the orders didn't come", he said.
Thieves take $26,750 from the seabed at Newport on the Levee
Thieves stole $26,750 from a Brink employee Friday morning during a carjacking in Newport on Levee, according to a Newport police news release.
The driver of the vehicle had emptied a car in the maintenance meeting and was going to go after more money, detective Dennis McCarthy wrote in the report.
While he was working, another man came up behind the servants and stole a bag of money that was to be carried out.
Witnesses saw several people fleeing the scene, according to the scripture, but the police could not confirm the number of people involved.
Anyone with knowledge of their association is asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
Announcing the change on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote: "Formerly known as Kanye West.
West, 41, has been using the moniker Ye for some time and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The tour comes ahead of his Saturday Night Live performance, where he is expected to announce his new album, Yandhi.
He will be replaced by Ariana Grande, who left the show for "personal reasons", according to the creators of the show.
Aside from being an abbreviation of his current professional name, West has previously said that the word has a religious meaning to him.
"I believe that 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year, discussing the record label with radio host Big Boy.
'I am you, I am we, we are we.
It went from Kanye, which means the only one, to just Ye -- a picture of our good, our poor, our forgotten health.
The wing is more a reflection of who we are.
He's one of many rappers who have gone by the name.
Sean Combs has been variously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he revealed that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
A former colleague of West, JAY-Z, has also managed with or without binding strokes and large letters.
Mexican AMLO promises not to use the military against civilians.
Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians as the country approaches the 50th anniversary of a bloody revenge attack against the state.
Lopez Obrador vowed Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would never use the military to beat up the Mexican people.
Soldiers opened fire on a peaceful march in the square on October 2, 1968, killing as many as 300 people at a time when leftist student movements were rising in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support young Mexicans by offering monthly tuition to students and opening several public universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are drawing young people into criminal gangs.
The US was doubling its investment in artificial intelligence (AI).
As China becomes more active in the space industry, the US is doubling its research spending in this area, says investor Kai-Fu Lee, who is a senior executive at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
The comments come after several US government officials made similar statements, even though the US as a whole has no high-level intelligence plan.
Meanwhile, China announced its goal last year: to lead the world in smart innovation by 2030.
"Doubling the budget to smart grants would be a good start, because all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we're still looking for a decisive path for smart grants", Lee said.
A doubling of the funding could potentially double the chances of the next major white-collar crime in the United States, Lee explained in an interview with CNBC this week.
Lee, whose book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's most widely-used artificial intelligence companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, he was at Carnegie Mellon University, where he worked on a computer system that won Best American Actor in Othello, and later became the head of Microsoft Research and the head of Google in China.
Lee acknowledged the previous US government competition, the Defense Advanced Research Agency's current Robotics Challenge, and asked when the next one would take place so he could see the next designers.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to earn a general education degree, Lee said.
"It's not China that is taking away academic leaders; it's the business people", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other tech companies have been getting huge funding from universities to work on IT in recent years.
Lee said changes in immigration policy could also be useful to the United States to support its efforts in immigration.
"I think that work and living permits should be equated to people with a doctorate in medicine", he said.
The State Council of China has announced its Visionary Plan for the Next Generation in July 2017.
The National Natural Science Foundation of China aims to fund people at academic institutions, similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government agencies fund American researchers, but the quality of academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the US State Department established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to bring together industry and academia, and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that it's investing $2 billion in a program called AI Next.
On the contrary, the NSF currently makes investments in the region of $100 million per year.
Meanwhile, the US legislation that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has been inactive for months.
Macedonians vote on referendum on changing the country's name
The people of Macedonia went to a referendum on Sunday to decide whether to change its name to the "Republic of North Macedonia", a change that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece, which has avoided membership in the European Union and NATO.
The Greek state, which has a territory called Macedonia, has insisted on the name of its neighbours to the north bypassing a claim to its territory and has denied accession to NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the new name proposal, but nationalist opponents point out that the change will destroy the nationalism of the Slavic majority of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has announced that he will not vote in the referendum and a communications ban attack has cast doubt on whether the party will meet the minimum requirement of 50 percent to win the referendum.
The question on the ballot paper is: Are you for NATO and EU membership with the acceptance of the agreement by Greece.
Proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, point out that this is what is needed to prevent Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the break-up of Yugoslavia, from joining the EU and NATO.
"I came today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people of Macedonia to live free under the protection of the European Union, because it means that we all have a safer life", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although not required by law, some members of parliament have said they will follow the results of the election and make a decision.
The name change requires the approval of two-thirds of the Parliament.
The State Election Commission said that nothing irregular had occurred at 1 p.m.
However, the turnout was only 16 percent, compared to 34 percent for the last parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of those registered cast their vote.
"I have come to vote for my children and our place in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Prime Minister of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife, Zorica, and son, Dushko, cast their votes in favor of the referendum in Macedonia to change its name and thereby gain entry into NATO and the European Union, in Strumica, Macedonia, September 30, 2018.
Outside the parliament in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, managed to make a small stage and high chairs over the tents that are set up for those who want to boycott the referendum.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we want to go prepared, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we are respected.
If they don't want us to be like Macedonia, then we can go to other countries, like China or Russia, and be part of Eurasian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will generate much-needed investment in Macedonia, where unemployment is above 20 percent.
"I believe that the majority will vote for it because more than 80 percent of our population is for the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said that one thing was going to be a big problem for the future.
A poll conducted last Monday by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research said that between 30 and 43 percent of voters turned out to vote in the referendum - less than the required turnout.
Another poll, conducted by Macedonia's Telma TV, found that 57 percent of respondents planned to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
For a referendum to be valid, the threshold must be at least 50 percent plus one vote.
If the referendum is defeated, it will be the first serious blow to the policy of the Western-led government since it took over in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero drives through all of Brighton's defence to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling were quick to point out the Brighton hosts' 2-0 victory over Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look easy when he scored in the 65th minute.
The Argentinian forward received a midfield send-off in the opening round of the tournament.
He went a full round of three Brighton defenders before running free after the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green trout.
He went on to beat a defender and then ran off several on the edge of Brighton's break-even window.
He passed the ball to his left, where he found Sterling.
The English forward returned the ball with his first nerting to Aguero, who used his right hook to send the ball past Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot into the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet", City manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about letting him play 55, 60 minutes.
And that is exactly what happened.
We were lucky that he scored right away.
However, it was Sterling who gave them the sky blue lead in the Premier League game.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero then scored a deep shot on Brighton's goal.
He sent a beautiful run ball over the left side to Leroy Sane.
Sane made a few shots before leading Sterling against a battered stick.
The celestial striker burst into action just before he left the pitch.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to use the outfielder against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoffs, there was no need to start over.
But Scherzer, always competitive, hopes to pitch Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but even if the Rockies can make the playoffs, they are one game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies secured a wild-card berth with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but will still try to win their first division title.
Even if we don't play for anything, we can at least throw, knowing that the song the Denver crowd will sing is going to be good and that the team will all the same go to play at the highest level that I have faced this year.
Why shouldn't I be competitive in it?
The Nationals have yet to announce who will start Sunday, but rumors circulate that they will allow Scherzer to pitch in such a situation.
Scherzer, who can start for 34 seconds, threw in practice Thursday and throws on his rest day if he starts.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump to head to West Virginia
The president indirectly referred to the situation with his choice of Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh, while discussing the importance of a Republican rally for the midterm elections.
Everything we've done is on the line in November.
Five weeks away from the most important decision of our lives.
This is one of the really big -- I'm not running, I'm really running, and that's because I'm always fighting for good candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible, rampant group of Democrats, you see it happening right now.
And they are determined to take revenge by all necessary means, you see the unclean spirit.
They do not put anyone to the torture who must be trampled to get power and authority. That is the power and authority they want, and we will not give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are in the business of opposing and preventing.
"You will see it over the last four days", he said, "and he will call the Democrat a coward, an evildoer, a filthy liar".
He pointed to the judiciary in the Senate, and named Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, prompting the audience to shout "hate group".
Do you remember her answer?
Have you ever been to the hospital?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, no, I was waiting - it was a terrible physical pain - the worst physical pain I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer a church
Such accusations are not in agreement with each other.
When Momentum activists in my local party voted to disapprove of my dissent, it was no surprise.
On the other hand, I'm the last in a long line of Labour MPs who understand that we are not welcome - anyone to speak their mind.
My parliamentary colleague, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way when she steadfastly fought anti-Semitism.
In my case, the notion of distrust came because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
The importance of a sound economic policy, national security, Europe, economic growth, are the same issues on which Jeremy disagreed with his former colleagues.
The report of the Nottingham East Labour Friday meeting stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive".
For most of my eight years as a local Labour MP, meeting at the conference on a Friday evening was exactly that.
However, the tone of many meetings and the promise of a viable, authoritative politics has long since been forgotten, if it ever began.
It has become increasingly clear that dissent is not tolerated in the Labour Party, and that all views are judged by whether they are acceptable to the party leadership.
This all started shortly after Jeremy became CEO when colleagues who I thought I shared political beliefs with started to expect me to be a bully and have beliefs that I would never have agreed with - now with regard to nationalism or the internal market of the EU.
Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there is a barrage of outrage on social media, calling for dissent, denouncing the policies of the MPs and saying I shouldn't have been in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
I know for a fact that I am more hated by some of my colleagues because the comments against me are purely political.
I have respect for the professionalism and moderation of those colleagues who face gross sexist and racist attacks every day, but never give up.
One of the biggest disappointments in this era of politics is how common conflict has become.
Jeremy Corbyn called last week for the Labour Party to develop a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church, and with all the misunderstandings or rules regarding election changes, the group is getting smaller and smaller.
I have received many counsels in the last two years that you have encouraged me to be humble, not to say much and so that I would have much to teach.
But that's not what I'm in politics for.
Since joining the Labour Party as a schoolteacher 32 years ago, spurred on by the Thatcher government and its neglect that had broken down my large-scale public library, I have tried to advocate better public services for those who need them most - whether that be as a councillor or a government minister.
I have never changed my politics, not even in the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could have been disillusioned with my political position, including disagreements with the current leadership.
To those who supported the idea of mistrust on Friday, I can only say that as the country is heading towards a Brexit that will damage homes, businesses and our public services, I did not feel the need to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour Party chairman.
But my message is certainly not for Nottingham Momentum, it is for my constituents, whether they are Labour members or not: I am here to serve you and I promise that no threat of resignation or political self-interest will deter me from working for what I believe is best for all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Undefeated Ayr go to the top
Two late scores may have skewed the final result somewhat, but there is no doubt that Ayr would have achieved victory in this ongoing dispute in Tennent's Premiership today.
They are now on top of the table, the only undefeated team of the ten.
In the end, it was also much to the dismay of the guards as their better decision of chances carried home the win, and the coach, Peter Murchie, had good reason to be satisfied.
We have been persecuted in our own way and we are still undefeated, so I can rejoice", he said.
Robyn Christie of Melrose said: "Rose to Ayr, they took better chances than we did.
A 14th-minute goal from Grant Anderson, converted by Frazier Climo, sent Ayr on the lead, but a yellow card to Scottish captain Rory Hughes, issued for the match from the Warriors, allowed Melrose to score and Jason Baggot a non-scoring goal.
Climo added to Ayr's frustration with a break-slap before he, just before half-time, scored and conceded a one-run home run to make it 17-5 to Ayr in the tiebreaker.
However, Melrose started the second half well and the score of Patrick Anderson, converted by Baggot, reduced the lead down to five points.
A long stoppage followed, due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who was carried off the field on the pitch, and when they started again, Ayr came further ahead after a scoring by Stafford McDowall, which was overseen by Climo.
Ayr's temporary captain, Blair Macpherson, was dealt the yellow card and Melrose again won the match with a man-of-the-match, with a non-overthrow scored by Bruce Colvine, after a heated press.
The home team came back, however, and when Struan Hutchinson got a yellow card to thank Climo without a ball, MacPherson went all the way from the penalty line, offending an advancing Ayr team.
Climo resigned, which he did again almost immediately after Kyle Rowe was kicked by David Armstrong and sent off the winger, Gregor Henry, who scored the team's fifth goal.
Still Game star prepares for new career in the restaurant industry
Still Game star Ford Kieran is set to move into the hospitality industry after it emerged he was named CEO of a well-known restaurant chain
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis on the popular BBC series, which he writes and stars in alongside veteran comedian Greg Hemphill.
The makers announced that the ninth installment in the series will be the last in the series, and it seems that Kiernan is preparing for a life after Craiglang.
According to public records, he is the chairman of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor refuses to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun suggested that Kiernan was trying to get into the burgeoning restaurant industry in Glasgow.
"The lake is ours": Bolivia's interior minister hopes the court will reopen the Pacific Ocean route.
Mariners oversee the rain-covered La Paz sea port.
The general buildings are flagged with a sea blue flag.
Lakes from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are painted with the motto: "The lake is our right".
Getting him back is a duty.
Everywhere in the interior of Bolivia is the memory of a beach, lost to Chile in a bloody confiscation battle in the nineteenth century, but vital - the longing to sail the Pacific again in the same way.
Hopes are perhaps as high as they have been for centuries, with Bolivia now awaiting a decision from the International Court of Justice on October 1 after five years on the sidelines.
"Bolivia has developed a sense of place and honor and is expecting a fair return", said Roverto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will look to the International Court of Justice's decision in the long-term, hoping that the Hague court will decide in favor of Bolivia that - after centuries of unsuccessful negotiations - Chile is obliged to negotiate an independent access to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, the native, charismatic president of Bolivia - who faces a battle of a controversial re-election next year - will also be spending Monday's decision.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised late in August.
However, some commentators believe that it is unlikely that the judiciary will vote for Bolivia - and that little will change if it votes for it.
The Dutch parliament does not have the power to decide on a constitutional area, and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of any possible negotiations.
The fact that the ICC's decision comes just six months after the final arguments were made shows that the case is not complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And rather than pushing Bolivia's quest, the last four years have perhaps made it even more dangerous.
"The issue of access to the sea is overshadowed by the current situation in Bolivia", Zárate said.
Morales's rhetorical manliness has removed the remnants of the goodwill, if any remained, of the spectre.
Bolivia and Chile will eventually talk again, but it will be very difficult to agree after this.
The two countries have not had diplomatic relations since 1962.
Former president Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, the Bolivian ambassador to The Hague, pointed out that the court's thinking was unusually quick.
Monday will be for Bolivia "an unprecedented opportunity to undertake a new relationship with Chile and an opportunity to end a 139-year old disagreement with the joint ventures", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still a popular president in Latin America - used the Navy as a political weapon.
Bolivia has repeatedly denied its right to access the Pacific Ocean.
"The past gives us the opportunity to see that we must forget the past".
North Korea has said that it will not disarm its nuclear weapons unless it can rely on the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will never disarm its nuclear weapons unless it can rely on Washington.
Ri spoke at the general meeting of ST.
He urged the United States to keep its promises made at a summit of world leaders in Singapore.
His remarks come in the wake of US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's announcement that he would begin using the country's nuclear arsenal more than three months after Singapore's Kim Jong Un ousted North Korea.
Ri says it is a "credible myth" that the continuing declarations and US claims of a Korean statehood will ever define North Korea.
Washington is wary of a nuclear deal unless Pyongyang makes significant changes to its disarmament policy.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want to hold a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang will actually give up a nuclear arsenal, which it believes is the only way to ensure its security.
Pompeo is planning to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
Fashion shows in Paris unveil the latest line of luxury headwear that's on its way to your front door.
If you want to stretch your collection of hats or completely rock the sun, then look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne unveiled a series of knit, oversized main garments for their SS19 range on the launch runway, which blinded the style that was set for the Paris fashion show.
A lot of hot hats have been all over Instagram this summer and these designers have sent their favorite models up after the fashion show.
Valentino's particular infatuation was a very determined, gray-brown hat adorned with a feather-like, large shadow that filled the heads of the models.
Other oversized lozenges were a now-spicy watermelon, a magic-call hat, and a single pineapple - but they were not made to keep the head warm.
Thom Browne also revealed a selection of the same masks - in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks have backward-looking warts and resemble Hannibal Lecter more than the fine carpeting.
One creature resembled a frog's nest with its spikes and specks and everything, while the other was like a burning flame of ice.
And if you continue to watch the big opposition news - you're lucky.
Fashion experts expect the eye-catching hats to soon be found on many major streets.
The unusually large hats come in the collars of La Bomba, the striped hat with a two-foot-long shadow seen on everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult logo on the back of the unheard-of hats, which was ubiquitous on social media, also has a second, large frame on the chain link - a straw beach bag, almost as big as the model in the swimsuit that wears it.
The bright yellow satin bag, with fringe and white leather handles, was the most prominent piece of the La Riviera SS19 collection by Jacquemus at the Paris fashion show.
Celebrity snow consultant Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags on the main streets next summer - now that snow has had such a big impact, it will be difficult to avoid the requirement of oversized lofts".
John Edward: Language skills are crucial for global citizenship
The free schools in Scotland maintain a reputation for academic excellence and this has continued in 2018 with unusually good test scores once again, which are only reinforced by good results in individual and team competitions, art, music and other team events.
With over 30,000 pupils in Scotland, these schools, represented by The Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), are renowned for providing the best possible service to their pupils and parents.
Free schools aim to prepare their students for further education, their chosen career path and their place as global citizens.
As a teaching department that can design and design a curriculum, we see more and more modern subjects being chosen as subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he knows, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
From the examination results this year, we see that the target is at the top of the list of the highest percentage of students who pass the examination in the free schools.
In total, 68 percent of students who read a foreign language got the highest test score.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students scored high in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those who had English, 69 percent of those who had French, and 63 percent of those who had Spanish also scored high.
This proves that free schools in Scotland accept that foreign languages are of great importance and that children and young people have a need for them in the future.
Language as a subject is now being equated with STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering, and math) in the curriculum of universities and other institutions.
A survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills in 2014 found that 17 per cent of the reasons employers struggle to fill vacancies are related to language skills shortages.
Therefore, language skills are essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
As more future job opportunities will require language skills, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
Regardless of their occupation, learning a foreign language can be a lifelong skill and a benefit to their future.
Being able to communicate directly with people from foreign countries puts a multifaceted personality ahead of its competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK, 75 percent did not speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation, with French being the only spoken language to have a double-digit percentage, at 15 percent.
That's why investing in language education is so important for kids now.
Knowing more languages, especially those spoken in countries with a growing economy, will give children a better chance of finding meaningful employment.
In Scotland, the language is taught in different schools.
Many schools focus on the classical modern languages, while others teach the languages that are likely to be most important to the UK by 2020, namely Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there is always a wide selection of subjects to choose from in free schools, with qualified teachers.
Scottish free schools work diligently to provide an educational environment that prepares children and equips them with the skills that are a prerequisite for good results, whatever the future may hold.
There is no denying that in the world of commerce, the issue of the future of a country is very important, so it should be reflected in the education system.
Modern languages should indeed be considered as international communication skills.
Free schools will continue to offer these choices, diversity and role models to the youth of Scotland.
We have to do it right.
John Edwards is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is set to play his first Lakers game Sunday in San Diego
The wait is almost over for fans who are looking forward to seeing LeBron James make his first start for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the team's practice session against the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in San Diego.
But exactly how many minutes he will have is still unknown.
"It's more than one and less than 48", Walton told the Lakers' official website.
Lakers announcer Mike Trudell tweeted that James' season would likely be cut short.
After training earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six training camp games.
'I don't need any training at this stage of my career to become clever,' he said.
Trump's meeting time in West Virginia, YouTube Channel
President Donald Trump is launching a series of rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It is the first of five planned meetings for Trump next week, including stops in the popular states of Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the threat of his election to fill the vacant seat in the US Senate growing, Trump plans to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress in the November elections.
Trump's West Virginia rally is coming up this evening, and what do you think of the Internet?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is set to take place at 7 pm ET on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can stream Trump's West Virginia meeting live on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to discuss the impeachment of Brett Kavanaugh, who was appointed to the Supreme Court this week, a position that was closed due to a sexual abuse scandal, with a Senate confirmation hearing suspended for up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of this fundraising campaign is to help Republicans in the November election.
Trump's team has announced that the five meetings next week are aimed at boosting voter turnout and support as Republicans seek to defend and increase their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"The strength of the Congress is so important to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we approach an emergency", a Trump spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
The event at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling this evening is likely to draw fans from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get coverage in the Pittsburgh media, according to the West Virginia Metro News.
The vote marks the second time in less than a month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state where he won by more than 40 percent in 2016.
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrisey, who is running in the primary.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president is forced to come and strengthen him in the election efforts", Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, told Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA shows battle spirit to keep hopes alive ahead of Sunday's singles matches.
After three days of the other team's dread, the two-on-two Saturday afternoon match was perhaps the Ryder Cup match for the Ryder Cup.
The pendulum swing of the models is a perfectly contrived concept in athletics, but it is one that athletes believe in wholeheartedly and firmly, and never more so than in competitions such as these.
So who has the example now?
"They were six steps ahead, and now there are only four, so I think we have a slight advantage at the moment", said Jordan Spieth, as he wrapped up his day.
Europe, of course, leads the way, with four points to go and twelve to play for.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel that they have some wind in their sails and they have plenty to back it up, not least the performance of Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and can break themselves with three out of four possible points.
Spieth has been extremely troublesome from the first game to the flat round of the hole and is on the outside.
The boat crew of joy grew harder as each rounded his way, until he missed a significant putt and tied for fourth, after he and Thomas had been behind by two after two catches.
The potter who won their match on the 15th hole was celebrated with a similar cheer, the stroke that gives you the assurance that he does not think the American team is out.
'You just have to dig deep and think about your own future,' Spieth said.
It's the only thing these players have left now.
18 holes to set their weight on.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas over the past two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the undisputed legend of the Ryder Cup.
The multi-faceted and at the same time imaginative peers of Europe have four out of four and can do no wrong.
The Mollwoods were the only pair not to shoot a bow late Saturday morning, but they also avoided firing any bow Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and on the last nine holes of Friday morning.
This process, as well as the way the energy seems to flow both to and from the spectator, confirms that they are the ones who will win on Sunday, and the only well-known players who can possibly confirm a European win, now that the sun has set on Le Golf National, are Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time in different caves.
However, there is not much information about European names.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly eliminated Sergio Garcia, the Spanish four-ball hero this morning, in a match with Alex Noren.
An arrow and two double at one ninth, buried the spaniel and threw it down a hole from which they could never get out.
On the Sabbath day, no one will lift you out of the pit.
Both the two-handed game and the four-handed game are so pleasing to watch at close range, because of the interaction between the pairs, the advice they give, the advice they don't give and how a plan can change in the moment.
Europe has played better as a team until the second half and are well ahead before the final day, but these two games have also shown that Team USA has a fighting spirit that some, especially Stateside, have doubted.
Europe ahead 10-6 before the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe has the advantage before the final day of the Ryder Cup, after they were eliminated from the tournament by four shots on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
The thoughtful pair of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the way with two wins over the struggling Tiger Woods and took their record at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorn's European side, looking to recapture the trophy they lost at Hazeltine two years ago, had taken control of a non-starter from the US in the four-ball match this morning, winning 3-1.
The United States provided more opposition in the two-legged matches, winning two games, but failed to reduce their advantage.
Jim Furyk's team will have eight points in the 12 individual events on Sunday to recover the steeplechase.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four straight points, while he and Molinari, named Mollwood after a successful weekly replacement, are only the second pair to have won four straight points from their first four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After beating Woods and Patrick Reed in the match with four balls in play, they also played well together and won on a ring by beating Woods and American star Bryson Dechambeau with an even more decisive 5&4.
Woods, who missed two games on Saturday, showed in some big games, but he has now lost 19 of 29 games with four walks in extra time, and has lost seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who was rested this morning for the four-ball match, returned to his team-mate, Henrik Stenson, in the two-man match with a 2&1 loss to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - number one and three in the world.
The European team, however, did not get everything it wanted on a nice, cool day in a view of Paris.
Triple winners of major tournaments Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas doubled the Americans' score on Saturday.
They took a crushing 2&1 victory over Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the match with four balls in play, and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4&3 in the two-hour match, after losing the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team come back from a four-point deficit before the singles, although Furyk's team, who won last year, needed only a draw to recover the lead.
After being second best for two days, it is unlikely that they will be able to return on Sunday.
North Korea says 'short' no to unilateral disarmament
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing declarations had increased mistrust in the United States and that there was no possibility that the country would give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the UN General Assembly that North Korea has taken "significant goodwill actions" over the past year, including ending nuclear weapons and missile tests, removing its nuclear weapons program, and pledging not to increase the number of nuclear weapons.
"But we don't see any corresponding responses from the United States", he said.
Without trust in the United States, we will not trust our national security, and under such circumstances, it is not appropriate for us to disarm first.
While Ri repeated well-known complaints about Washington's opposition to a gradual disarmament plan in which North Korea would be rewarded incrementally, his statement seemed to suggest that they did not reject the unilateral disarmament that Pyongyang has undertaken completely.
Ri was referring to a joint statement made by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at the first-ever summit between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim pledged to work towards a denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, while Trump gave promises about the security of North Korea.
North Korea has been seeking a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has ordered Pyongyang to first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also opposed calls for a harsh, international response to North Korea.
The US remains committed to "disarmament-first" and increasing pressure on the pledge to achieve its goals in a non-violent manner, and is opposed to "any end to the war", Ri said.
The fear that confessions can bring us down is a wishful-wishing of people who are ignorant of us.
But the problem is that the constant promises increase our mistrust.
Ri did not mention plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the US leader disclosed at the United Nations earlier this week.
The secretary also highlighted the three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months and added: "If the problem of disarmament came from South Korea and not the United States, the disarmament of the Korean peninsula would not be as firm as it is now".
Ri's tone was so different from last year's, when he told the UN General Assembly that the US mainland was being targeted by North Korean missiles after Mr Trump called Mr Kim a "rocketman" with a suicide mission.
At the United Nations this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally dismantle" North Korea, praised Kim for his boldness in taking steps to disarm, but said much work remained to be done and that commitments had to be made before North Korea disarmed.
On Monday, Trump said he had no timetable for this, saying "If it takes two years, three years, or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia say the UN Security Council should have recognized Pyongyang for its actions.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "the cycle of the Security Council's commitment must continue vigorously and decisively until we see a comprehensive, final, verified disarmament".
The Security Council has increased the number of confessions on North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to curb Pyongyang's development of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang next month to set up a new meeting.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but the last visit did not go well.
He left Pyongyang in July and said steps were being taken before North Korea within hours accused him of making "criminal" demands.
North Korea pledged, in a meeting with Moon this month, to take down a missile base in addition to a nuclear base if the United States made a "compatible" attack.
He said Kim told him that the only response he wanted was the security assurances Trump had promised in Singapore and moving toward a more normal relationship with Washington.
Harvard students take classes to get enough rest
A new program at Harvard University this year has given its readers more sleep, in an attempt to combat the growing self-consciousness of the human population, to read through caffeinated "all-nighters".
One academic warned that students at the world's top universities are often completely clueless about taking care of themselves.
Charles Czeisler, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, conducted the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to do the course after attending a lecture on the impact of sleep deprivation on learning.
Finally, one of the elders came to me and said, 'Why didn't anyone tell me this until now, in my last year?'
She said that no one had ever explained to her the importance of sleep - which came as a surprise to me", he told The Telegraph.
The course, which was offered for the first time this year, teaches students from the basics of how good sleep habits help academic and athletic achievements, as well as improve well-being and well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the university's health program, said the university chose to introduce the program after warning that students were seriously sleep-deprived.
The hour-long show features a series of collaborative presentations.
In one part is a picture of a common room where students press on coffee cups, curtains, shoes and books and are informed about the effects of caffeine and light, and how sports are affected by sleep deprivation, including the importance of a sleep disorder.
In another section, students are given a report on how chronic sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, then encourages participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that it will not change the behavior of students directly.
But we think they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know about health risks if you choose to smoke", added Prof. Czeisler.
The concept of pride in staying up all night is still there, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students to stay up all night are a growing problem.
Ensuring that you get enough sleep, a good night's sleep, should be a student's secret weapon to fight against stress, fatigue, and anxiety - even to avoid taking medication, he said - because lack of sleep puts the brain in a sleepy state, and they're always hungry.
So Raymond, a 19-year-old Californian who studies molecular and anatomical biology, helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he took a class with him last year in his first year at Harvard.
He said the fact opened his eyes and inspired him to try to get a job for the whole university.
The next step, he hopes, will be to encourage students to continue to complete similar courses before entering athletic institutions.
Prof Czeisler recommends that students should set an alarm clock when they should go to sleep, and one when they should get up, and be aware of the effects of blue light emitted by electronic skis and LED lights, which can make your social environment in danger, as well as making it difficult for students to fall asleep.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: The goal of Gerrard's many low-scoring players
The Rangers suffered another disappointing result on the road, as Dolly Menga's goal gave Steven Gerrard's team a 1-0 home defeat in Livingston.
The Ibrox side were looking for their first away win since their 4-1 February defeat at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side managed to give Gerrard his second defeat in 18 matches as manager, leaving his side eight points behind the eventual winners, Hearts, who have been beaten in the Ladbrokes Premiership.
Many hit until seven minutes into the half and the Rangers' set-up, without inspiration, never seemed to match.
With Rangers now relegated to sixth place, Livingston moves up to third, alongside Hibernian, only with a more difficult goal.
And there may be more trouble ahead for the Rangers after the lineman, Calum Spence, had to be treated for a head injury as something was obviously thrown from the outfield.
Gerrard made eight substitutions in the team that defeated Ayr in the semi-final of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, started with the same 11 that took points from Hearts last week, and he has been overwhelmed by the way the well-maintained team has overwhelmed the opposition every time they have had the chance.
The Rangers were maybe more on the ball, but Livingston did more with it when they had him.
They should have scored two minutes later, when Menga with the first nerting sent Scott Pittman off for Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder misused his big chance by shooting ahead of the goal.
A long free kick from Keaghan Jacobs caught team captain Craig Halkett, but defender Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot forward from the left-handed stick.
The Rangers came to control the spell, but there were obvious hopes rather than beliefs in it in the final third.
Alfredo Morales claimed he had a breach kick after a short fight between him and Steven Lawless, but the referee, Steven Thomson, dismissed the Colombian's claims.
Rangers managed only two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was badly hit by Lassana Coulibaly's scorer and a free kick from Ovie Ejaria.
Even if Livi's goal after 34 minutes was possibly against the course of the game, their effort made it impossible to deny that it was upset.
Again, the Rangers failed to score on a long free throw from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher played the ball for Scott Robinson, who immediately put the ball up so he could easily shoot the ball.
Gerrard made a change in strategy when he substituted Coulibaly for Ryan Kent, and the change had almost an immediate impact when the winger put Morelos up, but instead Kelly played out of line and blocked.
But Livingston kept getting the guests to play exactly as they wanted, with Lithgow and Halkett dropping long balls again and again.
Holt's team had been able to double the lead at the end of the game, but McGregor stood well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow sent a scalpel ahead of the goal after the corner.
Rangers' switch Glenn Middleton also had a claim of a foul kick complicated by Jacobs, but again Thomson looked away.
Almanac: The Inventor of the Geiger counter
A page from our "Sunday Morning Almanac": September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today and that TELUR --- the day when the future scientist, Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a way to detect and measure the activity of a jet, an invention that eventually became known as the Geiger gauge.
A large part of science since then, the joke became a widespread part of popular culture in the 1950 film "Bells of Colorado", with the two scientists, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: 'What in heaven's name is that?
Rogers: Here is a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive rock, especially uranium.
When you sit in this central chamber, you hear the impact of the atoms, as the lightning action in the rocks does.
Evans: Tell me, now really melt!
Hans Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.

This method involves extracting resistant cells from a patient, then injecting them in the laboratory to target a protein common to many types of cancer called HER2, and then re-inserting the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, at the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "These results show that we have a very promising population.
HER2 is a common drug in many types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colon cancer, Prof. Berzofsky reported.
A similar technique of taking resistant cells from a patient and "training" them to mimic the cancer cells has been used to treat a type of blood cancer.
Kanye West went into the hallway with an unlikely pro-Trump outburst, in a MAGA dress, after his SNL performance.
It Was Not Easy
Kanye West was booed off the stage of Saturday Night Live after a controversial performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump and said he planned to run in 2020.
After the performance of his third song of the evening, titled Ghost Town, where he was in a Make America Great contest, he began to confront Democrats and withdrew his support for Trump.
So often I talk to a white person and they say, "How can you like Trump, he's a racist?"
If I cared about racism, I would have left the US a long time ago", he said.
SNL began the evening with a chess game with Matt Damon, who paid tribute to Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the grand jury regarding the sexual assault charges against Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not sent, the footage of West's mother was posted on social media by the shooter, Chris Rock.
It is unknown whether Rock intended to anger West with his act.
West also complained to the judges that he was treated harshly because of his headgear.
They beat me behind the fence.
They said, "Don't go out there in the rabbit race".
They attacked me!
And then they say I'm in a blind spot", he told the Washington Examiner.
West came forward and said, 'Do you want to see the dark city?' And he said, 'I want to hide in the hero's box, because that means no one can tell me what to do. Do you want the world to move forward?'
The Bible says: "Keep on loving one another".
His comments were echoed by viewers at least twice, and SNL cast members seemed to be upset, Variety reported, with one person saying in the article: "The entire network was upset".
West was inducted as a finalist for the singer Ariana Grande, whose former mentor, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days before.
West was heavily criticized for his performance of the song I Love It when he was cast as a Perrier Whip.
West was supported by the leader of the conservative group, TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: THANK YOU FOR SETTING UP THE ENGINE IN A HORROR".
But left-wing host Karen Hunter tweeted that West just "remained who he is, and it's absolutely amazing".
But I choose NOT to encourage anyone - whether by buying their music, clothing, or artwork - because I am ashamed of holding such opinions and I would be shocking the congregation.
He is free.
And so are we", she added.
Prior to the broadcast, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and said that he was now Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The rapper, Snoop Dogg, has gone by the name Snoop Lion and not to mention the musical hero Prince, the soul who changed his name to a symbol for the artist formerly known as Prince.
Convicted of murder after knife fight in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The accused is expected to appear in the Belfast District Court on Monday.
The charges are reviewed by the public prosecutor.
The star of Game of Thrones, Kit Harrington, is found to be a manly eater.
Kit Harrington is known for her sword-wielding role as Jon Snow in HBO's epic, medieval fantasy television series Game of Thrones.
But the actor, 31, finds the conventional image of the macho heroes, saying that such roles on the screen often make young boys think they must be tough to get respect.
In an interview with The Times Sunday Culture, Kit said that he believes that "the moment has gone wrong" and posed the question of how this problem of male identity under the #MeToo movement can be solved.
Kit, who recently married fellow Game of Thrones actress Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he has strong feelings about the issue.
'I personally think, especially at this time, where did we go wrong with humanity?' he said.
What have we taught people growing up in comparison to the troubles we see today?
Kit believes that television is partly responsible for the increasingly masculine gender, as there are so many male roles.
He said to them, "What is the commandment and the law?"
What is taught on TV and in the streets that makes young men remain virgins is that such men must be.
I really think that's one of the big questions right now is, how do we change that?
For it is evident that something has gone wrong with you young men.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be doing any specials or continuing Game of Thrones when the show ended next summer, adding that he is "very excited and excited".
From November, Kit will star in a revival of Sam Shepard's True West, a story about a film producer and his brother, a thief.
The actor also recently revealed that he thought the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones was that he met his wife, Rose.
I met my wife in this mission, so in many ways it gave me my future family, and my life from now on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the love interest of Kit's character, Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning television series.
The couple married in June 2018 on the grounds of the Leslie family's ancestral estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has reported a 14% drop in the number of people living with HIV and Aids.
More than 820,000 people are affected in the country, according to health officials.
About 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the new cases were carried on through sexual intercourse, a change from previously.
Traditionally, HIV spread rapidly in parts of China as a result of contaminated blood transfusions.
But the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a news conference in Yunnan province.
However, year by year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
The continued transmission of HIV through sexual contact is a critical issue in the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is reported to be common.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70-90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
The reason for the continued illness of patients is in most cases the lack of adequate hygiene in these wards.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promoted public access to HIV treatment as part of its efforts to address the problem.
Maxine Waters denies staffers leaked data of Republican senator and points to "dangerous lies" and "crowdfunding"
U.S. Representative Maxine Waters condemns accusations that an employee posted personal information of three Republican senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that the content was controlled by ultra-right pundits and websites.
"Lies, lies and more worthless lies", Waters said in a Twitter post.
The leaked information reportedly included the current residence and phone number of U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee of Utah, and Orrin Hatch of Utah.
The information surfaced online on Thursday, sent out by an unknown person on Capitol Hill, as the Senate trial of sexual abuse nominee Brett Kavanaugh was underway.
The delay came shortly after the three senators had questioned Kavanaugh.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address of the person who made the disclosure had contacted Waters's office and sent out information about one of Waters' employees, Hill reported.
"These unsubstantiated allegations are completely untrue and nothing but lies", Waters argued.
My employees - who have had their personal information and privacy compromised as a result of these fraudulent and untrue commitments - had no responsibility for the leakage of this information.
These baseless accusations are completely untrue and nothing but lies.
Waters's advocacy quickly gained online attention, including from former White House mediator Ari Fleischer.
"The rejecter is full of rage", wrote Fleischer.
She indicates that she has no sense of being a member of Congress.
When men are condemned for what they have not done, they cannot stand condemnation.
They can't be wrong.
nor can they produce any evidence in support of the charges against them.
to be peaceable, quiet, self - controlled, not holding back from what is right.
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters' defense with the Democrats' feelings about Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of being too angry during the trial yesterday.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to take Waters' seat in the midterm election, also expressed his views on Twitter.
"Sure, if it is possible", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had informed the authorities and police about the false allegations.
We want to ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, she said, and that they are found guilty of their actions, which are ruining and causing trouble for some of my employees.
Johnny English Strikes Again review - Rowan Atkinson without the slightest spy parody
It is now customary to look at Brexit implications in a new film with a British cast and it seems to be useful in this revival of Johnny English, the action-slasher film - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn
Self-pity, said with a toast, about how little we use to be taken advantage of the possibility of exporting for the country?
In any case, the outspoken, unassuming, uneducated Johnny English has been allowed to knock it out once again - and even his name suggests that he is a broad-minded prankster made for the non-English film subject.
He is, of course, the taciturn, secret spy who, despite his secret attempt to show elegance, reminds a little of Clouseau, a little of Mr Bean and a little of the rabbit flock, which with a unique note helps in the Chariots of Fire theme for the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
He is also originally based on the international, streetwise traveler who Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard television advertisements that turned everything into chaos.
There are one or two good moments in this new JE movie.
I loved when Johnny English approached the turtle in a medieval costume and the turtle feathers briefly slid against his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is evident, but the song feels a little uninspired and unnecessarily sometimes, especially when the "serious" films, such as 007 and Mission Impossible, have now also suffered from comedy.
It seems that the plot is intended for children rather than adults, and I don't think Johnny English's crazy antics are as inventive and mediocre as Atkinson's finches in the silent film role as Bean.
The point that is made over and over again is that Britain is in big trouble.
A computer hacker has infiltrated the top secret network of spies, exposing the unity of all the British spies in the division to the fear of one of the spies on the mission - a minor role played by Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a Prime Minister whose shell is already broken by political infamy: Emma Thompson does her best to play this quasi-Teresa May, but there's not much to work on in the script.
Her navigator informs her that since all spies are out of drift, she must call a defect.
And that means the clown Johnny English, who is now the headmaster of some fancy school, but secretly teaches the kids to be spies: something weird is going on here, now that English is offering a spy academy similar to School of Rock.
English is sent to Whitehall for a crèche and is reunited with his former, long-suffering partner Bough, played by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, tied to a cafe manager, a free-spirited, shady character, with Vicki Pepperdine a bit of a distraction.
Batman and Robin are back, and face the beautiful young Ophelia Bulletova, played by Olga Kurylenko.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is purely seduced by the charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the pregnant Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin the perilous journey of cleverly: dressed as servants, they set a French restaurant on fire; they create a rumbul when they sneak aboard Volta's marble boat; and English unleashes the perfect sense of craftiness when he tries to use a thick-skinned listening device to get to know Volta's house.
All the stages of the journey are unmistakably foreshadowed by the final act, but the smooth and measured way it is done is very much like a child's play.
Very unusual things.
And as with the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Can the British filmmaker give Rowan Atkinson a role that truly shows his talent?
Labour denies that they are working on a plan to get Britons to work four days but get paid for five.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party is considering a proposed plan to get Britons to work four days a week - but get paid for five.
The party is said to want company executives to use savings from the AI crash to give employees an extra day off.
For workers, this meant that they could enjoy a three-day long week shift - but still get paid the same.
Some say that the idea fits well with the economic agenda of the party and puts the land in the hands of the workers.
A shift to a four-day work week is endorsed by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to benefit from the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times: "The political manifesto is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
This does not happen overnight, but a four-day work week is a desire that fits well into the work of the group to restore balance to the worker's budget, in addition to the group's overarching budgetary plan.
The Labour Party is not the first to endorse such a proposal, following the Green Party's attempt to reduce the working week to four days during its 2017 election campaign.
However, the doctrine is not fully accepted by the Labour Party at present.
A Labour Party spokesman said: "A four-day workweek is not party policy and is not considered by the party".
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour conference to air his views on a socialist collapse of the economy.
Ms McDonnell said he was determined to reclaim power from "dishonest governments and corporate corruption".
The Shadow Chancellor's plans also include that current water utility shareholders may not be able to get all of their shares back, as the Labour government is planning to make cuts to what it considers to be illegal.
He also outlined plans to put workers on company boards and create Inclusive Ownership Funds, to hand over 10 per cent of the share capital of private companies to employees, who stand to receive an annual profit share of up to £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy explain on "60 Minutes" that the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh may change their minds.
The FBI investigation into the alleged debts of Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final decision on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of whether a meeting of the Commonwealth Law Commission could influence Republican senators who are considering withdrawing their support.
In an interview airing Sunday, 60 Minutes reporter Scott Pelley asks Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could possibly find something that would change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South California colleague.
"I mean, of course", said Kennedy.
I said before the hearing, I said I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him, and after this, the accusation came out, and he said, 'Who did this to you?'
He was steadfast, firm, and unwavering.
Graham's vote, on the other hand, doesn't look likely to change.
"I'm sure about Brett Kavanaugh and that would require a powerful conviction", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know that Brett denied it", Graham added, "and he spat at Christine Blasey Ford".
And not everyone can agree with it.
It's been 36 years.
I don't see anything new that would change it.
What is Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to commemorate poverty?
On Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music festival featuring a stellar lineup of performers and an equally vibrant campaign to end global poverty.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people who will gather on the Great Lawn in Central Park, not only to experience performances by the likes of Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to shine a light on the event's real goal: ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an initiative of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you want to pay for a VIP ticket), people who attend concerts must complete a series of tasks or activities such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a call, or otherwise doing something meaningful to help shed light on the goal of ending poverty.
But how has Global Citizen fared 12 years after its case?
Is the idea of giving people a free sign a real force to persuade people to shout caution, or is it just a new case of so-called clickbait - that people feel they are making a real difference by signing a protest letter online, or sending out a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million actions from its supporters that have raised money for a variety of causes.
He says these actions have prompted world leaders to announce pledges and assurances worth more than $37 billion, which looks set to affect more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
As of 2018, the organization has reported 390 lifts and operations that have been diverted from its operations, with at least $10 billion already spent or collected.
The group estimates that the money has had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world.
Some of the most important findings include The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and promoters committed to helping children reach their full educational potential, pledging to donate $35 million to Rwanda to end the country's food crisis, after receiving more than 4,700 tweets from Global Citizens.
With the support of the UK government, donors, governments in other countries, and Global Citizens like you, we can make social injustice and malnutrition a footnote in history. " said The Power of Nutrition spokesperson Tracey Ullman to an audience at a concert in London in April 2018.
The organisation also said that after more than 5,000 applications were submitted, with the request to the UK to improve the quality of life for mothers and children, the government announced funding for a project, the Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with malnutrition.
In response to one of the OSS on their website who asked "How do you think we can end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen replied: "It will be a long and difficult journey - sometimes it will fail.
But, just like the civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B and Janelle Monae are among the names who will perform at this year's event in New York, with Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman in the roles of hosts.
U.S. likely to use navy as a deterrent to slow Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington can use its navy if necessary to prevent Russian forces from penetrating markets, including in the Middle East, US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke has revealed, quoted by the Washington Examiner.
Zinke argues that Russia's activities in Syria - especially where they are invited by the legitimate government - are a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is they want to sell energy, just like in Eastern Europe, the healthier part of Europe", he said, after all.
And, depending on the official, there are different ways to handle it.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to ensure that shipping lanes are open and, if necessary, prevent, to ensure that their power does not reach the shore", he said.
Zinke addressed the audience at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a national association that calls itself the "voice of energy consumers" in the United States.
He began comparing Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, and pointed out that they are largely the same.
"The economic potential of Iran and Russia is, to a large extent, only to have control and exchange of fuel", he said, while referring to Russia as a country that only does one thing and is economically dependent on fossil fuels.
These delays come as Trump's administration has been focused on increasing the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, rather than Russia, which is by far the cheapest option for European consumers.
Meanwhile, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump himself, have been trying to persuade Germany to pull out of the controversial Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which, according to Trump, made Berlin a "captive of Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly pointed out that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will double the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, is nothing but a financial project.
The Kremlin maintains that Washington's vehement opposition to the project is purely for financial reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said at a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US's attitude has given Germany a false impression, after it has otherwise waived its new obligations to the project.
Germany's top industrial organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of ST's energy policy, including the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", Dieter Kempf, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), said during a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren opts to run for president in 2020
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would consider running for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting in the state House in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren announced that she was considering running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and get a sense of the broken government and that means high-ranking women", she said, according to The Hill.
From November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren mentioned her opinion of Donald Trump, the president, in the House, saying that he ran the country on a very bad note.
"I'm very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet Friday, Warren wrote, "We need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A poll announced on Thursday showed a majority of Warren's voters believe she should not run in 2020.
Fifty-three percent of Massachusetts voters said the senator would not run, according to the Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Twenty-three percent supported the position.
The poll showed support was higher for a nomination of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent in favor of a nomination and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile, demoratic names mentioned in the 2020 nomination include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make a public announcement in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin performs PTSD by Track Palin at the Donald Trump conference
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after enlisting in the Army in September
He was arrested and charged with a burglary on Monday evening.
"What my son is going through, what he's going through after coming home, makes me understand other families who are experiencing the effects of PTSD, including how wounded some of our returning soldiers are", she told the audience at a Donald Trump conference in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Pauline mentioned his handwriting 'a problem that everyone sees, but no one does anything about it' and said about his son and other old soldiers, they come back a little different, they're soldiers, they come back and think about the respect that their fellow soldiers and sailors in the army and all the other soldiers gave to the country.
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman, and making a report of a home invasion, including possession of a weapon while intoxicated, according to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states and D.C. support the challenge of a new peacekeeping policy
Eight states and the District of Columbia are sponsoring a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that prohibits granting asylum to people fleeing gang violence or domestic violence.
Representatives of 18 states and territories filed a friend-of-the-court brief Friday in Washington in support of a petition for political asylum, NBC News reported.
The full name of the girlfriend in the Grace v. Sessions lawsuit filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Commonwealth policy has not been released.
She claimed that her partner and his violent sons, who were members of a gang, had raped her, but U.S. officials denied her plea for peace on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace cited El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which have a large number of asylum seekers in the United States, as countries that have a serious problem with cities and homelessness.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision by the U.S. Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed undocumented immigrants who fled their homes to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Governor Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "examines the growth of decades of state, commonwealth and international institutions".
Commonwealth law requires that all peace negotiations be judged on the sole facts and circumstances of the negotiation, and such a prohibition violates this principle, which was stated in the Friendly Agreement.
Businessmen further argued in the lawsuit that the policy of denying immigrants entry harms the U.S. economy, saying they are more likely to become investors and to lose the necessary jobs.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing house-to-house violence and gang violence in June.
"Peace is hard for those who flee their homelands as a result of persecution or fear because of migration, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group, or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy briefing.
Peace School was never meant to solve all the problems -- but all the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
The unlikely rescue attempt in Palu, now the death toll is doubled in an attempt to find a way out.
For those who survived, the situation became increasingly dire.
"It's very all-perfect", said 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, as she nursed her sickly son at a retreat in the deserted city of Palu.
The ambulance is bringing bodies every minute.
Pure water is itself pure.
The inhabitants of the island were forced to return to their desolate homes in an attempt to save any they could find among the drowned islets.
Hundreds were injured, and hospitals were overwhelmed by the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
Some of the wounded, including Dwi Harris, who suffered a fractured spine and a broken axle, were lying outside the military hospital in Palu, where patients were being treated outside due to continued aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he related the experience of the tremendous quake in the fifteenth-story guest room that he, his wife, and their daughter shared.
There was no time to save ourselves.
"I was crushed into what was left of the walls, I think", Harris told the Associated Press, adding that the family was in town for a camping trip.
I heard my wife screaming for help, but then I was sick.
I don't know what happened to her or my baby.
I hope they are safe.
US ambassador accuses China of "threatening" with "propaganda"
A week after a national Chinese newspaper published a four-page story in an American newspaper that criticized the U.S. trade relationship with China, the Chinese ambassador accused Beijing of using American media to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Tuesday cited the payroll of the Des Moines Register - the largest newspaper in the state of Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the US election is a sign, US officials told Reuters, of a new shift in Washington's campaign to try to put pressure on China.
Although it is common for foreign governments to make declarations in an attempt to stimulate trade, Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in a growing trade war that has increased tariffs on imports from both sides.
China's retaliatory tariffs in the early days of the trade war were used to target expatriates in states such as Iowa, which supports Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and US experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has taxed American workers, farmers and companies.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in the Des Moines Register on Sunday, "is increasing the risk of printing propaganda ads in our own free press".
"With the spread of its propaganda, China is abusing American values of culture, free speech and a free press by printing ads in the Des Moines Register", Branstad wrote.
"For comparison, in newspaper booths down the street here in Beijing, you can find limited, dismissive voices and no real thoughts about the uncomfortable opinions that people in China may have about China's difficult economic situation, because the Chinese Communist Party controls the media", he wrote.
He added that one of the most prominent newspapers in China had turned down the offer to publish his article, but he did not say which newspaper it was.
Republicans advance female voters ahead of midterm elections With Kavanugh defeated, Avara Greiner
While many high-profile Republicans are waiting to defend the Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh, amidst the sexual assault allegations, warns that they will experience a backlash, especially from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The outstanding concerns have been numerous, and most Republicans have already said they are in favor of a vote.
"These cases are irreversible", Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at the Maxwell School at Syracuse University, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubted the attempt by Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) to get an FBI investigation in the twelfth hour would be enough to sway voters.
"Women are not going to forget what happened yesterday - they are not going to forget it tomorrow, and they are not going to forget it in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, a high-level adviser and national spokeswoman for the advocacy group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C. newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters shouted "November is coming!" as they protested in the Senate Chamber, while Republicans, who have controlled the judiciary, chose to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination, despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, the former chief justice of the Michigan Supreme Court.
"Democratic intent and leadership will be very good", Stu Rothenberg, a renowned political commentator, told the news site.
People will say it's been a long time ago, and it's appropriate.
But it can be higher, especially among swingers, female voters in the outer boroughs and younger voters, 18 to 29 years old, who, although they don't like the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public statement, in which she spoke of her allegations of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts expected a setback to follow if Republicans continued the threat.
"This has become a hurricane for the Republican Party", former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said last week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh gets to be a judge, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've handled it", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, told the news conference.
However, Americans seem to be divided on who to believe, according to Frod and Kavanaugh's reports, with one narrow majority supporting the other.
A new poll by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents said they "somewhat or somewhat" trusted Ford's report, while 35 percent said they "somewhat or somewhat" trusted Kavanaugh,
As a poll showed, 38% thought Kavanaugh had lied in the report, while only 30% thought Ford had lied.
Following pressure from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating Ford's debts and at least one additional charge, Deborah Ramirez reported to The Guardian.
Ford testified under oath before a Senate trial panel last week that Kavanaugh, while intoxicated, had raped her when she was 17.
Ramirez claims that the appointment to the high court exposed her to her gender identity for a time while both were attending Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is starting a startup that plans to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech giant, Intrupt, is a tool based on Berners-Lee's open platform, Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and who has access to each piece of information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee suggested that the goal of Inrupt is "global peace".
"We have to do it now", he said of the work.
It is a historic moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal online profile or a POD.
It can include linking lists, to-do lists, calendars, music files, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like having Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all on your device at the same time.
The most important thing about the personal nature of the Internet is that it is entirely up to the user who can access the information.
The work refers to the personal image through data.
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's CEO, John Bruce, is that the company can provide tools, processes and management tools to help make Solid accessible to everyone.
The project is currently being assembled by Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired from IBM, a few contracted employees, a community of volunteer programmers, and a team of software engineers.
This week, developers around the world are starting to build their own customized apps using the powerful tool on Inrupt's website.
Berners-Lee said he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about whether they will come up with a complete revolution where all their business models will be wiped out after one day.
"Don't ask them for permission to leave".
In a Medium post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's goal is to provide commercial security and an ecosystem that helps protect the cleanliness and goodness of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, Berners-Lee revolutionized the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a leading voice in the fight for a more impartial Internet.
Even after Berners-Lee created Inrupt, he remains the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm very optimistic about the next era of the web", added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Priest who received the Victoria Cross in World War I, celebrated
The only priest in the English Church to win a Victoria Cross during World War I as a soldier, was knighted in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann, a priest, won the medal on 29 September 1918 in the battles of Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
But he was killed by a sniper four days later, unaware that he had won Britain's highest honour for bravery in war.
A memorial stone was unveiled by both his sons-in-law for a memorial in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
Another Abbass, Michael Vann, said that it was "imaginary" that the stone was discovered exactly 100 years after the Abbass's triumphal achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Vann led his division across the Canal de Saint-Quentin through thick fog as they were being pursued by cannon and machine gun fire.
Then he rushed to the line of the enemy and, with his superior courage, led the line of the enemy before he single-handedly opened fire on one of the guns and knocked down three of the other soldiers.
Lieutenant Oberst, Vann, was killed by a German sniper on 4 October 1918 - a good month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said the actions of the children were "a sign that I knew I could never live up to, but something that is humbling".
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, also placed a wreath at the ceremony, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt honoured to have a part in the tournament and added that the courage of a true hero is judged by the support that many people will give.
MMA fighters stayed up all night to see Bellator 206, and were given Peppa Pig instead.
Imagine you've waited all night to see a Bellator 206 with a steep climb and then you're denied access to the main track.
The San Jose record included 13 battle days, including six on the main card, and was broadcast live throughout the night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet each other, the British public were startled when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were surprised after waiting until dawn, especially until the battle.
One Twitter user described the switch to the children's show as "a bit of a paycheck".
"There were government agencies that thought the content of the show was not appropriate at 6am, so they had to switch to children's television", said Dave Schwartz, Bellator's director of marketing and communications, when asked about the content of the show.
The Greek Peppa, yes.
Bellator CEO Scott Coker said that they will work on their list to allow UK viewers to see into the future.
"I think if I think about the environment, we can figure it out", Coker said.
But it's 6 a.m. Sunday morning there and we can't solve it until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the weather changed, many messages were sent and they weren't all friendly.
We tried to spell it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't, it was a government problem.
I can promise that it won't happen next time.
We cut to five fights instead of six -- as we usually do -- and we tried to give the fighters too much and we just went too far.
It is an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt discriminated against because of his sexuality.
Olympic swimmer Tom Daley said he started to feel lighter than others because of his sexuality - but it inspired him to achieve a good result.
The 24-year-old said that he never realized until he started high school that the Apple is not like me.
On the first Desert Island Discs on Radio 4, with host Lauren Laverne, he said he was shedding light on gay rights to give others "the benefit of the doubt".
He also said that becoming a parent made him less focused on winning at the Olympics.
The regular host of the old show, Kirsty Young, has been on sick leave for a few months.
As an excerpt from Laverne's first episode, Daley said that he felt more like a hero than everyone else growing up because it was not socially acceptable to admire boys and girls.
He said, 'Today these emotions are to feel lighter and different, which gives me the drive and strength to succeed.'
He wanted to prove his innocence by saying, "I am not a virgin, " because everyone would know about his virginity.
A two-time Olympic bronze medalist, he has become a vocal advocate for LGBT rights and used his participation in the Commonwealth Games in Australia this year to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said that he spoke about it because he knew he was able to live independently without any consequences and wanted to make others feel guilty.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 - "made me very surprised".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than he is, last year, but he said the age difference had never been a problem.
"When you go through so much in your younger days" - he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone his age who had been through the same ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June of that year to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his views on marriage had changed completely.
"If you asked me last year, it was all about winning a gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are events that are bigger than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie.
The son shares the same name as his father, Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father did not want him to die, and one of the last things he asked about was if they had their access codes for London 2012 - because he wanted to be first.
I couldn't tell him that you don't have to stand in front of me, grandma.
"I took his hand and he expired, and it was not until he had really expired that I finally realized that he was not worthless", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won the bronze medal.
"I just knew that this was what I had dreamed of all my life - to dress in front of the home crowd for the Olympics, no feeling was better", he said.
It also inspired his first choice of song - Heather Small's Proud - which gave him a voice in the lead up to the Olympics and even gave him a gasp.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sundays at 11:15 BST.
Outside-of-the-box Mickelson on the bench in the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson set a record Sunday when he plays his match number 47 in the Ryder Cup, but he must get started so it won't be a technical milestone.
Mickelson, who is playing in the annual tournament for the 12th time overall, was benched by team captain Jim Furyk for the two-game series and played with four teams Saturday.
Instead of being the centerpiece, as he so often has been for the Confederate States of America, the winner had to divide his day into five days to be the egg and work up his game on the field in hopes of getting back in the game.
He has never been the one who is highly regarded, even when he was at his best, and the 48-year-old does not fit neatly into the Le Golf National stadium, where the long-haired section always punishes the punishing shots.
And if the field itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson will face British Open winner Francesco Molinari in his ninth match on Sunday, who, along with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood, has won all four of his matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind the 12th seed, get a good start, Mickelson's match could be crucial.
Furyk trusted her husband, not being able to say much else.
"He understood his role, which he had to play today, to the full, and he gave me a slap on the back, hugged me and said that he would be ready tomorrow", said Furyk.
He has a lot of confidence in himself.
He's in the Hall of Fame and he's done so much for this team before, and this week.
I didn't expect him to play two matches.
I think he's going to play more, but that's how we've decided to continue.
He just wants to be out there, just like everybody else.
Mickelson broke Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on a Sunday.
It could be the end of a Ryder Cup career that never matches his individual career.
Mickelson has won 18, lost 20 and drawn seven, but Furyk says his presence gives something special to the team.
"He is a cheerful, speedy, self-controlled, slow to anger, and a good companion".
I think even the younger actors had fun teasing him this week, which was fun to watch.
He brings with him much more than just spell
The European Commissioner, Thomas Bjorn, knows that great leaders can quickly disappear.
Thomas Bjorn, the European team captain, knows by experience that a big lead before the singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup can quickly become an unpleasant experience.
The Danish team had its baptism of fire in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a team led by Seve Ballesteros was five points ahead of the Americans, but managed to win by a narrow margin of 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You always remind yourself of the great leadership at Valderrama; we had a great leadership at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but just barely", said Bjorn, distraught after watching the 2018 team win 5-3 both Friday and yesterday, so they are now 10-6 ahead at Le Golf National.
So the story shows me and everyone on the horse's side that it's not over.
You have to go out with everyone tomorrow.
and from this comes every evil work.
This is not complete until the steps are completed on the plate.
We have a goal, and that is to try to win this race, and that is what we must stick to.
I've always said that I'm confident about the 12 players that are on our team, but we know what we're up against on the other side - the best players in the world.
Satisfied with the performance of his players on a round of golf, Bjorn added: "I don't think too far ahead in this.
Tomorrow will be a difficult day.
Tomorrow is the fruit of the individual that emerges and it's something else entirely.
Being out there with a partner is good when it's going well, but when you're out there alone, all your golf skills are tested.
These are the rules you must teach your players to understand, to get the best out of themselves tomorrow.
Now the son of perdition also goes his way, and shall receive the good of his own.
In contrast to Bjorn, the captain of the opposing team, Jim Furyk, will see his players as better individuals than those made by his teammates, except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who won three points out of a possible four.
Furyk himself has been on both sides of the great cow-turning on the last day, when he was part of a winning team at Brookline, before ending up as the loser when Europe won what is now known as the Miracle on the Medinah.
"I remember every damn word of it", he replied when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the 1999 team captain, had talked to his players before the final day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but we want to get a good start, just like we saw at Brookline and Medinah.
When it is going the only way, it puts a great deal of pressure on the horses in the middle of the race.
We've done our order and sent the four out the way we felt, you know, we're trying to create a little bit of a movement tomorrow.
Thomas is tasked with starting the fashion race and will face Rory McIlroy in the top-flight, while Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter are the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
I chose this team in this order because I think it's right all the way through", Bjorn said of his selection of individuals.
The new warship of Germany is delayed once again.
The latest frigate in the German Navy was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace aging Cold War-era warships, but will not be commissioned until next year due to a shortage of equipment and rising costs, local media reported.
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate, the flagship of the brand-new Baden-Wuerttemberg fleet of frigates, is now postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit newspaper, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was scheduled to enter service in 2014, but problems with the launch pad plagued the project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates, which the Navy purchased in 2007, replace the aging Bremen frigates.
Understood they will have a powerful cannon, a range of air and naval missiles, and techniques to become unstoppable, a now limited radar, interceptor and acoustic capabilities.
Other features are longer life span - it would be possible to take the newest frigates into service for up to two years away from home.
As a result, ongoing delays mean that the newest warships - said to be the last of German power abroad - are decommissioned once they are in service, Die Zeit points out.
The unlucky F125 came to the fore last year when the German Navy refused to commission it and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
It was the first time the Navy had sent a ship back to a port.
The reasons for the re-mission were unclear, but German media reported several significant errors and design flaws that rendered the battleship useless if deployed in combat.
The need for programs is particularly important, as the Baden-Wuerttemberg capabilities will be carried by a crew of about 120 sailors - only half the workforce on the older Bremen frigates.
In the meantime, it was discovered that the ship was much too heavy, which weighed down the sails and limited the navy's ability to make future landings.
The 7,000 tonne Rhine-Pfalz ship is probably twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in the Second World War.
In addition to the shortcomings in the design, the cost of the project - calculated training to manning - is also a problem.
It is said to have reached €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - out of an income of €2.2 billion.
The problems with the new frigates are particularly notable due to recent warnings of the decline of the German fleet.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's Defence Committee, admitted that the German Navy was in fact developing deployable ships.
The officer said that the problem has become worse over time because old ships are taken out of service but no one is able to come to the city for repairs.
He also complained that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg frigates were able to come up to the fleet.
The Nature Conservancy is investigating the secret life of bats
A recent study of a reindeer in the Scottish Highlands is about to reveal how the flying monkey uses wood for its hunt.
It is hoped that the results will be groundbreaking in the behaviour of special, flying mammals and help guide the conservation efforts in the future.
The study by scientists from the Scottish Wildlife Trust tracks common and soprano ground-dwelling flying insects, including a brown eagle and Daubenton flying insect at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders are placed at key locations around the property to track the activity of the bats throughout the year.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out portable screening with handheld wheelchairs.
Extensive sound analysis of all recordings will determine the frequency of the calls of the bats and what each species is doing.
A map and report is then made to create an accurate picture of all the landscapes and their behavior.
Rob Dwear, conservation consultant for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal which sites are most important to bats and how they are used by individual species.
This information helps determine the benefits of planting sites, including grasslands and how best to manage forest land for mosquitoes and other associated pests.
The population of the flying squirrel in Scotland and across the United Kingdom has declined significantly in the past century.
They are the threat of building and outgrowth, which affects sleep and loss of habitat.
Windmills and light can also be a problem, as can flying fowl and some chemical reactions from building materials, including attacks from cats.
Bats are not really blind.
But because of their nightly chase their ears are profitable for the eyes, when it cometh to be taken.
They use advanced feedback detection technologies to locate insects and spiders in their flight paths.
The NTS, which is responsible for the protection of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 significant gardens and 76,000 hectares of surrounding land, is taking flying mice into account.
There are ten specialists who regularly conduct inspections, maintain the resting position and occasionally rescue.
The Society has recently created the first and only free-ranging flying fox sanctuary in Scotland at Threave in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of the ten flying fox species in Scotland.
The group's leader, David Thompson, says the group is a model of the group.
"We have here a good field for the birds to eat in", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old timber and very good furniture.
But while much is unknown about the flying squirrel, the work being done here and elsewhere will help us better understand what it needs to thrive.
He stresses the importance of testing for flying insects before any maintenance is performed on buildings, as it is possible that an inadvertent destruction of a single resting place could kill up to 400 women and children, possibly taking away an entire, closed establishment.
Flies are venomous and it is not allowed to kill, injure or disturb them or destroy their nest.
Elisabeth Ferrell, a Scottish board member of the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
She said, 'We still have a lot to learn about our birds and many of our species, but we don't know how they are doing.
Ronaldo again exposes allegations of fraud, while prosecutors are preparing to sue the German weekly newspaper
Cristiano Ronaldo has described allegations against him of forced marriage as "false news", and says people "want to stifle themselves" by using my name.
His accusers are preparing to sue the German weekly Der Spiegel, which gave up the debts.
The Portugal and Juventus star is accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on the day of the wedding.
In a live Instagram post to his 142 million followers, just hours after the allegations were announced, Ronaldo, 33, said the allegations were "false".
No, no, no, no, no. I was just going to say,
What they said today, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said in the image.
They just want to use my name to motivate themselves.
It's common.
They'll be known by saying my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm a happy man and I'm good, he added with a smile.
Ronaldo's lawyers are seeking to sue Der Spiegel for the allegations, which they have called "an unlawful dissemination of malice in personal matters", according to Reuters.
Prosecutor Christian Schultz said the actor would seek restitution for "moral violations in a series of cases involving the crime, which is possibly one of the most serious violations of personal liberty in recent years".
The alleged incident reportedly took place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga reportedly returned to the player's room where he allegedly raped her, according to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went down on his knees after the incident and told her that he was 99 percent a good horse, but that one percent had betrayed him.
Rumors suggest that Ronaldo suspected the two of them of having a sexual relationship, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also says that she went to the police and photos were taken of her injuries at a hospital, but later came to an out-of-court settlement, as she felt guilty for the incident and was too embarrassed to be publicly humiliated.
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to make up for the loss, as she is still traumatized by the traumatic event.
Ronaldo was on a transfer to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the deal was supposed to have taken place, and this summer he moved to Italian giants Juve in a deal worth €100 million.
Brexit: Britain to face loss of oil markets
Britain would regret it forever if it lost its status as the world's leading fashion designer after Brexit, Trade Minister Greg Clark has said.
He added that it was "obvious" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at their Burnaston plant near Derby.
"We need to have an agreement", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese automaker said the impact of delays to the deadline in the event of a no-deal Brexit could be costly.
The Burnaston plant - which produces Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the European Union.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, production at our factory will stop", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's manager in Burnaston.
Other British carmakers have expressed concern about leaving the EU without an agreement on how their business will be run, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The biggest concern is what carmakers say are supply chain problems in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's fleet is built on a state-of-the-art basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from dealerships in both the UK and EU for ordered cars.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be unrest at the border, which the insider says could lead to delays and lack of supplies.
It would have been impossible for Toyota to have more than one day's supply of the Derbyshire plant, the company said, and therefore halted production.
Mrs Clark said Chequers' plan for Theresa May's future relationship with the EU is "simply set to avoid the possibility of a Brexit".
"We have to get a deal, we want to get the best deal that allows, as I say, not just to enjoy the result now, but to take the opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The challenge, not just from Toyota, but from other manufacturers, is that we must be able to continue what has been a very successful supply chain.
Toyota could not say how long the production would be stopped, but with the future in mind, he warned that the cost would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and therefore cost a lot.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is president of the Unite union there, said his members are constantly worried. From my experience, I know that if these big shocks happen, they will never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have put forward an urgent and ambitious plan for our future relationship with the EU.
Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed, but White House officials have called it off
Much is at stake in Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Secretary of State Rod Rosenstein, which could be delayed another week as the battle over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian interference in the election, and links between Trump associates and Russia over the president's possible obstruction of justice.
Whether Trump will run the state's attorney's office and thereby jeopardize Mueller's immunity has been debated in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had allegedly used surveillance equipment to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of impeaching the president under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied this.
But the following Monday he went to the White House, despite the news that he was going to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for the wedding day.
Trump said he "wouldn't want to" prosecute Rosenstein, but the hearing was postponed due to a conflict with the Senate trial in which Kavanaugh and one of the women who have accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed a Senate vote further.
Trump's running mate, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
When she was asked about the Rosary, she said: "One day is not set yet, it may be this week, but I count a week's agony, because of all that happens in the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'm happy to run the media.
Some reporters questioned the popularity of the event: Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders replied that the opposition at the news conference was not because of opposition to news people on television who were performing, but she said: "I'm not opposed to them actually performing".
She then predicted that interaction between Trump and the media would increase.
"The president is doing more S&S than any other president before him", she said, without providing any evidence. "We have been looking at the numbers".
The media will still be there, Sanders said, but if they have the opportunity to ask the president questions directly, it's often better than talking to me.
We try to do it a lot, and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks and it's going to come in the form of a press conference where you can talk to the President of the United States of America.
Trump regularly addresses questions as he leaves the White House or is part of open hearings or press conferences with visiting officials.
Having time alone is selfish.
In New York this week, the president may have shown why, when he appeared to be untamed and unprepared in front of a packed press conference.
Health minister writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland after Brexit scare
The Health Secretary has written to EU staff working in the NHS in Scotland to express the country's gratitude and hope that they will remain after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter with less than six months to go before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish Government has already promised to cover the cost of settled status applications by EU citizens working for the public sector.
In her letter, Ms Freeman wrote: "For some time, negotiations between the UK and the EU on withdrawal have been ongoing, with hopes for decisions in the autumn.
But the UK government has also taken a series of steps to prepare for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know it's a very difficult time for you.
That is why I want to return my respect for the achievements of every worker regardless of nationality.
Partners throughout the EU, and more, bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of healthcare organisations, and are of value to patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is without doubt your home and we want you to stay here.
Christion Abercrombie is in need of a hip replacement surgery
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christion Abercbrombie has undergone hip surgery after sustaining a head injury in Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores, coached by Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told the media that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He went out on the side and just collapsed", Reed said.
Doctors and nurses gave Abercrombie oxygen on the side before lifting him onto a gurney and taking him out for further examination.
A Tennessee State employee told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was being treated at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there are still reports of damage and Tennessee State is trying to determine when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie, a second-year redshirt, is playing his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles on Saturday before being forced to retire, bringing his total to 18 this season.
Foreign buyers are charged higher stamp duty when buying a property in the UK
Foreign buyers will be charged higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK, and the proceeds will be used to help the homeless under the new dry scheme
The change will neutralize Corbyn's ability to attract young voters
The increase in stamp duty will be charged to those who do not pay tax in the UK
The Treasury expects it will raise up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers are expected to face higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK, with the proceeds going to help the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move is seen as an attempt to neutralise Jeremy Corbyn's success in attracting young voters with promises of more generous housing options and high wages.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on individuals and businesses that do not pay UK tax, and the revenue will boost the government's efforts to combat noise pollution.
The flat rate - which is in addition to the current stamp duty, including the interest that came in two years ago on house numbers two and buy-for-lease - can be as much as three percent.
The Treasury expects the change to bring in up to £120 million a year.
It is estimated that 13 percent of new housing in London is bought by non-British residents, which causes prices to rise and makes it worse for first-time buyers to get a foot in the door.
Many bustling areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become ghost towns, as so many foreign buyers spend their time in the countryside.
The new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson called for a reduction in stamp duty to help young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction companies of keeping the price of land high by buying land without using it, and urged Mrs May to get rid of quotas on luxury properties to understand the housing crisis in Britain.
Mr Corbyn has announced a series of proposed housing reforms, including a rent review and an end to evictions without cause.
He also wants to give municipalities more power to build new homes.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my premiership to the realisation of the British dream - that life would be better for every generation.
And that means getting a sign on the broken home market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
However, it may not be that it is so easy for non-UK resident individuals, including foreign companies, to buy houses like the British citizens.
For too many people, the dream of owning a home has been shattered, and the destruction of a sleeping car has become all too real.
Jack Ross: My highest rating is to coach Scotland
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his biggest ambition is to coach Scotland one day.
The 42-year-old takes on the challenge of rebuilding the Northern Ireland side, who are currently third in League One, three points behind the ODAS.
He moved to Stadium of Light in the summer after leading St Mirren back to the Scottish Premiership last season.
I wanted to represent my country as a Spanish player.
I got a B match and that was it", Ross told BBC Radio Sportsound.
But growing up, I often looked back to Scotland, to Hampden with my dad, and it just kind of took me back to my uncle's side.
Of course, the pleasure comes only if I can get a good result in directing one part.
Ross's Sunderland team included the now-defunct Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic manager said he felt no fear of following such names in such a big club, and has previously denied having any contact with Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
My success at the moment will be measured by whether I get this club back in the Premier League?
The structure and circumstances of the club make it undoubtedly a Premier League club, he said.
I do not consider it a gift to come to you, but I would be most pleased if you would send me to you.
Ross has only been head coach for three years after spending a season as assistant coach at Dumbarton and part of the Hearts team for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa to regain promotion to the third division, and helped St Mirren to fight for relegation to become champions the following season.
And Ross says he feels more suited than he ever did in his career as a player at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
It was a real crossroads, he remembered, when he took the lead in the Alloa.
I didn't really think that running was the right thing for me, not more than playing.
I ran a good race, because I finished well, I made a living from it and had some great wins.
But it can be hard to play.
You have to go through a lot week after week.
I'm still going through it, if you think about the strength and the pressure of the work, but the direction just feels right.
I've always wanted to be a coach, and now I am, and I feel like that's the best thing I've been in my adult life.

This summer's heat wave has boosted the income of struggling pubs in the UK, but put even more pressure on restaurants
Restaurants and bar associations saw a 2.7 percent increase in July - but revenue in restaurants fell by 4.8 percent, according to the report.
Peter Martin, from business consultancy CGA, who calculated the figures, said: "Continuing sunshine and England's longer-than-expected participation in the World Cup meant that July followed the same pattern as June, when revenue from hotels rose by 2.8 per cent, but that restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent drop in restaurant sales in June was only exacerbated in July.
Taverns and bars, which mostly sold liquor, provided the best, and by comparison their profits were greater than the losses of the restaurants.
The inn, which mostly sold food, also lived in the sun, though not as luxuriously as the inn's owners.
It seems like people just wanted to go out for a drink.
In addition to restaurants and bars, sales of beverages rose 6.6 percent that month, and food dropped three percent.
Paul Newman, from leisure and hospitality industry, RSM, said: "These results continue the trend we have seen since last April.
Weather and the impact of large social and sporting events are the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the overseas market.
It is no surprise that restaurant chains continue to struggle, although a 4.8 percent drop in sales year after year will be a very painful addition to the ongoing cost crunch.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for the food stores and the weather will show if the mild heat that has been in August will provide the needed breathing space.
The overall growth in sales of hotels and restaurants, including new ones, was 2.7 percent in July, marking the ninetieth consecutive year of new brands.
The Coffer Peach Tracker, which tracks sales in the UK's pubs, bars and restaurants industry, collects and analyses data on sales from 47 partner organisations, with a combined turnover of £9 billion, and is the industry's single point of reference.
One in five children have secret social media accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they reveal to their parents and teachers, revealing questionnaires
A survey of 20,000 high school students
Recently, there has been a growing concern about the sexual content being leaked.
Twenty percent of the students said they have a head-dress booklet that they show to their parents.
One in five children -- some as young as 11 -- set up social media accounts for adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students reveals a huge increase in Instagram users - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
Recently, fears have been raised that sexual content is being leaked.
Twenty percent of students said they use a smart phone to show their parents when they have private conversations.
A mother who came across the mysterious website of the 13-year-old girl found a toothbrush that begged others to take her toothbrush.
The study, by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, found that 40 percent of children aged 11 to 18 have two computers, with half of them admitting to having private computers.
HMC director Mike Buchanan said: "It is disturbing that so many teens are tempted to create online rooms where parents and teachers cannot find them".
Eilidh Doyle is a member of the Scottish Athletics committee.
Eilidh Doyle is elected to the board of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual meeting of the board.
Doyle is the most decorated Scot in the sport of freestyle and chairman Ian Beattie described the move as a great opportunity for those running the sport to utilise her extensive experience at international level over the past decade.
"Eilidh is highly regarded in the Scottish, British and international sports community and we are sure that sports in Scotland will benefit greatly from her inclusion in the committee", Beattie said.
Doyle said: I am excited to act as a voice for athletes, and I hope I can really contribute and help the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200m and 400m at the 1996 Atlanta Games, as well as four Olympic gold medals, and who is now a permanent pundit for the BBC, is no longer able to walk after suffering a stroke.
He tweeted: "One month ago today, I had a brain hemorrhage.
I could not walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or how well I would do.
I have been beaten, but I have recovered, I have learned to walk, today I do the spinning exercises.
Thank you for the encouraging advice!
Breast pumps are a way of matching moms to cows and opinions vary on the internet
A breast-pumped fortress has sparked controversy online with a post comparing breastfeeding mothers with cows being milked.
As a pre-launch sign of what has been called "the world's first noiseless breast pump that's good to be in", the consumer technology company Elvie released a special image, reminiscent of a video clip, to showcase the freedom that the new pump offers to mothers who are giving.
Four real mothers dancing in a bar with a cow to a song, one now having the words: 'Yes, I milk myself, but you see no tail' and 'If you don't know this, it's not a dough, it's my beets.'
The result is: 'Pump it out, pump it out, I give this pink baby, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my lady.'
But the announcement, posted on the company's Facebook page, has sparked a crackdown on the internet.
With over 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the film has received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom say it does little to uplift the dairy industry.
It is a bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
As we must get up and go on the road to produce milk, except that their babies are taken away from the days after birth.
Elvie's breast pump fits snugly into a chest tube holder (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented: "Absolutely appalling for both mother and child.
But why not use them to light up a breast pump for a mother who has stopped bearing children?
Another added: "He is a good-natured lecher".
Some called it the Lamentation, and a woman confessed that she thought the song was obscene.
I think this is a very good idea.
I would have had one if I still gave breast.
The pump made me feel like a real bitch.
The description is a little strange, but I took it for what it was.
This is a very good product, "one wrote.
Another comment: This is a short description for mothers-to-be who pump (often for work or on errands) and feed themselves like cows.
This is not a lightning flash to praise or judge the milk-based product.
Finally, in the film, the group of women reveal that they have danced with the still-life pumps inserted into the nipples.
The reason behind the claim is based on the perception that many women who breastfeed claim to feel like cows.
The Elvie Pump, on the other hand, is purely rigid, has no conduit or pipe, and fits quietly into a breast holder, giving women the freedom to move about, hold their babies and even go outside while pumping.
Ana Balarin, part owner and creative director of Mother noted: Elvie Pumpan is a breakthrough product that has been born to an unprecedented and challenging start.
By making a comparison between pregnant women and mothers, we wanted to put the breast pump and all its challenges in the spotlight, while presenting it in a fun way that women can relate to, and show the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump offers.
This is not the first time Elvie the pump has been on the front page.

Hundred-year flood of steady flow to a Texas border
The number of detained refugee children has increased, although the monthly number of crossings is relatively stable, partly because of the harsh rhetoric and policies implemented by the Trump administration that have made it harder to get child sponsors.
Historically, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and have risked their own chances of remaining in the country by coming forward and accepting a child.
The pressure increased in June, when Commonwealth authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their household would have to submit fingerprints, and that the information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albence, an official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified before Congress that the agency had handled countless people who sought to sponsor unmarried pregnancies.
The agency later claimed that 70 percent of those arrested had no criminal record.
Nearly 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or members of a sponsor's household are in the country illegally and a large proportion of them are punishable foreigners.
So we continue to pursue these individuals", Mr. Albence said.
In an effort to take care of the children more quickly, officials have introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear in court within a month of being detained, rather than the previous 60 days, according to school officials.
Many will attend a phone call, rather than meeting in person, to defend their right to legal status before an immigration judge.
Those who are not considered fit to help will soon be sent out of the country.
The longer children remain in custody, the more likely they are to become frightened or anxious, which can lead to violent escapes or attempted escapes, such as the work on the shelters and the report of escaping from the system in the last few months.
Experts say that the fear of these events has increased in a large area such as Tornillo, where signs that a child is struggling are more likely to be circled because of the noise.
They added that moving children to tent cities without enough time to emotionally prepare them, or allow them to say goodbye to friends, can exacerbate the emotional pain many already struggle with.
Syria calls for the immediate withdrawal of American, French and Turkish forces.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem, speaking at the UN General Assembly, also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even as the country's civil war enters its eighth year.
Moualem, who also serves as deputy prime minister, said that foreign troops were on Syrian soil illegally on the pretext that they were fighting against the occupation and that they were being treated badly.
"They must leave this country at once and not make any disturbance", he ordered.
Moualem insisted that the war against terrorism is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed since 2011 and millions have been displaced.
He said that Damascus would continue to fight this holy battle until the whole of Syria was cleansed of both rebel groups and any unlawful foreign entity.
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem said that the conditions were good enough for them to return, and he blamed some Western countries for spreading unjustified fears that affect refugees to stay away.
"We have called on the international community and aid agencies to facilitate these returns", he said.
They make issues that should be just human problems political.
The US and EU have warned that there will be no reconstruction aid for Syria until a political agreement is reached between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
Diplomats in the UN say a new agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a zone in the last major rebel stronghold in Idlib has created an opportunity to move forward with political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a Russian-backed Syrian military offensive on the country of three million people.
Moualem, however, noted that the deal had "significant ramifications" and expressed hope that military action would target jihadists and fighters from the Nusra Front, which has been linked to Al-Qaeda, and that it would be "destroyed".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meetings of a new committee composed of government and opposition members to devise a post-coup plan for Syria and prepare for elections.
Moualem set conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the committee, saying that the group's work should be limited to "assessing the points of the current system", and warned of upheavals.
Why Trump Will Win Another Term
By the logic of the election, Mr Trump would win re-election in 2020, barring what many liberals are hoping is a possible impeachment and premature end to his presidency.
Because, without a doubt, the most exciting ending of a presidency ever.
There are no signs of economic recovery.
Since 2014, prime-time viewership has more than doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and nearly tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News averaged 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and "The Rachel Maddow Show" on MSNBC topped the list with as many as 3.5 million viewers on prime time.
"This is a fire that people are driven to because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer, the host of ABC's drama "Designated Survivor", which is about a secretary of state who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedy head and author of "Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys' Club", has a different theory.
She recalls a ride with a horse-drawn cart in Boston before the 2016 election.
The conductor told her that he would choose Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked.
And he said, Because he will make me well. And the woman said, Draw me.
There is a maintenance value in the rust league.
Indeed, unlike anything on television, the Washington process may determine the future of Roe v. Wade, the reunification of displaced families, and the health of the global community.
Sloth is the shame of the foolish, and the eyes of the deceitful are powerful.
And in short, you're more than an informed citizen, when you find yourself watching at six o'clock a panel of experts discussing Bob Woodward's use of "deep background" sources for his book, "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket (a garment full of courage, The Washington Post said) and hints at Stormy Daniels' inaccurate descriptions of, uh, Mr. Trump's estate.
I, if nothing else, go to see Super Mario, which I plagued.
"Part of what he does that reminds me of reality TV is that he gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, the president of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", about changing actors and daily challenges of the storyline (choosing to fight the N.F.L., to praise Kim Jong-un).
You can't run a mile, you'll be back.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was sunny and 80 degrees outside his apartment on the north shore of Kauai, but he was indoors watching MSNBC while taping CNN.
He couldn't look away, not when Brett Kavanaugh was about to face the judiciary in the Senate and the future of the Supreme Court hanging in the balance.
I remember when we were doing all the harsh, harsh sentences back in the day, and people said, 'This is the beginning to the end of Western culture,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a kind of folly, but it turned out that they were right.

Money from the East into the midterm elections
Not surprisingly, the 17th Judicial District of Pennsylvania sees a stream of money as a reorganization of a congressional district resulted in two officials competing for the same seat.
In this newly revised Pittsburgh mayoral race, Democratic Representative Conor Lamb is running - winning his seat in a different instance in a special election last spring.
Lamb is running against another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old 12th District in Pennsylvania, which is being overshadowed by the new 17th District.
The maps were redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old maps were inconsistent with the government and favored Republicans.
The race for the new 17th Congress has started a financial battle between the giants of the big party, the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRCC).
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after winning a landslide victory in a special election in March for the 18th Pennsylvania legislature, which was highly anticipated.
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the case by 20 points.
Political analysts expect Democrats to have the difference.
US to withdraw from El Salvador over funding to China
Government officials were wary that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, with little resistance from Washington.
Mrs. Trump had a successful meeting with the President of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in July of 2017 and was staying at a guest house in Panama before the owners sold her leadership of the Trump Organization.
Foreign policy officials decided to recall U.S. leaders in diplomatic circles from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama because of "their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", Heather Nauert, the council's spokeswoman, said in a statement earlier this month.
However, the sanctions were only applied to El Salvador, which reportedly received $140 million in U.S. aid in 2017, including for drug control, education and financial assistance.
The sanctions, which include cuts in financial aid and restrictions on immigration, would have been harmful to the Central American country's high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings continued, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level meeting on security and economic progress to replace a similar meeting last year that was meant to be a step forward in the effort to prevent migrant workers from going to the United States.
But in mid-September, officials at the highest levels of the administration made clear that they wanted the conference to continue and immediately ended sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference, which is now scheduled to take place in mid-October, as a sign of the importance the administration places on the conference, diplomats said.
The three American envoys returned quietly to El Salvador, Panama, and the Dominican Republic without any new, harsh orders or punishments from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr. Bolton refused to acknowledge details of the meeting of the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal matters anonymously.
Their statements were confirmed by an unnamed foreign analyst close to the investigation.
Read the story
The next thing that should not be missed is the statement by Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice, where there is now very significant evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller is reportedly turning his investigation to whether Mr. Trump's campaign had anything to do with Russia's attack on our elections.
If Congress were to change hands, Mr. Trump would have to answer to the Cabinet, just as he is preparing to return to the electorate, and possibly a jury of his peers.
There's a lot more to come, and my point is not to rush the inevitable fall of Mr. Trump - much less his counterpart in Europe.
Decisions will be taken by everyone on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the duration of the war.
In 1938, German military officers were prepared to launch a coup against Hitler if only the West had stood up and supported the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed and did not take advantage of the opportunity to escape the years of bloodshed that followed.
The story is set in such a corner, and the people's impunity is accelerating or delayed.
Americans are facing many of these turning points now.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump is driving home the representative of the Attorney General, Rod Rosenstein, the man who has been the center of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a state of confusion ever since this newspaper reported that he had secretly considered running for president last year and had speculated about whether he was unfit for the office.
Mr. Rosenstein says that the story in The Times is unreasonable.
How do we respond if the newly opened F.B.I. investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or ready - or if he is sued to the Supreme Court, despite the allegations of sexual harassment and dishonest testimony?
And after all, are we going to the midterm elections to vote for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, the winter of the people will be long.
But from what I learned in Prague, I don't expect us to be left behind.
My mother was a Czechoslovakian Jew, and she was sent to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied my convalescent home.
She survived, emigrated to America and, 60 years later, she sent me to tend the Sabbath light on a horse-drawn table that had a swastika.
If this is my inheritance, then how can I not be confident about our future?

Graham Dorrans of Rangers lighting shots before Rapid Vienna's game
Rangers take on Rapid Vienna tomorrow knowing that a win over the Eastern League champions, after a successful draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, puts them in a good position to advance from Group B in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first start of the season until the 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he expects Rangers to use the result as a springboard to something bigger.
"It was a good step for us because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
So we got underway in faith and sailed as planned.
We might have gotten to the end, but overall, a draw would have been a fairer outcome.
They were better in the first half and we went to the second half and were the better team.
Now the wedding day is another big, European night.
We can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult race because they got a good finish in their last race, but with the fans in the back, I am confident we can run and get a good finish.
It was definitely a tough year last year, with all the things that happened with my injuries, and the changes in the company, but now it's a positive environment here.
It is good to be afflicted, and the poor hath a delight in the outward [good]; and it is good for the upright to be trained.
We run the race with confidence, we endure the race, we take the win.
Women lose sleep over fear of retaliation
Although participants in a competition were aware of what kind of smoke they wanted, few spoke to their families about it.
About half of the Nationwide survey said they talked to their caregivers about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
People want someone in the family to take care of them, but they don't take the initiative to have the conversation, said Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
This is how it should start.
Inform your wife and children: You cannot prepare your family to care for you unless you make your wishes known in a timely manner.
With your advisor and your family, you can discuss where and how you want to smoke, as those choices can be particularly important to the cost.
Get your financial advisor over: Your advisor can also help you find a way to pay the bills.
Your financial options for long-term care may include a standard long-term care insurance policy, a blended life insurance policy with repayment value to help pay these expenses, or cover with your own money - if you have it.
Put away your false papers: Avoid a fake fight.
Get a health plan in place so you can appoint someone you trust to manage your care and ensure that staff follow your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also the power of a lawyer to your financial affairs.
You would choose someone you trust to take care of your financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid if you are unable to do so.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your elderly parent is in a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Have you finished answering questions about medicine and obesity?
Instead, write it down in a purposeful manner so that you are ready.
'It's not just about the drugs, but who are the doctors?' asked Mary.
What is the difference between the two kinds of healing?
Who takes care of the dog?
Have the plan complete.
Man shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man, shot several times with an air rifle, walked home from the city.
The victim, in his forties, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the neck, abdomen and hand.
Police described the shooting, which occurred at around 02:30 BST as an "accidental event".
The victim did not see his assailant.
The victims are not life-threatening and the police have called witnesses.
Earthquakes and floods in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in a massive earthquake and flooding that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, officials said, with the death toll expected to rise.
With poor communications, rescue workers have received no information from the Donggala government, an area northwest of Palu, which is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were displaced by the disaster.
Here are some important facts about Palu and Donggala on the island of Sulawest:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located on a narrow peninsula on the west coast of the island of Sulawesi. Its population in 2017 was 379,800.
The city celebrated its 40th anniversary on the day of the earthquake and flood.
Donggala is a headland that stretches over more than 300 km (180 mi) of coastline in an outlying area of the island of Sulawesi.
The municipality, which is officially a unitary authority, had a population of 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main industries of the economy of the Central South West province, especially in the Donggala coastal area.
Nikkulnám is also important in the regional area, but it is mostly concentrated in Morowali, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have often experienced severe flooding in the last 100 years, according to Indonesia's Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of houses in Donggala.
A tsunami also struck the West Coast in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic belt and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
Here are some of the biggest earthquakes and floods in recent times:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh, North Sumatra, on 26 December resulted in a tsunami that devastated 14 countries and killed more than 226,000 people on the shores of the Indian Ocean, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes struck the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Several hundred died on Nias Island, just off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: An earthquake measuring 6.8 on the Richter scale struck southern Java, Indonesia's most populous island, causing a tsunami that struck the southern coast, killing nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 quake struck near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra province.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 earthquake struck one of the Mentawai Islands, off Sumatra, and resulted in a devastating 10 metre flood, which destroyed countless villages and killed some 300 people.
2016: A major earthquake shook Pidie Jaya province in Aceh, causing devastation and terror, and reminded people of the devastation of the 2004 deadly earthquake and tsunami.
No one appears to have been evacuated from the area, but more than 100 people died from collapsed buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes hit the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left tens of thousands of people stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son handed over to the House of Representatives
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of racketeering.
29-year-old Palin of Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, according to a report by the Alaska State Troopers on Saturday.
According to the police report, a female acquaintance tried to call the police and report the crime, but he took her phone away.
Palin is being held at the Mat-Su detention centre and his unsecured detention is insured at $500, KTUU reported.
He was on trial on the Sabbath, pretending to be a Jew, but when he was asked to give an offering, he denounced the matter.
Palin faces three class A misdemeanors, which means he faces up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Paul.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police and reported the assault.
The case is currently in the Alaska Veterans' Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with house-breaking, interfering with a report of a domestic violence incident, and possession of a concealed weapon during the incident.
His landlady testified that he hit her in the face.
Sarah Palin was found by a group of veterans in 2016 after she strongly linked her son's behavior to PTSD, which had come from his service in Iraq.
Hundreds of people killed by earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed after an earthquake hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake erupted into a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communication systems are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck near the Indonesian capital of Jakarta.
Films are circulating on social media showing the fate of the coup.
Several hundred people had gathered for a festival on the beach in the town of Palu when the floodwaters burst onto land.
Community activists want the same death sentence for the man who is under attack in New York City.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in a New York City bombing that killed eight people -- a crime that has not been punished in the state since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented car from Home Depot to attack a candy bar on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, where he attacked people for walking and candy on his way in October.
To justify a capital punishment, prosecutors must prove that Saipov intentionally killed eight victims and intentionally inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the death penalty affidavit filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these charges could result in a death sentence according to the statute.
A week after the attack, an investigation commission charged Saipov with 22 counts, including eight counts of manslaughter by gross negligence, which are commonly used by Commonwealth prosecutors in organized crime cases, as well as one count of assault and destruction by a firearm.
"The whole thing was a very clever plan and strategy", said the prosecutors, "and the way in which Saipov was acting was vicious, merciless and destructive".
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused loss, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", according to a report in the newspaper.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the Southern District of New York last had a death penalty case.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a Commonwealth court in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a couple who were executed after being convicted of conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War two years earlier.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, reported no injuries in the days and months after the attack, according to court records.
He told detectives that he felt entitled to what he had done, police said.
Saipov told authorities he committed the attack after watching ISIS videos on his phone, according to the prosecutor.
He also asked to fly the ISIS flag in the hospital's room, police said.
He pleads not guilty to the 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's designated defense attorneys, said they are "obviously disappointed" by the decision.
"We believe the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept the threat of life in prison without the possibility of parole will weaken the case for all", Patton said.
Saipov's lawyer had already asked prosecutors not to pursue a death sentence.
UK Conservative member says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "help the people of the state" during a protest at the Tory conference today.
The former leader of UKIP said politicians should "feel the pressure" from Eurosceptics - after a member of Theresa May's cabinet suggested he should be at the forefront of negotiations with the EU.
Conservative MP Peter Bone told the Birmingham debate that the UK would not have joined if Mr Farage had been Brexit minister.
But the challenge Mrs May faces in unifying the two is being taken up by conservatives who want to stay, who were at another Brexit protest in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to keep her Chequers plan on track, amid opposition from Brexiteers, those who want to remain, including the EU.
Conservatives insist she is trying to reach an agreement with Brussels despite opposition - forcing Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her package and the chaos.
Mr Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "blind out Chequers".
He suggested that Mr. Farage should become a bodyguard and be given the responsibility of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he had not been of the same persuasion, " Pilate replied", we would not be here today.
The MP for Wellingborough added: "I am in favour of Brexit, but we must get rid of the Chequers".
Of his opposition to the EU, he said: "We did not fight in world wars to maintain the status quo.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Ms Bone pointed out the concern that public opinion had changed since the 2016 referendum: "The idea that the British people have changed their mind and want to remain is completely unfounded".
Tory Brexiter Andre Jenkyns was also at the rally and told the media: I just say: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not well liked by the masses, the opposition does not vote for it, it is not well liked in our party and among our constituents who actually walk the streets and get us power.
Do that request and let the Chequers go and start listening.
In a direct order to Mrs. May she added: 'Governors keep their promises when they keep their word.'
Mr Farage said on the programme that politicians must feel the heat if they are in the process of rigging the 2016 referendum.
"This is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political party", he said.
They're trying to screw up Brexit and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let you get away with it.
In a message to the eager crowd, he said: "I want you to get the political parties who are not far from betraying Brexit to turn the heat down.
We're getting the people of this country, who gave us a victory in Brexit, to help us, and we're not going to stop until we are an independent, self-governing, self-governing United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, those who wanted to stay marched through Birmingham before meeting for two hours in the city centre.
A bit of a volunteer effort with Tories Against Brexit marks the group's turn this weekend.
Labour's Lord Adonis, however, had already scolded the Conservatives for their security concerns that had arisen when the conference began.
"These are people who tell us that they understand the KT systems and all the problems of Canada and so on, that there are problems with the border, with free trade without a black in Ireland", he added.
It is completely dead.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit, he said.
Warren will consider running for president.
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will consider running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed his future at the Massachusetts State House on Saturday.
Warren, who often appears to be President Donald Trump's running mate, is running for re-election in November against Republican incumbent Geoff Diehl, who was Trump's campaign co-chair in Massachusetts in 2016.
She has been the focus of speculation as to whether she will run against Trump in 2020.
The late-night rally Saturday in Holyoke was her 36th meeting with voters at the White House since Trump took office.
One contestant asked if she wanted to stand up.
Warren responded that it was time for women to go to Washington and understand the broken government and that includes high-ranking women.
The action proceeded with the firing of Sims from LSU.
Police in Baton Rouge, La., announced Saturday that a suspect was arrested in the shooting of LSU cornerback Wayde Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson, 20, at a news conference at 11 a.m.
They had sent out a video of the shooting on Friday to help identify each man on the set.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed near the campus of Southern University early Friday.
"Wayde Sims was shot in the head and died as a result", police spokesman Murphy J. Paul said Wednesday, according to 247sports.
Wayde came up to help his friend and was shot by Simpson.
Simpson was interviewed and admitted to being at the scene, armed, and also admitted that he had stabbed Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested in connection with the incident and remanded into the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims was a 6-foot-6 student at the next-to-last-grade level who grew up in Baton Rouge and played 32 games, including 10 starts, last season and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Lewis Hamilton closes in on world record after team bid to give him victory over Sebastian Vettel
It became clear when Valtteri Bottas drove past Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team would have a big part in the race.
From the lead, Bottan got off to a good start and challenged Hamilton, who tried to defend his position in the first two laps and allowed Vettel to run on his teammate.
Vettel took the first emergency stop and let Hamilton steer into the race towards the end of the chain, something that should have been decisive.
Mercedes stopped on the next lap and came out behind Vettel again, but Hamilton came out ahead after a few crashes, which ended with the Ferrari driver having to keep his tripod open inside after a double move to defend on the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh after the first round on his 21st birthday.
He then led for much of the race and the wheels held firm, when he overtook Kimi Raikkonen with a quick finish in fourth place.
He went on the grid on lap 44, but was unable to increase his lap in the final eight laps, and Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a bad day, because Valtteri did everything very well last week and was a real gentleman and promised me ahead.
The team has worked incredibly hard to get number one and number two", said Hamilton.
The Famous Body Snatch
President Donald Trump on Saturday angered Senator Dianne Feinstein with her concern over the leak of a letter from Christine Blasey Ford, who accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
In his speech to a West Virginia court, he did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead noted that the proceedings in the Senate proved that people were dirty and unclean and immoral.
'The only thing that can happen and the only thing that will happen in the last days in the Senate is, when you see the anger, you'll see people who are evil, vicious, filthy and unfaithful,' he said.
When you look at the expenses and the games and they say, 'Oh, it wasn't me.'
It wasn't me.
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, were you the one who did the lacquer?
Remember her response... were you the one who painted the - ah, oh what?
Oh, no. I was just...
It wasn't me who did the dish.
Okay, wait a second.
We locked... No, we didn't lock, he put it back and he was chasing the senator.
Feinstein received the letter, which described Ford's allegations against Kavanaugh, in late July and it was leaked in early September - but Feinstein denies that the letter came from her department.
"I'm not covering up Dr. Ford's debts, I'm not covering up her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep the faith, and I kept the faith she asked me to keep.
But the next day, the ruler of the synagogue, who was looking for trouble in the synagogue, said, "You know what? This is a serious matter.
Maybe she didn't, but she's the worst bodybuilder I've ever seen.
In his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexually abusing three women, the president suggested that Democrats use the charges to their advantage.
They would have chosen to return to each and every praise.
Thou seest the wickedness, the uncleanness, and they have no thought of any, and whosoever they hurt, they have set in ambush for power and for dominion.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants The team finished with a record of 5-3 and were eliminated in the first round of the playoffs.
Patrick Dwyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars overcame their Elite League loss to the Belfast Giants on Friday, winning the latter 5-3 in Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants got a quick two-point lead with shots from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie were tied at home before Dwyer sent the Giants back to the field.
Francois Bouchard equalised for Dundee before two goals from Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the win.
It was the third Elite League defeat of the season for Adam Keefe's men, who came back from a 2-1 defeat at Dundee in Belfast on Friday night.
It was the fourth time the teams had met this season, and the Giants had won the other three games.
Dwyer's first speech came in the fourth minute at 3:35 with a line from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford had the line when Beauvillier doubled the lead four minutes later.
A lot of things happened in the first half, and Sullivan got the home team back in the game after 13:19, before Matt Marquardt became the catalyst for Cownie's equalising goal at 15:16.
Dwyer ensured the Giants took the lead before the first quarter when he scored his final touchdown of the night late in the first period.
The home team returned and Bouchard again scored with a goal, while they had a man on the overwatch, after 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran played well together as Nielsen gave Dundee the lead for the first time in the game late in the second period, and he secured the victory with the team's fifth goal midway through the second period.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, are on home turf in their next match on Friday against Milton Keynes.
Airline captain dies trying to save hundreds of people in plane crashes
An Indonesian airline captain is being honored posthumously after he helped ensure the safe landing of an airliner carrying hundreds of people.
More than 8 people have died and many are missing after a major earthquake struck the island of Sulawesi on Friday, triggering a tsunami.
Powerful aftershocks continue to plague the area and many are trapped in the walls of the city of Palu.
But even as his colleagues fled for their lives, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to leave his session in a crumbling control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport in Palu.
He stayed to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, then on the tarmac, was able to safely take off.
He then climbed down from the watchtower, thinking it would collapse.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision saved hundreds of lives, Australian ABC News reported.
We arranged for a wheelchair from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to be moved to a larger hospital in another city.
The next day we left and reached the island of Patmos.
Our hearts are broken for this, he said.
Authorities fear that the death toll could reach thousands after the country's water pollution agency said access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong was restricted.
"The number of people who have been detained is still rising, as many are under house arrest and many are unable to be contacted", said the spokesperson of the institute, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Elders who were as high as six feet had destroyed the pavement, which would have been a crowd of burial marches on Sunday.
The army and airmen arrive with aid and equipment.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: Every minute the ambulance is coming with bodies.
Clean water is self-sufficient.
The little ones are plundered everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN: "The Red Cross in Indonesia is helping us with the full process, but we don't know what we can achieve.
This is already a sad state of affairs, but it can only get worse.
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, visited Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I want to ask each and every one of you to work day and night to fulfill the promises regarding the evacuation.
Are you ready? reported CNN.
Indonesia was struck by a Lombok earthquake earlier this year, which killed more than 500 people.
Micronesia plane crash: Air Niugini says one man is missing after plane crash in a pole
The airline, which tracked a plane that crashed into a coral reef in Micronesia, is now saying one person has died after saying all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking vessel.
Air Niugini announced that late Saturday, a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to locate the man.
The airline did not immediately respond, so the traveller was asked for details about the passengers, including their age and nationality.
Boats in the area helped rescue the passengers and crew after the aircraft crashed in the water as it tried to land at the Chuuk Island airstrip.
Officials said Saturday that seven people were transported to a hospital.
The airline reported that six passengers were hospitalized on Saturday and that all were in good condition.
The cause of the crash and the circumstances surrounding it are unclear.
The airline and the U.S. Navy have reported that the aircraft landed in the tailgate near the flight deck.
Some witnesses thought the plane had gone over the side of the road.
American passenger Bill Jaynes said that the plane flew very low.
"It's a very good thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said that he and others were able to row across the water, which rose to the middle, to the portholes of the ship's hull.
He said that the fleas were separated from him and were scratched, and that he had a small wound in his thigh.
The U.S. Navy said that sailors working to repair a bridge nearby also helped to use rubber boats to evacuate people to shore before the aircraft sank in about 30 meters (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicate that 111 people have died in PNG-registered airline crashes in the past two decades, but none on Air Niugini.
Figuring out the timeline of the evening, a woman was burned to death
The prosecution presented its evidence on Saturday in the opening phase of the case against a man accused of burning a woman to death in Mississippi in 2014.
The American reporter for the court, Paul Rowlett, served as a court reporter for several hours on the area of the investigation.
He briefly described how he used a telephone wire to locate the whereabouts of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of her death.
Rowlett said he got location information from several phones that told Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, and immediately contradicted his previous preference, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When information emerged that his phone was with Chambers, who was said to have been with her friend, Michael Sanford, the police began to question Sanford.
Sanford went to the witness box on Saturday and reported that he was out of town that day.
When the prosecution asked him if Tellis was telling the truth, he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another controversy was that Tellis had said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that shortly after Charlotte's death, Chambers had deleted messages, calls and information from his phone.
"He cut her out of his life", Hale said.
The defending champion will begin his final test series on Sunday.
The judge announced that he expected the trial to go to a special session later that day.
The High Breed: What is hip hop?
A hip hop trio will offer some insight into their genre of music by filling their music with positive messages.
The High Breed - from Bristol, claim that hip hop has been moving away from its origins with political messages and fighting against social problems.
They want to return to the source and make a conscious decision to return.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a resurgence in the UK with artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black people?
NY child girl faces two charges for driving her behind racist order
A New York City child actress sues a couple for discriminating against her and driving her after receiving a surprise text from her mother, who complained that she was "a black person".
Pariks deny that they are racists and argue the case with a penny-pinching.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was shocked when she discovered that her new baby sitter, Giselle Maurice, was pregnant when she met her first date in 2016.
"I'm not a black person", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman to her husband in a text message.
But instead of sending the messages to her husband, she sent them to Ms. Maurice, twice.
When she picked up the phone, the driver called out Plasco-Flaxman's name to Ms. Maurice, saying that the child agent before her, who was African American, had not done a good job and she instead expected a kiss, according to the New York Post.
Ms. Maurice was paid for her day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Mr. Maurice sues the couple for restitution for the claim, including restitution equivalent to $350 a day for six months and living in the place the position originally offered, despite no contract.
"I want to show them, be careful not to do that", she told the Post on Saturday, adding, "I know that's discrimination".
The couple have responded to accusations of being racist again, saying that the disappearance of Maurice was the smart thing to do, as they did not know if they could trust her after having her kidnapped.
My wife had sent her something she didn't mean.
She is not a racist.
We're not racist people", the man, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
Would you let your child marry someone you were unfaithful to, even if it was by accident?
The newborn baby?
Come now.
On the merits of the case to the penalty, Plasco said that his wife was due to give birth two months later and that she was in a "very poor condition".
Did you leave anything on the way?
It's not very difficult to do", the investor looked up.
As the trial continues, the public has been quick to accuse the couple on social media, speaking out against their behavior and misconceptions.
The editor of Paddington feared that readers would not associate a talking bear with the discovery of new letters.
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It's hard to put yourself in the shoes of someone who reads it for the first time before it's published.
It's funny now that we know what we know about the Paddington theorem.
She said her father, who had worked as a BBC illustrator before being inspired to write the children's book by a small toy car, would have been shocked if his work was rejected, adding that the 60th anniversary of its publication was a good reminder of his grief at his death last year.
Of Paddington, whom she describes as a "significant member of our family", she added that her father was the ultimate example of the kind of reception he received.
"He was a peaceable man who did not take part in any violence", she said.
"But because Paddington was so close to him, it was almost as if you were your own child, but it was really not because of anything you had done.
I think he thought of Paddington up that way.
Although he created it and it was his pleasure, he always took credit for Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When they landed, the daughter was sent to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors desperately tried to save her.
"Nad kept calling to say she wasn't feeling well, that she wasn't expected to finish", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
So Nad called and said that she would die in two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did that.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, good.
We'll be together again soon.
I'll be there soon.
The medication that doctors had prescribed to stop her heartbeat had weakened and was on its way out of her system.
She had just died, and that was the end of it.
I had to sit there and wait, and I knew instantly what was going on.
I could not cry, cry, or cry, because I was surrounded by family and people.
I just had to keep it in.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, now grieving the loss of her daughter, boarded the plane with other passengers - without giving a thought to what she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
I kept my head bowed and tears rolled down my face.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the flight that I felt a strong empathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Sorrowful mother sets up card to prevent for suicide at wedding
Two women whose husbands committed suicide work to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have posted a map of a Welsh bridge with reassuring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he had a bout of depression and committed suicide when he was 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a serious cook with a contagious disease.
Everyone knew his smile.
They say his smile illuminates a room.
But he did not work long before his death, because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, 11-year-old Tyler was saddened to learn that he had taken his own life.
Ms. Davis said, "I always drive so that it will have its own year".
Ms. Davis made the cards to let people know that there are people you can go and talk to, even if it's just a friend.
Do not be silent; you must speak.
Mrs Humphreys, who has been Mrs Davies' friend for many years, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after the death of his mother.
"He did not say that he was unwell or that he was drunk or something", she said.
A few days before Christmas, he began to behave unusually normally.
He was at the lowest point of Christmas Eve - when the children opened the packages he did not look them in the eye or anything.
She said that his death was a big shock to them, but they have to work it out together. It's a shock to the family.
It scares us apart.
But we must keep up the fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in jeopardy as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought if we actually got what he asked for - an investigation with limited time and scope - then maybe we could have some sort of consensus", Mr. Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would be torn apart by entrenched, partisan politics.
Why didn't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters have the FBI investigate?
Their objection is simply due to the situation.
The midterm election is just five weeks away, November 6 - if, as expected, Republicans do poorly, they will be weakened in their bid to get their husband elected to the nation's highest court.
George W. Bush has been calling around to senators, trying to influence them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Mr. Bush, and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats currently sit.
It is not yet certain whether Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to muster at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to confirm him to the Supreme Court.
Speech by North Korean defector mink under Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byeong-seug, who cited data from the Unification Council of South Korea, said there were 1,127 such cases last year - compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Ms. Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and higher fines for smugglers were the main factors.
Pyongyang has not commented.
Most North Korean defectors eventually acquire South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most flee to China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is therefore easier to cross than the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China treats defectors as illegal immigrants rather than refugees and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between the North and South - still in a state of war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang for a meeting that focused on the ongoing disarmament negotiations.
This followed the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they unanimously agreed to work towards a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho on Saturday blamed the U.S. action for nothing.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security and under such circumstances, it is not appropriate for us to unilaterally disarm first", Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "stupid" and says he is unfit to serve in the White House.
Opposition House Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "insane" and said he was "really unfit to serve on the Supreme Court".
Pelosi made her comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"I couldn't help but think that if it was a woman who had behaved in a manner that they would have said 'crazy,'" Pelosi said of her response to Kavanaugh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee yesterday.
Kavanaugh denied allegations that he had sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In his first story, Kavanaugh was quite emotional, sometimes almost crying or fighting tears when he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also strongly condemned the Democrats on the committee, accusing him of a "gross and systematic character assassination" perpetrated by liberals who were angry that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 election.
Pelosi said she believed Kavanaugh's testimony proved he could not serve in high office because it showed him to be biased.
I think he was just throwing himself away in the same way he did for Clinton and the Democrats.
Pelosi objected when asked if she would impeach Kavanaugh if he were impeached and if Democrats gained a majority in the House of Representatives.
"One thing I can say -- if he's not telling the truth to Congress or the FBI, then he's not qualified, not just for the Supreme Court, but for the court that he's in right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that she, as a Democrat, was worried about the possible rulings of Kavanaugh v. Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, as he is considered a conservative judge.
In his trial, he avoided questions about whether he would appeal against certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"It is not the time for some foolish, biased person to go to court and expect us to say whether or not it is just fine", Pelosi said.
And women use it a lot.
It is a just day, months and years of devastation pass by, and she cannot tell it without weeping.
"We cry when we get sick", Ms. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
She came forward, 'I was helped a lot by a woman who was the director of her uncle's house, and she said she was crying too, then she got sick, but she found a snake, which was that when she got sick and started crying, she said to the one she was talking to, 'You're also worried because I'm crying.
I am sick. I have to go to the hospital.
And then she just stayed.
And I thought that was a great success.
Tears are justified as a source of anger, partly because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my vividest memories is from a job I had in a male-dominated office, where I once started to cry because I was so angry, where I was caught naked in the face by an older woman -- a bald-headed executive I had always been a little afraid of -- who pulled me into a corner.
"You'll be ten years old when you cry", she told me.
They don't think you're crazy.
They think you're cool and they're happy because they've done it.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic member of the House from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught having sex outside of marriage aboard a boat called Monkey Business and subsequently retired, Mrs. Schroeder, who was very dissatisfied, thought there was no reason why she shouldn't try to run for president herself.
"It was not a conscious decision", she told me, 30 years later, in a whisper.
There were seven other elected officials, and the last one they wanted was the last one.
Then one of them cried out in a loud voice, "White Thorn, and the seven elders!"
As it was late in the campaign, she was again in the money race and promised not to run until she had collected $2 million.
It was a losing game.
She noticed that some of her fans, who had given $1000 to men, had given her only $250.
"Do they think I'll get an invitation?" she thought.
When she spoke out and announced that she would not have a regular election campaign, her emotions were overwhelming - gratitude to the people who supported her, disillusionment with the system that made it so difficult to raise money and to appeal to voters rather than officials, as well as anger at the class struggle - and she fought through tears.
"You may think I had a nervous breakdown", said Ms. Schroeder, recalling the media reaction.
You might think that Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my tombstone?
Is she crying?
How the trade war between ISA and China was a boon for Beijing
The first shots of the US-China trade war have been fired, and while the battle is far from over, a dispute between the two countries could prove beneficial to Beijing, with future in mind, experts say.
US President Donald Trump delivered the first blow earlier this year when he imposed tariffs on key Chinese exports, including sunscreen, steel and aluminium.
The most significant came this week with a tariff bill that affected goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion) and in fact levied tariffs on half of the goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has retaliated every time, most recently by imposing tariffs on US goods of five to ten percent, worth $60 billion.
China has committed itself to competing with the United States, one by one, and the world's second largest economy is not going to stop anytime soon.
Getting Washington to stand down means that we have to give up on demands, but publicly endorsing the United States would be too prudent for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
In short, experts say that if Beijing does everything right, the trade war with the US could help China in the future by lowering the tariffs on both economies' goods.
"That a quick political decision, whether in Washington or Beijing, can make the economy of the rest of the world more dangerous than previously thought", said Abigail Grace, a research associate who oversees Asia at the Center for New American Security, a research organization.
Syria is ready to take back refugees, says foreign minister
Syria has announced that it is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and calls for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by a war that has lasted more than seven years.
At the United Nations General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
Today, the situation in the region is more stable and secure due to the progress in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government continues to repair the infrastructure that has been destroyed by the rioters, in order to restore normal conditions.
All the facilities are now ready to receive refugees in the country, who have been forced to leave because of the violence and the loneliness that have stripped their daily routine and livelihood.
ST estimates that more than 5.5 million people have fled the country since the conflict began in 2011.
The six million remaining in the country need help.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government is ready to rebuild the devastated country.
However, he stressed that she would not accept aid from countries that supported the uprising.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup with a victory over Team USA, who finished 16.5 to 10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six consecutive times on European soil, and has not won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the crown when Thomas Bjorn's team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who had the most difficulty in the tournament, struck his first shot on the par-3 16th hole directly into the water, losing his match to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all of his tournaments and became one of four players to record a 5-0-0 record since the current format of the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was given a slap on the wrist when he lost 5%4 to the European team's worst-ever finisher, Thorbjorn Olsen of Denmark.
World number one on the men's stage, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who was probably playing his last Ryder Cup.
The winner of eight Ryder Cups, Spain's Sergio Garcia, became the most successful European player in the history of the tournament, with 25.5 points.
I don't normally cry, but today I couldn't help it.
It has been a difficult year.
I'm grateful that Thomas chose me and trusts me.
I'm so happy, so happy to have the rock back.
It's about the team, and I'm happy I could help", said a Kensluis resident, Garcia, after the European win.
He sent the winner to his compatriot John Ram, who defeated American golfer Tiger Woods 2&1 in the singles on Sunday.
"I'm incredibly lucky to beat Tiger Woods, when I was growing up, I looked up to him", said 23-year-old Rahm.
Woods lost all four of his matches in France and his Ryder Cup record is 13-21-3.
The record for the most wins by a major league player is 14, the most by Jack Nicklaus.
Team USA struggled to close the gap between tees and flats all weekend, except for Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played golf at a high level throughout the tournament.
The American team captain, Jim Furyk, said after the team's disappointment, "I'm proud of these four guys, they fought.
It was the morning of the day we did bad for Europe.
We fought.
My hat is off to Thomas.
He is a brave army commander.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We come back, I'm going to work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move on.
I love these 12 men and I'm honored to be their captain.
Boast, where boasting is born.
They were more stubborn than we were.
