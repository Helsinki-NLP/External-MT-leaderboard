This is called the pH of the chemical. You can make an indicator of red cabbage juice.
The color of the cabbage juice varies depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is indicated by the number of Hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.
The hydrogen ion is a proton whose electrons are released (since the hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).

When a small group (small population) becomes isolated from their main population of origin (e.g. if they are moved to a mountain or river, or if they are moved to a new island so that they cannot be heard from again) they will often find themselves in a different environment than before.
These new environments have different resources and different hosts, so the new population will need different features or adaptations to become more powerful hosts than they were before.
The native population has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptation as before.
In time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new surroundings, they begin to become more and more different from other populations.
Eventually, over thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different that they cannot be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the creation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.

A civilization is a culture made up of a group of great people who live and work together, a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, and the Latin civis, meaning village, and civitas, meaning city or country, and is sometimes used to mean a measure of society.
These are the beginnings of nations, a culture that provides a way to pass knowledge over time, a piece of culture that cannot be broken down or even divided.
A small culture often dies out without leaving a trace of history that it cannot properly describe as a civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen Colonies initially retained a weak central government - the Congress - as the sole component of the Confederate budget.

Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of Japanese islands, Japan is often referred to, in geographical terms, as an "island".
Taiwan was first visited in the 15th century, when European sailors first referred to the island as Formosa Island, or the Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, beginning a transformation in the production of native grains and hiring Chinese laborers to work in the sugarcane fields.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a Qing province in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded southern Taiwan to Japan, which ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu has three buildings, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three-Stopped Room.

In 1976, three percent of Machu Picchu was reconstructed and the work continues to this day.
For example, the world's largest photographic image size was 35mm, the largest film size available before analogue film.
This is a relatively recent development, but more importantly the aspect ratio that has been incorporated into the image sensor measurement of digital cameras.
The original size of the shell was 35 mm, or 36 mm in length and 24 mm in height.
The aspect ratio of this measure (which divides by two to find the least common multiple) is said to be 3:2.
Many of the usual formats (the APS family for format, for view) are equivalent or more specific to this aspect ratio.
The third law of diminishing marginal utility is a commonly used rule for making adjustments to the size of a given image.
This means that the point of intersection of the first pair of lines is the intersection of the three lines of the circle.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, found a spotlight.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united the countries of Europe despite their different languages and customs.
And he had power over all the people, from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian tenets is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary fund exists specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for over a thousand years and this centralization of power and money has led many to question whether this principle is being fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of war, the British began to offer the Germans a sea front.
The plan was right to succeed, it was a decision that would have been difficult for the military and the public, but it was a violation of the laws of the world that had been accepted by all the other allies two hundred years earlier.
The English kept the sea under guard by many nations, to prevent any ships from being able to sail in the open sea, and to the ruin of even the common ships.
From this point on, the Germans were waiting for a similar plan to the warship that they had built.
In the 1920s, the most visible obstacle in many societies and nations was the choice of peace and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors of war during World War I, the nations are eager to predict similar events in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job at Edison's plant in New York City.

Ancient China had a distinct way of representing different periods; each era of China or each ruling family was in a separate dynasty.
There were periods of uncertainty in the distribution of territory between the three kingdoms, the most well-known being the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years from the Han dynasty to the Jin dynasty.
In these days there is a great strife among the brethren for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in Chinese history, with thousands of Chinese soldiers dying in the struggle for the highest seats in the Xi'an Palace.

Muhammad, who desired more than the things beyond this ordinary life, often lived in the cave that would later be known as the Hira Cave on Mount Nur (Light) for a place of refuge.
He rested in a cave, which he had covered with a layer of mud, which was a clear representation of Muhammad's spirit.
And it is on the mountain, which is on the north side of Mecca, and is separated from the earth.
It is not easy to tell if a person is actually in the cave, but it is a cave.
There was no light in the heavens, and the mountains were not round; and there was no sight in the caves, and no sound in the rocks.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
Built by the Moors in the 3rd century BCE, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramids built to commemorate the late pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Valley of the Dead", in the Moorish Desert, contains several pyramids (though the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller ones, several meeting places, and the huge Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built in the name of Pharaoh Khufu, and the many smaller pyramids, and the high places, and the tabernacles, and the houses of the house of the king, and the houses of his chamberlains.

At one point, a friend of the French was the leader of the royal guard who had been arrested at Versailles for the murder of the queen.
The US imperialist involvement in the Philippine War was paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes on U.S. colonial bonds to pay for some of the revenue and flowers shipped in the name of the Philippine government to Wall Street banking houses.
Indeed, the large profits from the gradual exploitation of the Filipinos were the proceeds of US imperialism.
To understand the Templar, a person must understand what the templar is and what he is doing.
The period commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 CE).
The High Middle Ages began in the early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which according to convection ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from the drive for or necessity of technology to the strictly held view that human destiny is driven by the underlying logic associated with scientific law and its manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism fall into two general notions: first, that technological development follows a path largely outside of cultural or political influence; and second, that technology in turn "affects" socially embedded societies.
For example, some argue that motor vehicles must lead to the development of highways.
However, the national road network was not economically viable for only a few motorcycles, so new production methods were promoted to reduce the cost of ownership.
Mass motorcycle ownership has also been a cause of increased road accidents, leading to the introduction of new techniques in health care to repair sprains.
Romanticism was a major influence on cultural determinism, taken up by writers such as Gothe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography is a personal attachment, and often the customs and cultures of the geographical origin, where people live, are more important than the laws that dictate what is acceptable.
As Paris is considered the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as the centre of luxury from about 400 BC to about 1100 BC.
Its status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices that were worth more than what the Byzantine market could provide.
It was during this time that the title of Fashion Capital was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style was compiled in the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
The first was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.

Subsistence farming is the practice of farming in order to obtain enough food for the day to meet the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple agricultural system, usually organic, that uses native seeds from ecosystems that are stored and harvested by crop rotation or other simple means to obtain good yields.
Historically, some cultivation of spirit in subsistence agriculture has been practiced in some developed countries.
Subcultures bring together people who feel isolated from their peers and may be able to express their own feelings of isolation.
Subcultures can be distinguished by their current, ethnicity, class, location, gender, and/or group base.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as distinct are linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or grouped by cause.
A subculture is a group of people who share a set of shared norms and values, including how to behave, how to communicate, and how to communicate.
One of the most commonly used illustrations of social importance is the use of a number of children who are poorly educated, neglected, unlucky, or accidentally abused, without being informed by an adult.
Some children are "crazy" or "wrong". Some children are "crazy" because they are being chased by people (usually by their owners); in some languages, they are not allowed to be chased because their owners do not want to destroy their brains or bodies.
And the children of the field shall be afraid, and the children of the field shall flee from before them.
Some feed the cattle, and some feed themselves in the fields.
When raised by non-human animals, wild children display a certain degree of physical restraint, almost all of which is due to their fear of humans.
While the idea of a space project was to create a simpler and more beautiful space, the planners went further.
Scanning is not a method of execution, rather it is a method of teaching newcomers how to use a new computer program or start a new project.
Screens can be both virtual and real, in other words, a window is the size of a screener but is actually a smaller version of Microsoft Office.
Virtual scanner is embedded in the software and allows you to ask questions, solve problems, and submit procedures that might be difficult for a student to handle alone.

We think of the Childcare System as a safe zone for these children.
Our childcare system is based on a safe home, a caring parent, good education, and good health care.
And the guardians laid upon them to feed me, all the days that I was in the house.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive nature of the Internet brings an additional dimension in terms of approach to use and gratification.
For example, learning and socialization have been suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Self-engagement and continuing engagement were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated participants' reactions to websites.
Video recorders can achieve a high level of interpretation of micro-expressions, facial expressions that move for a few milliseconds.
Typically, it is found that a person can tell whether a person is lying by evaluating the microexpression of truth.
Olver Sacks, in his paper The Presidential Address, showed how people who cannot speak because of brain damage can still be considered light.
And he commanded them to understand the same thing, to destroy man from the tree of life, and from the beast from the tree of life.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two types of genetic networks: hidden and real.
Mutation increases the number of new genetic lines, and selection eliminates the actual assembly line.
Segregation and recombination take a back and forth between the two pools with each generation.
Outside the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to replenish its amino acids from available wood resources.
In addition, unproductive work has its consequences: depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The oldest wood resources are proteins obtained from leaves and nuts, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are eaten.
In contrast, animal fat (monkey, cow, goat) is not only digestible, but also provides protein in high amounts containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised if our own grandmothers solved their "protein problem" in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Ice cutting is the process of keeping your normal ice time constant and then slowing down a few minutes later (10-60 minutes).
And thou shalt make a silent alarm, to bring thee to a stand, lest he deceive thee.
If thou sleep, and thou gather straw, then put it in another chamber, and bring it down from the bed.
Other sources of biorhythms include the diuretic process (also known as diuretic pre-exercise), which forces a guard to exert pressure.
The number of the bones in the body is the number of the bones in the heart, and the number of the bones in the heart is the number of the soul.
The more positive the diet, the stronger the life is. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.

The physical existence of a real "invisible group" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is the unique component of a virtual group.
An "invisible group" is a management group whose members report to each other. An invisible group does not set standards for the types of members.
Why is an organization willing to go to the extra effort to build a learning organization? One goal of bringing the concept of learning organization into practice is innovation.
