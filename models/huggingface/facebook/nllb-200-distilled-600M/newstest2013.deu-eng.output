A Republican strategy to oppose Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justify their policies by the need to combat electoral fraud.
However, the Brennan Center considers the latter a myth, affirming that election fraud in the United States is less common than the number of people killed by lightning strikes.
Republican lawyers have, by the way, only recorded 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine partly the democratic system of the United States.
Unlike Canada, the federal states are responsible for holding elections in each state.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of American governments have enacted new laws that make it more difficult to register or vote.
This phenomenon gained momentum after the November 2010 elections, in which 675 new Republican representatives were registered in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone that restrict the exercise of voting rights in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to present a photo ID and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce the time limits for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on Election Day and deny citizens the right to vote in respect of which a court order is made.
Before the 2006 election, no US state required voters to show a photo ID.
Indiana was the first state to make such a claim.
The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the constitutionality of Indiana's law in 2008.
The Republican authorities are rushing to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states that force voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal identification card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million eligible voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their state.
In addition, five million new voters in 2012 do not have such a card.
However, often more than a hundred dollars are paid to obtain the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people with incomes below $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo ID.
This goes further.
Students who are considered voters who are increasingly voting for democratic candidates are not allowed to use their school-issued photo ID in several states.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of fishing or hunting associations who vote more for the Republican side to use the election cards issued by these associations.
Prior to 2004, no state required proof of citizenship for voting.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting the Spanish vote.
Because it's obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in eight states in 2011 promoted laws that abolished voter registration on Election Day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general elections helped register about 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have led to a 17% decrease in the proportion of newcomers registered in 2010 compared with 2006.
In addition, Republican lawmakers in five other states have passed laws aimed at shortening the time for early voting.
For example, in the 2008 Florida general election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were African-American, even though they made up only 13% of the state's electorate.
The same is true of the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of the electorate, but 24% of the citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, whites, who represented 76% of the electorate, made up only 46% of those who voted in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have been vigorously opposed to legislation restricting voter registration.
Several bills have been blocked by the vetoes of the Democratic governors.
The U.S. Attorney General has intervened to expose the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have passed laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics criticize the party-political nature of the laws passed and see as a clear objective to influence the results in the states that have decided for 2012.
A 2011 report from the Brennan Center shows that the states that passed these laws received 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential election.
But one thing is certain: these new rules will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures undermine partly the democratic system of the United States.
Prostatitis early detection: should the test be done or not?
The PSA test does indeed sometimes reveal erroneous results, with false negative or false positive results leading to unnecessary medical intervention.
This leads to greater hesitation among men who are already undecided about conducting early detection tests.
Should we take the test or not?
We've got the opinion of two medical specialists.
The studies conducted in the USA had a number of disruptive factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and to make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there was a difference in mortality among patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that after 12 years of follow-up, the likelihood of metastases developing is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection is performed.
So I recommend testing from the age of 50 or 40, if you have a close relative who's already had prostate cancer.
African-American men are also at higher risk.
The most important thing is to make the right decision once a cancer is diagnosed.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient must be made to really understand the extent of the risk of his or her cancer by showing him or her the possible options for untreated prostate cancer if it does not affect quality of life in the long term, and in these cases, it is more appropriate to actively monitor the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not receiving treatment because their cancer is not aggressive and does not pose a threat to their lives.
They are offered active surveillance and treatment as the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should be treated and who should not are being determined with increasing accuracy.
That is why I recommend the test.
But the most important thing is to talk to your doctor about whether or not to perform the procedure.
Movember, in cooperation with the International Society for Urology, has developed an instrument to assess the advantages and disadvantages of the PSA test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of developing it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and exercised adequately.
"If there were no more smokers, this number would rise to at least 50 percent", says André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are hereditary.
Several remain completely unknown.
The fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority for the Canadian Cancer Society, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85 percent of lung cancer cases.
It's also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It's a big health hazard.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today", regrets spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: Ten years after quitting smoking, the risk of dying from cancer is halved.
Weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, obesity and being overweight also contribute to the disease outbreak.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, small intestine, mammary, esophageal, pancreatic and uterine cancers.
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects against pancreatic cancer throughout life", he adds.
The Nutrition
The organisation also recommends limiting red meat consumption.
In too large amounts, it increases the risk of developing a form of cancer of the small intestine or breast.
Whipped sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the body's cells and lead to cancer", he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
But your research is not conclusive at this time.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not been clearly demonstrated.
Mr Beaulieu also stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and his family background.
"Conducting an early detection test does not lead to cancer".
The Higgs boson is analyzed
The announcement of the probable discovery of the Higgs boson caused some alarm last summer, and for good reason.
In fact, it is believed that this boson is involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it's the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model -- our best or least false explanation of the nature and behavior of matter -- but not yet empirically observed.
But physicists aren't entirely sure it's actually the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it's very similar to the Higgs boson predicted by the standard model.
In addition, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented this week at a major physics conference in Kyoto, but there is still no data to be completely certain about it.
So let's assume it's actually the Higgs, because there's only a slight risk of being wrong, and let's see what it's all about.
There is a law in this world that is inevitable, and it means that two objects cannot be present at the same time in the same place.
It is not possible to break this rule - and do not try too hard, as you will hurt yourself.
Because even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that there is a law of this sort for it too: the Paulie exclusion principle, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same "quantum state", and that "state" is largely made up of some of their properties.
Based on this, physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In one corner are the good citizens, known as Fermions, who respectfully obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other, the bosons are moving, an evil gang of anarchists who have nothing sacred -- certainly not this principle, which means they can actually be in the same place at the same time.
These bosons, according to the Berkeley Laboratories' website The Particle Adventure, are divided into two groups (which is absolutely amazing, by the way): the mesons, which we won't be treating here, and the "particles of force" through which the great forces of nature spread and with which the Higgs boson would be related in some way.
But it must be emphasized here that these bosons are not all as exotic creatures as you might think.
If you can read this chronicle, it's only because of a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon, or "light particle", which is the "boss" of the electromagnetic force.
When a particle accelerates or changes direction with an electric charge, the electromagnetic field is "distorted" at that exact location, much like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" produces an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
Stable field
The same goes for the Higgs boson, except that another field, the Higgs field, has to be disturbed in order for that boson to show up.
However, the Higgs field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the agent must reach very high energies, somewhat comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be scratched by a very large rock.
So we need a huge particle accelerator like CERN -- the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a radius of 27 kilometers! -- to reach this kind of energy.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is again helpful in explaining the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don't - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold onto the refrigerator by itself.
And not all particles interact with the Higgs field equally: those that do have mass, while the others (like the photon, by the way) have no mass.
What is the use of all this research, Mrs Plamondon asks?
For science, they are used to verify the standard model (SM) and also allow physicists to accurately examine any discrepancies between the observations and predictions of SM.
By the way, there are many physicists who are eager to find such deviations, since the slightest difference could open a door to "new physics" and plug some holes in the model.
It must be said that the latter has still great flaws, since it offers no explanation for gravity (up!) and the dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, no such discrepancies have been found at CERN so far.
Effects
The impact of these studies on the general population is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is none.
By the way, in the early '60s, the pioneers of laser at Bell Labs had no idea that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first permanent laser (the first ones were pulsed) in 1962 - has already told us that the laser was initially considered more of a "laboratory plaything".
Imagine that you...
In addition, applications can also arise from all the instruments surrounding research.
For example, in 1969, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor while working in optics.
Although not the original purpose, this sensor is now used by all digital cameras worldwide as an eye, and it won him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
Of course, this doesn't mean that the LHC's activities will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you really can never know...
Palliative care is the best way to die...
With its committee on "Death with Dignity", Quebec recently discussed the delicate question of the end of life.
The debate must resume shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much work remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to look at this more closely.
A few weeks ago Mr L. lived alone in his apartment in the Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had given him a two-year deadline.
"They gave me five years to live, I made it seven", he said halfheartedly, lying in his bed in the Victor-Gadbois home for palliative care in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it", he says.
The disease is doing its job: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating himself.
Sitting at the table before a delicious lunch, he resigns to be helped with the meal.
He even smiles and talks to the strangers around him, bringing him his medicine, and offering him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is that my diarrhea be cured, as this is humiliating", he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this disease.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man peees while standing", says Pierre Brodeur, a psychologist at Victor-Gadbois Home.
For some people, going back to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation.
"It depends on the person's ability to take a step back", he notes.
Because according to several people working in palliative care, major events are taking place amid these setbacks.
The patients who are admitted to Victor Gadbois' palliative care home all have cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, they are no longer overwhelmed by the doctors and nurses who care for them with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation".
But the disease really got me to know my children.
"I have good children", she adds.
"I have no wishes in life", she says before accepting a mask to help her breathe.
She is still waiting for her son, who is coming from Italy, to visit her for the last time in the coming days.
The Victor-Gadbois Home offers a group of volunteers to help with physical care and food intake.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, for every 11,700 inhabitants, there is a palliative care bed.
That's very little considering that one day we're all going to die.
Here life is continued under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the doctors at the home.
Both at the level of physical, emotional, and spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given oral care with brandy or Pepsi, as desired.
Diabetics no longer have to control their blood sugar.
And death is part of everyday life.
Last night we served Mr. X a beer that died in the course of the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help family members and patients alike", reports Nathalie Savard, director of nursing.
Victor Gadbois' home is not a day like any other.
Alongside a 93-year-old man enjoying the last family gathering in the yard, well supported by his pillows while he is honored, a 36-year-old young man, surrounded by his parents, wife and two young children, tragically dies after trying his best to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have been occupied by cancer patients under 45", says Dr. Christiane Martel.
53% of patients admitted to Victor Gadbois' home come from their home, 47% from the hospital.
Problems of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, which is care designed to alleviate the suffering of patients who have reached the end of their lives, whether at home, in a hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, like the Victor Gadbois Home and the Home Palliative Care Society in Greater Montreal, are more or less exclusively dedicated to caring for cancer patients.
It is precisely this large inadequacy in Quebec's health care that causes several palliative care doctors to face the adoption of a law regulating assisted dying and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by prominent figures in palliative care such as Dr Balfour Mount and Dr Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
Dr. Christiane Martel says that Quebec's health system is not sufficiently efficient to ensure that everyone is entitled to high-quality palliative care before accepting the transition to assisted dying.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who had been in the emergency room for 14 days in great pain without any relief measures being taken.
I'm afraid the patients are dying because they don't get adequate health care.
And at the same time, several oncologists treat their patients, despite the worst prognosis, until the last day.
Hélène Richard's chances of survival were already minimal when she stopped a difficult chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist I was going to stop treatment, she replied that she regretted that I had given up the fight, she said.
But she told me I was done!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nurses for not granting their wishes after their pain has been relieved by a palliative care team.
But it must be made clear that palliative care is not omnipotent in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, 8% of patients do not seek pain treatment.
Thus, at the end of life, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which involves either putting the patient to sleep sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend that we don't see this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the option of resorting to this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pain is not relieved all say the same sentence, "I want to die".
But that doesn't necessarily mean, "I want you to put me to sleep", but, "I want my pain to be relieved".
The report was made possible by a journalism grant from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
Major real estate scandals in Quebec
Officials of the road construction office, construction companies, fundraisers of political parties, and specialists of the Italian mafia tell us every day what they know about a great "system" where construction, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafiosi are embroiled.
A 'industry' which was very expensive for the Quebec taxpayer, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
"It's strange how the system has fallen apart since drastic measures were taken", jokes Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former Montreal police chief.
The scandal was exposed by him following an in-depth investigation into the abuses related to the contracts for road construction in Quebec, which the then Prime Minister had only reluctantly agreed to.
The Duchesneau Report established a direct link between industry, secret party financing and bribes to officials.
"Since the beginning of the investigation in 2010", he stresses, "the Department of Transport alone would have saved a billion dollars on contracts", because some were controlling their instincts to keep their share!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already brought down two mayors", he adds, hoping to "make the case for the tactics behind the individual".
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
The permanent anti-corruption unit, which was launched in 2011, is also making great efforts with its troops of government auditors, investigators and analysts.
Also, the Martéau Police, who since 2009 have been making the Montreal Sewer Cartel more reluctant to artificially inflate contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out a series of house searches and charged with fraud and corruption against municipal officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is the mayor of a suburb.
Next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec's third-largest city.
He is suspected of having received bribes in exchange for public contracts.
The charges were specifically brought against engineers from the Montreal Road Authority and against Italian entrepreneurs such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito.
The latter has raised awareness by explaining to the Commission how the 'system' for obtaining public contracts works.
He himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts received in Montreal for several years to a mafia-linked broker who transferred the money to the Union Montréal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito has been at the forefront of the 2000s by giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (about 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the Liberals in power at the time.
He also admitted to organising an illegal fundraising campaign for former Liberal Vice-President Nathalie Normandeau.
Drainage contracts whose costs were artificially inflated by it
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption was working smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant has described this in detail to the Commission: in ten years he received gifts from the construction company, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants and ice hockey games, and bribes of $736,000 in return for sewerage contracts, the cost of which he artificially inflated.
Other officials at the Roads Authority admitted that they were being lubricated by artificially inflating the bills with false surpluses by 30-40%.
In addition, a promoter of the mayor's party, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately looking past a shadow household that filled his vaults with black money.
The Commission has already made a number of proposals to the Council.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal MPs to sound the alarm.
As mayor of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she opposed the sale of a community property that was bought for $5 million and resold to 1.6 million builders in the booming real estate market in 2010.
70% of the black money in the election campaign
Of the investigation, which is finally being carried out, she says that it "puts a thread in the way of understanding the functioning of the system undermined by ants to stop evil and to bring down the guilty".
She says the procedure is "painful, but positive".
We are cleaning the wound, but we need an investigation unit specifically for Montreal and a supervision to prevent a return of questionable practices.
How to clean.
I do it regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes that "officials have stolen several hundred million dollars", but he is especially concerned about the role of "the agents who are the most tactical in the picture" if they were not involved in the fraud!
He jokes about the 70% share of black money in the financing of Quebec's election campaigns: "I was told this was only a weak reflection of reality".
The Quebec government proposes to limit party donations to $100, which it believes would not change the situation: "Unless campaign spending is strictly limited, black money will be in politics".
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and financing parties: "We cannot go any further; by going to the bottom with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws".
If this story is to harm the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr Duchesneau urges those who laugh at it to take a look in their own backyard...
"PSG is not FC Barcelona!"
This season, you've taken a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
It can be explained by personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
I'm making progress every day with her.
The technical staff has also given me a lot.
These elements motivate me to improve my game every day.
And in a game, it's even easier.
Everything goes very fast in football.
But I'm not really excited.
From my beginnings at the INF Clairefontaine training centre until my time at Saint-Etienne, I have always made gradual progress.
You're taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Ancelotti...
The new additions this summer are used to playing games at very high levels.
You also know that every training session is crucial.
This leads to a player like me having to offer the front and want to give his best.
By the way, Carlo Ancelotti gives me a lot of things about my playing position.
He's backed by fellow coaches like Claude Makelele, who played the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the right person for the job?
Of course you do.
Ancelotti has a lot of respect for all the technicians.
There is currently no one like him in Ligue 1 and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He looks back on his rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he'll win more titles in Paris.
In January I had an encouraging conversation with him.
I was recovering from a series of injuries.
The trust he placed in me is also an explanation for my accomplishments.
What do you think of the first part of the season for PSG?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took our place as the top rider.
We're in the lurch.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the final eight this way.
What is the aim of the association in this competition?
We'll try to get as far as we can.
From now on, anything is possible.
But we will have to speak against very good European teams.
First, we want to be the first in our group before Porto, so we can play the final eight home games.
Can PSG become a major European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for...
To become a great European club, Paris must win titles and make a name for itself in the long run.
This is not the case today.
The PSG is financially committed to making this project take concrete forms.
Would it be a big failure not to win the Ligue 1 title, as it was last season?
Of course, this would be a great disappointment.
This year, we really want to get rid of this title.
Last season, we were close.
In May, we were disappointed that we were strong enough to hold out victory.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We finished with 79 points.
Normally, you should be a champion with 79 points.
But another team, the Montpellier team, has had an even better season.
I think this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are fighting for the title, I think we have the stuff to win it.
Do you think the media expects too much from PSG?
Given what's been invested and the players we have, it's normal that we're expected to do a lot.
We accept that completely.
But if we win 4-0 at home against Troy and you still find something to blame, that's certainly a little frustrating.
You wonder what else people are waiting for.
We could never win every weekend with a 4-0 record.
We're not the FC Barcelona!
We're trying to put together a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
We've shown strength in the Champions League.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has not qualified for the final eight for two seasons and has also spent a lot of money!
In terms of the sums invested, you were believed to have a 15-point lead at the game break!
That would mean our opponents and the French championship would be ignored.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be the smiling winners and tell ourselves that despite all the difficulties we have finally won them.
PSG seems to be completely dependent on the performances of Zlatan Ibrahimovic.
Better yet, we're talking about a "zlatan addiction".
That means Ibrahimovic is a strong player and he's a big shot.
That's why he came and he's proving he's the star of Ligue 1.
Everywhere he's been, he's shown that he's a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects those around him.
What he's done is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their playing ability.
Thiago Silva, one of the best defenders in the world, is also making it possible for everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the 2012 World Cup with the French national team?
It's such a disappointment.
I wanted to be a part of this tournament.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from spending some playing time.
I saw things there that made me stronger.
Today I manage to make good games in the national team.
This has been my hope since my baptism with the Blues.
We have learned from what happened in Ukraine, and today we must set an example.
What do you think of Didier Deschamps' first few months at the top of the Blues?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualifying group for the World Cup.
The national coach is strict, close to the players and drives to victory.
Just like Laurent Blanc was.
But I don't want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blues to Brazil.
Is the draw for the draw in Spain on 16 October a preliminary draw?
This game gave us confidence.
Everyone has stood up for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I had never seen a match like this in my career.
Bitcoin is a bank-free payment and sale
The opposite of the current monetary exchange on the basis of central banks, identified transactions and processing fees between the parties.
In addition, as so often in these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the belief that the current monetary system, designed by banking monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a secure exchange protocol like BitTorrent that allows direct file exchange.
With 15,000 computers on the network, about 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or payment method.
After peaking at $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, the price of Bitcoin dropped to $2 five months later before recovering to around $10 today (the prices are listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes Bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin differs from other types of virtual currencies such as "credits", which are used to advance in a video game that you can win or buy through gaming (and sometimes exchange back).
The social network Facebook has also developed a system of this kind.
However, each trade is controlled and processed by a central authority.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously account holders, auditors, money issuers, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two email addresses in the form of an email.
The difference is that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A series of data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
This allows the network to verify the authenticity of the transaction.
The contents of the file also make it possible to ensure that the traded bitcoins are in the public accounts ledger distributed throughout the network.
The crucial step is to include this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, where the winner, who is a kind of provisional central banker, has the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and clearer electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "hacked".
The aim is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
Once this number has been found, the other nodes can easily check if it's the right one.
The transaction is thus permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay for the same money very quickly (less than 10 minutes) twice for the scam, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would be unlinked because both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solves the problem gets 50 bitcoins.
In order to prevent inflation, this reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The bitcoins in circulation are limited to 21 million, but they can be divided up to a hundred millionth, which leaves a certain margin...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement in computing performance.
The life of the network has already had its ups and downs.
The websites that provide services for Bitcoin were attacked and the Bitcoin deposits were stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol", assures Pierre Noizat, who has just launched Paymium, a real money payment company that uses the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibility of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Important actors like Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They're accepted by others like the WordPress blog platform.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron of the Weizmann Institute in Israel analyzed the ledger and showed that almost 80% of bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega closing sale" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged", rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for the company Coinabul, which converts bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, strongly believes in the potential of this technology as a transactional network.
Its Paytunia system is similar to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment using a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate transactions that are cheaper.
In addition, the owner manages his identity and can thus remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented by the dealers and they do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
All you have to do is provide an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend in which hierarchical systems are overlaid in favour of more horizontal systems.
"It will take some time for Bitcoin to take hold, but 2013 could be a turning point", he predicts.
The ECB is proposing in its report to reassess the various risks that are now highly regarded in the event of the success of this currency.
We've moved out of Afghanistan.
And then what?
French troops have left their area of responsibility in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US should follow in late 2014.
It's time for the Afghan army to take back their territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We have punished the Afghan peasants in particular by considering them terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 dead soldiers, as well as the wounded and the marched.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also farmers who refuse to have an armed foreign presence, as they did in the Soviet era.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even though jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajikers have joined them.
Tolerated, sometimes supported by local insurgents, the latter will be gone when Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of French troops from the base at Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees financed by French loans, was carried out properly.
The convoy of trucks and tanks flown by helicopters reached Kabul without being attacked.
By the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban inflow into Kabul.
The situation has changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was ravaged by war due to the fighting of various insurgent groups.
Her rise to power was then seen as a kind of liberation and return to safety.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of the farmers overwhelmed by the Al-Qaeda organization, but their situation has not improved to this day.
Former Mujahedeen, the Afghan government and the current Taliban share a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The most important figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They've turned into business makers by seizing government land to sell it as construction land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, and thus benefiting from the massive subcontracting of American land.
They have become infamous, and most of them have not been involved in the fighting themselves.
As I've heard from the campaigns, people want a government that's not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, as did those who have benefited from the American contributions: capital flight is considerable.
The young people are fed up with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they have had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
About 65% of the population is under the age of 25; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In cities, public schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the old parties or to the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be given jobs.
All, including the armed parties, are obsessed with mobile phones; TV with its Turkish series, which represent a modern world, is watched everywhere.
There's an army now.
Will the authorities under whose authority it will be held be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already working to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the land of mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from some decentralization, as Western nations did, but by abolishing the office of prime minister that had existed since the 1964 constitution, the US wanted to make it a centralized state with strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, especially during the April 2014 elections.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functional dams are not present and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruit and vegetables.
The private initiative will be given priority.
In a country ravaged by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor spread that Afghanistan possessed immense land resources.
This further reinforces the impression that Western countries were only on the ground to seize it.
Without energy to process iron or copper ore on the ground or without means of transport for export through the mountains, mining is not possible.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mines of Mes Aynak, and international archaeologists (funded by the World Bank) are excavating the huge Buddhist site and remain the province's main employers.
One day it will also be necessary for Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports largely depend, to restore normal relations.
The withdrawal of French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: girls' and boys' secondary schools, the French Institute at the universities, the French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a Civil-Military Action Service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), set up in 2012, has carried out numerous non-profit agricultural rehabilitation works and measures in dozens of mountain villages and has been carried out by a small French non-governmental organisation in an attempt to 'win hearts and minds' and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive actions.
These efforts, which required a large number of local workers, helped to quell the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increase in agricultural land.
What souvenir do we leave behind after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, which are often more than 2,000 metres high.
The embassy received dozens of written requests from municipalities in the province of Kapisa for small agricultural projects.
In order to free the farmers from the insurrection led by foreign groups, which they claim they wish to, they would need to continue to benefit from less, better controlled and directly related civil aid.
A Constitution with a Breaking Rod in Egypt
It's a new poker game by President Mohammed Mursi.
While Egypt is more divided than ever on the constitutional declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited power, it has decided to put everything on a map.
To everyone's surprise, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
The President of the Commission has already given the plenary two months to complete its work.
Egypt has been relying on a provisional text which has been amended several times for almost two years, weakening institutional stability and leading to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to an even stronger division of the country.
To his opponents, the president persists in his "autocratic delusion" by continuing to "break his word" and "trample on the law".
Its supporters assure us that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and to speed up the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time that forces the brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text to the Egyptians section by section.
For the president, it is also a way to restore his public and democratic legitimacy as the protest rages across the country.
After confirmations in an interview with the American weekly Time, Mohammed Mursi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favourably.
Since the Egyptian people are being given an ultimatum with this recall to a hasty vote: "Either you vote for my draft or I will retain unlimited authority", the latter should be ended after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 members, mostly Islamic, of this Constituent Assembly, adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Liberals have not complied with the call.
Shortly before the declaration of the Constitution in mid-November, they turned away, feeling that they had not been able to put their views into practice.
Representatives of human rights organizations, religious minorities, and civil society acted in the same way.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the marketing of certain dangerous substances.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that the articles were generally adopted unanimously.
Commentators, by the way, found it amusing that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed in the time for prayer, as some members of the committee felt that the pendulum clock of the Constituent Assembly was not accurate.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Article 2, which has attracted all attention, remains the same as that of the 1971 Constitution, stating that "the principles of Sharia law are the main source of law".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, hoped to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been amended is proof of their goodwill and respect for the other members of Egyptian society.
"Propaganda" is the response of the Liberals, who see this as a propaganda attack.
Because they say that Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They have in particular in mind Article 220 which recognises the advisory role of Al-Azhar University, in particular with regard to the verification of compliance with Sharia law.
According to Egyptologist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people being asked to comment are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.
Here are the first signs of a theocracy".
The Liberals' fears are also fueled by the fact that the next rector of this university is likely to be far less moderate than the current one.
"There is no concrete religious commitment at present.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics who have been trained in part in the French system", reassures Alexis Blouet, who is writing a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
However, he acknowledges that 'there may be ambiguity with regard to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
The term "fiqh" is used here.
And in the future, the question may arise as to the extent to which civil judges are competent to rule on this matter".
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is being strongly criticized for the wide-ranging powers it gives the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that these are significantly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the military's wishes, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament but to a national defence council.
Nor will there be a ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as demanded by human rights organizations.
The latter also share their fears about the text they consider to be a threat to freedom.
The facts of blasphemy will be maintained and insults are now prohibited, which could have serious consequences for the right to freedom of expression, especially for the press.
In addition, no article is ever about protecting women, stresses Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In your opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture under Article 36.
This word was not included in the previous constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are scheduled for this afternoon.
The supporters of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists expect holy sites, the navel of the world and a sea of salt
The Promised Land combines the glory of Bible truths, modern comfort, and an untouched nature.
AIF gives you the five main reasons for visiting Israel.
Bow before the holy places
Visit the Jordan River, where Jesus was baptized.
It says that all who bathe in this river receive God's blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on the water, stopping a storm in the sea, and fishing.
It was here that Jesus appeared to his disciples after his resurrection.
However, most of the shrines are in Jerusalem.
Here believers go on the path of suffering or the way of the cross of Jesus Christ (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The path begins at the Roman fortress of Antonia, the Praetorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the Old City to the Church of the Tomb on Mount Golgotha, where the site of the crucifixion, the anointing stone, and the tomb of Jesus are located.
In Christian terms, this is the world's umbilical cord, symbolizing the salvation of mankind.
The Holy Cross Monastery in Jerusalem stands on the site where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which the cross for Jesus' crucifixion was made grew.
Jerusalem is also home to the holiest place for the Jews - the Wall of Mourning, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 C.E.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave wish lists there, which are then fulfilled.
Making a Highway Trip
The ruins of Massada Castle are the remains of the secret hiding place from enemies that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 C.E.
They're on a rock wall in the mountains, 450 meters above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins by their own power.
Everyone else is taking an airline to this historic summit.
In the north of the country, at an altitude of 1,600 to 2,040 meters, is the famous Hermon ski resort, which attracts countless tourists during the winter months.
From the foot of the mountain, you can get there by shuttle.
The skiers have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an ancient legend, pagan gods supposedly lived on the mountain top.
Visiting unique museums
There are almost 300 museums in this country.
One trip alone is not enough to see all of them.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Among them is the Israel Museum, not far from the Knesset.
It houses ancient Qumran manuscripts, or Dead Sea Scrolls, found in rock caves in the Judean Desert, as well as some 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Tel Aviv Museum of Art is also worth a visit.
It is home to the collection of works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko, you can visit the museum in Bad Al Basha, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of the visitors and bathmen of the time.
In Caesarea, you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free and donations are generally refused.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum, or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells one of the most shocking chapters in history.
The most striking section is the Children's Memorial, built to commemorate the 1.5 million children who were destroyed in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
When you enter the room, there is complete darkness.
The stars are shining.
And they're echoing the names of the Jewish children and the countries where they died.
The Ukrainian people are also mentioned.
Doing Something for Health
Israel's three main recreational areas are on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and the Dead Sea.
Each of the three locations has swimming pools, water parks, dolphinarium and oceanarium.
Surprisingly, the Red Sea is also bathed in the winter months, as the water temperature does not drop below 21°C and the air warms to 23°C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and baths there all year round.
By the way, this unusual sea, at 417 meters below sea level, is the deepest sea in the world.
Its turquoise water is high in salt, which makes it easy for even non-swimmers to swim on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatment with salt water (natural salt) and sludge, as well as for treating skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and to calm strained nerves.
Touching the Mysteries of the Ancient World
These secrets are hidden in the old city of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia, and Mesopotamia ran through this city.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with which he lived a long and happy life in that place.
Tourists like to stroll through narrow streets named after the star signs.
Fortuna is supposed to be the legend that touches the walls in the alley with her star sign.
In Jaffa, you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even other countries at photo shootings.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can wander through the Roman theater and conquer the fortress of the Crusaders.
In Roman times, Caesarea was the most important city in Judea and the residence of Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
The carefully restored theater now hosts evening concerts and operas.
List of tourists
If you go to Israel, don't worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is not to be taken in euros but in dollars, which can be easily converted into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you usually get there by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a high-speed tram and in Haifa there is the only metro line in the country with six stations connecting the city centre to the city centre.
It's actually an underground cable car.
A trip within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the means of transport, which is enough for a journey of up to 1.5 hours.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is observed on Saturday in Israel.
From Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, markets and shops are closed, and public transportation is at rest.
And Sunday morning is the start of the work week.
Many cafes, restaurants and restaurants only serve kosher food, excluding pork, seafood, fish without shellfish and foods containing both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you have the choice between various dishes with ham and beef, soups and desserts (made with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus paste, various sauces, fried balls of puréed beans and peas (falafel), and fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
For this reason, many well-fed cats wander the streets comfortably and unharmed.
In the evening, they are even seen sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
Cats like busy places and don't say no to sweets.
A rental car costs between $37 a day (Hyundai Getz) and $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80), depending on the brand.
The insurance costs an extra $15 a day.
And the cost of renting a bicycle is 15 shekels a day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
In numbers
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the United States and Ukraine.
The Commission also concluded that the Commission had not yet established the conditions for the entry into force of the Agreement.
"The Great and Powerful" to Moscow: Migrants save money for language
While lawmakers and civil rights activists are discussing the benefits of the mandatory language tests law for migrants, criminals are already trading in fake certificates
Every year 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money to support the families who remain in their home.
On 1 December, a law came into force that requires every migrant to take a test certifying his knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this scheme has only been applied to migrants who want to work in the services sector, in the municipal housing sector and in retail.
However, the Federal Migration Agency has proposed that in time, testing will become mandatory for all migrant workers.
It is not only language tests that are required, but also tests on Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be demonstrated for both the granting and the renewal of the work permit.
Exceptions only apply to citizens of countries where Russian is the official language.
The same is true of persons who obtained their diplomas and certificates of education before the dissolution of the USSR in 1991.
The purpose, problems and protection of rights
All the examination centres will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute of the Russian Language, the Russian University of Friendship, the Moscow State University, St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in all cities, and more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the Members of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Agency.
But before the law came into force, civil rights activists repeatedly asked the press: What is the point of all this?
What changes will the requirement to have language skills bring for both Russians and guest workers?
The main aim, according to a spokesman for the Migration Agency, is to reduce the number of forced labourers.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers", says the head of the Federal Migration Agency's representation in Tajikistan, Viktor Sebelev.
However, their rights must be protected before they leave.
Only an organised recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical examination face problems.
Sebelew is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions who will put him in a dark, narrow barracks under the guise of help, where he will endure with dozens of his peers for months without food and documents and 12 to 14 hours a day of work.
We have received many complaints from our migrants.
"You will be promised the one at home, and on arrival you will be cheated, your passports taken away and you will not get the promised salary", confirms Tolib Schwaripow, head of the Tajik Migration Agency's chief labour migration office.
Don't be mean, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn money in Russia admit that they not only do not master the language of the destination country, but also can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the problem: few Turkmen, Uzbeks and Tajik people can afford even a reasonable basic education.
Because their families do not even have money to feed their children, let alone buy them decent clothes, shoes, and school supplies.
As teenagers, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's hard without language skills", they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior".
Civil rights activists stress the following important aspect of the law.
Only legal immigrants have to take the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of guest workers continue to stay in Russia illegally.
"Welcome" or "No entry for unauthorized persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
The reason is the bureaucratic obstacles and, of course, the linguistic difficulties.
The legal process also costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
You can make a fake registration quickly and for only a thousand and a half.
The Russian police know that our documents are mostly fake and we are not registered, and that leads to cases of blackmail.
"They want a hundred or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea", Tadjik Umed Huschkadamow told reporters.
"No cost to avoid false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it was revealed that not only the registration documents of migrants could be forged.
Some fake certificates certifying the completion of the language test have already been seized by Federal Migration Agency employees.
The counterfeit papers were printed with a regular color printer.
Of course, the new owners did not receive the documents for free: every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
This is more than twice the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
The most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption so that certificates cannot be bought easily, officials and civil society alike agree.
For now, the authorities can only promise guest workers who fail the test for the first time that they will be given time to take a basic language course.
In addition, newcomers without language skills are offered jobs in areas where no active interaction with people is necessary.
Home Office ignoring illegal arms market
The proportion of legal weapons in crime is extremely low
The Russian Interior Ministry plans to tighten the gun laws for private gun owners.
This is the response of the authorities to the recent events: wounded in wedding shootings and seven dead in the shooting of Moscow lawyer Dmitry Winogradow.
The police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for gun ownership from 18 to 21.
The President of the Duma Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Jarowaja, supported the proposal and promised that the amendments to the Arms Code would be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to fight the problems by "drawing the screws".
An open letter was published on the Internet, asking the authorities to refrain from "senseless intensification".
The percentage of registered gun crimes is very low, criminal lawyer Wasiliy Lesnikov told the BBC's Russian service.
According to the Ministry of the Interior's statistics, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed over a six-month period in 2012, while a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were committed during the same period.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law on private gun owners will not prevent criminals from using the black market.
According to the authors, at present, every weapon can be found in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Interior Ministry stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from the factories to the officers
The weapons are being smuggled into the black market through several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former colonel, Viktor Baranez, who spent ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website accepting weapons orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
"The weapons were stolen from both Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves", Baranez says.
On the second channel, illegal weapons are coming in, stolen from law enforcement officers by criminals.
Baranez explains that this includes weapons stolen from both the police and law enforcement officers' weapons chambers.
Other illegal weapons are from military weapons stores.
Many military camps have often had explosions.
"There is evidence that in some cases it was arson to cover up the lack of weapons", says the former military official.
According to Baranez, the arms manufacturers are also contributing to the black market.
"Today, there are countless private arms factories that cannot withstand international competition and therefore waste their weapons underhand on the black market, such as in Moscow", reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Especially many guns and pistols come from poor countries like Kyrgyzstan.
"There is a production of its own, sometimes manual, and a mafia that organizes the smuggling", explains the former military official.
Where did the guns come from?
Experts calculated the proportion of each of the five channels in the black market supply of illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Problem Analysis and Public Administration.
The experts analyzed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Office of State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly available data on portals on weapons.
The majority of the illegal weapons, according to investigators, come from the army and law enforcement agencies.
Half of all weapons on the black market are there because of "the fault of those responsible for dealing with weapons in their work", the report says.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons are from conflict zones, 14% are stolen from weapons production, and 5% are from illegal excavations.
A sales consultant at an arms store, who did not want to be named, assures that weapons found in illegal excavations have long since been outdated.
He said that it is more common for dealers to get supplies in an arms depot.
A firearm is bought through a firearm, for example a TT gun.
The weapon is exposed and passed through the fence.
"The dealer brings the gun to the city and sells it there for 900 euros a piece with two magazines", he says.
"Of course, the police know everything and, if they cannot follow the plan to detect crimes, they regularly make control purchases from dealers who offer illegal weapons", adds the salesman.
"Like in a luxury store"
Buyers and sellers are most likely to get acquainted through each other.
I was looking at websites and blogs when someone noticed me and suggested that I come to the Begowaja station, where someone would wait for me, and take me to a certain place where we could negotiate the price.
I didn 't know the price of the gun until I was there .
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need a friend who has contacts", says the salesman. "I have such a friend, but I don't trust him".
There are dealers in the markets, but you have to go there and date with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who tells you that your daughter lost a tooth".
I'm even getting some knock-offs right now about a friend I trust.
He's also giving me the rings just because he knows I'm not blowing his whistle.
Newcomers look for weapons in different ways.
Former military man Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
He said the plans had not changed.
He got a photo album that showed "everything possible".
"I felt like I was in a luxury store", recalls the military man.
Baranez says the buyer doesn't get the cat in the bag, but he can try anything.
As a potential customer, I don't just buy, I drive the seller into the woods, and we set up a target disk.
"I can shoot there, and when I'm convinced the gun has a good shot, we negotiate with each other", the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the couch
Internet search engines display search results for websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for various purposes".
No papers are needed, no personal meetings.
"You only need the right amount of money", says the advert on the "Buy a Gun or a Rifle" website.
It's where users place orders and make requests.
Is it sold to minors?
"Of course without a license", asks user "Iwan" (literally quoted).
"Buy a TT. Moscow", is the laconic request of Fedorenkov.
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to buy guns are increasingly going online.
People come like hungry fish to feed and then they land in Siberia and they can shell out coal
Military commentator and former military officer Viktor Baranez
I heard about the following scheme: the website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
The people in charge will accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money through a bank machine.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the weapon's hiding place", reports Dmitry Kislow, a spokesman for the nonprofit organization "Pravo na oryzhie".
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that you can also end up empty and behind bars if you place a query on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently turned on countless fake websites, and buyers who want to buy guns are increasingly going online.
"People come like hungry fish to feed and then end up in Siberian labor camps and are allowed to shovel coal", he says.
A macaroni for 100 dollars
According to experts, illegal firearms can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislow of the organization "Pravo na oryzhie", a makarow pistol can be bought for $100 to $300.
You have to wait up to a month and a half.
The weapon is issued in military weapons camps by mid-level supervisors.
According to official statistics of the Ministry of Interior, the number of illegal weapons offences across Russia decreased by 7% to 22,9 thousand between January and October 2011, while the number of reported cases of theft and extortion related to weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7,8%.
In the US, fast food and supermarket workers are on strike
One in four American teenagers sits behind the counter at some point in their lives at Mc Donald's.
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the United States against low wages at Walmart stores and popular fast-food chains like Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can predict whether the protests will continue to swell or if they will soon be out of the air again.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organizations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and fast food workers, the organizers of the protests are aiming to create unions.
Until now, this sector of the economy has been hardly organized syndicately.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, on what is known as Black Friday, when sales in the United States attracted millions of customers, sometimes leading to hand-to-hand combat.
On that day, some Walmart employees, including 2.2 million worldwide, quit their jobs and, along with unions and leftist activists, shut down the chain's branches targeting low- and middle-income individuals.
Walmart sells everything from diapers to hunting rifles and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
The average cost of Walmart's stores is between 8 and 27 percent cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That's why many of Walmart's low-paid employees only shop at their own jobs.
The prices and the product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the United States.
Critics say Walmart can often sell goods at such a low price only because its employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain of difficult working conditions, for example the absence of forklifts or hand scanners.
The Black Friday protesters demanded wage increases and expressed their anger that the contribution to the health insurance business had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
A typical Walmart employee earning $9.5 an hour couldn't afford that raise, they said.
Researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, prove that if the company raised the average salary to $12 an hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That's about 1.1 percent more than they're paying for their wages now.
If Walmart were to fully reverse the pay increases to customers, each purchase would cost them only 46 cents more in the future.
That would be an extra $12.39 a year for them compared to today.
Walmart supporters are satisfied that only nine states have seen protests, and they have not caused any losses to the company.
Black Friday lasted from 8:00 p.m. on Thursday until midnight the next day, and Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second during that time.
In total, Walmart's cash registers made nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company's spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the left-wing Huffington Post website that a total of "less than five" Walmart employees quit their jobs and that the protest was merely "another PR trick" by the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where their target was not Walmart stores (which are not desirable in this progressive city and therefore no longer exist), but McDonald's and other low-cost restaurants.
McDonald's says the company sells billions of servings, and yet you're not given sick days, and you're not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the federal and New York minimum wage is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-food restaurants are gradually raising the minimum wage, but not too much, and their average New York employee gets $8.90 an hour.
No one in this expensive city deserves less than her.
How it is possible to make a living in New York with so little money is incomprehensible to me.
There was a time when almost a quarter of all American teenagers were behind the counter at McDonald's after school, but the teenagers were still living with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw the main source of income or planned to stay there longer.
Now, I keep interviewing people at McDonald's who complain about making ends meet with that salary, and sometimes even feeding their kids.
On the other hand, there is a commentary in the Wall Street Journal forum that the author notes is irresponsible to have children if you don't know how to feed them.
Participants in the protests, which began at 6:30 a.m. on Thursday outside McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that cashiers and chefs of fast food restaurants receive a minimum wage of $15 an hour, more than double the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
U.S. law prohibits the management of a company from obstructing that goal by dismissing or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, business management is not easy for them.
The establishment of trade unions in the fast food industry is difficult for objective reasons.
The main reason is the high staff turnover.
Unsatisfied
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The highlight of the protests was a midday rally outside McDonald's in Times Square where some local Democrats spoke, including City Councilman Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's says it sells billions of servings, and yet you're not given sick days, and you're not getting paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should join forces to support fast food workers so they can get a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity every New Yorker deserves!"
According to the New York Times, this was the largest such action in the history of the U.S. fast food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on the scene, not all of whom are employed in the fast food industry, which employs tens of thousands in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"The brain is only moderately intelligent"
The theme of augmented reality, popular among modern technologists, is usually seen through the lens of a special pair of glasses.
Google first presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, and then in November it was announced that Microsoft had filed a patent for it.
However, in a conversation with the head of the interactive 3D technology group at Microsoft's Cambridge lab, Shahram Izadi, it becomes clear that the glasses were just a transit station for the company's scientists.
It's exciting to manipulate virtual objects in the air with your bare hands and create virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly the research your group is conducting.
- We are concerned with the interaction between man and machine, but we want to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Until now, mankind has largely been stuck in the phase of using pixels on flat-screen displays, sometimes even touchscreens.
But we want to look forward to five to 10 years and predict the radical changes that this interaction will bring.
For example, Xbox consoles and Kinect sensors are a breakthrough, and no Xbox without Kinect is sold today because everyone is interested in motion control.
- What's in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought interaction to a physical level, much of it still happens on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) has been improved, but the output has not yet been decisive.
We're trying to change that, working on real three-dimensional imaging systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We need to release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, this requires that not only the user but also his environment be recognized.
Then we could complement the real world much more easily with virtual objects.
And first of all, we should get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
- What do you think of voice control?
She's popular, but isn't she overrated?
- It's certainly not the all-purpose solution, as it raises privacy issues, because you don't always want to inform everyone about your actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each one in its particular niche.
For example, we were working on a project in the field of object control in public places where we experimented with short and narrow gestures instead of loading.
The gestures were not recorded by the camera, but by a bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but could theoretically be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future is a mixed control, like gesture and language.
- What do you mean, "that"?
- Would we ask you to give us this spray can?
You say it and you mean it at the same time.
- I usually just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to tell.
- Does that mean you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and cannot afford at any given time?
Not necessarily, but this is a matter of mutual approximation.
I think in the near future, we'll have to work primarily on developing new types of sensors that allow us to more accurately capture people's reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, because they provide good resolution at depth, which is very important.
What are your claims based on your work with the Xbox Kinect sensors on modern cameras?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth, or something else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, eight megapixels at 1,000 fps would be good.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
So, all the current technologies are not good enough for us, because the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
The resolution along the X and Y axes must be taken into account, as well as along the Z axis.
The speed and number of images per second are also important.
Human movements are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps is too little for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed a touch sensor in our Redmond lab with a controllable processing delay of 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors being closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction between man and machine.
For my work, I needed exactly the same device, but without touch control and with more images per second.
- Shouldn't the number of cameras be increased?
- Kinect is currently operating with three 'cameras', one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the other is a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually a regular RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the depth of the object.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or to amplify the problem, as more calculations would be needed.
It would be nice to have a flexible, Kinect-like system where we could play with different camera properties to see how that helps us in determining a three-dimensional position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that in terms of the application of augmented reality technology to everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it's not always nice to have a smartphone in your hand on the go, but I think the best thing would be a "changing" augmented reality where we could switch from glasses to smartphones over a cloud.
The glasses are a personal gadget and that's their strength (only you can see private things), but also their weakness, because augmented reality uses glasses to prevent you from working with others on virtual objects.
- Let's imagine for a moment that manipulating virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Iron Man's Tony Stark, but to normal mortals as well.
There is one problem that critics of this idea often point to: there is no tangible response!
The hands don't feel anything at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often talk about the fact that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth breakthrough could be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection document.
She's a very good pressure sensor.
But there are also technologies that are actually designed to give the "pictures in the air" a touch of hand-holding, for example, interference from some directed ultrasonic beams at a certain point where the finger is, creating a feeling that is at the moment still as weak as someone breathing over the handballs.
There are also bands for the wrist that affect the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Did you try to outsmart the brain?
Make it think it feels what it should feel when it's seeing something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
Here we have another challenge that we will have to deal with for a long time, namely to make a person who is physically in a closed space think that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large balls.
So far, the brain is only modestly over-smart, and we have many years of hard work ahead of us.
This is what makes virtual reality work so attractive to a researcher: we are just getting started on many subjects.
The European Union has also adopted a new policy on the protection of the environment.
Rosbalt continues the project "Petersburg avant-garde", which is dedicated to the city's inhabitants who form the vanguard of art and culture.
The list of selected artists already includes high-ranking representatives of the St. Petersburg art scene, whose successes extend beyond the city limits and often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the red-clad beard you meet at the Russian Museum, the summer garden, the stage meetings, the rehearsals.
Wherever Kirill Miller's paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical social-philosophical artists of St. Petersburg who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a bright figure in the Petersburg avant-garde of the late '80s and early '90s.
He is also a man of the city, and by his presence on the street he brings a smile to the faces of his fellow citizens and makes them feel good.
He recently got a set of horns and became a St. Petersburg horn player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artistry, philosophy and image.
Kirill, why are you always wearing red and not yellow or turquoise in town?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer who deals with optics and image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artists, image consultants and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the grey standard evokes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to talk to people through my provocations.
Every provocation I've ever had was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know you had to be a painter?
- At an exhibition at the Palace of Culture in Nevskiy, where my work was exhibited.
I realized I had to go this way.
Then the age of the old free, but not officially recognized painters at the time, was over, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, the representatives of the "Gazonewska", and from this came "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was over.
I'm drawn to theater, fashion, music, really, everything but literature.
And all this came together in your kind of clinic... it was important to me to be at the center of St. Petersburg's culture, where the best creative artists would gather.
In 1995, I occupied a room in Pushkinskaya 10, and there was a music-artistic club for Bohemians until the renovation work, the house of the Bohemians of St. Petersburg.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how String got there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs for the playback, wore tight t-shirts and included the now-fashioned composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started playing live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg hosted many programs before the time of Halli-Galli.
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it started his great career, but he learned the basics from us.
The D 137 gallery or the Griboedov club also originated in the Art Clinic.
Our staff and regulars went there.
I'm a hero of the last century, when culture was still important.
In 2000, there was a press poll about the "City of Our City" award.
I won the Artist of the Year category, and I was on top of the list.
It is not easy to work in new times by old rules; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the last century.
It's easy to become famous today, but culture and popularity are not the same thing: You can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your work has an unmistakable style.
- Many of my paintings are real pearls and clearly express the timeliness and sharpness of the thoughts.
I'm going to have an exhibition titled "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares me to be.
In a clown, all that disappears and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let's save the world by making it mandatory for everyone to fully dress.
Now everyone is paying attention to the clothes and focusing on the outside and not on the inside of the person.
But maybe you shouldn't shake a man's hand, you should spit in his face.
The deception disappears by the disguise.
- We saw you playing the role of the city's film-maker.
Who else is there?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Today commercial art must be careful, considerate and flattering.
We're seeing the decay of cultures.
In the past, people formed large groups: Bohemians loved one and the common people the other.
Now there are micro communities, and it's hard to please everyone.
I'm not a hundred-dollar bill that everybody likes.
Now you have to think about who you're gonna like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- But there are thousands of people at Stas Mikhailov's shows.
- It's where abandoned women come in, where the sexual and social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come instead of 10,000, so there's less management, less money, and everything goes to waste.
I have followers, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not destroy what they have achieved.
When I was younger, I painted pictures that were even hanging in a row with the works of Falk and Larionow.
I started with pictures that usually don't come until the end of my career.
There are often misunderstandings these days.
It's called "spiritual culture" and "consumer culture".
Consumption has no culture at all, that's something else entirely.
I'm a person of a past culture, and I grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money to paint.
That's the culture I advocate.
- Kirill, what's missing from Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say, "servant of culture".
But not all of them can deal with culture.
The real Tsars were different, because the Tsars may not have understood much about culture, but they understood that the right experts were necessary.
There are good advisers in Moscow at the moment.
In St. Petersburg we have some who could be experts, but they are blocked because they need higher-level experts who can evaluate the former correctly and clear their way.
Now it's just your taste.
The same goes for Errata, but with the difference that they honestly say they don't accept all contemporary art and some painters have to look for other museums.
- What's Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the cultural capital; Moscow has much more culture and a corresponding food base.
It's hard to grow art on our rocks.
We need a cultural breeding ground, because for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that's not right.
In Europe, there are many curious people who attend exhibitions or concerts.
We're a lot less than that.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the City of St. Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Warming or collision with a killer asteroid.
Caravans of spacecraft with Earth's inhabitants on board are on a quest to find a replacement planet.
To save humanity, the important question is, how can we reproduce in weightlessness or on the replacement planet?
I don't think there's much to choose from.
There are only two real planets that we could actually inhabit, at least hypothetically.
"It's Mars and Venus", says Vladimir Surdin, a scientist at the Sternberg Institute for Astronomy.
However, while conditions on Mars are comparatively life-friendly, the surface of Venus is 500 degrees Celsius.
Life would only be possible at high altitudes or in the orbit of Venus, that is, in space.
The question of reproduction in space was first addressed by the researchers with regard to the flora.
Already half a century before that, experiments were being conducted on plants.
The fourth generation of peas grown in orbit differed in no way from the terrestrial species.
This was followed by the breeding of insects, more specifically, tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, a team of guards was sent into space to study the effect of weightlessness on embryo development.
It's a normal chicken that's developing.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chicken must find a stop; it must be able to stand on its feet and start moving", explains Vladimir Sychev, laboratory director of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems at RAN.
Without a solid ground, the chickens overcame each other wildly.
Ten hours later, the newborn's instincts were completely numb.
The chickens didn't respond to light or sound.
Four days later, they just died.
"We had chickens hatched twice and then stopped because it's just impossible to work with them there", says Vladimir Sychev of the failed experiment with chickens in space.
The last animal cage flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, only the same-sex species will be present on the Bion satellite.
There was an experiment with rats that were already fertilized and sent into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"This was just with the biosatellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research needs to continue", observes Wladimir Sychev.
After landing, the space rats were given newborn babies.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not been solved until now.
The task is difficult.
Animals that are torn from their natural habitat simply cannot follow their reproductive impulse.
Unlike animals, humans could do that in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not conducted.
But women have been flying in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was Tereshkov.
The most precious thing that mankind possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the question: Can it survive space flight?
Will she be able to give birth after this flight?
"Finally, no one answered this question", says spaceflight veteran Wachtang Watschnadse.
In June 1964, just one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkov, gave birth to a daughter.
The child's father, Andrijan Nikolaev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Swetlana Sawizkaja, who was in orbit twice and even worked outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
But there's still a risk.
We have very few astronauts who have been successful after long flights and have had healthy offspring.
"The more the more dangerous it is even in orbit", concludes cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, hero of the Soviet Union and hero of the Russian Federation.
Yet, humanity must find new ways in biotechnology, radiation protection and the generation of artificial gravity.
The Hydro Lab at the Cosmonaut Preparatory Centre is a mandatory station during flight preparation.
Here in a suspended state, the cosmonauts are gaining routine space work.
Water is weightlessness.
Although adults find water pleasant, it is a strange environment; yet infants find water a natural element.
It's like the little Ichtyander testifying that life on land originated in the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in the fetal water for about nine months and the fact that it can then become more accustomed to water.
This is logical, since it takes just two weeks from birth to swimming.
"This is too little time to forget", says Marina Aksenowa, a baby swimming teacher.
While for a newborn child, weightlessness is a much more natural state, the woman does not go out without gravity.
In the state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles are rapidly retracted, and the ability to squeeze the child out also decreases.
All right, let's get around this with birth control.
For example, the birth could take place in a special room to squeeze the baby out.
"But what happens then?" is the not insignificant question of Waleri Polyakov.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without the sensation of earth's gravity, the organism cannot train the skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put into a weight suit like an adult to train in orbit.
He'll just miss what's essential to his life.
"This joint experiment, the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will lead to the birth of a disabled person, a completely unadapted person", predicts Igor Pestow, head of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute for Medical and Biological Problems at RAN.
So far, the birth of children in space is just a theory.
But eventually it will become a reality when the inhabitants of Earth embark on their spaceships to a distant planet that will be home to their spaceship-born offspring.
NKÚ-chef: control of the black system fails due to political fault
The Czech Republic has good control authorities and adequate laws in the context of public procurement, but is falling behind in their application.
In an interview with Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala, said this.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I do not think this is the case with us", Kala comments on the current situation.
A similar result appears to be achieved by joint checks by Czech and German inspectors.
As a negative example of practice, he points to the appointment of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black system".
Recently, the Prime Minister said that the ODS would not bother entrepreneurs with controls - so is the system now banned or allowed?
"A law must be valid, and if something is forbidden by law, the head of government cannot simply come and the control body, whose duty is to check compliance with the law, can not interfere with its work", Kala notes.
At the meeting of the House's audit committee you spoke about a joint Czech-German project comparing the laws of both countries on public procurement.
What was it about?
This is a parallel examination which we started about two years ago.
In short, it is about European legislation setting out how public procurement is to be handled, on which national legislation is based, and finally, there is the actual practical application.
We have compared all these and although the examination is not yet complete, we have found very interesting differences.
This confirms that it is not enough to keep setting new and more precise rules, but also to deal with the actual application of the law.
How can the project help you? What will you gain from this project?
I would like to say that the Commissioner has already made a number of proposals to the Council and to the Council, and I would like to thank the rapporteur for his report.
Economics means buying a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding illegal enrichment or even criminal acts.
But lowering the thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will achieve this goal.
Maybe it's even the case that we're just burdening the system with excess paperwork, and those looking for loopholes in the system are much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds stayed higher.
They are talking about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech tax law.
How does the control system in Germany work?
Is there an authority like our NKÚ here, or does the system work differently?
As regards the authorities, the German counterpart to the NCA is the Federal Court of Auditors, which is similar in structure to ours and also has a college which is only slightly different in structure.
The competencies are also comparable to a certain extent, but Germany is a federal state, i.e. there are also these accounting offices in the individual Länder - this is what differentiates the German system from ours.
The Federal Reserve can only control federal funds that correspond to our state funds.
Public funds managed by the districts and municipalities are controlled by the national accounting authorities.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would not like to compare this without specific information, but Germany is often referred to as an example in some respects, although it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in all respects.
Is it because the inspectors are better off there?
I'm sure not, but like I said, I don't like comparisons like that.
The Commission has also been able to provide a number of information on the situation in the Member States.
Otherwise, you wouldn't have any cooperation with our agency, would you?
As regards the Czech legislation, what significance the amendment to the Compensation Act had for your authority, do you feel any impact?
Given that this new rule is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had an impact on our examinations.
As our checks are carried out in the aftermath, we must expect some delay here.
If we are to see the effects of future controls so far more in the preparatory phase - we have introduced the new control instrument 'Identification of risks of unfairness' and have used it to examine and analyse almost 14,000 public contracts - the changes will of course have an impact here, as thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, among others.
Do you see the passage of this law as more positive, or is the system being burdened with more bureaucracy?
I think that this law is definitely a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption will be confirmed.
However, the problem may be that the rules become "strict" and cannot be followed.
The Commission has already established that the Commission's decision to adopt the budgetary procedure is not binding on the Member States.
But is it reasonable to make the law even stricter?
I don't think it's that way.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system, and not punish those who have made a form error that does not affect the actual decision-making.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the protection of workers' rights.
Where's the way out?
Let us first say which path is not conducive.
The Prime Minister recently said that the SDG would not allow entrepreneurs to control the so-called "black system" - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black system now prohibited or allowed?
A law must be valid, and if something is forbidden by law, the head of government cannot simply come and obstruct the control body, whose duty it is to check compliance with the law.
He can say, "We're changing the law and allowing the thing", but he can't say we're pretending nothing.
The tax legislation contains relatively strict rules on the formal conduct of certain transactions - and this is true for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best bid is excluded solely because of mistakes in form.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think we lack.
The roads are sometimes ice-slotted, but mostly dry.
The streets of the Czech Republic are partly snow- and ice-covered.
However, the roads are mostly well-paved and sometimes require increased caution.
The Commission shall adopt implementing acts.
In Karlsbad district, the roads were well paved this morning, with occasional snow and ice.
Temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 degrees Celsius, and during the day it's supposed to get a little warmer.
The region is now freezing from snow, and only a thin snow cover remains in the lower altitudes.
However, there is about 30 cm of snow on the slopes of the Erzgebirge.
According to the district highway patrol, due to fog, there was limited visibility.
The R6 motorway and the first-class roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention is paid to bridges where the rails are sometimes difficult and smooth.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, are also accessible.
However, on these roads there are still some required or exhausted snow remnants.
In particular, in the higher regions, increased attention is therefore required.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
Some roads in eastern Bohemia are at risk of ice, in higher places and in the mountains, and sometimes there is a heavy snow cover on the roads, the Road and Highway Administration reports on its website.
The road authorities warn drivers of ice, which can occur particularly in higher locations in Pardubice district.
The ice shelf can be reached in particular on second and third class roads in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
The roads I/43 and I/34 at Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is particularly found on the roads in the Giant Mountains and the Orlické hory Mountains.
A large snow layer is located on the high roads of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov.
In eastern Bohemia today, it is mostly sunny or warm, and it remains largely rain-free.
Temperatures are between -3 and +1°C, a weak wind is blowing.
District of Pilsen
The roads in Pilsen district are now well paved, but local attention is being paid and the driving patterns must be adapted to the weather.
This one's freezing in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it had snowed before and the temperatures dropped afterwards, it can become icy on the streets.
Local fog is also expected, but visibility will improve over the course of the day.
This information comes from the county road authorities.
The D5 motorway is virtually unrestricted, but the road authorities recommend increased attention between 80 and 131 kilometres.
The first-class roads are mostly dry but frozen.
However, in the southern parts of Pilsen and Tachov, there may be a partial glacial glaciation.
The second and third class roads are wet and therefore the reference to possible required sections applies here as well.
Drivers should be particularly careful on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest.
Olomouc district
Today, drivers who are heading for the high ground in Olomouc County must expect snow.
After the use of scattering vehicles, Snowmatch remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass and on the road to Videlský kříž.
The nightly snowfall forced the road authorities to use the snow, according to the road administration, in the district of Šumperk fell about 3 cm of snow.
In the rest of the district, the roads are mostly unrestricted.
"In the district of Šumperk, snow remains in the highlands.
On the Červenohorské sedlo pass, drivers in the direction of Jeseník must expect snow", a Šumperk road administration official told the ČTK agency today.
Her colleagues in Jeseník had to leave at night, saying that the roads up to the high ground were clear and wet after chemical treatment.
In Olomouc, the roads are completely accessible, but in Šternberk, drivers must be careful in forested areas, as the roads are still wet.
The following is the list of the regions of the region:
In northern Bohemia, the road authorities report several road sections that are not conducive.
In addition to several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in Ústí County N.K. is closed, according to traffic police.
Temperatures also remain below zero, so snow and ice will remain on the roads. However, no problems are reported from the lowlands, particularly southeast of the Bohemian Mountains, and roads are generally dry.
No traffic jams have been reported so far.
Ice sheet is reported in particular from around Štětí.
According to meteorologists, the ideal conditions for this were at night - rain and melting snow during the day, cloudless skies and frost at night.
The main roads and I/13 road on the border between Ústí n.L. and Liberec districts are reported to be in poor traffic conditions.
The road between Telnice and Knínice was closed due to branches being pushed from the snow to the track.
Šimon Ornest: We want to gather positive energy at our concerts
What do you think about the world ending in less than a month?
This is one of those disaster reports that people like to jump to.
With our band The Tap Tap, we're more of a joke about it, saying that we're the only band in the world that can collect enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December, you will also be hosting a unique project with three anti-concert concerts.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
It's a national benefit event we've been planning for two years.
To do this, we want to use the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, which is predicted to end at 11:10 a.m. on December 21.
On the day before, that is to say on 20 December, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava from 21:00.
The end of the concerts is supposed to be around the time when the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which is in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
I thought it was me, but then we came up with the idea with our graphic designer, Honza Augusta.
We want to not only gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to think with the public about what kind of world we will once give to our children.
To mark the end of the Mayan calendar, we also developed a unique collection of end-of-the-world shoes, T-shirts, bags and key hangers that people can buy on www.e-tap.cz to help us.
The band The Tap Tap has also recorded, along with other performers, the so-called "End of the World" anthem, entitled "End of the World Is Falling Out".
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. Will it be played at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and it's all in the end, provided everything works out and the world doesn't end...
The anthem is to be sung simultaneously by all performers at all three concerts.
In addition, the anthems will be broadcast live together on Czech television.
The lyrics of the hymn are by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video, Xindl X also sings with...
How did you get to work with them?
We also cooperate with other figures of the Czech cultural scene, which is linked to the fact that we have many charity events and concerts...
We're trying to get these people involved in our projects.
It has been shown that most people are interested in working with us and enjoy it.
What purpose does the proceeds from the concerts against the end of the world serve?
The project is aimed at the creation of the Studeo Barrier-Free Education Centre, where we have been working for six years together with the Tap Association at the Jedlička Institute.
Students of Jedlička Institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who assist them in various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we want to help them in this way.
The project is to build a building for the Jedlička Institute, which we will then move into.
Every concert features several groups and performers.
What criteria did you use to choose these?
We wanted to put together a program that would appeal to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, there are Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "major events" planned for the future?
In May we will perform for the first time at Prague Spring, and we will also prepare an interesting programme for this concert with interesting guests.
We would like to perform at the Czech House in New York next year, and I personally, if we are in the United States, would like to associate this with performances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not very small, you have already performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap, however, is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organisationally?
It's not as bad as it looks at first glance.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, which means wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage compartment, and we must of course bring a lot of instrument trunks and other luggage...
Nevertheless, until now it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, which I have sometimes wondered at.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Your travels abroad will give you a comparison of what accessibility looks like in each country, how people with disabilities are treated there, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than ours, we have just witnessed in Russia that everything in the East is still in its infancy.
Moscow is not a handicapped city compared to Prague, where it is still unusual for a person to be in a wheelchair alone in the city centre.
It is not even natural to leave a wheelchair user in an elevator, for example.
Fortunately, there are also groups that try to raise awareness of the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what way do we have to catch up with the more developed countries?
There's a lot of stuff we're stuck with...
However, it should be noted that improving the situation always depends on the efforts of those concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common for people with severe disabilities to move freely in public spaces, to go to museums, to use toilets, etc.
But it is not very common for a larger group of disabled people to take an active part in social events there, and we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect for the public and accessibility are one thing, but only when prominent athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks will things really start to change.
So far, these are only individual cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap is very popular right now, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
I started as a tutor at the Jedlička Institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intensive.
And as a musician myself, I play saxophone, among other things, I started a music company with a colleague.
And over time, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, says, it got a little out of control.
But the band didn't really get to the attention of the public until the last few years, or am I wrong?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us; in addition, we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We've come to realize that when you do something that you can't see from the outside, your own performance doesn't exist in some sense.
Thanks to EU funding, we can also afford good readers, high-quality equipment, etc.
Was it your goal to get this far with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt the potential to approach things differently.
In show business today, people often copy each other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is considered with caution and only accepted after a long time.
There are few really unique things, and I dare say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression the viewer usually has is, of course, pity; it's only natural...
But this pity is absolutely superfluous because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a full life if they have the means to do so.
I always say that when people with disabilities succeed, it's not just a progress for themselves, but for the whole society.
Was it helpful for this success that you were a strict boss, as you hear from many people?
If you want to do something well, you must not compromise on many things and you must also require some discipline.
But I think this is quite normal.
Some come to us with romantic performances, and when they find that they have rehearsals twice a week, they have to go through preparatory stages and spend a lot of time on concert tours, the excitement in many quickly fades.
But that's how it works everywhere, in every band that's serious about working and trying to get something done.
The Tap Tap currently has 20 members.
How many of these were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
There's only one, Lada Angelovic.
We're an open group, people come and go, and you can't stop that.
Anyone who has the will and the desire to join is always welcome.
Takes place the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday, December 20, 2012 at 9 p.m.
The venues are: Incheba-Arena/Prague, Fléda/Brno and Plynojem/Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
The three venues will be connected via live circuit and a common interpretation of the anthem "The End of the World is Falling Out" by The Tap Tap will be played.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the establishment of a multifunctional centre for learning with disabilities, to be set up under the name STUDEO at the Jedlička Institute in Prague.
Admission is 400 CZK, children up to 12 years old are free, tickets are available for pre-sale at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was admitted to the European Space Agency's 20th membership at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the ESA member countries, making it the second member country from the former Eastern bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland began working closely with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland's journey into space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, Polish cosmologists were interested in space travel, but they did not always understand it.
I remember, for example, the lecture given by A. Šternfeld at the Warsaw Observatory on 6 December 1933, in which the author presented ideas from his pioneering work "Entry to Cosmonautics".
However, the ideas of the young engineer (born 1905) left the audience cold, and after years Šternfeld still remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
In 1934 Šternfeld won the Prix REP-Hirsch, founded by Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch, for "Entrance into Cosmonautics".
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899-1966) later became an important proponent of astronomy and space travel.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomsky's world-renowned contribution to space travel was recognized, among other things, by the fact that one of the craters on the lunar surface was named after him.
In 1925, a railway drainage system was built in Poland, for which a rocket propulsion system was planned.
The author of the draft and the details of this project remain unknown.
It's not even clear whether the rocket should be used to launch or to brake the drill.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933, the Polish infantry began to deal with rocket-propelled shells.
The research was carried out by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
The documents submitted show that the research had progressed to the stage of practical testing.
The research was interrupted by the German invasion.
In 1937 the design of a photoelectric fighter missile by Ing. Rohoziński appeared in the trade press, and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by author Leliwa-Krzywoblocky appeared.
Both projects concerned the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of missile technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Committee Doradczo-Naukowy).
The Committee was set up in 1937, but after two years of work its work was terminated by the beginning of the war.
Further articles on space were published in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this society is found in the November 1954 issue of Problemy magazine, which devoted four extensive articles to space travel.
The article by Prof. M. Subotowicz contains the proposal to set up a space company.
At that time, the first satellite projects were already underway, and it was expected that space exploration would have a future.
Already from its inception in 1956, the Polish Space Agency PTA was seeking membership in the International Space Federation, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a full member in autumn 1956.
The following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became Vice-President of the International Federation for Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful Meteorological Missile (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish missile for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, with the first launch on 10 October 1958.
The rocket, with a maximum flight altitude of 1,800 m, was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later an improved version, the RM-1A, was built, and in 1959 flight tests began in the Błędów desert with the two-stage RM-2 rocket.
The rocket was 1.4 meters long and weighed about 11.5 kilograms.
A further stage of development should already be capable of providing real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach a flight altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for observing high winds.
However, further development was halted in 1962.
The successor to the first RM-type rockets was the Meteor-1 rocket developed between 1962 and 1965.
The missile was designed as a two-stage rocket, with a total length of 510 cm and a launch weight of 32.5 kg.
Three types of this missile were developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differed in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A rocket had a carrying capacity of 0.4 litres, the Meteor-1B 0.34 litres and the Meteor-1C 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude for all three types was 37 km.
Between 1965 and 1968, the Meteor-2 rocket was developed at the Aviation Institute, and its first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor-2 had a launch weight of 380 kg and was capable of carrying a payload of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
After that, the Meteor-2H and Meteor-3 versions were built.
It is also worth mentioning that Poland joined the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960, followed two years later by the creation of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in the Intercosmos programme in space exploration using Soviet satellites, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the law on nonprofit work is not the solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court struck down the law on nonprofit work.
This decision has sparked a lively debate in the public.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economic systems in the EU and the globalized world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
In the end, this means that the individual economies are in a permanent conflict with each other.
The reason for this is the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
The large differences in the value of labour (wages) lead to price tensions.
The term 'sub-competition' means a situation in which a producer tries to remain competitive by importing more favourable goods, thus 'sub-selling' the competition in order to gain a greater market share and increase its profit.
On a large scale, this means for most companies to move their production abroad or to buy cheaply there, or to abandon their business.
Since private capital has no social responsibility and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, public expenditure necessarily increases.
This situation is further exacerbated by the fact that the gentlemen of the business are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes and thereby to compensate for the economic and social damage they have caused to society as a whole.
This situation is well known, so that concrete statistics are superfluous at this point.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in individual economies where governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital to the country.
In other words, governments supply their own population with private capital regardless of the social consequences.
This is particularly evident in changes to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force the own population to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in the wage field.
This is done, firstly, by economic coercion in the event of longterm unemployment and, secondly, by the reduction of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as ever-growing disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany, public food shelters have been in place for some years for the poor who are no longer able to feed themselves by working.
The number of people affected is already in the millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regular cases where workers receive such low wages that the state has to raise their income to the subsistence minimum.
A similar scandal was also exposed in the case of aid workers employed in the German Bundestag.
The austerity measures in virtually all the southern EU countries will undoubtedly lead to the same situation where people are forced to emigrate under the pressure of a catastrophic drop in their social levels (as was the case in the 19th century) or to sacrifice for a hunger wage on the margins of society, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
The question naturally arises here: where does this capital come from?
If it comes from another EU country, it is simply poverty that moves from one country to another; or capital remains completely out of stock, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco or Egypt or even Africa, the workers work for a fraction of European wages.
This applies to all Latin America.
Liberal theories and media have argued to the extreme that the state cannot participate in its own economy with capital and that planning leads to economic disaster.
Private capital is narrowly insisting that the state must not interfere in the economy by inducing it.
But then one must ask whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and, therefore, the entire state in its own selfish sense.
Here's the clear answer: yes.
The evidence for this is the existence of a practically all-powerful lobby that is present in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual advantage, legislation where practically everything is punishable but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that a state ministry, due to lack of finances, is entrusting private law firms closely linked to industry with drafting legislation.
These bills are then passed by the Bundestag.
All violence will then no longer be carried out by the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but by powerful financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Clearly, liberal democracies are now rapidly entering a situation, as Appian describes in his book The Crisis of the Roman Republic in the Times of Caesar and Pompey: "The state has long been in decay, and the offices have been seized by force.
For bribes, for illegal profit-sharing, or with stone and sword.
Corruption grew unabated, and the people voted with already bought votes"... "People with character did not run for office, so that the state had no consul for eight months as a result of this decline"... "It was really beginning to be talked about that the only medicine in this difficult situation was monarchy, and that a strong man had to be elected"... Appian thought of Pompey, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who replaced democracy permanently with monarchy.
As it turns out, today's society, as in ancient times, is based on the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, without regard to the interests of society as a whole.
Private capital is by its very nature incapable of recognizing and enforcing the benefit to society as a whole.
The result, as it was then, is an unprecedented decadence of elites who are not in the least committed to profound reforms.
The reason for the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be found in the ruthless liberalization of economic systems in the 19th and 20th centuries.
The Commission has already taken a number of measures to ensure that the Community's financial resources are not used to finance the implementation of the budget.
Particularly catastrophic is the fact that today's elites are faced with complete ignorance of the possible loss of hundreds of thousands of lives in the future, the humanitarian and social disasters we are already witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know it from the old and recent history.
The repeal of the law on non-profit work is not a solution here, at least not permanent.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to reduce the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the state's capital contribution to the economy, increase the influence of citizens on the government and weaken the monopoly of private capital in society in favour of the state.
Israel: The lab of chaos.
"...that nothing comes from violence, or could ever come from it", Sting sings in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the chorus is, "...so we don't forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons didn't want war, there wouldn't be one", says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in 1849.
After the last wave of violence between Israel and Gaza, there were, as always, countless reactions.
The first is that the Palestinians are terrorists, while the other is that they support the Palestinians, that they are racist, that they are genocidal against Palestinian Arabs, and that they are terrorists.
I do not want to write here about who is responsible and who is the victim of these repeated waves of killing; in the end, the people of Israel today, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not experience the beginning of violence themselves.
I am concerned about opening the eyes of the reader behind the scenes, to see who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small country of the Middle East are most useful to.
My thoughts are based in part on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these facts and are based on my own understanding of who or what group of people has a significant influence on the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is primarily a history of the struggle for power.
In any era, we can make an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is whether these personalities were always the ones who were autonomous in determining their steps, or whether behind their throne was someone who was directing their actions toward a predetermined goal.
We must recognize that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of fewer individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the lifespan of a generation.
Among these astronomically rich families, one particularly prominent one that could be called the head of the crake (I don't know if there is anyone else over them, but I don't rule this out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about her.
I understand that.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds in the 1990s to disconnect their name from high-crime activities, which were always based on consolidating their power, increasing their wealth or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks in the world, and they wage wars or arm themselves against countries where they are not involved (before the invasion of Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the invasion of Iraq there were 5 countries, after the fall of Gaddafi there were only four remaining, while Russia has in the meantime subjected its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to stand up to this family had to pay with their lives.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild's Bank of America as the central bank, began issuing his own (i.e., state) banknotes during the Civil War, and was assassinated in a theater in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy began issuing his own notes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was assassinated in 1963; Congressman Louis Mc Fadden was poisoned in 1936 after he tried to sue the Fed for triggering the 1929 World Economic Crisis.
The Rothschilds' global ambitions for power led in 1859-71 to the formulation of a plan to unleash three world wars by Albert Pik, a Freemason of the 33rd and thus the highest degree of knowledge.
The first war was to eliminate the great monarchist states of Europe, the second war was to break Britain's colonial rule in particular, and the third war was to reduce the world population to about 0.5 - 1 billion people (a number that would provide for its conveniences and luxury and would not consume as many resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the precursor here) and finally lead to the takeover of absolute power.
The method by which the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top works is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
However, these solutions are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the creation of the Fed so that crises like those they triggered in 1907 do not repeat themselves).
After having succeeded in triggering World War I by assassinating Habsburg successor Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian Tsarist Empire by means of the Bolshevik Revolution.
World War I ended with the sudden, military and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian Tsarist Empire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European Great Power of Austria-Hungary.
To facilitate the outbreak of World War II, the bankers created a latent conflict situation by politically occupying Germany with gigantic war reparations, creating the conditions for impoverished masses, so that they had to undermine the Germans only by a sufficiently strong leader who offered the guilty to name and simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to assume the function of a fifth column and also to ignite the fires of war.
In the late 19th century, the Rothschilds initiated the establishment of the Zionist movement, in which a branch sought to establish a Jewish state, possibly on the historic territory of Judea with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The Balfour Declaration, as already mentioned, created the conditions for mass immigration of Jews to Palestine, and it brought about the first clashes with the Arab population.
There were terrorist attacks on both sides.
World War II broke out, and whether Hitler broke free from the chain that had initially kept him in the hands of international bankers or whether everything went according to plan is hard to estimate, but the suffering of European Jews in the concentration camps certainly created the conditions for the international community to recognize the Jewish state.
Israel was founded in 1948 and just as the war reparations against Germany laid the groundwork for World War II, the proclamation of the State of Israel is the creation of the focal point for World War III.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will be the victim in the front line, this time alongside the Arab or Muslim population of the Middle East, much like they were in World War II.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of conflict and chaos, not only within the country itself but also internationally (just think how much people divide into supporters and opponents of Israel).
Who is to blame and who is to blame for the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, where injustice only triggers injustice in an endless spiral of violence, beginning with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
We must distinguish between the people of Israel and their leaders, but the international bankers in Israel and we, the people, choose only their own candidates.
The current Israeli Prime Minister, Falke Netanyahu, is a typical example of a fascist-favorite, international bankers-loyal politician who is doing everything he can to start a war with Iran that, given Iran's membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan...), could quickly escalate into a global conflict, and could cause a devastation to the world economy because of Iran's control over the two-mile-wide Hormus Road, which runs over 20% of global oil supplies.
In what light do the words of David Rockefeller in 1994 come to pass: "All we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order".
In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world where the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world where every newborn is implanted with a chip at birth to put that being under total control.
"And it causes the little ones and the great ones, the rich and the poor, the free and the slave, all to put a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom: let the man of understanding consider the number of the beast.
For it is a man's number, and his number is six hundred and sixty-six".
The movie Argo: When the worst is over, call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of demonstrating Islamist students occupied the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and took 52 diplomats hostage.
They demanded the extradition of the deposed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled to the United States after the revolution, which had been patronizing his regime for decades.
The US government had no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have greatly damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to enforce the release of hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a major blow to the reputation of the United States, and the subsequent failure of the violent attempt to free hostages only made matters worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days of negotiations brokered by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages has sparked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiment at home.
The debate in Iran contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter's defeat of Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
Director and actor Ben Affleck's Argo depicts an episode of this story that gave the United States a small partial victory.
Six embassy staff managed to escape immediately before the embassy was occupied.
This ended after numerous complications at the Canadian ambassador's residence.
The CIA, in cooperation with the Canadian authorities, managed to get the refugees out of Iran, helping them to cover up their true identity with an extravagant story - they travelled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film crew who allegedly visited the country's filming grounds for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by Exfiltration expert Tony Mendez also required Hollywood to collaborate.
To make the cover credible, articles about this film project appeared in professional magazines, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have long been kept secret.
Affleck's film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand, it's a realistic political thriller, but at the same time, it's a so-called "Caper Movie", which is the story of a successful household act like the movie Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood levels in the film - on the one hand, the documentary scenes from Tehran (the title sequence shows iconic contemporary photographs, and there are no major differences in the filming of the same situations).
On the other hand, the loose passages from Hollywood, which are ironic and slightly overstated, come from that.
And then there are the scenes from CIA headquarters and other institutions-- men in suits at the meeting table, on the hallways, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable start to his career with this film.
From a mocked actor to a respected director, he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after Crime No Child's Play (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller City Without Mercy (2010).
At the same time, it's Affleck's first film not to be shot in the director's home town of Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that distinguished the director's previous films from the Hollywood standard.
Affleck, however, also proves this feeling in Argo, where Tehran is being "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film play out in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that really took place - the sequence of the message's storming is very impressive in its clarity, yet it conveys the sense of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team also have a similar effect on fictional scenes (the fake film staff at a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story doesn't actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
However, he is quite successful with the few, sometimes with a slightly more subtle effect on reality - which is not always so elegant (the scenes of a phone call to America to divert the impending crisis at Tehran airport or the chase at the runway are somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its overly broad scattering, which is due to the need to show too much action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their Hollywood roles, but their characters should have earned more space, and they are far from alone in the film.
Affleck's film loses some traction, and it's a film that you can follow with some interest, while also guessing the design and retro style of a 70s thriller.
But it is hard to get excited.
But it is sufficient as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive to this day and as proof of how far-fetched the ideas of the all-powerful and all-knowing secret services are.
Guidelines for blowing balloons, bananas and circuses
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which annually publishes a survey on the most absurd bank fees, decided this year to host the competition "The most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This idea was inspired by the recent EU plan to introduce a 40% female share in the management of major European companies", Patrik Nacher, who is responsible for organising the survey, told Právo.
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the protection of workers' rights.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they represented an objective lower risk to the insurance companies.
"More incredible findings from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place by the end of February 2013", Nacher said.
The controversial EU regulations include the binding mixing of bioethanol with fuels that are harmful to nature, the prohibition of reliable mercury thermometers because they contain relatively little of this hazardous substance, and the Directive on the size of chicken cages, which has made eggs significantly more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism has also been levelled against the actual prohibition of the use of the term 'butter spray' or the prohibition on the sale of conventional bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under the pressure of one or another trade and industrial lobby whose claims in Brussels are usually represented by one or more Member States (for example, the Czech Republic is currently trying to enforce the claims of Czech banks even with a veto threat).
Lobby interests also held that bananas of the highest commercial class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and not have a 'curvature anomaly'.
The European Commission defended itself by arguing that it merely harmonised the non-uniform national standards that would hamper trade.
The EU has already softened the standards on fruit and vegetables against resistance from some countries, noting that previous directives would lead to food waste.
A candidate for the victory in this survey may be the EU regulation of last year, which, according to balloon sales, must state that children under the age of eight are not allowed to blow the balloon without the supervision of an adult.
The EU cited an American study which, according to balloons, is the leading cause of childhood death by suffocation.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to 14 years of age when using annual market strawberries.
Curious incidents happen at home too
The Commission has also proposed a directive on the protection of the environment, which is intended to protect the environment and the environment.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com, in cooperation with the Association of Liberal Economists, nominated the EU regulation on the amount of food stocks in the territory of a Member State in addition to the absurdities.
The EU thus set the maximum amount of food stocks that could be in the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our accession to the EU.
For example, the Czech Republic may have exceeded the fixed volume of mushroom preserves, for which we were subject to a high fine.
The survey organizers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of granting grants for grant applications.
These ideas did not, of course, come from Brussels, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by the lack of a sea.
We will ask the EU for a refund", declared the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD), in autumn 2004.
He argued that the cereal crop was very high and that the state stock was overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic may have another way to the seaports, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros, according to Palace.
The European Commission finally met the Czech Republic and organised a tender for the purchase of cereals from countries without access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development (USD) under the chairmanship of Minister Pavel Němec (USDEU) offered the municipalities funding for grant applications, specifically to finance the submission of grant applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations are easily the target of criticism in the Member States, some experts believe that the EU's efforts to regulate and thus to improve the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserve more recognition.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, is the EU funding for projects which have nothing in common with deepening European integration but which have been forced on by individual Member States during budgetary negotiations.
The Czech Republic, like other Member States, is also in Brussels fighting for the right to use specific names for traditional products, and it does not always win this fight.
Although the Czech Republic was able to defend the name 'Olomoucké tvarůžky', the traditional name for the indigenous rum (Tuzemský rum) which dates back to the 19th century, after six years of fighting with Germany and Austria, our manufacturers had to rename it 'Tuzemák'.
The name rum may only be used for products derived from sugarcane distillate, not for products derived from sugar beets.
The official list of products registered in the EU includes the world-famous Feta and Gorgonzola cheeses, the Lübeck Marzipan or Parma-Skinkin, the Karlsbad Zwieback, the Pohořelice and Třeboň carp, and the Saazer hop.
The EU brand can be used to make Pardubicer cake or Hořicer rolls.
"People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur", Okamura says.
Senator, how do you get the idea to run for president?
I'm not interested in being a senator or president.
If everything worked out in our country without problems, I wouldn't run for office.
But I can't stand to watch the Republic being plundered for 20 years, thieves running around while people are raising taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambitions of becoming a politician.
But if I see something I don't like, I try to suggest a solution to change that.
And since I'm over 40, and independent and nonpartisan, I have no other way to influence things than to run for senator or president.
You made it to the Senate and then you made your way to the castle.
Are you not turning your backs on your constituents?
I've been telling myself I'm gonna start the fight for the castle after the Senate election.
Later, I clarified this and said that if I was elected senator, I would run for president.
But my goal is not function, function is an instrument that I can use to realize my visions.
I need as much influence and a strong mandate as possible.
The problem is that we, as a people, not only insult people in the pub and in front of the TV, but we also insult anyone who wants to change.
The media, which want to rob you of your honor, confuses freedom of speech with freedom to lie.
For example, I was alleged to bribe journalists or to be a consultant to Jiří Paroubek.
Let's talk about your visions.
You started the battle for the castle with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians and with retroactive declarations of assets of over 20 million crowns.
You're gonna have to change the laws.
As President, you have no powers in this regard, and only the Senate as a whole can make legislative proposals.
How do you plan to solve this problem?
As a simple citizen, I have been committed to keeping the tour guide a free trade, and this has been enforceable.
The problem is the petty politics - when someone from the right or from the left comes with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent nonpartisan, I have a much greater potential to win support from all the parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that without any drawer thinking or party ideology, I can take away from any party what is best for our country.
Do you see yourself as a human being in politics more to the right or to the left?
From a Czech perspective, I think people tend to see me on the left.
But for me, this right-left thinking is completely irrelevant.
It's important to me that we move on.
I don't care if anyone is on the left or the right; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good approach to solutions, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You don't like being called a populist.
But don't you confirm that by what you just said?
When you're setting up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And that's the one you want to approach.
I think this is what you might call populism, but all the proposals I have spoken about are already working in the world or have been discussed by important experts.
But without parliamentary support, you're just a slur.
And that's not going to get you far in politics in the long run.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you can enforce material and criminal liability?
I have no choice.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them to join us in pursuing these goals.
As President, I would have no problem in asking the chairmen of the parliamentary parties to be televised live to make the material and criminal liability of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors legal.
And the respondents would then have to say why they refuse.
A strong personality who points to abuse can exert pressure on the political scene.
Take just one direct election of the president, which was a merit of public pressure.
I'm not a genius, I'm not an intellectual.
I'm trying to find allies for my views and visions.
I have just started politics and I am trying to get the majority support for my programme.
I always try to judge things for myself, and if it doesn't work, I'll be back in the private sector in six years.
It sounds a little like Okamura is supposed to save the Czech Republic.
I'm not a saviour.
I know I can't do anything on my own, so I've talked to several celebrities about whether they want to run for the Senate.
I have spoken with Radim Jančura, for example, but he refused because of his overwork.
I also supported investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who uncovered the fraud in the light heating oil trade.
I started my candidacy on the premise that people were deeply dissatisfied, but now I'm not sure.
Sixty percent of those eligible did not go to the polls at all, and those who did did did most of the time vote for the establishment.
That makes us two independents in the Senate.
People have elected such a Senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
I'll still fight for my visions, like direct election of mayors and district leaders.
Are you thinking about starting your own party?
I haven't thought about it yet because I don't have time to check the past of every potential party member, and I don't even have the money to do it.
I don't even have money for the presidential campaign yet; I only have 20,000 CZK in my transparent account.
You don't have any money?
You're talking about the estate statements, what did yours look like?
I estimate my personal wealth at about 60 million CZK.
In Prague, I have a property worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, and an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Skoda Superb worth about a million.
The Aston Martin was a childhood dream, by the way. I always liked James Bond, driving in the car, being gallant with women and fighting evil at the same time.
You drive an Aston Martin, you have a fortune of 60 million and you have no money for your campaign?
You say you want to change the republic, but you don't want to invest your own money in it.
That's not exactly convincing.
I don't have 15 million for the campaign.
You want me to go into debt?
I've already put $2.5 million into the campaign.
The fact that I don't have sponsors shows that my program probably doesn't get much interest.
And I'm not obligated to fight the campaign on my own.
The campaign costs are basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I couldn't live off the senator's salary alone, so I couldn't finance my son's English school, which costs 30,000 a month.
If I only wanted to make money, I wouldn't run for anything.
So you're still an entrepreneur to make a living?
Didn't you say you were going back to these activities?
But that's not about the salary.
As promised, I've partially recovered my activities.
For example, my deputy will become the travel agent's managing director in the spring.
People want me to be the Samaritan who saves the republic.
But I have to live off something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
About 200,000 to 400,000, and that's still the case.
As President, however, I would completely cease my business.

The MVRDV architects prove that true adventures are not just in the mind - like the showcase and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
"I find the building fun, it looks futuristic, and finally there's something interesting to see again", says Lisette Verhaig, a roadside passerby.
And Stefan Spermon, an IT technician at a large nearby company, says, "Well, it's nice, the house".
But I wonder what we need a library for today.
Everyone has the Internet, iPad and e-books.
No one volunteers to go to any of these old-style libraries today, right?
Spijkenisse, a sleeping town that barely needs to be visited outside the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000-member community has the lowest education rate in the whole of the Netherlands.
To counter this stupidity, a few years ago it was decided to contribute to general education and to rebuild the seven fictional bridges on the euro banknotes as beautifully polished concrete steel miniatures.
The success of the education campaign was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to master statistics: a library!
Winy Maas of the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of the brilliant balcony diagrams and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with a conventional calm and appeared at the competition hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury was still gazing around and nodding its armpits, the feeble Maas piled up his elegant portrait of greatness to a pyramid and finished his action-backed speech with the words, "Dear Town Hall!"
So this is it, my proposal for the bookberg of comic strips, for the so-called bookberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain is being poured out.
It is part of a revitalization project that includes a garage, a supermarket, a post office and a few adjacent residential and rowhouses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project was also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This is the faceless small town town that has so far had nothing more to offer than a postmodern pedestrian zone and a stunningly ugly town hall, behind whose white façades one would tend to speculate a dairy factory to enrich a piece of contemporary architecture.
Specifically, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to the Book
First impression: book editing under a cheese bell.
While there is an elevator that leads through the middle of the mountain range, true enjoyment of space and reading is revealed when you walk up the topography.
The glass-lined interior is bright and clear, the burned-out clockwork floor and the elegant street lamps speak the language of a public square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
You're already looking for park bench, dog and boys and girls playing football.
And everywhere there are books, books, books.
"Usually, the bookshelves are along the facade, and in the middle is a large, dark room, usually uncomfortable and impersonal", says Winy Maas.
We've turned the classical room configuration upside down and stitched the reading area from the inside out.
The interior of the library is well-used: in the center are offices, an Internet library, a chess club, an environmental center and a home technology center.
A special delight are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall coverings, sometimes chest covers, sometimes staircases.
Optics, touch and smell are foreign.
Even skilled architects and civil engineers shake their heads over the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here", explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the municipality of Spijkenisse, at the standard's request.
And so we came across a suitable agricultural waste product one day on a farm in Friesland.
For many years in the Netherlands, a millimetre-thin plastic sheet has been used as a rootstock in greenhouses and fields.
It's cheap and time-efficient.
The thin fabric lasts two seasons, then it's ripe for the garbage.
For the library, the sheet was pressed to four centimeters thick plates for the first time in this quantity.
Under heat and pressure, the so-called land-based plastic (LFP) discolors into a dark, homogeneous, resistant material that smells like a bisel for new cars and a bisel for sports shoes.
After 105 steps, you've reached the summit.
At the end of the nearly 500-meter trek, the literature cafe will reward you not only with a fantastic view of the city but also with Dutch croquettes and embellished fig trees.
They provide atmosphere, but above all, they provide the right humidity in the literature mountains.
Donations for the New Soul
"You wouldn't believe it, but this house is an example of ecological design despite its many glass surfaces", says Trouborst.
Heated and cooled by geothermal heat.
Although the Bookerberg is under a glass collapse, the sun itself shines only briefly inward on sunny days.
The broad wooden glue bands that stand across from the glass facade serve as shade and capture much of the sun's radiation.
The room climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic rolls.
Stefan Spermon, the early sceptic in the IT industry, was already venturing into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was already there.
And so does TCM teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who calls the Boekenberg the "most obsolete soul" of the concert scene.
The reason: At the opening a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
This will fill the gaps in the library, which is currently 70,000 pieces, which are not yet fully equipped.
The concept has been developed.
The shelves are full upstairs.
"Nothing is worse than a half-liture library", says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that thanks to our invitation, every resident now has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that their book is part of this building.
And if it's just for the jewelry.
This has led MVRDV to the royal discipline known in the specialist jargon as identity foundation.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as she may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans need to play a bigger role"
Germany voted in favour of the accession of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on U.S.-European relations, Berlin balances this on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany initially signaled that it would vote against the request for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin was in the dark.
Why? Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
But now Germany must be careful because of its special relationship with Israel.
But at the same time, I don't think it supports the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - but without being too critical of Israel.
During the March 2011 uprising in Libya, Germany also abstained from voting when it was asked to establish a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Does Germany find it difficult to take a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that's right.
This is because it is now converting its foreign policy away from a policy that is, as it were, managed by the United States into a German foreign policy.
The European Union is not a single country, but it is a country that is not a single country.
The Germans are now between the fronts.
They're expected to play a more independent role, but they're not used to it.
I think they are still working on their role, but they are on the way to a more "normal" foreign policy.
A foreign policy like France or Britain.
What is the meaning of a "normal" foreign policy from the German point of view?
It is willing to take positions that are independent of those of the United States or European partners in the interests of national interests.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, that is, by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany's economic interests are to some extent different from those of the other great powers and therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the attitude in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
Firstly, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
So we must be careful not to put the public, but also the elites in the Arab countries, in the head.
That certainly does matter.
But I wouldn't want to put too much weight on that either, because that's not a one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German thinking.
Did Germany damage its relations with the United States by abstaining from voting on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe that in Europe and even in the United States there is a great understanding of the German position.
I therefore do not believe that this was a dramatic break as in the Libyan question.
Perhaps Germany will even gain some respect.
Because it signals that as an international player, he needs to be taken seriously and his interests taken into account.
There are different opinions in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The United States, on the other hand, has clearly voted for a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the United States and many European nations?
Because of American domestic policy, these differences have always existed.
I think the Obama administration has a pretty good understanding of the European position.
But given the political situation here, the government cannot, of course, publicly represent this position.
I think the actual differences of opinion are not as great as they always seem.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not so enthusiastic about Netanyahu's policies.
Does Germany find it difficult to agree on its close relations with Israel and the United States on the one hand and the position of the most important partners in the EU on the other?
I think that's what makes it so hard for the Germans.
It would be a little easier for the Germans, of course, if there were a coherent and uniform European policy, which is not the case at the moment.
So they can't be part of a broader line and instead have to push things from their own position.
They're doing that with the euro.
I believe that in the future Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe towards a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, of course, because of its relationship with Israel.
It's always been a sensitive subject.
But I think the Germans are aware that they need to play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself as an important international player in the role - does Germany want to take a leading role at all?
Or is Germany still a difficult leader?
Germany is not yet used to this, which is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it is still difficult for it to play a larger role.
The European Parliament has also been able to make a number of proposals to the Council.
It's not easy for the Germans.
That's the old problem, actually: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
Germany is in a much more difficult position than the United States.
It must be responsive to the widest possible range of neighbors and opinions, and that's not easy.
Now the influence of the United States in European politics is continually declining, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment, who else is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a bigger role.
Even if they don't like it, they feel uncomfortable and it makes them much less popular - c'est la vie!

"Trade mark protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-renowned brand, Polo Ralph Lauren is one too.
But what is Armani Polo?
The Commission therefore considers that the Commission should be able to determine whether the measures in force are compatible with the internal market.
Nevertheless, it enjoys protection as long as the actual namesake does not complain.
And even then, it's not clear if they're right.
"It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China", says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the Taylor Wessing law firm specializing in protectionist infringements in the Far East.
Every week, a new case lands on my desk.
Followers will need a few extra letters to register their trademarks.
So Gucci is just Lu-Gucci, and instead of Prada, you can just put Prada-Kny in.
This is also legal for German companies, such as the sportswear manufacturer Puma.
Pattloch opens a folder with trademark records in Beijing.
On 14 September 2010, a Chinese company registered the Zegna DF Puma trademark, an art name also used by Ermenegildo Zegna.
It's well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and injured intellectual property.
In the big cities, there are multi-storey shops that sell almost exclusively counterfeits.
However, Pattloch's case is different: on behalf of his clients, he claims that Chinese companies are officially granted the right to use a name that is already protected elsewhere by the Trademark Office.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a passenger trademark.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
I mean, women who are fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"This is harmful to business, we have to fight it", demands Pattloch.
"The brand is watered, the loneliness is gone, the image damage is enormous".
The financial and legal costs of the industries concerned are in the millions, especially for expensive examples.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods with a volume of EUR 15 billion per year.
However, the deletion of dubious trademark entries is difficult to achieve and costs money.
The procedure can take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports on cases in which the court dismissed complaints because after a long period of time the name in question had become 'true market'.
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he may even have to pay the plagiarist money for violating his trademark in China, Pattloch says.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a legal dispute with the construction machinery manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putsmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use a logo that resembles the Mercedes-Star to this day.
Volvo buyer Geely originally used a blue and white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
Fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to Hong Kong and Singapore imitators who turned the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The CTMO trademark office in Beijing admits that there were shortages there in 2010 due to low staff and space facilities.
Last year, however, the "working situation has returned to normal".
The number of unprocessed opposition proceedings has therefore fallen by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 such cases have been completed, 75 percent more than last year.
Nevertheless, the Office still has 81,500 objections pending resolution.
But it costs a lot to do that.
As is often the case in China, the numbers are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1,4 million applications for trademark protection, almost a third more than in 2010.
This is a record and means that China is making the list of new registrations worldwide for the tenth time in a row, the authority said.
The same applies to the stock of all the valid trade marks, totalling 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1,8 billion yuan were levied.
Simply put, the average cost of each application is 1280 yuan, or 160 euros.
The cost of tackling this problem is manyfold, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarist.
The Germans did manage to get its illegal manufacture of imitated motor vehicle parts out of the way.
However, the impersonator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
This was also overlooked, since family names could not be protected in Germany, says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of the board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The CTMO trademark office rejected the objection of the Munichers.
In the next two instances, Freudenberg was right, but the prosecution continues to fight to this day.
You gotta be careful
Now the matter is pending before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident that the case will be brought to a good conclusion and commends the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely costly and takes a lot of time, money, and energy".
The internal costs were hardly quantifiable, and the company archives even had to look through hundreds of years old files to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side a "high six-figure euro" to settle in vain.
"That's what you see", says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are threatening to spill over into Europe.
That's when imitators get unprotected marks.
A Chinese manufacturer in Germany wanted to register the name Freudenberg for shoes and leather.
The Group has long since abandoned this business, but it was able to withdraw its registration.
"You have to be careful", says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but rather, as Wentzler says, foreigners should "register anything that is somehow protected in China".
Otherwise, it could be much more expensive than registering.
In fact, if Freudenberg fails in the final act of his brand-name drama, the other party may have to pay royalties for his name, explains Wentzler.
Or we're being pushed out of the market in the segment in question.
World Day of the Dead: Stomping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg, the choir is rehearsing the Imbongi - and in Swaziland, AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The story of a connection that spans more than 8,733 kilometers.
First, there's the stamping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' pumps and men's slippers on the parquet floor, looking for the beat, finding it fast.
One, two, three, four.
Then the singers' voices - alt, bass, tenor and soprano - slowly swell, deceiving and stalking each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost pulls it off his fabric shoes when he combines them with his smooth, wild gestures.
It's Monday night, in the music room of the Institute of Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the Imbongi Choir is rehearsing a new song.
The 50 singers, aged 23 to 69, ranged from the human geneticist to the housewife.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, each choral voice has a different text and it is also in a very foreign language: Zulu, spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and parts of Swaziland.
Self-help
There are about 34 million people living with HIV worldwide, according to the UN AIDS Programme.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV positive.
For 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Estjeni, Voices for Africa found a father in Germany.
70 of them go to secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month, you can get a sponsorship.
She guarantees the child school money, school uniform and a hot meal every day at Gogo Center.
Imbongi means storyteller or praiser in Zulu.
No one can speak the bantus fluently in this room, but sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign soft language, occasionally bringing them back to where they originated: South Africa.
Because 8,733 kilometres of airline from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Estjeni, which depends on the voice power of the German choir.
Forty percent are infected
Some 2,000 people live there, some in simple clay and straw huts, most of them children.
More than 300 of them have no parents because they are infected with the HIV virus.
In Estonia, the disease is the smallest in the whole of Swaziland: the highest HIV infection rate, the lowest life expectancy in the world, according to UNICEF.
Men's foreskin circumcision, which has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, is hardly accepted by the general population.
More than 40 percent of Swaziland's population is infected with the virus, and deaths in their mid-30s are not uncommon.
On a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but most of all, the Imbongis saw many children on the streets who lacked not only parental care but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a degree, you have no chance in a poor country.
At first, it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to provide him with a warm meal a day.
But a year later, the choir founded the association Voices for Africa, which has since become a professional caregiver for AIDS orphans in Estjeni.
Facts about sexually transmitted infections
What are the most important sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral STIs are HIV, human papillomaviruses, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Flea and scratch are parasitic STIs.
Who are the main groups affected?
Syphilis and trippers are most common in men who have sex with men.
The Robert Koch Institute estimates that at least four out of five reported cases of syphilis in Germany are transmitted by sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia infections, trichomoniasis, candidiasis (fungus), trips and human papillomaviruses are common sexually transmitted diseases.
HIV prevalence among heterosexual adults in this country is relatively low - yet about 20 percent of new HIV infections are in this group.
Chlamydia infections are much more common among adolescents than in other populations.
According to European surveys, three quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In addition, human papillomaviruses are common in young people in this country.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are required to be reported.
According to the Robert Koch Institute, the number of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
The number of new HIV infections has been declining since 2007.
In 2011, there were about 2,700 cases.
That's about a tenth less than the year before.
What are the symptoms of a sexually transmitted disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, urinary disorders, discharge, abdominal pain, and blisters or warts.
However, they often do not cause pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How can you protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not provide 100% protection.
In part, sexually transmitted diseases can be transmitted through lubricant infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially for frequently changing sex partners.
Early diagnosis can cure most STIs and prevent late consequences.
Through sponsorships, donations and, not least, the gigs that the choir sings throughout Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent some €200,000 to Estjeni", says Annette Lennartz, the association's president.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and forceful woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also makes sure that the orphans are well-settled, like one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women are called in Zulu, are the mainstays of the village.
Some have taken up to 14 orphans with them, giving them a roof over their heads, and making sure that the children in their uniforms arrive on time for school each day.
If you have no one left, you go to the shelter to see Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the association just as much as the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, Voices for Africa has started a sewing school, built two chicken houses, and, together with the American health organization PSI, organized a HIV test for many in the village.
This is not a matter of course, because no matter how obvious the disease is all over the country, you prefer to keep it quiet.
A King With 14 Wives
"AIDS is a taboo", says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality".
It's actually strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is this state-sanctioned way of life that has caused the HIV virus to spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus across the country.
Free condoms are available at every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are rarely used.
Culture is different - flesh to flesh".
To encourage cultural exchange, the Imbongi Choir travels together through South Africa every two or three years, singing songs of fervor, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence that many on the southern tip of the black continent have known since apartheid.
A bus full of white people singing in a black language - so much recognition brings not only mood and joy, but has also shed some tears on some grim border soldiers.
The journey always leads to Estjeni, where the singers visit their stepchildren.
Although the small village is hardly found on maps, it is more than well known in the valley of the Ezuluni River.
"Go to Estjeni, there is light", the people there say.
And when you go back to the 8,733-kilometer airline to Heidelberg, to the thumping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Street, you see it glowing there too.
Messenger: NASA is detecting ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 meters thick.
The US space agency NASA has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, it also has frozen water, as three studies published in the journal Science showed on Thursday.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the permanently shadowed region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets or perhaps asteroids that hit Mercury.
But no one is linking the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
But the findings could help to explain how water and other building blocks of life reached other parts of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the Earth's inhabitants, probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time, they send images to Earth, tiny holes in infinite space.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, plus the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the International Astronomical Union's new definition in 2006.
This infrared image taken by the Spitzer Telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue dots, the pinkest "newborns" in the constellation are harder to identify.
This star-forming region - unromantically called W5 by scientists - has been discovered by the Spitzer telescope in the constellation Cassiopeia, 6,500 light-years away.
This glowing glow of a dying star has been captured by NASA's Spitzer Telescope.
The donut-shaped ring is made of material that the star ejected in the dying process.
In the huge trifide nebula, 5,400 light-years away from Earth, new stars are being formed from gas and dust.
NASA's Spitzer Telescope took this photo of the galactic birthplace.
The Pleiadian constellation, also called the "Seven Sisters", can be seen by the naked eye at night.
But with the telescope, the colors are better.
Like a red age, the Helix Nebula looks at the viewer in this infrared photo.
It's 700 light-years away in the constellation Aquarius.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent gave this nebula the title North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photography creates the spectacular coloration.
This baby star was only able to be captured in its full beauty by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer telescope.
Saturn and its rings: how these came to be is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and most powerful images of the Hubble telescope: the Whirlpool Galaxy
Depending on the color, images of spiral galaxies become works of art.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid Nebula several thousand light-years away in the constellation Schütze.
The name trifide comes from the Latin word trifidus (triple, tripartite), since dark dust strips divide the glowing heart of the birthplace of stars.
In the constellation Snake, astronomers photographed the forerunners of a cosmic carambalage: 400 million light-years away from Earth, the cores of two merging galaxies are colliding with each other and will inevitably collide.
This star birth was recorded by the Hubble Telescope in the spiral galaxy M83.
If you don't have technical abbreviations, you might call it the Southern Fire Wheel.
The Hubble Space Telescope photo shows a slice of the iris nebula in the constellation Kepheus.
The fog, 1,400 light-years away, is made up of dust grains that are ten to a hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images taken by different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes 430 million light-years away from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
The larger spiral galaxy is called UGC 1810.
This nebula contains the brightest group of young stars in our Milky Way.
The Star Trek is always producing new youngsters.
Also, this stellar cloud, combined with the Rosette Nebula, is continuously producing new baby stars - 5,000 light-years from Earth.
In this bright galaxy with a small black hole, there is no dust, only gas.
Researchers suspect that it did not form until shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was the dominant source of energy in the universe.
Our insights into space: The most important telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for star observation a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have grown larger and deeper, providing more insight.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego was the world's largest telescope.
The mirror in this picture was an average of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to look into space through two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canarias on the Canary Islands of La Palma is enormous - the mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the cheap design is that the telescope is fixed at its angle of height - and therefore limited in its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed at the high angle.
Its peculiarity is its high light-collecting power.
This is because, despite its comparatively small mirror diameter, it reaches the world's largest mirror telescope.
Using a radio telescope in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, researchers are listening for alien signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
In Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI), any computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the European Observatory of the Stars (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
Here's the Very Large Telescope, which is honoring its name.
With a total of four mirrors, the telescope can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also planned at the ESO Observatory in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to be 42 metres high and be composed of nearly 1,000 mirror elements.
But images are expected in early 2018.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors, each averaging ten meters.
The Keck telescopes are part of the Mauna-Kea Observatory, which is still looking up at the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTTF.
A new, huge telescope is also to be built on Mauna Kea - with a mirror average of thirty meters.
It's amazing on an illustration here.
But the most important space images are from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since 24 April 1990, it has been providing images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler space telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - primarily habitable ones.
On February 2, 2011, NASA announced that 1235 planetary candidates had been identified since the mission began.
The image documents the latest launch preparations by the Kepler space telescope.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched into space as early as 2018 aboard an Ariane5 rocket.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
One of the telescope's tasks is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists believe that ice also exists at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data for this, as the Messenger orbits the planet much closer to the North Pole.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
With the Messenger probe launched in 2004 - the first to orbit Mercury - scientists are now certain.
Drinking butter every day and living to be 168
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible-based age.
There's even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach a Bible-based age.
There's even a museum for longevity.
A trace search in the country where 97-year-olds are still relatively young.
The journey through the Talysch Mountains is wildly romantic.
The minibus is roaring along the curved road, past dense forested hills, rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you're in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
The Caucasian Italian people live here, of whom little is known except that they speak Persian and Azerbaijani perfectly and are very long-lived.
The terminus is Lerik.
The small town boasts of over-ripe Soviet-era architecture that doesn't fit the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, too difficult to drive from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.
It takes eight hours to run the 323 kilometers because the road is only one-way.
The fabulous wealth the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva, 48, is convinced that Lerik has the stuff for tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Contest - and next year we have a festival of the world's oldest people here", says Fatulayeva.
She's the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is the Vita documented by about eight dozen Italians from the area, older than 100, Fatulayeva pointing to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he turned 120.
Another child born at the age of 136
But the museum's controversial star is Shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168.
But there is no birth certificate.
And given the oldest documented person, who lived to be 122, Mussulmoff's age seems highly questionable.
"He was born here in 1805, he died in 1973", Fatulayeva explains.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, and at the age of 136 he is said to have given birth to another daughter.
So, at his age, did Şirali Muslumov count himself a few decades?
But Rembrandt Scholz, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has also heard of the high-ranking people in Central Asia.
"Strikingly, there are also many elderly people in some parts of China, Japan, or the Hunza Valley in Pakistan", says Scholz, "and in Sardinia there are also extremely many very old men".
However, there was no scientific evidence of age due to lack of documentation, especially since personal status records were lacking.
Daily, probably melted butter
The fact is that the people of the area around Lerik often reach a Bible age.
There are currently 20 people who are over 100 years old.
So why are there so many elderly people living here in the South?
Assyrian travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talians.
The museum's director, Fatulayeva, believes that the food is the main reason.
But the idea that the Italian diet should be so healthy, that they love meat, bread and, above all, dairy products, and that many of them drink a glass of butter every day, does not seem plausible from a nutritional standpoint.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? In Cengemiran, a tiny settlement near the city of Lerik, lives Rubaba Mirzayeva.
At 97 years old, she is still relatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She's sitting on the floor with a butter jar that rolls her around tirelessly.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva's sons and a daughter, both of whom are grandparents.
Two little kids are jumping around, too.
In the kitchen, guests are served tea in the typical belly-shaped armadu cups.
Mirzayeva's white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under her head covering she hides long, dark blonde braces that her son proudly reveals to us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so it never went out and kept its color.
"I never used shampoo either", Mirzayeva says.
Monthly pension is enough for life
She always ate only what came from her own yard, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
In my whole life, I haven't bought food at the supermarket once.
Then she tells me about her husband, who was in the army.
The worst was in the post-World War II period.
But things got better when "beloved father" Heydar Aliyew took over.
Propaganda sounds strange from an old woman's mouth.
But the cult that is driven by the nation's father figure, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows little about borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
At least there is no need among Azerbaijan's elders.
The Commission has also proposed that the Commission should take into account the fact that the Commission has not yet adopted a proposal for a regulation on the implementation of the Community's budget.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's long-gray son is right: "The elderly are held in high esteem in our culture".
They live in the midst of a large family, are loved, cared for, and happy.
If that's not a reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival demonstrations in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution based on Sharia law is highly controversial.
The Egyptian president didn't spare Pathos.
We have to make the transition.
"And that it succeeds is my responsibility, to the people and to God", he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but probably to the Christian Copts, the liberals, the enlightened Muslims, and the secularists.
Because all of them, who have been hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a god-state on the Nile, of the graces of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
He, Morsi said, almost apologizing, temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and expanded its powers "to save the revolution".
But what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save, the Egyptians are worried about, the world is not quite clear about.
Do you want the judgments revoked?
In fact, the 234 articles that were whipped by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a 15-hour nightly parkour strike are partly cause for concern.
As in previous constitutions, the draft law states that the case law is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what do you mean "principles"?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the legal scope to make the Sharia more rigorous.
This is suggested by at least one newly added article: in all matters relating to Sharia law, Al-Ashar University should be drawn to the attention of the country's most important Islamic institution with a strong influence in all Sunni Islam.
It doesn't have to, but it could mean the clergy are overseeing the legislation, which would de facto result in the revocation of the judgments.
Much of the draft constitution is a matter of interpretation
The problem is that civil military justice must continue to be maintained.
These courts were used during Mubarak's reign to suppress opposition.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were imprisoned by the military.
The draft also says that the state should "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family" and "promote its morals and values".
This is so legally vague that government institutions could use this article to control the content of film and literature.
In plain text, it means nothing but censorship.
There is no article that explicitly states the equality of men and women.
Another forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what an insult is and how it should be punished remains unclear.
The wording of "insulting people" is also doubtful.
Is a caricature of the president or a joke enough to cost a lawyer?
The Commission has already decided to take a decision on the proposal for a directive on the protection of the environment.
"The revolution is back"
The opposition has been building up against the Islamists' superiority for weeks.
Tens of thousands of people gathered in unusual unison on Friday evening in Cairo's Tahrir Square and vowed to topple the charter before it can take effect.
"The revolution has returned and we will win", said Hamdin Sabbahi, third-place candidate in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El-Baradei said the draft constitution was "on the trash of history".
He accused the followers of Morsi of wanting to lead a "coup against democracy" via short-term news service Twitter.
"If he calls for a referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him", said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not tired yet, the blood of our brothers is not yet washed", Egyptian media quoted opposition politician Chaled Ali as saying.
And several judges announced that they would not want to monitor the referendum, which would invalidate it.
"The Qur'an is our constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood, for their part, blew a counter-demonstration, but not on Tahrir Square, but after a mass prayer on the other Nilufer outside Cairo University.
Many disguised women and Salafists joined in, shouting: "The people demand the application of God's law".
They demanded from Mursi, "Purify the land!" and they insisted, "The Koran is our constitution".
A struggle for supremacy over the symbolic Tahrir Square, where it all began, would have probably sparked civil warlike conditions.
Morsi's followers obviously didn't want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that both the opponents and supporters of the draft constitution had spoken out loud and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box which way the country should go.
A majority for the Islamists' draft is considered safe.
"The word human rights does not even come up"
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry about this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to last until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and chairman of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EHRO) defended the Muslim Brotherhood when they were in prison or in court under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because he considers human rights indivisible.
He was beaten, convicted, imprisoned for it.
"And now the word 'human rights' is not even in the new constitution", he lamented in an interview with the World on Sunday.
Morsi's expansion of power to all three powers in the state caused the lawyer to resign.
These measures are flagrant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President de facto abolishes it", Saeda complained.
But without civil society organizations, a democracy cannot function.
Saeda feels alone, even by the international community, which views the ideological struggle for direction on the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
It could be revenge.
A Tahrir protester warns, "You are carrying a monster you can no longer control".
Norway rakfisk: Is that the most stinking fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest standards of living - not only in Europe but in the whole world.
Could the secret of the country's success have anything to do with the local appetite for rather nasty fish?
You take a selection of overripe cheeses.
You put them in the middle of a pile of dirty, wet sportswear.
And leave them there for a week.
This is how you can imagine the nasal smell of rakfisk, one of Norway's great delicacies.
I'm in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There's snow, spectacular scenery, and this stubborn smell in the air that just doesn't want to go away.
Rakfisk is a salt-coated trout that is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how badly the fish is smelled.
When the country gets dark in Norway and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a party here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, well, really very subtle specialty.
"You eat it raw and then you wash it down with a glass of aquavit", says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works for the local fire department but also hosts the festival as the "Rakfisk General".
People around us eat small fish cubes and drink large amounts of alcohol.
"Many people like the aquavit more than the shrimp", says Havard.
The liquor can displace the smell.
I'm going to eat some chips.
If you avoid bringing the rakfish near your nose, it's not bad - like sushi, which has a pretty long bus ride behind it.
Rakfisk is the product of a very different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling facilities and fish were watered in airtight saltwater jars in the autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was then removed after a long fermentation and - undoubtedly under the influence of alcohol - consumed.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and they migrated mainly to the United States.
Today, the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a thriving labour market, high wages and comprehensive health care.
Even from Sweden, the old rival, which was far richer than Norway not too long ago, immigrants are pouring in.
Rakfisk is considered an important part of Norwegian history - an essential, if not a stinking part.
It's one of the most expensive dishes you can buy here.
But in fact, everything is expensive here - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs a proud 10 euros.
Norway doesn't get it in the world press often, and most people don't seem to mind.
Here, people still hate to name Anders Breivik -- the racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, we are referring only to the "July 22 incident".
Norwegians find it hard to accept that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal killings.
The main reason for the wealth of Norway today has been the growth of one of the world's largest oil and gas industries since the early 1970s.
"But oil is not the only reason we are doing so well", says Anna, our waitress, who distributes the round tablets with ripe shellfish and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blonde hair and piercing blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a prudent people.
Your English is just as flawless as most people here.
We're not very picky, we don't like to brag.
Norway has been very careful with its oil wealth - a large part of the industry's revenues are invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the global financial crisis, when everyone was throwing around money they didn't even have, Norway kept its wallet closed.
"As long as we can ski in the winter and hike in the summer, we're happy", says Anna.
"And of course, eat shrimp", she adds with a light laugh.
I'm standing in the snow and preparing for another dish - I've had enough of Rakfisk.
I'm sure that a moose burger like that is something else.
But tonight, the fish is back on the menu.
The hotel I'm staying at is one of several venues that host a shellfish dinner where guests can vote for the best - or perhaps the most challenging - fish.
There's a live TV circuit to a showmaster dressed in flies, surrounded by plates of shrimp.
The show is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you get up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor-Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
You're clapping and laughing.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquarium.
But maybe it's the heavy fog of the whole fish.
Mexico's Enrique Pena Nieto is facing a difficult start
As Mexico's future president Enrique Pena Nieto prepares to take office, Will Grant of the BBC analyzes the challenges he faces and the mixed feelings of his people.
Traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad right now.
Even on better days, this is a city that is always clogged, but on Monday a steel ring was built that blocks several important routes into the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disturb commuters on their way to work but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico's new president Enrique Pena Nieto will be sworn in as president and take over the leadership of the nation.
He's faced with a complex task.
Under the departing government of Felipe Calderón, Mexico has been able to prove itself economically, but the country is in the grip of a drug war that has already claimed 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is very committed to reducing violence", Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama in the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will help us achieve this goal.
Before he came to terms with the US president, Pena Nieto was governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, vast part of the country that surrounds the capital, opinions are divided about the new head of state.
A straight man
For example, in the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, people like to remember him.
Residents of the resort attribute to it the development of tourism and the construction of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can take one of the highways built by Pena Nieto, which is a major improvement over the fragile, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Posters bearing his name hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive climate change museum.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him", said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who is a member of Congress for the PRI party, Pena Nietos.
In particular, as regards security and the economy, we hope for the interesting and real change that our country needs so urgently.
After 81 years in power, the PRI was replaced in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the opposition's accusations that the new president lacks substance.
He's a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The site is hidden beneath highway traffic and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are of a decisive urban nature.
Earlier this year, the military was activated to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In the last two years alone, dozens of murdered women have been left behind on a patch of land near a large landfill.
During the tenure of Governor Pena Nieto, over 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that surpasses even the city of Ciudad Juarez, which is notorious for its violence and the murder of innocent women.
Pena Nietos' critics believe that he has not at least adequately addressed the issue of women's murder during his term in office.
But at worst, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building typical of the downtown area, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears as she shows me pictures of her late daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official story, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes she was murdered by her life partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed", recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she had been beaten, and the corpse rig had already been used.
As her mother tells her story, a picture of Mariana looks down at us from the wall, and it's placed next to a cross that carries a single word: justice.
But this is exactly what the family says she's been denied so far.
The authorities treated me like I was a talkie, a troublemaker, a nerd.
They want you to accept their verdict and keep your mouth shut.
"But that's not possible with so many mistakes and failures", she says.
If President Pena Nieto receives the Presidency on Saturday, he will also assume a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been plagued by violent crime in the past six years, and the new president has vowed to take special care of this problem during his term.
"I hope as president he is as he was as governor", says PRI congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that's what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
Prosecutors say Bradley Manning did not complain of abuse.
Prosecutors dispute Bradley Manning's allegations that he was mistreated in prison.
The hearing is about Manning's time in military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence seeks to dismiss the charges on the grounds of harsh conditions of detention
The US Army's jailer is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents
Prosecutors tried Friday to find that Army Private Bradley Manning, accused of the largest disclosure of classified information in U.S. history, missed several occasions to complain about the alleged abuse he suffered in military custody.
During a cross-examination of Manning during a pre-trial hearing in Fort Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Manning's nine-month imprisonment in Quantico, Virginia, showed no complaints about his treatment.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held following a request from the defence to dismiss the charges - Manning had already been sufficiently punished by the harsh prison sentence - Manning had testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US Army intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of classified documents during his time in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
At Friday's hearing, Mr. Fein reviewed the forms officials filled out after meeting Mr. Manning during his time in custody at the Quantico Military Prison, where he was held under strict conditions from July 2010 to April 2011.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When asked about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards to be "excellent" and the treatment by the facility as a whole to be "very professional".
The forms, Fine said, contained no complaints of abuse, although the officials had directly questioned Manning about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that officials had discussed them with him and indicated that they were dealing with them, but that they had not been recorded.
"They wrote down (after discussing the concerns) 'No problems,' and that didn't necessarily mean I said anything at all", Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he hadn't complained about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he mentioned on a form a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during this meeting was to reduce his observation status to 'injury prevention'.
The military said it had assigned him this restrictive status - one level below the suicide risk - to protect himself and others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and to get rid of injury prevention observation status . . . so that I could achieve a higher quality of life", Manning said.
Manning announced his arrest and deportation to Kuwait on Thursday, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Naval Base prison in Virginia in July 2010.
He said he was thinking about suicide in Kuwait and had passed out in the heat.
Not knowing what was happening to him or the outside world was stressful.
"My world shrank to Camp Arafjon, to this cage", Manning said Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in this cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without company.
All he was allowed to do was use a mattress, a blanket, flip flops, clothes and glasses.
Manning said he tried to stay in motion because during the day it was forbidden to sleep or even lie down.
He always had to sleep with light penetrating his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and the guards could no longer see his face, they woke him up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning's lawyer formally objected to Manning's treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the military prison at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
On Friday, Judge Manning also questioned Manning about an accusation he made in his statement on Thursday - that he slept naked one night in his cell in Quantico and had to stand naked before guards and other prisoners at a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during this count.
During the interview on Friday, Manning said he had concluded from a warrant issued by his guard that he should drop the ceiling he could have covered himself with, but he admitted that no one had asked him to.
On Thursday, Manning testified that he was forced to sleep naked the night before, and that he had tried to show an officer that he was not a danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could have used the fuse of his underwear or his flip flops to hurt himself, but he didn't.
That night, Manning said, his underwear, flip flops and glasses were removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take into account his experience in prison and drastically reduce his sentence should he be convicted in his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to lesser charges while challenging other charges deemed too extreme.
The hearing is scheduled to resume this weekend and the prosecutor's office is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon maintains that Manning was detained under the provisions applicable to all detainees held under the highest security measures in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include favouring the enemy, illegally publishing intelligence on the Internet, transmitting national defense information, and stealing public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all charges, he faces a life sentence.
My Mexican-American identity crisis.
Many people were forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame immigrants - they remind them of difficult times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are trapped between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just crossed the hall and arrived at the passport checkpoint when disorientation spread.
The signs pointed to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicanos") and another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I was there for a few seconds, unsure of which direction to turn.
I grew up in central California and have been called a Mexican all my life.
An ethnic acronym -- just like my friends in Boston call themselves "Iren" or my friends in New York call themselves "Italians".
Later, I decided to go with "Mexican American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's home, there was no need for shorts or bandages.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, at least well enough to speak it at both ends of an interview.
But I don't have the vocabulary of a native speaker, and I'm not going to get rid of my American accent either.
So I took my American passport and lined up for aliens.
I was thinking about that moment this week when the future Mexican president, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
The agenda included all the topics that are expected when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto was also very interested in talking about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one reason why Mexicans are just as likely to stay in Mexico today as to emigrate to the United States.
He wants to join forces with the United States and Canada and create a North American trade bloc modelled on the European Union.
And Pena Nieto vowed to continue Mexico's war on the drug cartels, even if he didn't give any details.
Mexico's relationship with the United States is complicated and full of resentment.
Most Americans probably never waste a single thought of the United States invading Mexico in 1848 and forcing the country's leadership under pretended fire to cede more than half of its territory to them.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries and not minutes, memories of this event are not to be overlooked.
So once a U.S. government official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, you hear complaints in the Mexican press and among the country's elites about how the Americans are suppressing the sovereignty of their neighboring country.
And the children of Montezuma are on the path of war.
And yet, the biggest challenge for Mexico is actually in the relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans living in the United States.
You want to talk about resentment?
There's more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is that at some point in our family tree, a person -- maybe a parent or grandparent -- didn't get a chance to live in Mexico and migrated north.
And in most cases, this person matched a profile -- dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people, and our loyalty is to them.
Not Mexico.
And while we may now be living the American Dream, attending good schools and getting good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American Dream we are living - not the Mexican Dream.
Our identity may be blurred at times, but when it comes to our loyalty, it is not.
This clearly applies to the United States.
We also know that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we're not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In your opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families hadn't failed in Mexico, they wouldn't have left.
And then we wouldn't be trapped behind the silk curtain now - with a pleasant life in the United States, but still somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and immigrated to the United States legally as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans take it badly.
While she is a US citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel that they belong neither to one country nor to another.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but we also love Bruce Springsteen.
You enjoy the best of both worlds, but you're not rooted in either.
In Mexico, we're seen as Americans.
And in the United States, we're seen as Mexicans.
As I should have learned during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and parts of the education community want to reestablish their ties to the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as temporary "ambassadors" for Mexico to represent their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and pressure the political leadership to intensify their ties to Mexico.
Well, I guess.
It's not gonna happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And given the unfair distribution of income, the rampant corruption and drug abuse, many of us are not so sure if this is a great country.
I'm afraid you'll have to go through this alone, Amigos.
That's fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must also accept that some Mexican Americans resent the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
I'm not going to.
Maybe we're more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old battles, new Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas could prove to be an unexpected cornerstone of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
The latest bloody events seem to stifle such hope in the seed.
Amid the usual accusations, countless buildings have been thrown into the ground, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis killed - and for the first time, rockets from Gaza have hit near the Israeli capital Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
Yet, although Israelis and Palestinians seem to be trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East is changing around them.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this mess.
Maybe this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there is reason to believe that the deadly situation may finally come to an end.
A War Neither Lost nor Won
At first glance, optimism seems far from appropriate in view of the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on November 21 continues, this week's fighting has strengthened the hardliners on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled Gaza since 2007, claim to have pushed back Israelis even though their group itself suffered heavy losses.
Despite the killing of several Hamas leaders and the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza being trapped in one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival moderate Palestinian group Fatah.
And the Hamas leaders might conclude that they have time on their side.
Just as Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has been able to attract powerful and wealthy friends to its side.
Turkey, a recovering regional power once considered Israel's closest Muslim ally, has joined Hamas - just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheerful Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel - from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah has power, to Syria, where rebels of an increasingly Islamist character could face the overthrow of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
And in particular, the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Mursi in Egypt - by far the most populous and important Arab country - on Israel's southern flank has changed the balance of the region in a lasting way.
Hosni Mubarak, the secularist despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time left for Hamas.
In contrast, the Brotherhood is more aligned with Hamas and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations Hamas could prove to be an actor that Israel and the United States themselves cannot push out.
The Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw the opposite conclusion.
From a military point of view, Hamas is no longer a threat.
The Israeli missile defense system, the Iron Dome, has proven itself and many of the Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more peacefully.
The United States has maintained its position in a diplomatic sense, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has done well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free from suicide bombers - not least thanks to the blockade facilities that have penetrated the West Bank and thus the mainland of any Palestinian state, which protect Jewish settlements that have been declared illegal under international law but are continuing to expand.
Netanyahu is doing well, and his Likud party has allied itself with an even more militant group ahead of the January 22 elections, led by Avigdor Lieberman.
Why should these cunning Palestinians be harassed and left with their own state?
If they were in control of the West Bank, wouldn't they be firing missiles like their fellow soldiers in Gaza?
No, it's better to hold them behind the wall and punish them if they dare to lift their heads.
Maybe the hardliners will be able to make a move, but the Arab Spring could make a dent in their numbers.
Even if the Islamists who are now in power in Egypt and other countries have little left for Israel, they will focus first on the difficulties in their own country.
Israel's defense is bigger than its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will hardly help the new Arab governments to rebuild their economies.
That the pragmatic President Morsi has teamed up with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire could be a promising sign - and perhaps symbolize the beginning of a new era.
Israelis should think longer term too.
While the rest of the Arab world is taking bold steps toward democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli-occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and with the growth of the Arab population, this situation will only worsen.
Bloody missions to repel Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly demand diplomatic tribute over the years.
Both sides need an outside push.
The correct answer is that of the more reasonable representatives of both sides, of most of the rest of the world and of this newspaper: two states where Israel is relinquishing territory for security reasons.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more influence in enforcing this solution.
Egypt must now, together with Turkey and Qatar, stop arms supplies to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, complemented by land exchange and a shared Jerusalem.
Foreign Arab nations should also push Hamas and Fatah to an agreement.
This would be more to do for the creation of a Palestinian state than with the forthcoming request for UN observer status.
Obama must also play his part in moving Israel to negotiations.
During his first term, he missed the idea of his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, it seems he's equally averse to participation.
But that's a regrettable, shortsighted prospect.
The United States has a substantial interest in a stable Middle East.
And that includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on uniform cigarette packaging come into force
Health warnings and sick parts on neutral green packaging, identical for all tobacco brands
The first uniform laws for cigarette and tobacco packaging in the world came into force in Australia, replacing brand logos and colours with neutral olive-green covers, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and infants and children who are sick from cigarette smoke.
As from next Saturday, apart from the various health warnings and images, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical small letters, is that they are not identical.
Australia has introduced the strictest tobacco packaging regulations in the world.
The Australian federal government wants to stop young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco use.
The government is based on studies that have shown that people who haven't started smoking by age 26 are 99% likely to quit after that.
"You can already see that young children understand the message of trying to promote tobacco companies with their brand image", says Tanya Plibersek, the Federal Minister of Health.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have only a slight impact on the profits of multinational corporations, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco club fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour the black market trade, which would lead to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will have serious, unintended consequences", says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will be offering far greater quantities of these products on the streets of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have upset their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family business, notes that the demand for cigarette tubes and silicone lids to cover the intolerable packaging has increased dramatically since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed to challenge the laws in the Australian Supreme Court two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
It's a good deal for us.
Experts say that the social media's popularity is tied to the specific population targeted by the plan.
A series of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, prohibiting them from acting as sports sponsors, and forcing most retailers to stop selling cigarettes in stores.
The Australian government has banned internet advertising by local businesses and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
"If you're marketing tobacco and you only have a small area left to promote your products, you're not going to get around the Internet", says Becky Freeman, a health researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has seen an increase in brand experiences written by "totally normal people".
You have to ask yourself, is this just a private person who likes Marlboro cigarettes so much that she even makes a video for them, or is there a marketing agency involved?
British American Tobacco Australia says that the industry is focused on dealing with the new laws rather than marketing.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, even though none of them have a greater trade relationship with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has been in talks with other countries considering similar packaging laws.
In 2001, Canada was the first country to require photographic warnings.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tighter laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures don't affect me.
I just ignore them.
"You just take a cigarette butcher and put the box away", says Victor El Hage, buying a cigarette box with a picture of a mouth tumor.
Honestly, there's only one reason I'd stop, and that's my little girl.
James Yu, who runs the King of the Pack tobacco shop in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it harder to fill his shelves.
"I used to need an hour to sort out a shipment, now I need four", Yu says.
"The government should have just banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said okay, that's it, we're closing", he adds, apparently regretting.
In a world that's always electrified, it's nice to be bored sometimes.
This Thanksgiving, I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane crashed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to think about a few things.
I don't want to lie to you.
Waiting at the airport for a flight for half a day is quite annoying - even when books, magazines, and iPhones (and, of course, tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts are calling boredom a positive thing.
When it comes to them, it's okay for us - and our kids - to get bored occasionally.
It forces the brain to lose itself in interesting thought processes, which may stimulate creativity.
And because most of us today are staring at one or another screen almost all the time, we no longer benefit from the benefits of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
- I know.
And no, I did not.
I'll come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has evolved with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011), does not see it that way.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history", he says.
The walls of Pompeii's houses are decorated with a Latin graffiti of boredom dating back to the first century.
And then there's the question of how we define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After reading research literature for a long time and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues concluded that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wishing to do a satisfying activity but not being able to do it".
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy but wants to be.
Apathy, on the other hand, is not a drive to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is "a disturbance of the attentional process, coupled with a bad mood and a feeling that time is passing by slowly".
Boredom can sound almost like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that while these two conditions may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think we're bored, even when we're just having trouble concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in September in the journal Perspectives on Psychological Science, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues point to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard a loud TV program from the neighboring room that had nothing to do with the content; others listened to it at low volume, so it was hardly noticeable, while the third group did not hear those sounds at all.
The people who rarely listened to the television reported feeling more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, could not find a reason for it, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
When trying to focus on a difficult or stressful task, distracted attention can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the study's authors.
On the other hand, when you do a monotonous activity - "like looking for faulty products on a factory tape - music can distract and help you not feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that whining and screaming, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even combat it by keeping people more physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to walk around learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still", says Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my late flight, a loudspeaker, a particularly tiring movie.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers developed a "boredom sensitivity scale" in the 1980s.
On the scale, you can find statements like, "A lot of things I have to do are repetitive and monotonous", and, "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored than girls, says Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida - particularly when it comes to the need for more and more variety of external stimuli.
But in general, teenagers are a pretty tense bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of human and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted nearly 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day with a pager.
He found that 32 percent of adolescents were bored at school and doing their homework, while 23 percent reported being bored when they weren't at school.
Yet, only 3 percent of parents reported feeling bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he doesn't know if the boredom percentages have gone up or down.
He is sure, however, that "youth is perceived as particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers have little influence on their daily lives.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases, it causes people to take extreme physical risks and resort to gambling or drugs to mitigate them, studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers study the relationship between boredom and creativity, according to Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"When you get bored, your brain wants to tell you to do something different", says Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at New York University.
But the brain doesn't always know what the best thing to do is right now.
If you're bored and you use that energy to play guitar and cook, you'll be happy.
But while television can provide short-term happiness, it can fade in the long run.
So if you give your bored child an iPad, you can help him get rid of boredom, but he hasn't learned to talk or control himself, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control is a transition from one situation to another".
Not only does the child learn to communicate, but he also gains more self-control in other areas.
I don't think we should celebrate boredom.
We should not be too critical of them either.
Instead, our goal should be to feel comfortable away from the constant distraction of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees with that.
"It sounds like we're more likely to get bored, but boredom is the tormenting, unrelenting desire to do something meaningful", he says.
He believes that people are really just looking for a way to turn off and relax.
"In an environment where we are constantly over-stimulated, it is difficult to be busy once the noise is silenced".
In Colorado, there's no clear guideline for the new marijuana law.
Nineteen-year-old community college student and football player Anthony Orozco is on trial in southeastern Colorado for a crime that will soon be legal in that state: the possession of a few small pieces of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke.
Orozco said he and some friends were driving to Lamar, near the Kansas border, on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was charged with possession of drugs and drug paraphernalia - criminal offences punishable by a fine of $100 each - and was given a court date.
"We are treated like criminals", Orozco said.
But is he one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state's decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of smaller drug offenses depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of marijuana-related offenses are already being dropped here and in Washington State, which has approved similar measures.
The police authorities no longer pursue adults over 21 for possession to a lesser extent, which will be allowed by law once the new laws come into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative counties of Colorado have announced they're continuing to prosecute existing marijuana offenses and are still citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the Denver suburbs to the Western Mountains, have voted to prevent new, state-licensed marijuana businesses from opening in their communities.
"This situation is moving so fast that I don't know what's next", says Daniel J. Oates, police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
And regulators in Washington state are scratching their heads.
They are awaiting guidance on the setting up of a licensing system for the production, manufacture, distribution and sale of the drug - and have a deadline of 1 December 2013.
In Washington, Colorado is considered to be in any case ahead of most states in regulating marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical purposes and then for personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is well suited to navigation", says Brian E. Smith, spokesman for the D.C. State Department of Alcohol Control.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve in the sense of a rough guide.
"We have no real precedent to follow", he adds.
The Washington law, called I-502, will take effect on December 6 and thus marks the end of a gray area where the state licensing system does not yet exist but ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practical issues need to be addressed during this time - such as how to agree on the state's requirement for "appropriate access" to licensed marijuana with a ban on cannabis sales within 300 metres of schools, parks, playgrounds and childcare facilities.
"Nothing will be more difficult to find a location for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area", says Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a newly formed research group.
On November 21, Chief Oates sent an email to his Aurora employees stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offences against individuals over the age of 21 and that the police would not prosecute those offences "from now on".
Chief Oates added that the police would continue to enforce municipal regulations on medical marijuana growers and continue to prosecute drug dealers.
In Weld County in northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck has a stricter view.
After the vote, he stated that his authority would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to encourage consumers to withdraw.
Currently, 119 people are charged with possession of 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have been charged with other crimes.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations that were criminal at the time of the crime", Buck said in a statement.
The reactions are even mixed in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer charge adults with possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision but also decided not to drop all outstanding ownership proceedings.
"I don't think I'm wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes", he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile personal marijuana use with the complexities of government and the legal system.
And the conflicting reactions across the state have fueled a deep disagreement among local officials about the big green experiment.
District attorneys are a "cultural barrier", says Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents marijuana offenders and is a spokesman for the national organization for marijuana law reform.
"They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people for it that they still can't accept legalization", he believes.
Colorado and Washington are the first states to treat smaller amounts of marijuana as alcohol, and are seen as national drug legalization patterns.
While advocates and government officials are preparing for an era of legal sales, they are also anxiously awaiting orders from the federal government to continue to criminalize the sale and cultivation of marijuana at the federal level.
Proponents of the legalization movement hope the Justice Department will yield.
Despite several shocking arrests of medical marijuana consumers and sellers, the federal government has largely allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
Kevin A. Sabet, a former Obama administration drug policy adviser, believes that while criminal officials are unlikely to walk in the doorway to confiscate smaller amounts of the drugs, they are likely to be willing to tolerate legal, state-regulated marijuana businesses under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act.
Even before election day, some local authorities approved moratoriums on new marijuana businesses, although they could not open for about a year.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the west, decided on a six-month ban, which is likely to be passed next week.
"We don't want to be in a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level", said Bob Nicholson, a city council member.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We're judging by what the community has decided to do, not what the state has decided to do.
There are still many questions.
I was bullied from Oxford because I'm a Tory.
It's not just university students today who are being attacked for their views
It had always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
My father and my older brother both attended that university, which I once considered the world's greatest temple of knowledge, for a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization -- free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of entering Worsester College in the late 1980's - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my suitcases again, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father broke down in tears.
My friends were confused.
The Evening Standard said I left because I had a problem with having sex with fellow roommates in the next room.
Author A. N. Wilson said slanderously that I had left the university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yeah, I ran, because I was bullied and threatened.
Not because of my unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I had been harassed for one reason only - one reason that seemed even more narrow and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: My late father Woodrow Wyatt had been a key adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a supporter of the Conservative Party.
Why am I mentioning this right now?
Well, according to recent reports, a new generation of moderate-right students are suffering similar persecution.
The organized and growing hatred of Tory students at Oxford has now developed to such an extent that a group of them last week called for equal protection for gays, disabled people and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College say they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared unwanted" because of their political views.
They are asking for a seat on their college's equality committee to ensure that their views can be freely expressed.
Their situation was made worse by a recent documentary on political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which depicted Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
It featured, among others, graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the conservative Oxford University student union, who was riding a Rolls-Royce and wearing a silver suit and a silver-colored walking stick.
At other universities, conservative students say they are considered "sinner goats for the introduction of higher tuition fees".
The 20-year-old Luke Black, vice-president of the Conservative Students' Association at the University of Nottingham, told a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing leftist trend in universities.
People think we're like the Bullingdon Club without ever knowing each other".
Samuel Roberts, 21, a Corpus Christi history student who initiated the search for greater protection, believes that such a climate is "unpleasant". 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-elect of the Conservative Students' Association of Oxford, says she has observed a growing rejection of moderate-right students among JCR members.
"This poses a danger to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of members", she says.
In my first few weeks at Oxford, I was part of such a minority.
I arrived in September 1986 at the age of 18 and was incredibly shy.
The hatred of the Conservative Party had reached its peak.
Last year, the university voted not to award an honorary degree to Margaret Thatcher, a former student, because of the cutbacks in higher education.
The atmosphere would have scared even Stalinists.
During the first few days of the first semester, when new students and tutors meet, I get a taste of what's to come.
I've experienced that the tutors not only tolerated the ridicule of Tory students, but even took part with pleasure.
Political issues such as the miners' strike, privatization and the government's rejection of sanctions against South Africa's apartheid regime found their way into the wood-paved rooms of the tutorial.
At my first such event, I was supposed to translate 18th-century French texts into English, but I was not prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt", said tutor Harry Pitt (who has since died), "please translate the first paragraph".
I stumbled on it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like a pie pie pie, and pretty nasty.
"Do Thatcher supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students were giggling.
Tears were pouring out of my eyes.
"I suggest that you take a few French lessons in your spare time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities", Pitt whispered.
I went back to my room with my head hanging.
That night, I was sitting alone at dinner in college when someone tapped me on the shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student union.
"I know who you are", he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is what it is.
Anyone suspected of being a Tory is being bullied.
It's bad enough for me, but they know your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it's gonna be worse for you.
Most Tory first-year students pretend to be Labour.
I tried to pretend to be in a local pub later.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on all points.
This trick should prove unsuccessful.
A freshman in philosophy, politics and economics, who, ironically, had attended what was considered conservative Eton College, told me, "You're the daughter of a fascist pig".
You're dirty.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How are Tories having sex?" one asked me.
They're fighting each other, aren't they?
I felt the way homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation in the United States.
Would I ever manage to lead a normal life at Oxford University?
Could I meet with my peers after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay ahead of me stretched out before my spiritual eye into a fiery furnace of rejection and isolation.
The only tutor who openly identified himself as a Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history who had his seat at my college.
He was hated not only for being a conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and small-town, and rejected it for its Marxist-determinist historical perspective.
In 1997, he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here", he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents' house, and I took refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed unbelieving.
During his time in the 1940s, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world", he said low.
They would never do such a thing, not in my dream town of tower towers.
Even my communist friends were always showing perfect manners.
His wet eyes were blurring.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure you're just being fucked.
It would break my heart if you left.
Tired of my frequent travels to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also a Tory, had succumbed to pressure and renounced his beliefs.
During a lecture the following week, where another history teacher seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people", I decided to do the same.
Although I was secretly crushed by shame, I admitted that my parents had brainwashed me, calling them "old idiots".
The relief was short-lived.
It was my father who hit the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford career.
At the time, he was writing two columns a week in the Murdoch press.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes, my rabbits gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never came back.
I'd like you to call me a weeping cock.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to suffer such intimidation and malice in an educational institution.
And even more tragic, it was Oxford -- a university that not only produced 14 Tory prime ministers, but still hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to fame"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC is speaking to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino Masters of Couture", a grand retrospective that has assembled more than 130 high-end costumes created by his "maison" over the past 50 years.
"I love this palace", he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition concludes a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished client.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the remote and sticky world of the nobility.
The first room of this exhibition, which will be on view until March 3, features a large number of private letters and photographs with the signature of the most distinguished aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Princess Marie-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino presents these personal memories as trophies of his social rise from modest fashion designer in the northern Italian city of Voghera to international jet idol.
Being in love with the nobility doesn't have to be disadvantageous.
"At least they don't perform their tips on your gorgeous rug like some beautiful pop stars do", says Baroness Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the '60s and '70s, the two lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all happy to be invited to his house in Gstaad", explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, who is close friends with forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred the elegance of fame.
And yet he's a star.
Valeria Mazza, in a dress by Valentino
The Argentine model Valeria Mazza also remembers the fashion designer's charisma.
Many years ago, after a fashion show in Rome, we went to his house for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
His influence was evident in every detail of his apartment, in the decorations, in the food, in the music.
"All the guests felt important and loved", recalls the "top model", who began her career at Haute Couture Week in Paris in 1995.
"It never goes out of fashion because its designs are works of art", she concludes.
Fashion of origin
Garavani's life is not a story of madness, but rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious, 60-meter-long runway that suggests a role replacement: the user takes the model's place and walks along the runway to admire a dreamlike "audience" wearing Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristotle Onassis, the costumes Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a coat of wool and leather made by Empress Farah Diba.
In this fashion puppet audience, names like Sibilla of Luxembourg, Gloria of Thurn and Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía of Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the fashion designer, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentine's Day is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
It was a pair of pants, a shirt, a Gillette jacket and a jacket from the 1971-72 fall/winter collection.
"It was a gift from him", says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he highlights our beauty", adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and emphasize the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Even the princess and fashion commentator Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time she wore a Valentino.
When I was a teenager living in Italy, I dreamed of finally being old enough to wear one of his evening gowns...
In the late 1990s, it finally came to this.
I bought my first Valentine's dress for a party at my cousin's castle, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a decolleté that honors his name.
"It was a dream come true", says the widow of Rodrigo d'Arenberg.
"Valentino is not a fashion addict, his obsession is timeless", explains this Italian aristocrat who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
Princess D'Arenberg keeps her fashion designer's evening gowns "with utmost care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the memories associated with it".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress for her wedding to Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
Four months of work and 25 "fashion-making" days (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) were needed to make this ivory-colored silk dress with beads, twelve different embroidery items, and a four-and-a-half-meter-long braid.
According to Suzy Menkes, the top authority in the printing press, this dress was a landmark in late-20th-century haute couture, "the return to the top-class of women".
For years, tainted by the elite's "savoir-être", Valentino is now her best example.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (Italy's highest award), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded with the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honours as each of the husbands of his clients.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his calmness, his neat and perfect appearance", admits D'Arenberg.
I last saw him a month ago at a gala dinner at the Musée d'Orsay.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; time leaves no trace of him".
And this is what a princess says...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human working animals of Kawah-ijen
For four euros, the Indonesian volcano's bearers risk their lives and health carrying 70 kilograms of sulfur across the steep, rocky paths.
There are people who work for hell, and others work literally in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of 400 miners who earn their living by extracting sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, he must climb down to the bottom of his crater every day, where the sulfuric gas that flows from the earth in contact with the air solidifies.
After he has broken out large stones of sulfur, which can weigh up to 70 pounds [70 kg] in total, he carries them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders along the shallow stone paths.
While it is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano, which rises to an altitude of 2,386 metres, the exhausted tortoise carrier takes more than 40 minutes to climb up the pace, while maintaining balance and carefully setting its steps so as not to slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost them their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the slopes of the Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 eurocents for every kilo of sulfur they mine.
They're going up, they're going down the path between tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and they're walking with the tiringly heavy baskets three kilometers up to the scale that a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1,850 meters
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which has been exploiting the volcano's resources since 1960 and (not to mention) its workers, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rupees (5 eurocents) for each kilo of sulphur.
It then sells it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 eurocents) each, because this mineral is common in everyday life and is used to make firewood, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite, and even to bleach sugar.
"We usually carry 70 kg, so we get about 46,000 rupees for each trip", explains Anto, who normally runs three routes a day.
He needs three hours to complete each route, but at the end of the day he has collected 138,000 rupees.
What may seem like a miserable wage for such a purely inhumane effort is three times what he would earn from field work.
"The daily wage of miners here, where the coffee harvest pays 15,000 rupees a day and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high", explains the carrier, who previously worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, for a reason as important as sulfur in Indonesia: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I brought her to Java to convert her to Islam".
Anto has asthma, difficulty breathing, frequent coughing and irritated eyes from the toxic gases.
For three years, 27-year-old Anto has been risking his life at Kawah Ijen, where sulfur has already left its first traces, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, difficulty breathing, frequent coughing and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases from the volcano.
This is the price he must pay to achieve his dream.
"I'll work here for two more years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French", he promises in more than just acceptable English.
This kind and intelligent, but life-threatening young man could be working as a tour guide, a waiter, or a hotel receptionist, but instead he does the work of a traitor.
He shares a dirty wooden hut with other people and wakes up at two o'clock every morning because the sulfur also flows out at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines blue in the dark.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought with his own money.
About 400 carriers load the baskets of sulfur on their shoulders at the crater floor.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanised sulphur extraction to save costs and does not supply any equipment to the operators who work on their own account and are paid by weight.
They also do not receive a share of the 30,000 rupees (2.5 euros) bonus per camera, which the guards of this nature park charge, along with the 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) entrance fee, to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human tragedy.
"This work is for the animals, not for the people", protested Madrusin, a tribal, 42-year-old carrier who has been working at the Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He can carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will continue "as long as possible" because he needs the money to raise his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I'm not retiring, I'm dying here because the volcano was my whole life.
Even when the sulfur burns their throats and their eyes itch, when the wind suddenly turns and the miners are crammed into the thick columns that rise from the crater, the men are so tough that no one complains about serious illnesses... except, of course, the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have become deformed by the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik, at 53, can only carry 50 kg.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which is transported by three trucks over a goat trail between the bushes to the camp at Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I'm not going to retire, I'm going to die here because the volcano has been my whole life", Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide, missing some teeth.
Of his five children, the oldest, aged 30, also works as a sulphur-bearer.
Time passes, but poverty persists generation after generation in one of the toughest professions in the world: that of those who work as human burdens on the cawah-en.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
Singaporeans blame the lack of children on their careers, the stress and the cost of real estate and parenting.
"The population of Singapore must grow".
I am a patriot husband, you are my patriot wife, let us fulfill our civic duty and create life!
It seems incredible that the verses are part of a commercial for mint candy, but nevertheless - or precisely because of that - they went viral on YouTube in Singapore earlier this year.
The phrases are part of a rapper song that uses local proverbs like, "Shutting a bao in the oven to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which made the video, hopes that the commercial will come out in a fun way to raise awareness of the problem.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do their "national duty".
This is something for the Internet, so we had to make it fun and funny.
It is the biggest problem in this country.
We're the worst breeders in the world, so we realized this was a topic we had to deal with.
We knew the government had tried a lot, like marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed dating nights.
Many of these ideas may have been creative, but they didn't necessarily lead to success.
So we thought, why don't we do something as creative as possible to address this problem, like compose a rap?
Children 1.2
The government of Singapore is the one who is not taking this issue lightly.
Every year, she spends $1,300 on political initiatives to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for couples and parents provides up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has been very unsuccessful.
Singapore is a wealthy, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservatism of its rulers and its strict social controls.
According to its national population agency, the birth rate is currently 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was above 2 - also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don't the Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, director of the National Population Agency's marriage and family policy, says this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities".
"This has allowed people to have more options and priorities in life than to marry and have a family", she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the increase in single people and the delay in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, immigration policies aimed at a drastic increase in immigration to counteract population decline have led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the hardly-closed xenophobia against many new immigrants is flourishing, especially against the Chinese who are being criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why the ruling party in Singapore scored its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem of higher contributions and taxes for foreign workers.
Unforeseen Consequences
While the falling birth rate has known effects on a nation's economic growth, tax revenues, healthcare costs and immigration policies, the example of Singapore also shows unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to make sure that not so many small dwellings are built.
It already has an impact on the housing market.
The Urban Development Authority has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoe boxes" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they may promote the lifestyle of the single person and that they may deter construction firms from building large homes for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, CEO of real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoe boxes" sell much faster than larger residential units.
They're so popular, and the units sell out days and even weeks faster than the larger housing units.
This makes them much better for our cash flow.
However, he admits that the new standards provide clearer guidance for developers who have previously been hindered by obstacles when they want to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for a rise in the national birth rate, the discussions with Singaporeans working in the financial district are to be seen as having little impact.
"People are under a lot of stress, housing and education are expensive, and many people are pushing it out", says one young manager.
The kids can get others.
"It is important to me to have my own money and time", says another man in his early twenties.
Men and women are putting their careers, stress and the cost of ownership and upbringing as reasons why they can't have children.
That's why Singaporeans have the final say when it comes to having children - there's so much the government can do.
Offline private offline is online private
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the private property or "the area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What's private for someone under 16?
How does this definition apply to his everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers he faces when he publishes online situations he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five teenagers aged 10 to 15 who are often online.
In four cases, they linked the term to "something very personal" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when they applied it to social networks.
"I wouldn't reveal my deepest secrets in a post", says 10-year-old Jorge, trying to explain the meaning of "private" on sites like Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has had accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world", he confirms.
I upload beautiful pictures or pictures of games on FB.
I also spend my time with people I know.
"I wouldn't share a picture that wasn't of me or of someone who's making a fool of myself", he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to post obscene photos, of nudity, of crime, or to write offensive or violent comments.
Jorge insures he knows 35 friends he has on FB and nine followers on Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up for Twitter to express myself and write interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone's answering me, I'm just uploading them", he adds.
"Social networks are fun, and I can talk to relatives or friends from a distance", he says.
When asked, he replies that he would never accept an invitation from a stranger.
Even if he liked a stranger, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask, he admits not to know 20 of the people he added to his friend list.
"I'm not scared of that because we have something in common, like music", he says.
The boy said no one gave him any clues or asked for his address or phone number.
"If someone presses me or demands it, I simply remove them from my user account", he admits.
José joined Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The boy is not unfamiliar with the experience of what is now known as cyberbullying.
A friend's acquaintance was blackmailed on a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never found out who it was", he assures me.
According to José, the victim didn't close the user account.
"He just did it privately".
It then explains a series of steps to configure a user account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yeah, I would if I didn't like him or if I wanted to wipe one off.
"But I know this is cyberbullying", he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a degree in education and learning, believes that in order to guide children and young people, it is necessary to understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet was born as a means of searching for information, but with the advent of these pages, the rules of the game have changed", she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, who holds a master's degree in education from Yale University and author of Digital Natives and Immigrants, coined these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are them, the children and young people who grew up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them, where we are still learning ourselves", he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue, "because we require them to have a defined criterion for what is allowed to be disseminated, published or said, at an age when maturity is not sufficient".
"They should also be selective when they think it's most important to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences", he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and adolescents what privacy is, is to ask them questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it doesn't work", he says.
Porras then mentions some ways: There are things you wouldn't tell a stranger.
Or would you like to be published a photo of yourself, like the one you posted by a friend?
You know what other people say about you?
Did you ask the other people for permission before you tagged photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Do you need everyone to know what you're doing at any given moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they need to do online business like they do offline.
It's the same rules.
"Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks", he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, a university professor, primary school teacher and educational consultant, comments that it is essential that parents carefully read through the guidelines of social networks.
If they understand all the sections, they have a solid foundation to talk to their children about the importance of opening an online user account.
"For example, age, or what you can share or publish", he explains.
Guardia says the children need to be reminded of the lesson "You must not talk to strangers".
The UNASUR Summit concluded without publication of the Lima Declaration
The sixth summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was announced in advance and was to be signed theoretically by the seven Governments present.
Efe repeatedly sought access to the document signed at the VI Ordinary Meeting of Heads of State and Government of the Unasur.
When asked about the text, they stated that the content was presented by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
The access of journalists to information on the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, only the image of the presidential meeting was transmitted in the press room without sound, with the message "private meeting, limited audio".
The few information circulated among the journalists was received by the press officers of some of the governments of Unasur present at the meeting, but not by the Peruvian press officer.
The only document that was circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
The President of Peru then sent an email to the media with the "concluding statement" of the summit, but it was Humala's statement and not the official document concluding the summit.
Last October Peru hosted the third summit of the South American-Arab States (ASPA), and even on this occasion, despite press urges, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had been announced earlier, was not published.
The official website of ASPA shows that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that information systems exist for journalists, but they restricted access to information to a high degree.
The summit also ended with Chile and Peru jointly committing to accept a judgment of the Hague Court of Justice settling a border dispute between the two countries.
The Presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICC, which begins on Monday in The Hague, in the process initiated by Lima v. Santiago to hear the pleadings of both sides.
"We will follow and implement the judgment on the differences we are currently bringing before this International Court of Justice", Humala said, along with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile was, is and will remain a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful settlements of disputes, concludes agreements and submits to international courts", Piñera adds, and greets Humala with a handshake in front of both countries' flags.
The confirmation by both Presidents that they would submit to the ICC came after Colombia, following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua which it considered a grave error, had filed an action against the Bogotá Convention, which agreed to submit to the judgments of that International Court of Justice.
The summit was attended by the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from the Unasur since 2011 after the ouster of its President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host President Ollanta Humala opened the talks in the morning and concluded the summit shortly after noon in Lima.
The President read the final document, which stated that 16 decisions had been taken and the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries had been set for a total investment of 17 billion dollars.
He said that the Unasur countries would "take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, to which we are extending residence rights decisions".
He said that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and organised crime across countries, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and low-cost Internet access in all areas of South America and to act together and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not take triumphant forms, but serve to expand our production capacity and to show our peoples a better future", Humala added.
"We have decided to prioritise a series of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving spatial connections in South America, especially in rural and border areas... and thus unite our countries and open up new economic forms", the Peruvian President said in a statement read out.
The project also included five Peruvian ones located on the crossroads of his territory from the coast to Brazil, two of which are to provide better connections with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also dealt with the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in this country will serve to re-enter the Union of South American Nations", which is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region of prosperity and peace and good neighbourly relations was another aspect emphasized at the summit.
In this regard, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said before he began his participation in the regional meeting that he expected a meeting with his counterpart from Nicaragua, Daniel Ortega, on Saturday in Mexico to treat the maritime conflict with respect after a judgment of the ICC challenged by Bogotá.
"Maybe I will meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)", Santos said.
"We will review all these routes - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary", he stressed.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectfully as possible", Santos added.
Santos and Ortega are due to meet in Mexico on Saturday, where they intend to attend the inauguration of the country's new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the Summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc also met in advance to adopt the Action Plan for 2013 to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter country is currently excluded.
Peru holds the provisional presidency of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from the integration of citizens", says Rafael Correa
President Rafael Correa of Ecuador today confirmed that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal, with "South America actually learning from Europe".
Correa, who attended the 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, told Peruvian state television that Europeans "killed each other in World War II and other conflicts" and "today are practically a homeland".
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship that would drive the Unasur member states forward.
"The free movement of citizens and workers in all South American countries must be achieved, as is already the case in the Andean Community; however, there are still reactionary sectors seeking a return to the past", he warned.
The President of Ecuador also supported the reorganisation of the Organization of American States (OAS) with a view to reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account those which have signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
The teachers never commit to anything, and in return, we always sign everything for South Americans.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States", he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assured that he did not regret this decision because it did not betray his principles but was in compliance with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights".
He added that at the time there were "founded suspicions that Assange was extradited to a third country and that his proceedings would not be followed".
He also criticized the Swedish judiciary for requiring him to be interrogated on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish jurisprudence allows this through a video conference that could have been conducted via the Ecuadorian embassy in London".
Correa explained that there was a risk that Assange's health and mental state would be impaired.
"I haven't spoken to him since he's been in our embassy, but the ambassador has informed me that he has a mild lung problem but not a serious one", said the Ecuadorian head of state.
However, there is a risk of physical and mental harm because he is confined to a confined space and cannot exercise outdoors.
"This would affect the health of every person", he added.
Correa said the solution to Assange's asylum granted since June at the Ecuadorian embassy in London was to grant him a release letter allowing him to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European legal authorities.
We are not dealing with human rights, we do not use that word in this case, but there has been constant discussion.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European legal authorities because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a series of proceedings in various European courts", he explained.
And if Britain grants this release tomorrow, I think it's done".
And if Sweden interviewed Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London or via Skype, as Swedish jurisprudence allows and was done in other cases, the problem was solved.
Correa took the opportunity to establish himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he does not tolerate "are mediocrity, evil intent and lies that undermine free expression".
"The greatest enemies of press freedom are not the wicked and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek to profit and blackmail", he said.
In this sense, he welcomed the fact that Ecuador is no longer ruled by such journalists "nor by bankers or hegemonic and bourgeois countries", and anticipated that if elected again, he would "deepen the revolution to continue in this right direction".
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto against Paraguay in the Unasur until at least his next election, arguing that the body "must remain tough and not allow opportunism and a legally disguised coup" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay".
The President of Ecuador also considers that his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, is "absolutely entitled" to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime boundaries between the two countries, now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which favored Nicaragua's maritime sovereignty.
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They need to be treated extensively so that they can be overcome and looked forward.
Likewise, he relied on a good settlement of disputes over the Peru-Chile maritime borders before the same court, saying that "it is right for Latin America to call international courts when both countries commit to accept the judgment, even if it is very harsh".
Regarding the possibility of running for the next presidential election in Ecuador to achieve his third consecutive term, he said he sees this possibility "with great optimism and joy, although sometimes it is also very difficult".
Correa assured that if he loses the February 2013 election, he would withdraw from political life.
I have never been personally interested in power, but under unjust circumstances like those in Ecuador, this socioeconomic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement believed that I was the one who guaranteed this likely victory, so I have to fulfill that responsibility", he said.
If I win, it's my last term as president, and then I'll retire from public life.
This is true even if we lose.
"That's decided", he explained.
Mr Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I just spoke to the vice president of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, and he told me that he had traveled there for scheduled, routine treatment and that he would be expected to be able to travel back to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not mean a decline in the health of President Chávez", he commented.
The Ecuadorian President took part today in the 6th Summit of Heads of State or Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, which ended with the call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of AIDS deaths today is too late to be identified
Fabrizio was 21 when he was confirmed HIV positive.
"It was like a bomb hit", he says of the moment he received the diagnosis, which the doctor tried to "weaken without noticeable success".
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to learn about it, and this with such commitment that he was just celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he joined after several struggles in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine in the early 1990s when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigma.
At that time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it led to a dead end".
AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, many people still come to the clinic who know nothing about their illness and who have already been damaged by the virus and whose immune system has been depleted and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the world's first reported cases of AIDS, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient who is taking treatment in time and the survival of the general population are exactly the same", said Jaime Andrade Villanueva, head of the HCG's HIV unit, adding that this information was backed up by a reputable scientific publication in April of this year.
Infectious diseases and HIV/AIDS expert Andrade Villanueva commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that while AIDS is not a death sentence, years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree to which people's immune systems are impaired at the start of treatment, and that those who are not drug-dependent have a higher chance of being: up to 30 years at a count of 200 CD4s and 50 years at a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above statements mean that those diagnosed HIV positive at age 25 can "go straight to age 75 as long as they are under control", explained this expert.
To properly rank this progress, it must be remembered that the average life expectancy of Mexicans today is 76 years.
Even though mortality has declined significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has decreased from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (UNICEF's annual report), it is true that 60 percent of the patients listed in the national database have died since the onset of AIDS.
In 2011 alone, 255 people died in Jalisco, and as of May this year, there have been 187 deaths; however, it is assured that since 2005 there has been universal access to antiretroviral medicines.
- So why are people still dying from it?
- I don't think the problem is access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is our hospital.
At least in the last 12 years, we haven't had any problems with the supply of the drugs. The problem is that people get in a far advanced state because they don't know their infection status, which is very late in the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us when they already have an accompanying infection, and to influence global mortality, early diagnosis is needed, so massive screening tests must be offered to all those who need it".
This proposal is supported by experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) (the State AIDS Prevention Committee in Jalisco) and by patients such as Fabrizio, who had his test done in a private laboratory, for the sole reason that it had been done by a friend of his who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had Kaposi sarcoma (a cancerous tumor), one of the common complications.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some people think they're going to die and they don't want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather blow three times", they say in my case.
The change was for improvement, I eat well, I exercise, and I take my medication.
Today, all his parents know is that he had cancer.
I live a normal life, like everyone else.
"I work, I do a lot of things, I have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of my health and that of the other person", says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO in order to use his testimony to animate those who are afraid as part of the global AIDS Day.
They should get tested if they're in the risk group, and the sooner they know they're HIV positive, the better, and once they've got the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly, like all people.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are huge gaps between health programs and the common citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the HIV issue.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the places designated for this purpose, "the distribution of condoms was actually increased; they were previously given individually, now they give us packages of a hundred pieces, which is good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom", he said.
Young people are at risk of new infections.
"What do you need these for?" is a common mockery of social workers, school counselors, pharmacy and health care workers who do not want to expose young people, the correspondent assured.
He proposed reorientating this inefficient distribution, not only by placing condoms behind the counter but in the delivery machines in public toilets of facilities frequented by young people.
It is not intended to promote promiscuity.
They are not to be paid for the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González answered the question of whether preservatives would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality is not like that; it's best to bring the condoms closer to those who are already engaged in sexual activity", he said.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
The state is ranked fourth in the nation in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in HIV.
92% of infections occur through sexual intercourse, 6% through blood and 2% perinatally.
It's estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV because for every recorded case, there are four or five people who don't know.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld a judgment not recognizing the restructuring of the Vitro Group's liabilities achieved through a trade competition in Mexico, setting a disastrous precedent for any national company with branches in a neighbouring country that has payment problems.
So you could say that the survival procedures that Mexican laws allow for companies are not valid in the land of stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition of the judgment by Judge Harlin Hale on June 15 in the Bancarrotas District Court for the Northern District of Texas leaves Mexican companies vulnerable to the seizure of their property beyond the Bravo River.
However, the ruling opens doors for the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to appeal three cases to the United States Supreme Court.
While the judge in the case points out that creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States, the New Orleans-based Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals first says that the main case involves the Mexican-based trade competition.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings by companies with a cross-border profile is not known.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created for this purpose, using the American Law Institute as an intermediary.
Second, the judgment states that without the votes of the companies having recognised the bankruptcy liabilities of the Vitro branches with their parent company, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been achieved.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities to group companies have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles (Federal Trade Commission).
It is also true that, after deducting the votes of the branches, Vitro's creditors, the creditors who complained to the United States courts against Vitro, namely the vulture funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, did not reach a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
The Court of Appeal does not take this into account.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for its difficult situation since 2008 in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States that struck the country.
The González Sada family therefore objected to the same Court of Appeal for a vote in plenary, i.e. by all the judges, since only three of them voted.
If this is not granted, the Cerciorare objection is lodged, which requires the review of the proceedings by a higher court, in this case by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The seriousness of the case is that the Court set aside a document sent by the Government of Mexico under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court) describing the proceedings conducted by Vitro under the Trade Competition Act and pointing out that it had strictly complied with the agreements signed by the two countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.
It is also noted that the country has submitted to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cross-border insolvency cases that guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Double-crossed carambots: a blow to Vitro and to the country.
General balance sheet
After months of failing to get to the news of the complaints by the Mexican air traffic unions against the former owner Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, who is accused of fraudulent administration, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Union of Pilots) has finally made progress.
The request, led by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has now brought criminal proceedings against the National Banking and Securities Commission, accusing it of obstructing the judiciary.
The Authority has subsequently systematically refused to inform the main administration of the Republic of a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from the F/589 bank of IXE's trust account in the name of Mexicana de Aviación.
The Commission has also decided to extend the period of validity of the agreement to the extent that it is not possible to grant the aid.
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart is surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a Caribbean University forum, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, businessmen and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we're talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the wall, supplemented by a living area for the employees of 150 companies.
In advance, Canacintra (the National Chamber of Manufacturing Industry) has managed to unite the governors of the Southeast to resist the monumental institution, which has partially destroyed protected areas and is the mother of all industrial threats.
ACTA is dead
Because the government has not complied with a request from the Senate to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican Ambassador to Japan signed the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, known in English as ACTA, the matter has already been filed, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken despite the fact that the Senate had disregarded the possibility because it considered them a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex in the long term
In order to pay long-term liabilities without prejudice to short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is launching over 500 million pesos of stock market certificates.
The issue is the first of four similar issues that promise interest payments every 28 days.
Establishment of Competival
A group of companies, comprising NYCE, e-Quálity and Kernet, leading information technology companies, was established under the name Competival, which aims to market the services of software clusters in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to over $1.5 billion.
Hector "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
Basketball's world champion, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been involved in basketball for more than 60 years and has traveled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large intellectual collection of the history of the country's basketball as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being confined to a wheelchair in 2008 due to a stroke, Rex was part of the sport for 6 years, whether as a lower-class player, first-class national player, full-time and manager in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the Basketball Association.
"I've put on a lot of hats in basketball my whole life, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the association in the 1990s", Reyes recalled visiting Primera Hora at his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife of more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life".
Reyes is not exaggerating with that statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photographs and memories of his long career, and they bear witness to it.
Bayamón in the heart
The most emotional memories are those of his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-manager or general manager of the club.
"Those were my best years, the ones I enjoyed the most, because I was allowed to be part of eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as a general manager, co-manager or coach.
It was a very fulfilling time, including five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy made his BSN debut.
"Cucco took over Ortiz, who was a very good manager", says Reyes.
I remember Gene Bartow, who was a coach here at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, telling me, "I have a very strong, two-meter player.
Do you want it?"
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and one of our best pitchers.
I remember him saying that if Mincy had made a championship possible for Bayamon, Gausse would have made another one.
The Vaqueros with Gausse championship was awarded to him, but from a distance, because he was already at the top of the league in 1988.
At the time, he preferred to enjoy his executions and Mincy's in the national team.
I remember the first time we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the United States.
Then came the 1990 World Cup, where we finished fourth, which was actually supposed to be bronze, if it wasn't for that Canadian referee who let us repeat the last game for the second time, Reyes said.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you've ever seen?
She's one of the best, like the one who won the 2004 Olympics against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team at the 1991 Pan American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and gave the U.S. team a fight, like when they won bronze against us at the World Championships.
Not only were Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and Piculín (Ortiz) back in the squad, but young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who was unable to attend in 1990 because of a knee injury.
One team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which brought us great joy was the pre-Olympic tournament in Neuquén, Argentina, in 1995.
With players like Canito Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner as replacements for the players who were banned because of the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against all odds.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without a doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the international level are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has ever dominated this level as Piculín.
And that's without taking into account his career in the various leagues he's played in.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
That's a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
I like Leo Arill's work with the boys.
What do you think is the best thing you've accomplished in the league?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which included the BSN in the early 1990s up to 17 teams in a season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their territory and only meet teams from other parts of the island in the national playoffs.
Today, children make unnecessary trips and games.
At least I see the results of the prescribed training and courses for coaches, table officials and referees.
I'm proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like to listen to music, watch music videos from my time on YouTube, enjoy my grandchildren, and occasionally go to a basketball game.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who was always by my side.
Larry Hagman is dead.
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931, in Forth Worth, Texas, and became world famous for his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R". in the television series "Dallas", where he played a ruthless, cunning and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the '80s, is dead.
He turned 81.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon of complications from cancer, according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved hometown of Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most", the family said.
Larry's family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas for Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played his wife in the original and sequel series, was with Hagman when he died in Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He made everyone who knew him happy.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving, and talented, and I'm going to miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest", Gray explained in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992, and he admitted to drinking a lot over the years.
In 1995, a malignant tumor was found in his liver, and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before Dallas, Hagman was known on television as a nice guy in the sitcom "Enchanting Jeannie" on NBC from 1965 to 1970.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "chin" (played by Barbara Eden) who will live with him in his home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, such as "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
His film work included critically acclaimed roles in The Group, Harry and Tonto and Primary Colors.
But it was his masterful interpretation of the charmingly disgusting J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The CBS television drama series about the Ewing clan and other figures in their surroundings aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The "Who shot J.R". advert, which was supposed to create the expectation of an emotional episode where Hagmann's character was nearly killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were betting in bookmakers.
This set a record for viewership at the time.
When the answer was announced in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers, turning "Dallas" into the second most watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (played by Mary Crosby) who shot.
J.R. had conceived her and threatened to expose her as a prostitute if she didn't leave town, but others had reasons to want him dead, too.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a treacherous businessman and an unfaithful husband who sought to have his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray) admitted.
"I know what to put on J.R.'s gravestone", Hagman said in 1988.
It should say, "Here lies the honorable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he hasn't won.
Victoria Principal, co-star of the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as a "huge figure on and off the screen".
He is unforgettable and irreplaceable to millions of worshippers around the world and remains in our hearts to those of us who have had the good fortune to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new Dallas episode were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT television channel.
The filming of five episodes for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was just being filmed, the broadcaster reported.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT as to how Hagmann's loss would be handled in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the New York theater stage in the early 1950s, then served in the Air Force in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met and married the young designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities have their homes.
In 2001, he published his memoir "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
"I didn't write anything I thought would hurt or affect anyone in any way", the Associated Press reporter said at the time.
After the liver transplant, he became a donor and volunteered at a hospital to help anxious patients.
"I advise them, give them courage, and meet them before and after their operations", he explained in 1996.
I want to give them some comfort, like, "Don't worry, it's a little uncomfortable the first time, but you'll be fine".
He also opposed smoking and took part in several campaigns.
Starting the course studying "The End of the World"
Each week, students study apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the professor of religion decided to take a course on the end of the world, he knew he had an irresistible fishhook: the end of the "long countdown" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the next two months: the devastating Hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmageddon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place Christian theorists believe the apocalypse begins.
"I didn't realize this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester ever", Charmé told students at Rutgers University in Camden, New Jersey, this week.
If anyone analyzes what has happened in the world today as if we were thirty days away from it, this would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
And he's not the only professor who's offering classes on the "end of the world" this semester, which is supposed to be the last in history.
At Temple, Assistant Professor Barry Vacker is teaching a course on media, culture and the end of the world.
Each week, students study apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and germs, and global warming.
"We analyze why these ideas spread over time", he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a particular human behavior.
If nuclear material gets into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed movies with apocalyptic content and examined how they compare to real life.
"I've tried to inform the students about what's possible, likely, credible and impossible", Vacker said.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, Professor of Latin American History Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an assistant professor of art history and anthropology, have teamed up to offer a course simply titled "The End of the World".
"We're not taking 2012 so we can always keep the option of re-starting the course in case the world doesn't end", Restall said.
Despite the "previous collapse", students must study, create projects and take final exams.
Penn State is taking the final exam on the eve of the apocalypse, so students have no choice but to "work until the night when the world is supposedly coming to an end", Restall said.
The courses were very popular.
"In two hours there were no more places", Restall said of his high-average student course, which was filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester, we received e-mails from students asking if there were still seats available.
The students, for their part, assure us that the course is one of the most interesting.
"It's fascinating to see what people do to comfort themselves", said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student at Rutgers-Camden School of Religion and Sociology in Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic sectarian or religious mentality is really just a matter of comfort or lack thereof.
The 25-year-old psychology and nursing student Will Wekesa says he's seen all the apocalyptic movies.
"I have never heard of a class where this is taught", he said.
I'm enjoying it.
But none of the students interviewed - let alone a professor - declared belief in the deadline of December 21.
"Our first project was about the Mayan prophecy, and in a certain way we discredit it", said Julie Zeglen, a 21-year-old West Chester Temple senior.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is just a key point in the calendar, Restall said.
He notes, however, that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that dates back several centuries when people responded to changes in their environment with predictions of the end of the world.
The Internet has increased these speculations.
"Otherwhere people don't think that way", he says.
This is especially the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University who teaches this year in the Philippines, quickly answers the question of whether he would have a course there on "the end of the world".
"The Philippines is not involved in the end of the world", he wrote, hinting at an exception from a higher court.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Reminding that the Last Judgment had been discussed for many days over the years, Restall said that when nothing happened on December 21, "people immediately thought of a new date" or philosophically thought that December 21 was the beginning of a seven-year period that would bring about the end of the world.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said they wanted to go to celebrate "the end of the world".
"Maybe I'll call a few friends and have a laugh", said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
