This not only confirms that certain dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but provides specific details that fossils generally cannot, for example, give us about colour and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's fur is a light brown color on the upper part with the underside being pale or carotenoid colored.
The study also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed stem, called a rachis, but had other feather features - spines and barbs - researchers concluded that the rachis was likely an evolutionary development of these other features that came later.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight purposes but rather to control temperature or for display. The researchers suggest that, although the tail was that of a young dinosaur, the sample showed feathers belonged to the adult and not the young.
The researchers suggested that, although it was a young dinosaur's tail, the sample showed adult feathers and not the delicate feathers of chickens.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was caused by tidal forces between the galactic dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts its gravitational pull on the earth and causes tides, so the Milky Way exerts its pull on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory says that dark matter throughout the galaxy lies around the galaxy in a kind of halo, and is made up of many small particles.

However, the driver has sustained a severe head injury.
The road at the scene is temporarily closed for emergency services to relieve the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya is already in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court on charges of murdering his son.
He's in custody pending arraignment and trial, but any witness evidence may have been contaminated because his picture was publicly released.
This is common practice elsewhere in the UK but the judicial function in Scotland is different and the courts consider the publication of the photo to be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dundee University said "Journalists are walking on dangerous roads if they publish photos and other items belonging to suspects".
The Crown Office, which is responsible for the entire prosecution, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the charges are laid.
Based on leaked documents, the document refers to a border dispute claimed by Palestine based on borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics covered reportedly include the future state of Jerusalem which is sacred to both countries and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demanded a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the agreement was signed while the PA agreed to a military presence for only five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control experiments need to be closely monitored by the rangers, while the experiments are monitored and evaluated for their effectiveness.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Shooting Sports Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited, under the Shooting Sports Association's hunting program.
According to Mick OFlynn, Acting Director of Park Conversation and Heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly was sworn in to the new nine-member Council of Election (CEP) yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
A presidential commission last month recommended the withdrawal of the previous CEP as part of a move to mobilize the country for the implementation of new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime unrest that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheated malfunctioning iPods have been reported, causing a total of six fires and four people to be lightly burned.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that they were aware of 27 accidents associated with the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had announced an additional 34 extreme warming events, but the company took it not seriously.
The ministry has responded by calling the delay in the report from Apple "very disappointing".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office says that no damage has been reported in the state.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino policeman has taken Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Some hostages have been rescued and at least six confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographer then took the old lady's place because she needed to use the restroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins had begun investigating premature births in his spare time.
His research showed that if given hormones it would accelerate the maturation of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reports that government investigators found two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer says "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager, Luna died on the night of the second moon, pretty unique as she was, a strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels commented on "My weird Luna may be more... fond of him and will miss him... may his soul rest in heaven".
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those in this poll think, would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last king of Australia.
At the extreme of the public opinion poll, 29 percent of those polled believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle events and in three sprint races at the Commonwealth Games, but her complaints led many to question her fitness.
He was unable to take the medicine needed to suppress his pain because it had been forbidden from the Resistance.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri has found the largest prime number to date on January 25.
Several people confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software in early February and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be the source of the water that's been delivered to Earth and the organic material that's been able to form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth forms, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month allowing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political talk and nonsense".
He is speculated to be the president in 2016.
NextGen is an FAA-mandated system that will allow aircraft to fly to shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology rather than older radar-based technologies to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately track the location of aircraft and provide more accurate information to pilots.
No additional transport is provided and the overground train will not stop at Wembley, while car parking and pick-up facilities are not available at the ground.
Fears of a lack of transportation raised the possibility that the games would be conducted without the team's support.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reports on the formation of a new species of bird in the Galápagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved after only two generations, although this process is believed to have taken much longer, due to cross-breeding between a Darwin-endemic finch, fortes Geospiza, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into many different forms, it can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled into thin threads, which can then be spun and woven. It can be beaten or sheared into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and it can be attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it can be used to decorate books with hand-drawn drawings called script split.
This is called chemical pH. You can generate a marker using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice will change color depending on how acidic or alkaline a chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of Hydrogen ions (the letter H in pH) in the tested chemical.
The hydrogen ion is a proton with an electron removed (because the hydrogen atom is composed of one proton and one electron).
Empty both dry powders and then, with clean, wet hands, clump the powder into a ball.
The fluid on the hand will react to the outer layer, which will feel strange and form a shell-like layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro have toilet facilities in almost every house connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, they became part of the public bathhouse where men and women mingled freely.
When you're calling someone thousands of miles away, that means you're using a satellite.
A satellite in space received the call and bounced it back down, almost instantly.
The satellite is launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because Earth's atmosphere interferes with our lighting and vision.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in a remarkable way, and its greatest contribution to us is the creation of easier and faster transportation.
It has brought us trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
Below them are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to vultures and roaches.
Finally, there are many small cats (including feral cats) that eat more small prey such as insects, rats, lizards and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the niche, a special task for each cat that prevents it from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social of the cats, and live in large groups called "lion packs".
A lions' pride is made up of one to three adult males, along with as many as thirty females and their young.
The women were always close to each other, as they were part of a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion Prides act much like a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are as fearsome in behavior as a lion (but not a big cat) and are also very dangerous to their prey.
Ready to attack, tigers can climb (though not very well), swim, jump for long distances and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, star tigers, and jaguars. Only four of these cats can growl.
The roar of a tiger is not like the roar of a lion, but rather a rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rambling, rallying, and so on and so forth.
The oselot tiger preys on small animals, and will catch monkeys, snakes, rats and birds if it can, and almost anything it hunts is much smaller than its size.
Scientists believe that the oselot stalks and hunts for food (mangsa) by means of its sense of smell, which is to inhale the soil it has passed.
The ocelot can see well using night vision, and also moves slowly. The ocelot hunts its prey by hiding in an environment that mimics its body color and then pouncing on its prey.
When small groups of organisms (small populations) become separated from the main population from which they originate (for example if they travel across mountains or rivers, or if they move to a new island so they cannot easily relocate) they often end up in a different environment than before.
These new environments have different resources and different competition, so new populations will need different characteristics or adaptations to become strong competitors than what they needed before.
The natives haven't changed at all, they still need adaptation just like before.
Over time, as new residents began to adapt to their new surroundings, they began to look less and less like other residents.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they are no longer of the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that is inhaled by humans and take in carbon dioxide that humans exhale (when breathing).
Plants produce food from sunlight through photosynthesis.
We build our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based.
The mosasaurus was the apex predator of its day, making it fearless of anything but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws are equipped with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an additional set located in its roof, which means there is no escape for anything that crosses its path.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and it may have fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, even a giant dinosaur like T. Rex would not be able to compete with it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans also had some strange or exotic food, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of mouse called a dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and women eat their meals sitting in chairs, the rich people like to make a feast together where they will relax on their side while they eat their meals.
Ancient Roman cuisine was unlikely to include foods brought to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, or tomato, or potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted a Dutch chicken.
The Babylonians had built primary temples for each of their gods which were considered the homes of those gods.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and the priests would try to fulfill the needs of the gods through various ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctum that is only allowed to the priest.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers called ziggurats were built to be part of such temples.
The tower's pinnacle served as a shelter for the deities.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house is no longer so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life took place in an open environment.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were just open counters facing the street.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was a very expensive resource.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and while on his way west, discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimos were already settled there at the time.
Although each country is 'Scandinavian', there are many differences in people, kings, culture and history between Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie "National Treasure", you might think of a treasure map inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true, and although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence is the original Declaration of Independence dated 4 July 1776. The text is inscribed below the document, inverted.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its life, this large documentary sticker (it measured 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
So it is possible that the notation was added only as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated the north of France, but the south had yet to be liberated.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, who had made a peaceful alliance with Germany in 1940 and had chosen to cooperate with the invaders rather than oppose them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, this attack was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France and turned toward the Germans.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together as a community.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, which is related to the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas meaning city or city, and it also defines the size of society.
Civilization marks the transmission of knowledge from generation to generation, the perpetuation of cultural traces and the equitable distribution of knowledge.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as a perfect civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government - with Congress as its only component - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax and, because there was no national judicial executive, it depended on the state, which often did not cooperate, to enforce all its acts.
It also has no right to veto taxation and interstate tariff laws.
This article required the unanimous consent of all the districts before they could amend and the districts took the central government lightly because their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were the winners of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, wheelchair hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are very popular in the North, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan contains nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands belonging to the State of Japan, the State of Japan rather than the geographical establishment, is usually referred to as the archipelago.
As early as the 15th century, Taiwan was first sighted and recorded by European traders who referred to the island as IIha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, transforming the native grain-producing practices and employing Chinese laborers to work the rice and sugar fields.
In 1683, Qing dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Three Rooms.
Most of the old buildings have been restored to give tourists an idea of how they looked originally.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu would have been restored and restoration work continues to this day
For example, the most common image format in the world is 35mm, which is equivalent to the dominant size of film at the end of the analog film era.
It's still produced today, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by digital camera image detection formats.
The 35mm format is actually, it's a bit confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided into twelve to get the easiest overall ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family formats) are similar or nearly identical to this aspect ratio.
The often misused and abused rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining orderly sizing in the image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection between the lines dividing the image into three vertically and transversally (see example).
During this period in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become very rich and powerful, began to be questioned.
For more than a thousand years, Christianity has bound the nations of Europe together despite the differences of language and custom.
His absolute power affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate poverty and misery and that church funds are specific to that cause.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years and the power of power and money had caused many to question whether this belief had been fulfilled.
Shortly after the battle, the British began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, though these blockades did not comply with the generally accepted international law embodied by several international treaties two centuries ago.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering the entire section of the ocean, causing danger even to ordinary ships.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, the Germans expected a response similar to that of unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most people and nations was one of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, some nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job offer with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his old workplace) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient Chinese had a unique way of representing different periods of time, each stage of China or each family ruling at that time had its own dynasty.
Between each dynasty there was also a period of regional instability and fragmentation. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period a fierce war was raging between several nobles who were vying for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was an era of bloodshed in ancient Chinese history. Thousands of dead men fought for the highest seat in the great palace of Xian.
The social and political implications would be such as the adoption of the metric system, the change from absolute to republican rule, and the awareness and spirit of nationalism that the state belongs to the people and not to a single leader.
And, after the Revolution, employment was opened to all male applicants allowing those most ambitious and successful to succeed.
So is the military because instead of ranking the military by class, it's now by caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
He was very interested in the things beyond this ordinary life. He often visited a cave later known as Hira in Mount Noor (light) to think.
He carved himself, enduring all the time, giving a very clear image of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Perched on a mountain peak north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
It's actually not that easy to find, even if you know it's there, but once you step into this cave, it's completely silent.
Nothing is seen but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, and only the whispering of the world can be heard or seen from inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the world still standing today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramid structures built to commemorate the deceased pharaoh.
On the Giza Plateau, or Nekropolis of Giza in Egypt's Valley of the Dead are several pyramids (among which the largest one), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The sign swipe up is similar to the letter V and swipe down is similar to the shape of a semicircle or a square with no bottom.
Up means you have to start at the end and push the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (the part where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
An up-bow usually produces a soft sound while a down-bow produces a louder, assertive sound.
Feel free to write your own signs, but keep in mind that the printed subjunctive signs are there for musical purposes.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Empress Marie Antoinette, their two small children (Marie Therese was 11 and Louis-Charles was four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a group of women in the market.
Riding in a carriage, they returned to Paris and were surrounded by a mob of shouting and shouting threats against the King and Queen.
A mob has forced the King and Queen to open wide their peephole windows.
Once a rioter lifted the head of the royal guard killed at Versailles in front of a terrified Empress.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover most of the expenses and floating bond interest on behalf of the Philippine government through the banking house of Wall Street.
Of course, the great profits connected with the continued exploitation of the Filipino people would be the fundamental profits of U.S. imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that gave rise to the Order.
The period in which the events occurred is known as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000 -1300)
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas that are held to be of practical application, from technological advancement or technological superiority to the assertive sense that human destiny is driven by logic associated with scientific laws manifested through technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has an effect on existing societies, rather than social conditions.
For example, one might say that motorized vehicles led to the construction of roads.
However, the nationwide road network was not viable for just a few cars, so new methods of production were developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
The very high car ownership also resulted in an increase in road accidents which led to the creation of new techniques in health care to restore injured body parts.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, inspired by authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped the individual, and with the passage of time emerged customs and cultures related to this geography. And this, which was more in harmony with the social position, better than the laws imposed by its arbitrary authority.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion center of the contemporary world, Constantinople is considered the center of feudal European fashion.
It was known as a center of luxury beginning around 400 AD and lasting until around 1100 AD.
Its declining status in the twelfth century was mainly due to the Crusaders who returned with gifts such as silk and spices worth much more than what was offered in the Byzantine market.
At this time the exchange of the title of Fashion Model from Constantinople to Paris was made.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.
At first the dress was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, the western style may be 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europeans began to develop their own styles. One of the biggest developments of the time as a result of the crusades was that people began to use buttons to tie clothes.
Self-agriculture is agriculture that is carried out to produce food for the needs of the farmers and their outlets.
Self-sowing farming is a simple, often organic, system that uses stored seeds that originate from a single ecological region and is combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in agriculture as a means of livelihood, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel they are being ignored by society's standards and allow them to develop their own identities.
Subcultures may be differentiated by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define different cultural branches may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, sexual politics, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a cultural branch often display their membership through certain styles symbolically, whether in the form of fashion, behavior, and language.
One of the most commonly used methods to describe the importance of socialization is to take into account some unfortunate cases of children being neglected, disadvantaged, or abused intentionally, not socializing with adults when they are growing up.
Such children are called feral or feral. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually the parents themselves); in some cases this child neglect is due to the parents rejecting the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaped.
Other children were allegedly raised by animals; some were said to live alone in the forest.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, a feral child will exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like that of the animal that cares for it, such as a fearful or indifferent nature towards humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process easier and more engaging, scaffolding provides much more than that.
A scaffold is not a way of learning but rather an aid that supports individuals through new learning experiences such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
A scaffold can be either virtual or real, in other words, a teacher is a kind of scaffold and so is the little paper clip guy in Microsoft Office.
Maya scrapes are integrated into the software and act to question, assist, and explain procedures that might be difficult for the student to handle themselves.
Children are placed with foster families for a variety of reasons that include neglect, abuse and even for extortion purposes.
No child should grow up in a careless environment, caring and educating, but they do.
We see the Maintenance System as a safety zone for these kids.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
A foster care should provide all the needs that cannot be provided in the home where the child is taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet bring an additional dimension in terms of approach to use and satisfaction.
For example, learning and social have been suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al, 1995).
Personal engagement and continuous engagement were identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements lasting several milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether someone is lying by interpreting small facial changes correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his work paper The President Speaks, showed how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He suggested that the ability to interpret human behavior might be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century studies have shown that there are two groups of genetic variation: the hidden and the manifest.
New genetic changes are the result of mutations and selection taking out from the set of changes that are highlighted.
Isolation and recombination have been reshaping the variation between the two groups with each generation.
In the savannah, it's very difficult for a primate with a human-like digestive system to meet the amino acid requirements of an existing plant source.
Moreover, failure to do so would have serious consequences: increased depression, unbalanced nutrition, and eventual death.
The most readily available plant source is the protein found in the legumes and beans, but this is difficult for primates like us to digest unless it's cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (chimps, ducks, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they provide high-quality protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors coped with their protein problems in the same way that the grasshoppers on the savannah do today.
A sleep disorder is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep briefly (10-60 minutes).
This can be done by simply using a silent alarm clock to awaken you without waking you up completely.
If you find yourself resetting the clock in your sleep, the clock can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking plenty of fluid (especially water or tea, the diuretic of which is unknown) before bedtime, forcing a person to get up to urinate.
The amount of calmness a person has in their soul is the opposite of the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the pressure, the more positive life spirits there are, and everyone has the potential to find true peace and contentment.
The only thing that's stopping us from achieving this is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddhism, but has been extended with the path of mahayana love and many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism has very simple principles, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
Kundalini energy (the energy of consciousness) is triggered with Kundalini Yoga through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualization.
The basis of Tibetan meditation is the Yoga of the Gods, depicting the various gods cleansing the energy channels, activating the chakras and creating inner awareness.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. By the end of the war, the clash of systems, processes and cultures had caused the two countries to split.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It will last for the next 40 years and will be fought in the flesh by proxy armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By September 17th, 1939, the Polish defences were shattered, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridge.
However, these plans became obsolete in the aftermath, after 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and formed the ranks of Belarus and Ukraine after invading eastern Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Neutrality Treaty, and other international, bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Using ships to transport goods was the most effective way to move large masses of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditionally, the Navy's job has been to ensure your country maintains its ability to move people and goods, while impeding your enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most famous recent examples of this was the WWII North Atlantic campaign. The Americans attempted to move people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, using U-boats, was trying to stop the traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have conquered Britain as well as the rest of Europe.
Goats appear to have been first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise them to get milk, fur, meat and skin more easily.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that grazed on hills or other pastures, often tended by goat herders who were usually children or teenagers, similar to the better known shepherds of today.
The pot was built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the track of the carriage consisted of only parallel wooden planks, it allowed the horse to pull it to reach a higher speed and to pull heavier loads than the rougher roads of the day.
Cross-linking was introduced relatively early to hold local tracks, but it was realized that the tracks would be more efficient if they had an iron rail on top.
This became a custom, yet the iron had rusted the wooden wheels of the cart.
In time, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron track was laid.
The first known transportation was walking, humans started walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
Their keepers, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright in their usual way.
Bipedal speciation is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is the same as treating the symptoms in many cases, but if we don't want to just have a temporary solution, then we have to find the root of the problem and get rid of it.
It's quite clear that the world is changing dramatically because of the advancement of human science and technology and the problems are getting bigger because of the overpopulation and the luxurious lifestyles of humans.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4th, a written draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few blocks away.
Overnight between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon on the lawn of the Independence Hall on July 8.
One was delivered to George Washington on July 6th, read to his troops in New York on July 9th, and the copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 wide-sided copies of the Dunlap book known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document, a handwritten copy of the original that is no longer extant.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and survived, and we call them birds.
Many people don't think it's a dinosaur because it has feathers and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that are very much like dinosaurs.
It had scaly legs and legs, laying eggs, and walking on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only contain one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and such numbers are known as binary numbers, or bits, in computer terms.
Internal poisoning cannot be quickly proven. Symptoms, such as vomiting are quite common so it cannot be diagnosed immediately.
The best indicator of internal poisoning may be the leftover of an open container of poisoned medicine or household cleaning materials.
Check the label for the first-aid instructions specific to that specific toxin.
The term pepijat is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
The term comes from an ancient custom of the pelican, an insect that has adapted well to become a parasite of humans.
Both the killer-wall and the massager-wall are artificial, adapted to live in nests or housing.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, the spinal cord and the optic nerves.
Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A married couple may decide that it is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In the process of adoption, the original parents terminate their parental rights so that the other spouse can take over as the child's parent.
The ultimate goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which is actually the guiding principle of most scientific research.
It is not alone, experimentation and experiments are tests used to rule out one or more of possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, especially, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's commentaries have been accepted in all areas of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the Western world found themselves withdrawn from learning the Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are typically strongly dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their derivation through the biological clock.
Periodic pulsation, which is not simply a response to a periodic external signal, has been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue to cycle independently even without external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiments are one of the main suggestions that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase have used faj, or virus, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They did two tests that marked whether the DNA in the fag was radioactive phosphorus or the protein fag was radioactive sulfur.
Mutations have a wide range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected and whether the cells involved are germ cells.
Only mutations in germline cells are passed on to children, while mutations in other areas can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism is the interest of people to visit natural areas with the aim of enjoying the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and learning about ecosystems.
For example, visit, take pictures, and learn about the Bornean orogeny.
Every morning, people leave small towns in their cars to go to work and are passed by others whose destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transportation, everyone, in some way, is involved and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Science now shows that a massive carbon economy has stripped the biosphere of one of its stable bases and once supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone participates in the association and uses the transport system. Almost everyone complains about the transport system.
In developed countries you don't hear similar complaints about the quality of water or a collapsed bridge.
Why is the transportation system causing such complaints, why is it failing every day? Is it because of inefficient transportation engineers? Or is there something wrong at the fundamental level?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because the behavior of the driver is not 100% predictable.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave in a fairly consistent manner; thus, traffic flows are also fairly consistent and can be represented roughly mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, designing, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to be taken up into the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back to the side of the body.
This gives them a wide area of small places to hide from predators.
Now, the only insects that can't fold their wings are the butterfly and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moves around the sun.
Some people think he is right but many believe otherwise; that the Solar System moves around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
This makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it holds more than eight times the water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at six miles wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller streams.
Although the pyramids continued to use stone until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza never exceeded their size and technical excellence of construction.
The ancient Egyptian New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the lowest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in law and official communication.
Italian is the daily language of most of those who work in the country while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because these can all be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made of a mixture of four or more elements: earth, water, wind and fire.
It's more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although it's also theorized that they transform into new matter to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
The size of an atom is so small that a few trillion of them could fit in a dot at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to many people when it was created.
Unfortunately, as newer methods of writing emerged, the pencil was relegated to a very low status and use.
People now write messages on a computer screen, without having to be near a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something more recent appears.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to fuse a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons.
It's like pulling a heavy weight over a hill, separating the nucleus once again and then releasing some of that energy.
Certain atoms have unstable nuclei which means they can be separated with little or no contact.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, and the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the high ground.
There may be more mares in the vicinity because the crust is thinner, making it easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory is all about finding out what makes people tick or what appeals to them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been met as they reach maturity as adults.
These theories look at what's inside a person that makes them want the things they want and the things in their environment that will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Hertzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can arise when managers start leading their former coworkers. At one end of the spectrum is an attempt to remain part of an old gang of friends.
Such managers face difficulties in making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary action, performance appraisal, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other hand, one would turn into an unrecognizable individual who felt that he had to change everything that the team had done and give it his own personal touch.
After all, the leader is responsible for the team's success and failure.
This behavior often causes friction between the leader and the other members of the group.
Virtual teams are held to the same standard of excellence as conventional teams, but the differences are not significant.
Virtual team members often serve as the point of contact for nearby physical groups.
They typically have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet in different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
The invisible team is the management team where all members report. This invisible team sets the standard for each member.
Why would an organization want to engage in the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organization?
When all the resources are used effectively across every functional part of an organization, creativity and intelligence can occur.
As a result, organizational processes working together to overcome barriers can lead to new innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as organizational knowledge sharing and learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiology data provide physical evidence of theoretical approaches to the investigation of cognition, thus refining the fields of research that make it more accurate.
The link between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their research.
It's been known for a long time that different types of brain injury, trauma, injury and tumors can affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong connotations with science fiction, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with attitudes, learning and intelligent adjustment in machines.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose customer answers and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Things like this have become a separate discipline, one that focuses on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in economics, medicine, engineering and military fields, as have been built into some home computers and video game software applications.
Study tours are a big part of any classroom. Often a teacher wants to take his students somewhere that cannot be visited by bus.
Technology offers a solution with virtual tours, where students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing a virtual tour is the best way to describe the tour and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year, students from North Carolina's Bennet School design a website about their visit to the state's capital, and every year the website is updated, but the old version is kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve student writing. While students often start their blogging experience with grammatical and spelling errors, the presence of an audience in general can change that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger started to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also forces students to be more aware of the world around them.The need to engage readers inspires students to write intelligently and interestingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs can provide opportunities for students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to internet materials, students can determine their position in the context of other people's writing and also outline their own perspective with related issues (Oravec. 2002)
Ottawa is Canada's bilingual capital of charm with a variety of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south is Niagara Falls and the northern part is the Muskoka Area of Natural Beauty and beyond that is not contiguous.
All of these things and more make Ontario a true Canadian experience for visitors from outside.
Large areas of the northern part are sparsely inhabited and part of it is a nearly uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that shocks many: There are more African Americans living in the U.S. than Canadians.
The East African archipelago is located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and the continent itself when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are separate countries, or attached to France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam into these lands and it has flourished in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
It is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that female travelers say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
There are advantages to wearing a ring (but not a ring that looks too expensive.
Women should be aware that cultural differences may result in what they consider a nuisance and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting people, and don't be afraid to stand firm (cultural differences or not, it doesn't matter!).
The modern city of Casablanca was discovered by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Moroccan sultans rebuilt cities such as Daru I-Badya and named it Casablanca by Spanish merchants who established a trade base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
It is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan items around the old Medina such as tagin, pottery, leather goods, shisha and various small jewels, but that's only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo in the far east near Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that flooded most of the streets of the city, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, any visit outside Goma should be studied to understand the state of ongoing warfare in the North Kivu region.
The town is also the site for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest Mountain Gorilla trekking in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congo Franc for the short trip.
Combined with its inaccessible location, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for an exotic and distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of deserts.
This was one of the main stops during the PBS special Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World.
This city is different from other cities in the country, because it has more Arab style than African.
Kruger National Park (NKP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones each supporting a different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the crown jewel of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there is a daily maintenance and admission fee for the park.
It can also be beneficial for one to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all of the South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the Hong Kong region its name and is a place considered a major focus by many tourists.
The row of buildings that decorate Hong Kong's skyline is likened to a glittering bar chart that is increasingly distorted by the reflection of Victoria Harbour's waters.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the opposite coast of Kowloon.
The majority of urban development in the Hong Kong archipelago is concentrated on land that stretches along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists took as their own and if you're looking for evidence of the history of colonization of this region, this is a great place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world with a total area of 80 km (50 mi) stretching from the coastline to the far inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forested part within the Indian enclave is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just a mangrove - it includes the last few remnants of the abandoned mangrove forest that covers the Gangetic plains.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which one-third is covered by water/wetland.
Since 1966 the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and is now estimated to have 400 Royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer living in the area.
Buses depart from the district's bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most of the main eastbound and Jakar/Bumthang buses depart between 6.30 and 7.30 am.
As the inter-district buses are always full, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most counties have the Japan Coast Bus service, which is comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that connects Oyapock River with the town of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and it has two aisles that are 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoint is expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most prominent indigenous group in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering crops and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Local of the Indian Giants", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquistadors with the indigenous groups.
The Spanish had begun a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve the character and identity of its original people.
Argentina is very famous for having one of the best teams and polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here in other years.
For news on the tournament or where to buy tickets for the polo match, check out Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP) whose value is set equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also commonly accepted.
In remote islands credit cards may not be accepted, although British and US currency may be taken; check with the owner beforehand to determine what payment methods are acceptable.
It's almost impossible to change the Falklands currency outside the islands, so change the currency before you leave.
Because Montevideo is south of the Equator, it experiences summer there while it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is subtropical; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winters can be confusing: temperatures rarely exceed freezing, but wind and humidity make them feel colder than the thermometer readings.
There is no specific rain and dry season, the amount of rainfall remains more or less the same throughout the year.
Although most of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be eaten or disturbed.
According to the park's authorities, keep 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wild animals!
How docile they look, bison, deer, moose, bear, and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them some space.
In addition, be careful because strong smells can attract the attention of bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking strong smelling food and always keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, with a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the site of a famous naval battle in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All but one of the ships were sunk, a British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German sailors were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the assassination of the most important Tupua chief Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, as Auckland stretches across two harbours.
The North Shore (in the North Harbour district) of the Pacific Ocean and extends from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming areas and mostly shade provided by pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in the Waitemata Harbour, on the outskirts of the upmarket towns of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
This is a family beach that is sometimes crowded with all sorts of shops along the shore.
The main local beer is Number One. It is not a complex beer, but is delicious and refreshing.
There are plenty of French wines available, but New Zealand and Australian wines are probably better.
Local tap water is safe to drink, but bottled water is easy to find if you're careful.
For Australians, the idea of a flat white coffee is foreign. A concentrated black coffee is an espresso, a cappuccino has a high cream (not foam) stack, and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is the standard Belgian equivalent, and the fruit juices are expensive but delicious.
The reef is visited repeatedly throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes are rare in the reef area.
However, seek advice from the authorities, observe all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Boxfish occur near the coast and near the estuary from October to April north of 1770. They are occasionally found outside these times.
Sharks do exist, they rarely attack humans, most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
The saltwater crocodile does not live in the ocean actively, its main habitat being in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Early booking gives travellers peace of mind that they have a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with a particular hotel, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation, such as camping sites, through a travel agent.
Typically, travel agents offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or packages that combine the hotel and the flight in one.
They can also make reservations for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Any amendments or requests should be sent through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the majority of those attending a music festival decide to camp on site, and most of the entourage considers this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get in early to get a tent site close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there may be a section of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some parties have special camping areas for families with children.
If crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as the ice-crossing cruise produces loud noises to those involved.
Saint Petersburg cruise includes time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions)
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Windows and clocks are usually missing and exits can be difficult to find.
They often have a special food, drink and entertainment offer, to keep guests in a good mood and keep them on premises.
Some places offer alcohol at home, but drunkenness can impair judgment, and all sober gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who is about to drive on high latitudes or across mountains should consider the possibility of snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
The icy and snowy road conditions cause low traction and you can't drive as if you were driving on a normal dirt road.
During a blizzard, you can be covered by snow in no time.
The range of vision may also be limited by falling or blown snow or through condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, snow-covered and cold weather is normal in most countries, and traffic is mostly smooth year-round.
The safari is Africa's biggest tourist attraction and a highlight for many visitors.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to a journey by land to see the breathtaking African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars and standard equipment that allows for good views.
Lions, cheetahs and star tigers sometimes feel frightened and you'll see these animals better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a bush walk, hiking safari or footing) involves an adventure, whether for a few hours or a few days.
The Paralympics will run from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted once in 1964.
If you book your 2020 flight and accommodation before the delay is announced, you may face a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus-based cancellation policies did not take effect until July 2020 when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with regular tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Drying damp clothes can help to dry them out. Many hotels provide steric and steric boards for borrowing, although they are not provided in the room.
If there is no iron, or you do not like to wear sterilized stockings, you can try using a hair dryer, if available.
Please take care not to let the fabric become too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, fire).
There are many ways to filter water, but certain methods are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in others a few minutes is required.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you're worried, you should consider buying bottled water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that they are not used to seeing in their home countries.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or worse cause allergic reactions, spread lice or spread infections.
Self-infectious diseases or dangerous animals can injure or kill people forcibly, never confirming as a pest.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in a particular location.
Tourists heading to heavily taxed states can sometimes save money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont provides the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently passes through remote wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, beware of the steep, grade, narrow lanes, and sharp curves that dominate.
The announcement speeds are distinctly lower than the preceding and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and strict adherence to them is even more important than the others.
Surprisingly, cell phone service is more robust here than in other parts of the trail, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
The pastries in Germany are quite tasty, and the Bavarian pastry is rather sweet, rich and varied, similar to the pastries found in its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastry is a common delicacy, with apples being pastry all year round, as well as cherries and plums appearing in summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts.
If you want a small but fatty pastry, you can try pastry named after the region of origin such as Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.
Curry is a herbal and spicy dish cooked with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either dry or wet depending on the amount of liquid.
In the northern temperate regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without qualification, the term means food originating from the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Now found throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine presents a variety of simple dishes, typically consisting of Javanese favourite flavours of peanuts, chilli, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various kinds of aromatic spices.
The rack is a support for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
It provides more stability for the rider but there is a safety risk due to the potential for the rider's legs to get stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but his foot is caught on the raking, he will be dragged if the horse escapes.
First, most riders wear boots with flat, rather narrow heels and soles.
In addition, some saddles, especially British saddles, have a safety bar that allows the foot pedestrian to drop the saddle if pulled back by the rider.
Cochamó Valley - Chile's main climbing destination, known as South America's Yosemite, with its many large walls and granite canyons.
The lighthouse includes a magnificent view from the summit, and climbers from all over the world continue to build new routes between all its endless walls.
Hill-climbing sports involving skiing and snowboarding are popular sports involving skating over snow-covered surfaces with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is the main activity of the trip with many enthusiasts, sometimes known as ski-walkers planning the entire vacation around skiing at a particular location.
Skiing has been around for a long time  paintings on caves depicting skiers since 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: This activity is also known as skiing in the interior, ski touring or ski touring.
It is related but usually does not involve alpine-style skiing or mountain climbing, mountain climbing is done on steep terrain and requires harder skis and shoes.
Think of a ski trail as being analogous to a hiking trail.
In good weather you will cover a distance farther than on foot - but very rarely will you get a cross-country skiing speed without a heavy backpack in a neat lane.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through various countries means having to go through visa applications and passport controls several times.
