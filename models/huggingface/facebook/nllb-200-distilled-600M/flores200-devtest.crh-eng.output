The equation stream is the outline of the movements of the individual drivers and the transportation systems between the two points and the effects of one-to-one flow.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to determine the flow of traffic because it is impossible to predict the driver's behavior with one hundred percent certainty.
Well, the travellers have been drawing themselves into a fairly consistent range; thus, a logical sequence of transport flows has been discovered and mathematically determined.
For a better estimate of the flow of the comparator, links were established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) frequency and (3) frequency.
These help with gardening, road construction planning, animal planning and operation.
