This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already known, but provides details that cannot normally be provided by fossils, such as color and three-dimensional presentation.
According to scientists, the animal had brown feathers on its upper part and a pale or carotenoid feathers on its lower part.
This discovery also gives us an idea of the evolution of bird pups.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed central axis, which is called a rachis, but share with the structure of today's feathers other features, such as the bones and beards, the researchers concluded that rachis may have been a later evolutionary development than these features.
The structure of the birds suggests that they were not used for flight but rather to regulate temperature or for appearance.
The researchers felt that although this is the skull of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows a growing feather and not a tiny bird's nest.
A car bomb exploded yesterday morning in the Gaziantep police district of Turkey killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.

The brightness and rotation are used together to determine the number of Rossby stars that are related to plasma flow.
The smaller the value of the Rossby number (Ro), the less active the star is in reversing the polarity of its magnetic field.

The work was more theoretical, although the program was designed to simulate observations of the Arrow's galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for could be caused by the battery forces between black matter in the galaxy and black matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts gravitational force on the earth and causes baths, so the Milky Way exerts gravitational force on the star of Arrow.
Scientists have concluded that black matter has an effect on other black matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the black matter around a galaxy is in the shape of an aureole and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
He stated in an interview that the new variant was "very disturbing and alarming because of the very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have been infected with the virus in the hospital, says Dr. Molly, and at least two were hospital health workers.
Within a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, the percentage of XDR-TB in the entire TB group appears to be still low; 6,000 out of 330,000 people in total infected at any given time in South Africa.

The government has also promised several million bottles of the anti-encephalitis vaccine, which will help health agencies prepare for the coming year.
Plans to distribute vaccines to the most historically affected areas were delayed this year because of a lack of funds and less priority given to other diseases.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters are isolated in a booth and put a pre-printed sheet of paper in the envelope identifying the chosen candidate.
After officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot.
French electoral law strictly defines procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be visible so that voters and observers can prove that they do not contain any envelope before the start of the vote and that no envelope is added except for those of duly numbered and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives as witnesses to any part of the process. Votes are counted in the evening by volunteers under strict supervision, following the appropriate procedures.

The accused are Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police inspector Chandra Shekar Solanki said the accused arrived in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car collided with him, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the crash occurred was temporarily closed as emergency services released the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Greyt Jarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoja has been charged with murdering her son in Edinburgh's first-degree court.
She's in custody awaiting recognition of the charge and the start of the trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be corrupted because her image has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice found in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and the courts have considered the publication of the photographs as potentially biased in the case.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "journalists appear to be taking a dangerous turn if they publish photos, etc., of suspects".
The Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of all criminal prosecutions, told reporters that no further comment would be made at least until the indictment is announced.
According to reports, the document will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wanted along the borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics covered are thought to include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel, until the signing of this agreement, requires a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, while the Palestinian authorities agree to allow their presence for only five years.
Residents had to be closely monitored by guards during the additional pest control test, as the test was monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness.
In a partnership between the National Park and Wildlife Service and the Sport Writers' Association of Australia, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sport Writers' Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, deputy director for Park Protection and Heritage at NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation have been given expanded instructions for their safety and training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth Interim Electoral Council for Martel in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Interim Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country toward new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the election's delay, some of which have been expected since 2011.
Some 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overloads have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been notified of 27 equipment-related accidents.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced last week that Apple had informed it of 34 other over-the-counter incidents, which the company called "unseemly".
The ministry responded by calling the delay of the report by Apple "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (Friday at 09:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Emergency Management Office said no injuries were reported at the site.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has held hostage Hong Kong tourists by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have so far been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released, along with the first Filipino photographers.
Photographers later grabbed an elderly woman's seat after she had to go to the bathroom.
LeGinès followed his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Lindsay began to research premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered, it would speed up the maturation of the fetal lungs of the baby.
Xinhua reported that state investigators found two black box flight recorders on Wednesday.
You've been honored by your peers around the world.
Tommy Drimer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died two months later.
Dustin "Goldast" Ranelson commented that "Luna was as strange as I was... perhaps even more... I love her and will be proud to... hope she's in a better place".
In a poll of 1,400 people ahead of the 2010 federal election, opponents of Australia's return to the republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed the state of Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share the view that they want Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
In the survey's stark responses, 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was to swim the 100 and 200 metres freestyle and three relay at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his physical form was not safe.
He hasn't been able to get the right tools to beat his pain, as they're banned from the Games.
Kurtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known simple number to date on January 25.
The discovery was verified by many people using different devices and software in early February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water to the earth, along with organic matter that can make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially how the Earth was formed by a long-standing cometary collision.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political bullshit and stupidity".
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, will allow planes to travel on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to the older technology that relied on ground-based radar, to allow air traffic controllers to locate the aircraft more accurately and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional means of transport will be introduced and overhead trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parking facilities, as well as parking and travel, are not available for the playground.
Fear of lack of transport increased the possibility that the game would be played with doors closed without the support of the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Upsalas University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in only two generations, although this process was thought to have lasted longer, due to the cross between a Darwin endemic shrew, the strong Geospiza, and the arrival shrew of the cactus, the Geospiza conirostris.
The flower can be worked in all shapes.
It can be pulled and made into thin wire, which can then be twisted and torn, hammered or laminated into sheet metal.
It can be over-polished and mixed with other metals, and it can be so polished that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "Lighted Handwriting".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red lacquer juice.
The lacquer's color changes depending on the acid or base (alkaline) level of the chemical.
The pH level is evidenced by the amount of hydrogen ions (H-at pH) in the analyzed chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been removed from electrons (as hydrogen atoms are made up of an electron and a proton).
Mix two dry powders and then, with wet and clean hands, squeeze to form a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give you a strange feeling and form a kind of convexity.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had drainage toilets in almost every apartment, connected to a rather complex black water system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of black water systems have been found.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Toilets, in Roman civilization, were sometimes part of mixed public baths for men and women.
When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The space satellite takes the call and then returns it, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
To launch a satellite or telescope into space, a giant rocket over 100 feet [100 ft] is needed.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways, and the most important thing the wheel has brought to us is that it has provided us with a much faster and much easier mode of transportation.
She brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are larger than average cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and woodpeckers.
As a result, there are many small cats (including free-moving domestic cats) that eat far more small animals such as insects, mammals, reptiles, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a comfortable dog, a special function that every cat has that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable felines, living in large groups called herds.
The females are one to three adult male relatives, along with up to thirty female rabbits.
Women, being part of a large family of sisters and daughters, are generally more closely related to one another.
Lions behave like herds of wolves or dogs, animals with behaviours that are oddly similar to lions (but not to other large cats) and also very lethal to their prey.
As a well-prepared athlete, a tiger can climb (though not so well), swim, jump long distances, and pull in the strength of five powerful men.
The tiger is in a group with lions, leopards, and jaguars, the only four cats that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full roar of a lion, but rather is like a word-for-word with hunger and screaming.
The ocelots like to feed on small animals, and when they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, breeds of birds, and almost all the animals that hunt the ocelot are much smaller than it is.
Scientists think that ocelots track and find the animals (their prey) through the wind, smelling where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and move very stealthily as well.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (such as if they cross a strait or river, or if they go to a new island so they cannot easily return), they will often find themselves in a different environment from where they have been before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than a previously needed competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can't be considered the same species.
This process is called specialization, which simply means the creation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans absorb and absorb carbon dioxide that humans release (i.e., they release by breathing).
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also make shadows.
We build houses with plants and we make clothing with plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals would not survive.
Mosasaurus was the super predator of his time, so he was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
His long jaws were filled with over 70 sharp bristles, along with an extra set in the sky, meaning that nothing that awaited him could escape him.
We do not know for sure, but he may have had a tongue like a pirun, including turkeys, large fish, other unassorted animals, and may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex could not defeat it.
Although we would have known most of their food, the Romans had quite a few strange or unusual items for feasting, including wild boar, pallo, ants, and a breeder called ger.
Another difference was that while poor men and women ate their food sitting in chairs, rich men enjoyed eating together at the inn, where they ate their meals lying in the ice.
The times of the ancient Romans may not have included food that came from the Americas or Asia to Europe during the centuries that followed.
For example, they had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, cocoa, and not even an ancient Roman ever tasted sea green.
The Babylonians built a major temple for each of their gods called the house of God.
The people offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to provide for the needs of the gods through festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, and then an inner courtyard where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called zigurates, were built as part of temples.
The tower tower was a special feather for the god.
Housing was not so important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Life in the Jewish family was mostly outdoors.
Women made their grass in the courtyard; shops were just open sports fields with a view from the street.
The land of Canaan was not forested, so the cost of woodland was extremely high.
Greenland was sparsely settled. In Scandinavian legends, it is said that Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, on his travels westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, the Eskimos were already living there at that time despite its discovery.
Although each country was "Scandinavian", the customs of the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differed widely among the people, kings, and peoples.
If you've seen the movie "The National Treasure", you might think that behind the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence was written "The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776".
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence, the large parchment document (about 1,300 inches [293⁄4 inches] by 1,400 inches] was collected as a scroll to preserve it.
For this reason, it is possible that the mark is only used as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the French of the Vichy regime, who in 1940 had chosen to make peace with the Germans and cooperate with the invaders rather than fight them.
The Allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was renamed Operation Dragon.
Within two weeks, the Americans and the forces of the French freedom movement had liberated the South of France and were moving on to Germany.
Civilization is a distinct and shared culture of a fairly large group of people who live and work in cooperation, a society.
The word "civilization" is derived from the Latin word "civilis" meaning "civil", which is related to the Latin word "civis" meaning "citizen" and "civitas" meaning "city" or "city-states", which in a sense also defines the size of society.
Civilizing culture means the transmission of knowledge across generations, a continuous cultural trail and a just spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as true civilizations.
During the American War of Independence, the thirteen colonies first formed a weak central government - with Congress as its sole structure - under the Confederate branches.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, since it had no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, which were often non-cooperative, for enforcing all its laws.
He also had no jurisdiction to violate laws on taxes and tariffs between states.
The mothers sought unanimous approval from all states before they could change, and states took central government so seriously that their representatives were often lacking.
The Italian national football team, like the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and, in 2006, they were the champions of the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, soccer, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, wheelchair hockey, and F1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, starting with Italians competing in both international games and Olympic activities.
Japan contains nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the grouping/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, geographically, as an "archipel".
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors who passed through recorded the island's name as "Formosa Island" or "Beautiful Island".
The Dutch East India Company established a base in Southwest Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation of local grain production practices and employing Chinese workers on its sugar rice plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty forces (1644-1912) took control of the coastal areas in western and northern Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing Dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which gave Taiwan sovereignty to Japan, which ruled until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main buildings, specifically: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Three Window Room.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they originally looked like.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored by 1976, and restoration continues today.
For example, the most common static photography format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film wind.
It continues to be produced today, and above all, in the same formats inherited from the image sensor of a digital camera.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat twisted, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest ratio with integers) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS family of formats) are the same or very similar to this visual ratio.
The rule of thirds, often abused and derided, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism by keeping a degree of order in an image.
It specifies that the most effective place for the main subject is to cross the lines that divide the image into a table vertically and horizontally (see example).
At this time in European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, was seen with an investigative eye.
For over a thousand years, the Christian faith had bound European nations together, despite differences in language and customs.
His power, felt everywhere, affected everyone from the king to the common people.
One of the main dogmas of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the funds of the church's money are there specifically for that reason.
The principal organs of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money made many doubt whether this principle was being applied.
Immediately after the start of the military struggles, Britain launched a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective, disrupting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which had been codified by some international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all ships from entering all parts of the ocean, endangering even non-navigating ships.
With little response to this tactic, Germany hoped for a similar response to its war without submarines.
The dominant positions of most citizens and nations during the 1920s were pacifism and isolationism.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a future similar situation.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the U.S. with only 4 cents in his account, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a rare way of telling different periods of time; every stage of China or every family that had power was a known dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty there was an unstable period with separate provinces. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms era that lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce battle ensued between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, in which thousands died in the battle to occupy the highest office in the great palace in Xian.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were also opened up for all male applicants, enabling the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
This is also true of the military because instead of ranking the army based on categories, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class peoples in other lands to launch their own revolutions.
Muhammad was mostly interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often went to meditate in a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (the gate).
The very cave that has survived the times gives a very vivid reflection of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
This cave, located on the top of a mountain in northern Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find it, even if you know it exists.
You can see nothing but the clear and beautiful sky above and the many mountains around you, and from within the cave you can see or hear only very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the dead Pharaoh.
The plains of Giza or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt have several pyramids (the largest of which is the Pyramid of Cheops), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Kufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Kufu's women and family members.
The upper arch is V-shaped and the lower arch is a wire-grabbing or a square without the lower edge.
"Upper" means to start up and push the bow, and "lower" means to start at the ring (which is where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
The upper lobe generally produces a softer sound, while the lower lobe is stronger and more stable.
You can keep your notes, but remember that the printed marks are there for musical purposes, so they usually have to be respected.
Terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Therese aged 11 and Louis-Carl aged four) and the king's sister, Lady Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of merchants on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a chariot, surrounded by a crowd of people who were coughing and moaning threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their chariots fully open.
In an instant, a member of the crowd turned the head of a royal guard who had been killed in Versailles before the terrified Queen.
The cost of the American imperialist war to conquer the Philippines was paid for by the Filipino population itself.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a significant portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds was floated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Of course, the surplus gains from the over-exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main gains of American imperialism.
One must understand the circumstances that prompted the creation of the order to understand the Templars.
The period of time when events occurred is commonly referred to as the Middle Ages, the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (years 1000-1300 CE).
The Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages and were followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended in agreement around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, from the technological impetus or necessity of technology to the narrow sense that human destiny is guided by a basic logic that relates to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two main ideas: that the development of technology itself goes beyond cultural or political influence and that technology, on the other hand, has "influences" on societies that are natural, socially unconditional.
One might say, for example, that the automobile is conducive to improving roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for only a small number of vehicles, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of owning cars.
Large-scale vehicle ownership also leads to higher rates of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new health care techniques for repairing damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a prominent element of cultural determinism, brought by writers such as: Goths, The Fellowship of the Ring.
In the context of Romanticism, geography enveloped people and over time cultural customs associated with that geography were born, and, since they were in harmony with the place of society, they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of today's world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 C.E. and lasted until about 1100 C.E.
Its position fell during the twelfth century, largely because the Crusaders had returned with gifts such as silks and spices, which were valued more highly than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, the title of fashion capital was also transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At first, clothing was heavily influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
However, as a result of slow channels of communication, Western styles may be 25 to 30 years behind us.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a style of sailing. One of the greatest developments of the time that came as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use saws to sew clothes.
Existential agriculture is agriculture that is applied to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Existential farming is a simple, often organic system that uses native seeds combined through crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield growth.
Historically, most farmers have engaged in subsistence farming, and the situation remains the same in many developing nations.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel disregarded by social norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinguished by ethnicity, age, location, class and/or gender of members.
The distinguishing criteria of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender, geographical or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their membership by using in a distinct and symbolic way the style that includes fashions, manners, and sarcasm.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the misfortunes of children who, because of neglect, accident, or deliberate abuse, have not socialized with adults as they grow up.
Some wild children are restricted by humans (usually their parents); this abandonment of the child was in some cases due to the parents' disapproval of the child's severe intellectual or physical disorder.
Wild children may have been victims of severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or abandoned.
Others are said to have been raised by animals, and some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, the wild child manifests behavior (within physical limits) almost identical to that of the particular caring animal, such as: his fear or indifference to humans.
While the project-based learning method should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding-based learning takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a support tool that provides support to people who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scales can be virtual and real, which means a teacher is a kind of scale, but so is the little person in the letter-taker line at Microsoft Office.
Virtual scales are adopted by software and are intended to investigate, promote, and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty handling alone.
Children are sent to the child's home for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, even blackmail.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, caring, and educational, but they are growing up that way.
We consider the Child Protective System a safe area for these children.
Our care system is expected to provide loving care, safe housing, safe health care, and continuing education.
The care is supposed to provide all the missing needs of the house where they were before.
The Internet is interconnected as much as the elements of mass communication as it is the interpersonal elements.
The unique features of the Internet lead to other dimensions regarding access to uses and pleasures.
For example, "student" and "socialization" are proposed as important incentives to use the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal engagement" and "continuous relationships" were also identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they observed how audiences reacted to websites.
The use of video recordings has brought important discoveries to explain micro-expressions and facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect if a man is lying by correctly interpreting his mimics.
In his "The President's Speech", Oliver Saks showed how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess honesty.
He even thought that such abilities to explain human behavior could be possessed by animals such as, for example, domestic dogs.
Studies of the 20th century have shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
The mutation adds a new genetic variant and selection removes it from the group of expressed variants.
Exclusion and recombination repeatedly mix the variation between two groups with each generation.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans finds it difficult to meet its amino acid needs through savannah plant resources.
Failure to do so also has serious consequences: slower growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would be proteins from leaves and plants, but primates like us have a hard time digesting them if they're not cooked.
In contrast, animal-derived foods (millings, termites, eggs) not only are easily digested but also provide large amounts of protein that have all the amino acids needed.
Given all the things, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" to some extent as chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep after a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively low-volume clock to bring you in without you being completely awake.
If you find yourself resetting your sleeping clock, you can put it on the other side of the room to force you out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythmic options include drinking enough fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed to force someone to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person has is in harmony with the level of tension in his body and soul.
With the decrease in tension, the current life force increases, and each individual has the opportunity to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Anyone can access the light, and the only thing that's holding us back is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but was further enriched by the theological thought of the Mahayana "way of love" and more Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It includes yoga, kundalini, meditation, and the path of all-inclusive love.
With Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of lighting) is awakened through yoga positions, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is divine yoga, where the visual representation of several gods cleanses the channels of energy, activates the chakras, and creates the consciousness of enlightenment.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, bringing cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, the clashes of system, process and culture led to the strife of states.
Two years after the war ended, the former Allies had become enemies, and the Cold War was about to begin.
It would continue for the next 40 years and be fought really, really by authorized armies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia to Afghanistan to Cuba and many other countries.
By September 17, 1939, Polish defenses had already been broken and the only hope was withdrawal and reorganization along the Romanian front.
However, these plans fell out of use almost overnight, when over 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers entered and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after occupying the regions of eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Nonaggression Pact and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is currently the most efficient way to move large quantities of goods and people across the ocean.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time interfering with the ability of enemies to move people and goods.
One of the last major examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign in World War II, when the Americans were trying to move people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German fleet was trying to stop traffic by using mostly submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain, as had happened to the rest of Europe.
Apparently, the gods were first softened about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy consumption of milk, milk, meat, and skin.
Domestic sheep were generally kept in herds that grazed hills or other pasture, often under the care of herdsmen who were usually children or adolescents, more or less the same as the better-known herdsmen.
Carriageways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages were made of parallel wooden beams only, they allowed horses to pull them for greater speeds and to pull larger loads than on the slightly more difficult roads of the time.
Travers were introduced early enough to replace the shells, but gradually it became clear that the shells would be more effective if they had an iron plate on top.
This became common practice, but the iron consumed more of the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first wheels were introduced entirely of iron.
The first known means of transport was walking; people began walking two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means man on foot).
Their ancestors, the australopithecus, did not walk normally.
Adaptations to two-legged walking have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although sahelantropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living with more respect for the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is the same as treating symptoms, but we need to find the cause of the problem and activate it if we want only a temporary solution.
It is clear that the world has undergone great changes because of human advances in science and technology, and problems have increased because of overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of mankind.
Following its approval by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Tomson was sent several blocks further to John Dunlap's press desk.
Overnight, 150 to 200 copies were made of what are now known as "The Dunlap Flakes".
The document's first public reading was on July 8 by John Nixon in the lobby of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, who read it on July 9 before his troops in New York.
The 25 Dunlap leaflets known to exist to date are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today think that a group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Many people do not view them as dinosaurs, since they are feathered and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have legs with fins and scales, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex dinosaur.
Almost all computers in use today rely on manipulating information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and, in computer language, these numbers are referred to as binary numbers or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, but symptoms such as seizures are common enough to be diagnosed immediately.
The presence of an open box of toxic drugs or household chemicals may be the clearest sign of intoxication.
Check the label for specific instructions for quick relief for that particular poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term cinder in its official sense.
The term originates from the generous resemblance to bed bugs, which are highly adapted insects to parasitize humans.
Both killer insects and bed bugs are non-nidiole, adapted to live in the fallow or in the shelter of their carriers.
Across the United States, there are nearly 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most important neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples may decide to prepare an adoption plan for their baby.
In one adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which actually leads most of the scientific research.
But it is not the only one; scientific study also guides experimentation, and experimentation is the evidence used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all scientific matters, including psychological ones.
As the knowledge of the Greek language fell, the West found itself cut off from the Greek roots of philosophy and science.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles as well as their production by biological clocks.
For most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, occasional rhythms have been documented that are not simply a response to occasional external signs.
The biological clocks are independent oscillators that will continue a period of free-moving cycles, even when external signals are absent.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses, or phages, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They did two experiments in which they marked the DNA of radioactive phosphorus bacteria or the protein of radioactive sulfur bacteria.
Mutations can have a variety of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material being affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only germline cell mutations can be passed on to children, and mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in going to nature areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of field activities include fishing, hunting, photography, bird watching, park visits, and the study of information about the ecosystem.
One example is the development of visits, photography, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave towns by car to go to their workplace, and other people pass by, whose workplace is the country they just left.
In this dynamic roll-off of transportation, everyone is connected in some way and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
Now science shows that a massive carbon-based economy has caused the biosphere to shift from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
They're all social participants and they use transportation systems.
In developed lands, such complaints about water quality or poor bridges are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems cause these discomforts, why do they fail every day? Are they just incompetent transport engineers? Or is something more important happening?
Traffic mobility is the study of the movement of particular drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to operate within a steady time frame; therefore, traffic flows can be approximated mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, links have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This coordination helps in the planning, design and use of road facilities.
In animals, insects were the first to fly, and their ability to fly helped them to avoid predators more easily, to find food, and to mate more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to spread their arms backward along the body length.
This gives them a greater number of smaller places to be robbed by predators.
The only insects today that cannot spread their wings are the butterflies and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the Sun (and other stars), moved around the Earth.
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river on Earth and the first wideest, flowing eight times as much water as the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on earth, at six miles wide in some cases.
Almost 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 3,980 miles [63,887 km] long, collecting the water of thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the scale and technical perfection of the pyramids of Giza was never exceeded.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the monuments of their ancestors, which were at that time much older than a thousand years.
The Vatican has a population of about 800, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the daily language of most of the state's workers, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have had knowledge since antiquity of basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, as they can all be found in nature in their original forms and extracted relatively easily from mines by primitive means.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed the theory that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, air, water, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also developed the theory that they transform into new matter to create anything we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. There are, of course, metals like silver and gold.
You can also make alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them can be spotted at the end of this sentence.
In this way, with his invention, the spider became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of newer writing methods, the status and use of pen has fallen.
People now write messages on computer screens without ever having to use a flash drive.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes out.
An atomic bomb operates on the principle that the fusion of several protons and neutrons with a nucleus requires energy.
It's like putting a heavy carriage up a hill, separating the core from the first one releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to separate on their own or with a slight burst.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer surface of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side of the moon.
It is thinner under the dark areas of the Mariana and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more lakes on the near side because the grass is thinner.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people choose or attract them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that hold them in place as they age.
These theories analyze what makes some people want the things they want and what things in their environment will or will not push them to do certain things.
Two widespread theories of content are Maslov's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start to lead their former colleagues: One side of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the boys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unusual decisions, setting disciplinary measures, making performance assessments, assigning tasks and responsibilities to everyone.
On the other end of the spectrum, one of them easily turns into a stranger who thinks he or she should change everything the team has done and adopt it.
Ultimately, the manager bears the ultimate responsibility for the team's success and failure.
Often, this behavior causes division between the manager and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to have the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more independence than traditional team members, as their teams may meet by different time zones, which may not be understood by their local administration.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of a real "invisible squad" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
The invisible team is the management team where each member reports.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating an education organization? One goal for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional sectors of an organization, creativity and skill can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome a barrier can lead to a process of recovery to serve the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, and as a result, they narrow the scope of research and make it much more accurate.
The mutual link between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their studies.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury, and cancer affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
It gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which helps us understand our mind processes.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has taken on strong nuances in science fiction literature, artificial intelligence is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of a machine.
AI research involves the creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, scheduling, ownership of answers to client diagnoses and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, facial voice.
These things have become special disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as it has been incorporated into some personal computer and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of any teaching methodology, and it is often the case that a teacher expresses a desire to send her students to places where they cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers virtual field trips, where students can visit museum artifacts, view an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Virtual field co-operation is also a great way to think about a trip and share experiences with the next classes.
For example, every year students at Bennett High School in North Carolina create a website dedicated to their travels to the capital, this website is updated every year, but the old versions are still stored online as a memory block.
Blogging can also help improve the way students write. While students often start their blog experience with careless grammar and writing, having a general audience changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger has begun efforts to improve writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "forces students to become more mindful of the world around them". The need to feed the audience's interests inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their knowledge beyond their traditional school day.
Using blogs in the right way "can help students become more critical and analytical. Through active responses to online materials, students can define their positions regarding the writings of others, as well as define their views on particular issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's attractive bilingual capital city which has a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south is the Niagara Falls, and to the north is the untapped natural beauty of Muscovy and beyond.
All of these and many more present Ontario with elements considered by foreigners to be the most typical of Canada.
The larger areas further north are sparsely populated, and some are almost deserted and uninhabited.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, along the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island and continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands and it had a great influence on the Comoros and the Mayotte Islands.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, after Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Road from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual family situation.
It will help you even if you come with a ring (not just one that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural change can cause what they consider harassment and stalking, grabbing, etc. It's not uncommon.
Be bold when rejecting men and do not be afraid to hold your position (even if it is due to cultural changes, it does not mean that it is okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by the Imazighen fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E. and was exploited by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Meremedes as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it, renaming it Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru-i-Badia and it was named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established a trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to do a picnic in all of Morocco.
Around Old Medina, you can easily find places that sell traditional Moroccan products such as tagina, ceramics, leather goods, garlands, and a whole range of decorations, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo on the eastern edge near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava of the Niragongo volcano that covered most of the city's streets and especially the city center.
Although Goma is somewhat safe, you should research every visit outside Goma to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for climbing the Niragongo volcano along with some of the lowest-cost mountain gorilla pursuits in Africa.
You can use the boda-bodan (motor taxi) to get around Goma. The usual price (place) is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its unpredictability, "Timbuktu" is already used as a metaphor for exotic faraway lands.
Timbuktu is today a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger in 1990 because of the danger from desert streams.
It was one of the main stops during the Henri Luis Gates Special Broadcasting Service's "Wonders of the African World".
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the cities in this country, because it has more of an Arab style than an African one.
Kruger National Park (KNP) stretches in northeast South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 divided into 14 different ecoregions, each of which is home to different wildlife.
It is one of South Africa's most important attractions and is called the flagship of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As in all national parks in South Africa, the park has a daily entrance fee and storage fee.
You may also be able to purchase a Wild Card, which offers access to any selection of South African parks or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the country considered a major tourist destination by many.
The building parade that forms the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a striped graph that is seen from the presence of Victoria Harbour water.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the Koulon Strait across the street.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on a well-drained land along the northern coast.
This is the land owned by the British colonizers, so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is the place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal belt of reefs in the world, stretching 80 km (50 mi) from the coastline within the Bengali and Indian coastal zone.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest in the Indian part is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just coral reefs, they include some of the last remnants of the large jungles that once covered the valley of northern India.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, approximately one third of which is covered by water/sea.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a haven for wildlife and it is estimated that the area now contains 400 royal Bengal tigers and some 30,000 tigers have been found.
Buses depart from the intersecting bus station (beyond the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those traveling eastward and Jakarta/Bumthang, depart from 06:30 to 07:30.
It is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance, as interchange buses often get crowded.
Most provinces are served by the Japanese Coaster minibuses, which are comfortable and powerful.
Taking taxis together is a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Ojapok River Bridge is a coffee bridge that spans the Ojapok River to connect the cities of Ojapok in Brazil and Saint George of Ojapok in French Guiana.
The two towers stand at a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two 3.50 m wide corridors.
The vertical space below the bridge is 15 metres. Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs control points are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important local group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaikuru and the pajagua, who made a living by shooting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Gigantic Province of the Indies", was created as a result of the Spanish conquistadors' confrontation with indigenous groups.
The Spanish were the initiators of the colonial period, a period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the creation of the Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to preserve much of its indigenous identity and character.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and for having the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Here you can see smaller tournaments and matches at other times of the year.
For tournament tickets and where to buy polo tickets, go to the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Flemish Pound (FKP), whose value is set at the equivalent of one British Pound (GBP).
You can exchange the money at the only bank on the island, which is at Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British banknotes will be generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and U.S. dollars are often accepted.
In the outlying islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and U.S. currency may be accepted.
Outside the islands, it's almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands, so break your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer when in the northern hemisphere it is winter and vice versa.
Montevideo is in subtropical areas, and temperatures above 30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be a cold to lie about: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it appear colder than the temperature of the thermometer.
There is no particularly "rain" and "dry" weather: the rainfall level is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild and need not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park administration, you must stay at least 100 feet away from wolf bears and 25 feet away from all other wildlife!
No matter how smart you may seem, bison, deer, brilliant deer, bears, and almost all other large animals can attack you.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't keep the right distance. These are wild, big, and possibly dangerous animals, and that's why you need to give them the space they need.
Also, be aware that the scents attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid holding or cooking food with scent and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, a city on the island of Upolus with a population of less than 40,000.
Apia, founded in the 1850s, has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval crash in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk except for a British cruiser, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the independence efforts organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful organization in the city caused the assassination of the chief leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, because of the stretch of Okland between the two ports.
The beaches on the North Shore (in the district of North Harbor) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north and to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of these are sandy beaches that are safe to swim in, and most have shade provided by the pohutukaua trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Road are in the Port of Waitematas, on the elegant outskirts of Mission Lake and St Heliers in Central Oakland.
These are family beaches sometimes crowded with people with a bunch of shops lined up by the beach.
The main beer in the country is "Number One". It is not a complex beer, but it is refreshing and delicious. Another local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines are easier to find.
Rubber water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is more readily available if you are afraid.
For Australians, the idea of a "just white" coffee is a foreign one. A short black coffee is "express", cappuccino is served covered in cream (and not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is by Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but wonderful.
There are many trips on the tyre throughout the year, and damage to the tyre from any of these causes is rare.
But again, respect the advice of the authorities, respect all tables, and pay close attention to security warnings.
The cubozoan sea candle appears near beaches and river cliffs from October to April, north of the bay in 1770.
Fish exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away from them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean. Their main habitat is the river cliffs north of Rockhampton.
An advance booking makes the traveler think that there will be a place to sleep as soon as he arrives at his destination.
Often, travel agents have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find that it is possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport/flight transportation arrangements or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to provide other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, any change or request must first be made through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of music festival participants decide to camp in the same place, and most participants consider it an essential part of that experience.
If you want to be close to the activity, you will need to go early to find a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even if the music may have ended up in the main stages, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music until the late hours of the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, check your cabin location, as ice movement makes a very terrible noise for those who are most sensitive.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos usually make every effort to maximize the time and money spent by guests.
They usually have special offers for food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and in their environment.
Some countries offer free alcoholic drinks, but thirst weakens judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of remaining sober.
Anyone who wants to drive over large geographical areas or over mountain passes should consider that there may be snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is small and you cannot drive as if you are on clean pavement.
During snowstorms, in a very short time, you can get stuck in snow.
Visibility may also be limited by falling snow or snow wind or by condensation or ice in the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many lands, and traffic generally continues uninterrupted year-round.
Safaris are perhaps the main tourist attraction in Africa and the most special moment for many visitors.
The term safari, in common usage, refers to trips to the land to observe the amazing wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are usually approached by cars and with standard equipment, you can get a better view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes bright, so you can see them better with the light.
A walking safari (also called "shrub walking", "walking trip", or "walking walk") consists of walking, leisurely, or dissatisfying.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021. Some events will be held in other places across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host the Summer Olympics twice, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the delay was announced, you may be in a messy situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most of the coronavirus-related cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to be priced from 2,500 to 130,000, with typical tickets priced around 7,000.
Many hotels have iron and a iron counter to borrow, even if there is no one in the room.
If you do not have a iron or if you do not want to keep iron socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if any.
Be careful not to allow the fabric to heat up too much (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, burning).
There are different ways to clean water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it takes just a minute to cool the water, in others, it takes a few minutes.
Filters have different effectiveness, and if you're concerned, you should consider buying the water in closed bottles from a reputable company.
Travelers may feel pests that they do not recognize in their areas of residence.
Parasites can damage food, cause skin irritation, or, at worst, cause allergic reactions, spread toxins, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases in themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force are not generally classified as harmful.
Customs-free purchases are a case of purchases of goods exempt from taxes and duties in some countries.
Travelers to high-tax countries can occasionally save quite a lot of money, especially on such products as alcohol and tobacco.
The road segment between Point Marion and Vermont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburg motorway, often traversing isolated virgin forest terrain.
If you are not used to driving on the road in the countryside, keep your mind in place: sharp swords, narrow gaits, and sharp turns prevail.
The speed limits marked are considerably lower than in previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and full compliance with them is even more important than in other circumstances.
Surprisingly, cell phone service is much stronger here than it is on other parts of the road, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are very varied and varied, as are their southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common, ranging from apple cakes cooked year-round to summer-style cumin cakes.
Many German ripe produce contain almonds, milk and other dried fruits. Typical types of cake go well especially with a strong cup of coffee.
If you want some small but rich candy, try the ones that, depending on the region, are called berliner, pfannkushen, or krapfen.
A cherry is a dish of spices and seasonings with meat or vegetables.
The curry can be "dry" or "liquid", depending on the amount of liquid.
Coconut milk is commonly used in the inland Indian provinces of Pakistan; in South India and in some other coastal provinces of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a general term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But the term is intended to denote foods originating in the central and eastern areas of the main island of Java in case of use without other qualities.
The weekly cuisine, now widely available throughout the archipelago, has a variety of simple spicy herbs, with the predominant flavorings enjoyed by weeknights being: peanuts, spices, sugar (especially coconut sugar) and some aromatic spices.
The earrings are the footholds of the rider hanging down on either side of the aisle.
They provide better stability for the rider, but they can be a safety concern because of the possibility of the rider getting his feet on them.
If the rider is thrown from the horse but his foot is stuck in the stall, he may withdraw if the horse leaves.
First, most motorcyclists wear slippery, tight boots and very tight underpants.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety belts that allow the belt of the rider to fall off the saddle if it is pulled back from the falling rider.
Kocamoto Valley - Chile's main alpinism destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large walls and granite cliffs.
The mountains include stunning views from the cliffs, and climbers from all over the world are constantly trying new routes between its pages of endless possibilities.
Snow sports on hill terrain, which include skiing and snobbering, are popular sports that include snow-covered skiing or a snowboard tied to your feet.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many admirers, who are sometimes known as "ski nomads", whose sole purpose of vacation is to ski in a particular place.
The idea of skiing is very ancient - cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 B.C.!
As a sport, alpine skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first ski training club in Australia.
Backpack skiing: This activity is also called off-track skiing, ski tours, or ski tours.
It is related, but does not usually include alpine-style skiing tournaments or alpinism, where the latter are developed on steep terrain and require much stronger skiing and boots.
Think of the ski route as a similar hiking route.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly greater distances than on foot, but you will very rarely reach skiing speeds on the field without a heavy backpack on clean tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travel to many countries would require multiple visa applications and passport checks.
However, the Schengen area functions to some extent as a place in this respect.
As long as you don't leave this area, you can usually cross the border without having to cross the passport checkpoints again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa yourself to any Schengen member country, thus saving time, money and documents.
There is no general definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies classify as antiques goods older than 100 years.
This definition varies geographically, where the age limit may be lower in countries like North America compared to Europe.
Craft products can be called antique, even though they are newer than similar mass-produced products.
The reindeer herd (northern wood) is an important livelihood for the Sami and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many people with other professions.
Although traditionally not all Samites were heavily involved in reindeer herding, they made a living from fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer primarily as pets for attraction.
Today, many Sami people are employed in modern crafts, and tourism brings significant income to the Sami area of Sapmi.
Although widely used, especially among Roma, the word "gypsy" is commonly considered offensive because of its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Roma population.
If a travel recommendation is made for the country you are going to, you may be affected by travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
You may also want to consult the advice of other governments, but they are designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens may encounter in the Middle East conditions that are different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
Advisory announcements are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
Views presented are often superficial, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information given elsewhere.
"Heavy weather" is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious deterioration of social life or loss of human life.
Severe weather can be felt anywhere in the world, and there are different types of seismic weather that can be affected by geography, topography, and weather conditions.
The effects of severe weather include strong winds, hail, numerous fires, as well as storms, tornadoes, water storms, and cyclones.
Severe regional and winter weather conditions include hail, snowstorms, thunderstorms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of any hazards from severe weather affecting their area, as this may affect their travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that may be called a war zone must have professional training.
By searching the Internet for "Hostile Environments Course", you can probably find the address of a local association.
A course will normally cover in much more detail all the issues discussed here, generally with practical experience.
A course will be regularly 2-5 days and will include role-playing, plenty of training for first aid and sometimes weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with desert survival are common, but few publishes dealing with war zones.
Travelers planning a sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documentation for the return trip.
Governments' willingness to issue passports without gender (X) declaration or updated documents matching the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to comply with these documents varies as well.
After September 11, 2001, security checkpoints have become much more annoying.
Transgender people before surgery should not wait to go through the scanners without compromising privacy and dignity.
Coastal currents are the flow of waves that travel from the coast, often in a rubber or something similar.
Underwater topology causes the return flow to be concentrated in some deeper parts and a rapid current to the depths of the sea can be formed there.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue while trying to swim back against the current, which may be impossible.
But when you get off the streets, the night to return isn't any more difficult than usual.
Try to go somewhere you won't be caught again, or, depending on your abilities, and if they've seen you, maybe it's better to wait for rescue.
The opposite cultural friendship occurs faster than the cultural friendship (there is a shorter honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to the new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to adjust to their native culture.
When you return to your home country after your life abroad, you will be adjusted to the new culture and will have lost some of the customs of your country's culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers needed to adjust to a new country.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The light and sound of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in this area.
Before the show starts, you can see the pyramids in silence and in the dark.
You usually hear the voices of tourists and merchants.
Sphinx is set against the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The images appear on the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
For the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, there are claims from several nations and there are more bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest being King George Island with the settlement of Vila-Las-Estrelas.
Others include Livingston Island and Deception, where the water-filled caldera of an active volcano offers an impressive natural harbor.
The land of Elsuorth is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Belingshausen Sea.
The peninsula's mountains unite here in a cluster and then reappear to form a 360-mile chain of Ellsworth Mountains, which are separated by the Minnesota glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Mountains have the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak Mount Vinson at 4,892 m.
In designated places, without cell phone signals, satellite phones may be your only option.
Satellite phones cannot generally replace cell phones, because you have to be in nature with an unobstructed satellite view to make a call.
The service is often used by maritime transport, including cruise ships, as well as by expeditions that need long-distance data and telephone calls.
Your local telephone service provider may provide additional information about connecting to this service.
One of my favorite options for those planning to take a sabbatical year is travel and study.
This is especially preferred by those who drop out, allowing them to take a year off before university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a sabbatical course abroad can actually increase your chances of getting into higher education when you return home.
In general, for enrollment in these educational programs, a school fee will be required.
Finland is a very good destination for boating. "The Land of Thousands of Lakes" has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You certainly don't need a yacht on these lakes and archipelagos.
While the coastal archipelago and larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is considered a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but, apart from them, it is something quite unique (e.g. in the Netherlands this figure is one in forty).
Most of the special cruises in the Baltic have an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few full days while returning to sleep on a boat at night.
If you go to the coast only on boat trips, you will not need a special visa (as of 2009).
As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not at all by the sea, so a visit to this city is not included in the price of the cruise.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced any traumatic event.
It is nothing to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and dislikes of many, many people.
For some, a little knowledge of how an airplane works and what happens on a flight can help them overcome their fear of the unknown or of things beyond their control.
Courier companies are well paid to deliver things quickly, and time is often very important for work documents, goods, or parts for an emergency repair.
For some lines, the larger companies have their own planes, but it was a problem for other lines and smaller companies.
If the goods were to be delivered by air, some routes could take days to unload and dismantle.
The only way to get through faster would be to ship as checked baggage.
The easiest way to fly first class or business is to raise a lot of money for this privilege (or, even better, have the company do it for you).
However, this is not cheap: as a general rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economic fare for business and eleven times the first-class fare!
Usually, it's not even worth asking for a discount on business or first-class seats on direct A-to-B flights.
Airlines know well that there is a certain group of passengers who willingly pay high prices to have the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and conveniently and assigning prices according to circumstances.
The capital of Moldova is Kisinau, the native language of which is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
This conflict led in 1994 to the creation of the self-declared Transnistrian Republic in Eastern Moldova, which has its own currency government but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been restored despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religious faith in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a rather good transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it has now become an active, modern and developed shopping center, spread out over a vast plateau and surrounded by mountains.
Among the wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping malls are the traditional red brick roof, the 18th-century market and the old church glass, although the atmosphere of the city is more Mediterranean than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvik offers views of nearby Eisturoi Island and has a strange octagonal church.
Above the tombs of the church's courtyard, there are some interesting sculptures, in the form of pebbles, made of marble.
It's worth a half-hour walk through the plot village.
To the north and very nearby is the romantic and charming city of Sinatra, which became famous to foreigners after a colorful tale of its beauty, written by Lord Byron.
Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo-da-Roka.
Also head north to the magnificent Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, a place of world-renowned St. Mary's spectacles.
Please remember that you are actually visiting a place with mass graves, as well as a place that has almost unparalleled significance for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived the times that passed here and many more whose loved ones were killed or worked there to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Show the dignity, solemnity and respect that this object deserves.
Do not damage the appearance of the object by making notes or graffiti on these structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are marked only in Catalan, because it is legally established as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other services.
The usual subway announcements are in Catalan only, but for unplanned interruptions announcements are made by an automated system in a number of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, harsh and arrogant.
Although this is often a false stereotype, the best way to get acquainted in Paris is to get the best of yourself, to act like someone who is "bien élevé".
The Parisians' rough outlook will fade quickly if you display some basic good behavior.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered with dense forests, mostly with oak trees, conical and wet swamps, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean flora.
It has a particularly large diversity of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, unique elevation soils with varying levels.
The region is also home to an immense number of animal and bird species.
There you can find a rare animal world, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, pigeon, raccoon, wild cat, and wild deer, along with many more common species.
When women go to a convent, they must wear a skirt under their knees and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer shades for women who do not come prepared, but if you get yours, especially a brightly colored shade, you will get a smile from the nun or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover their knees.
These can also be borrowed from the back-up pants at the entrance, but those clothes are not washed after every wearer, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these wide pants.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil entirely.
A typical simple dinner of the area, especially during the summer, is "No Olive Oil": olive oil bread, tomatoes, and any other ingredient available such as dieth, tuna, etc.
All names next to the word "you", which means "you", always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish some speech from the opposite.
It also makes reading undoubtedly easier, although the writing is a bit complicated because of the need to discover whether a verb or a nickname has been used in substantialised form.
In Italian, the pronunciation is relatively easy, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to be careful of are c and g, since their pronunciation varies based on the following note.
Also, make sure you spell R and R differently: "carro" means dear, and "carro" means car.
The Bible has a grammar that is somewhat simple and generally regular.
Therefore, if you read this practical grammar, you can learn much about Persian grammar and better understand its expressions.
Needless to say, if you master a Romance language, you will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is very similar, so it is not necessary to study it yourself.
The medieval observatories have now become almost obsolete and are used as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution was not as much of a problem in their day as it is today, they are commonly found in cities or campuses, where access is easier than in modern-day buildings.
Most modern study telescopes are very large objects in areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The sight of cherry blossoms known as "hanami" has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China where the favorite flower was the cotton bud.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor exclusively for him and other members of the aristocracy in the imperial court.
Plants look much better when in their natural environment, so do not be tempted to remove a "single" champion.
If you visit a garden arranged according to the rules, even the collection of "samples" will get you out without discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe and very easy place to move around and you can buy almost anything when you get there.
But since it is located in the "northern tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to face either steam (always) or strong sunlight (rarely, when the sky is round).
There are also some buses that travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you plan to take goes inside Hebron, not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kirjath-Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good subject to provide a base for holidays around them.
For example, visiting the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruising in interesting places on the Danube or sailing along the Irian Canal.
They also set routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of Christianity's most important holidays and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday have been adopted by unbelievers in Christian lands and by non-Christians worldwide.
There is a tradition of staying awake on Easter night in an open place to watch the sun rise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual for spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday evening on Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into festivities as soon as midnight falls to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands came here by swimming, flying, or boating.
Because of its great distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant turkey the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
After humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals, including horses, cattle, deer, cats, dogs, and mice, arrived.
If you visit Antarctica or the Arctic during the winter, you will enjoy the polar night when the sun does not set over the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to watch the polar lights, as the sky will be dark most of the time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, visual pollution is easy and usually not a problem, so you can enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than the one Westerners might be used to.
Costumes are standard business wear, and colleagues call each other by their last names or by their job title.
Harmony in the workplace is decisive, emphasizing group efforts rather than individual achievements.
Often, workers must get their employers' approval for any decision they make, and they are expected to follow their employers' instructions without discussion.
