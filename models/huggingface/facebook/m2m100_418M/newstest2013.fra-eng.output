Republican strategy to counter Obama's re-election
Republican leaders justified their policy by the need to fight against electoral fraud.
But the Brennan Centre considers it as a myth, claiming that electoral fraud is more rare in the United States than the number of people killed by the lightning.
Republican lawyers have only identified 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in ten years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly minimize the U.S. democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the United States is responsible for organizing federal elections in the United States.
It is in this mind that a majority of U.S. governments promulgated from 2009 new laws making the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon grew after the November 2010 elections that saw the adding of 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 draft laws restricting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states were introduced during the year alone of 2011.
The new electoral laws require voters to present an identity card with photo and proof of U.S. citizenship.
In addition, these laws also reduce voting periods in advance, invalidate the right to register as a voter on the day of the election and withdraw citizens with a judicial file their right to vote.
Before the 2006 election, no U.S. state required voters to present an identity card with a photo.
India was the first country to impose such a requirement.
The Supreme Court of the United States confirmed the constitutionality of the Indiana law in 2008.
The Republican authorities urged to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they sponsored bills in 34 states to force voters to present an identity card with photo.
It is important to note that, unlike Quebec, U.S. citizens do not have a universal identity card like the health insurance card.
In fact, 11% of American citizens, or 21 million people in the age of voting, do not possess identity cards with photo issued by a government agency in their state.
Moreover, five million new voters in 2012 don’t have such a identity document.
But it often costs more than a hundred dollars to get the required identity card.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities, and low-income people.
In fact, 25% of African Americans, 15% of people earning less than $35,000; 18% of citizens over the age of 65 and 20% of voters aged 18 to 29 don’t have the required identity card with photo.
much more.
Students, voters considered to vote more for Democratic candidates, are not allowed in several states to use their identity card with photo issued by their institution.
On the other hand, these same states allow members of fishing or hunting clubs who vote more on the Republican side to use to vote the cards issued by these clubs.
Before 2004, no state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first to present such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have adopted laws that require voters to prove they are U.S. citizens.
These measures clearly aim to limit Spanish voting.
Two out of three Spanish voters are in favor of the Democratic Party.
In 2011, Republican lawmakers sponsored laws abolishing the registration of voters on the day of the election in eight states.
In addition, they have limited the right of individuals and groups to provide assistance to voters who want to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, during the 2004 general election, voter registration campaigns contributed to recording about 10 million citizens.
However, the measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the number of new voters in 2010 by 17% compared to 2006.
In addition, Republican legislators have adopted laws in five other states aiming to reduce the voting period in advance.
For example, during the 2008 general election in Florida, 33% of the voters who voted in advance were African-Americans, while the latter represented only 13% of the state voters.
The same goes for the Spanish.
These represented only 11% of voters, but 24% of citizens who voted in advance.
In contrast, the white, which accounted for 76% of the voters, represented only 46% of the voters voting in advance.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters strongly opposed the adoption of laws restricting the registration of voters.
Several bills have been blocked by the veto of the Democratic governors.
The US general lawyer has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
The damage could be partially reduced.
For example, only 16 out of 34 states have adopted laws requiring the presentation of a photo identity card.
However, the new rules introduced will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote in 2012.
Democratic critics denounce the supportive character of the laws that have been voted and they see it as an obvious goal to influence the results in 2012 in key states.
A 2011 Brennan Centre report shows that the states that adopted these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes required for the electoral college to win the presidency.
It is too early to assert with certainty that these legislative changes at the level of the electoral system will have significant impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will negatively affect the participation rate.
In this sense, these measures will partly minimize the U.S. democratic system.
Testing of prostate cancer: pass the test or not?
In fact, the APS test would sometimes have erroneous results, with false negative or false positive results, which lead to unnecessary medical interventions.
What makes even more hesitation men already refusing to pass the screening tests.
Going through the test or not?
We asked for the advice of two experts.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there was a lot of contamination between the witness groups, so it is difficult to interpret these data and have strong recommendations.
Another study, the European, concluded a difference in mortality between patients who had a test and those who did not have it.
This study also showed, with a follow-up after 12 years, that you are between 30 and 40% more likely to have metastases if you are not diagnosed.
So I recommend the test from the age of 50, or from the age of 40, if you have a direct parent who has already had prostate cancer.
Men of African-American origin are also more at risk.
The key is to make the right decision once a cancer is detected.
There are aggressive cancers and others that are indolent.
It is really necessary to make the patient understand the degree of risk of his cancer, by offering him the possible options, not necessarily treating prostate cancers that do not affect long-term life, and rather by choosing, in these cases, for active surveillance of the disease.
Today, many men in whom a cancer is detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and does not threaten their lives.
They will be suggested to do active monitoring and if the disease progresses, they will be offered a treatment.
More and more, criteria are precisely determined to decide which should or should not be treated.
I recommend that you pass the test.
But the important thing is to have a discussion with your doctor to determine whether you should pass it or not.
In collaboration with the International Society of Urology, Movember has created a tool that allows you to evaluate the pro and counter of the APS test.

Preventing the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle recipe to prevent cancer.
Despite the research progress, the adoption of good lifestyle habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it.
It is estimated that if everyone eats well and moves enough, 30% of cancer could be prevented.
“If no one smoked anymore, this rate would rise to at least 50 percent,” said André Beaulieu, a spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
It is estimated that about 10% of cancer is caused by heredity.
Many of them are also completely unexplicable.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against smoking remains a priority, despite the decrease in the number of smokers.
Cigarette is linked to 85% of the cases of lung cancer.
It is also a risk factor for many others.
This is greatly harmful to people’s health.
“There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today,” said spokesman André Beaulieu.
10 years after you quit smoking, the risk of dying from cancer decreases by half.
The weight
Obesity and obesity also promote the appearance of the disease, according to the SCC.
They would increase the risk of breast, colon and rectum cancer, eosophage, pancreas and uterus.
“Research shows that regular exercise throughout life protects against colon cancer,” he added.
The food
The body also recommends to limit its consumption of red meat.
In too large amounts, it increases the risk of developing colorectal cancer.
They are also shrinking, and they should be avoided.
Conservation of meat by smoking, drying or salation can lead to the formation of carcinogenic substances.
“The latter can damage the body’s cells and lead to the development of cancer,” it explains.
The Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have studied the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their research is not conclusive for the moment.
Studies on vitamin E are contradictory, according to the SCC.
While one of them observed a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer, another observed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer is not clearly established either.
In addition, Mr. Beaulieu insists on the importance of talking about his concerns and family history with his doctor.
Passing a screening test does not cause cancer.
The Higgs Boson Decorated
The announcement of the likely discovery of the Higgs boson created a whole emotion, last summer, and because.
It is believed that this boson is part of the mechanism responsible for the mass of everything in the Universe, nothing but that.
And then, this is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the Standard Model – our best, or “less worse” explanation of the nature and behavior of matter – but which has not yet been observed empirically.
But for the physicists, it is not yet completely sure that it is Higgs.
We know without the shadow of a doubt that we hold an authentic new particle, and that it looks very much like the Higgs boson predicted by the Standard Model.
Additionally, new data revealed this week at a large physics congress in Kyoto seems to confirm it, but there is still a lack of data to be completely sure of it.
Let’s still assume that it’s well about Higgs, as the chances of getting wrong seem small, and let’s see what it’s about.
There is, in this low world, a fatally inevitable law wishing that two things cannot be found in the same place at the same time.
No way to violate this rule - and don't try too strong, you'll hurt yourself.
But even if the particle physics is a very strange world, it turns out that it also has a law of this kind: Pauli’s principle of exclusion, which stipulates that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same “quantum state” – that “state” consisting grosso modo in some of their characteristics.
Physicists classify the particles into two categories.
In one corner there are good citizens named fermions, who wisely obey the principle of Pauli.
And in the other are the bosons, a dirty band of anarchists who have no respect for anything - in any case, not for this principle, which means that they can actually be at the same place, at the same time.
These bosons then divide into two groups, according to the site (absolutely extraordinary, otherwise) The Particle Adventure, the Berkeley Laboratories: the mesons, which we will not address here, and the "power particles", through which the great forces of nature spread and to which the Higgs boson would somehow be related.
These bosons, we must emphasize here, are not all so exotic beasts as we could believe.
In fact, if you manage to read this chronicle, it is thanks to a boson of an extraordinary banality: the photon, or the “light particle” which is the “messenger” of the electromagnetic force.
When, in fact, a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, it “interrupts” the electromagnetic field in that specific place, a bit like a stone thrown into a basin.
From this "interruption" is born an electromagnetic wave (from light, or infrared, or ultraviolet, etc.), and this wave is nothing but a photon - and therefore one of the "power-bearing" bosons.
More stable fields
The same goes with the Higgs boson, to this difference close that it is another field, the Higgs field, which must be "interrupted" so that this boson appears.
But this Higgs field is much, much more stable than the electromagnetic field; to excite it, it is necessary to reach very, very high energies, a bit as if it was a frozen basin of which only a very large rock could ride the surface.
That’s why it takes an immense particle accelerator like that of the CERN – the Large Hadron Collider is a 27 km circonference ring! – to reach such energies.
The analogue with the electromagnetic field is again useful to explain the relationship between the Higgs and the mass.
Not all particles or materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do it, but others do not - a piece of paper, for example, will never hold itself on a refrigerator.
And in the same way, it’s not all the particles that interact with the Higgs field: those that do it have a mass, while others (such as the photon) do not have it.
Now, what can all these research bring, ask Mrs. Plamondon?
For science, it serves to verify the validity of the Standard Model (MS), and it also allows physicists to examine any gap between the observations and predictions of the MS.
There are many people who desire to find them, because any difference could open a door to a "new physical" and kill some holes in the Model.
This, we must say, still has enormous shortcomings, offering no explanation for gravity (oups!) or dark matter, which forms about 80% of the matter of the Universe (re-oups!).
However, no such disagreements have been found in the CERN so far.
Impacts
The consequences of these research in the daily life of Mr. and Mrs. All-World, they are harder to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there will not be.
Keep in mind: at the beginning of the 1960s, the pioneers of the laser in the Bell Laboratories did not suspect the revolution that their work would trigger.
They interviewed scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, we’ve already said fire the physicist Willard Boyle – who worked in the Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in 1960, and who himself developed the first continuous laser (the first were pulsated), in 1962 – in the beginning the laser was rather seen as a “laboratory gadget”.
Imagine...
And then, applications can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds the research.
For example, the same Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor in 1969, during his work in optics.
This sensor, although it was not his original intention at all, now serves as a "eye" to all digital cameras in the world, and has won him the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics.
This, of course, does not mean that LHC’s activities will necessarily transform our lives, but that means that, really, we never know...
Palliative Care – The Best Way to Die
With its Commission to die in dignity, Quebec has recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life.
The debate is expected to start again soon as a draft law is prepared.
But in this important area, there is still a lot to do.
The duty tried to look closer.
Just a few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that rushed him left him a two-year rest.
“They had given me five years to live, I’ve been seven years,” he says, half-figue half-rain, lie in his bed at the palliative care house Victor-Gadbois, from Beloeil, where he arrived the previous day.
“But it’s always a shock, we can’t be prepared for that,” he says.
The disease does its work: an enormous weakness that prevents it from going to the toilet alone, and even eating alone.
Placed before an appetizing lunch, he agrees to let himself help to eat, resigned.
Courageous, he even gets to smile, speaks to the strangers who go around him, bring him his medications, offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
“My greatest desire is that I get healed from diarrhea, it’s humiliating,” he says.
A few hours later, the team found a remedy for this illness.
“Thro our lives, we learn that a man is standing,” says Pierre Brodeur, a home psychologist at Victor-Gadbois.
Regressing to the child’s stage, for some people, is an unacceptable humiliation.
“It depends on the person’s ability to accept regression,” he notes.
For, in the opinion of several people working in palliative care, great moments take place in the heart of this regression.
Patients who enter the Victor-Gadbois palliative care house all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life forecast of three months.
At this stage, the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provides so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die “consciously and drowned.”
But the illness has made me discover my children.
“I have good kids,” she added.
“I don’t have any more desires in life,” she says, before she accepts that she gets a mask to help her breathe.
In the next few days, she will visit her son from Italy.
In Victor-Gadbois, with a group of volunteers, the care of the body and the nutrition assistance are produced.
This is the palliative care, which is given when there is nothing else to do.
To make death more comfortable.
In Quebec, there is a palliative care bed for 11 700 inhabitants.
It’s very little when we know that we all end up dying one day.
Here, life continues in the best possible conditions, explains Dre Christiane Martel, one of the home doctors.
Whether it is at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
After the death, we will agree to provide oral care to the brandy or Pepsi, according to the request.
Diabetics will no longer be required to control their sugar levels.
Death is part of everyday life.
Last night, we served a beer to Mr. X, who died during the night.
This morning, it is his son who will finish the beer at the foot of the deceased.
“We help the relatives as much as the patients,” says Nathalie Savard, head of care.
In the house of Victor-Gadbois, the days follow but do not resemble.
Alongside a 93-year-old man who enjoys his last family gathering in the courtyard, well silent in his ears while drunk in his honor, a 36-year-old man dies tragically, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, after having tried everything to survive.
“For six months, there’s always three to five beds that are occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45,” says Dre Christiane Martel.
53% of the patients who are admitted to Victor-Gadbois home come from their home, 47% come from the hospital.
Access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians simply do not have access to palliative care, i.e. care designed to relieve suffering when a sick reaches the final phase of his life, whether it is at home, at the hospital or at home care.
And several organizations, such as the Victor-Gadbois House and the Grand Montreal Home Palliative Care Society, specialize more or less exclusively in the care offered to cancer patients.
It is precisely this great shortage in Quebec’s health care that causes several doctors specializing in palliative care to fear the adoption of a law that encompasses euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since October, a manifesto, signed by palliative care summits including Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, circulates to testify of their opposition to such initiative.
According to Dre Christiane Martel, the Quebec health system is not efficient enough to ensure that everyone is entitled to high-quality palliative care before euthanasia is accepted.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient spending 14 days in an emergency, in great pain, without doing the necessary to relieve her.
I'm afraid that patients ask to die only because they don't get adequate care.
And at the same time, several oncologists rush on their patients until the last day, despite the worst forecasts.
Helen Richard's survival expectations were already minimal when she abandoned a trivial chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I stopped treatment, she replied that she regretted that I stopped fighting, she told me.
She told me I was finished.
No all-powerful care
Dre Martel believes that 90% of the sick who ask to die thank the nurse for not accessing their request after they were relieved from their pain by a palliative care team.
But it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all-powerful in the treatment of pain.
According to Elsie Monereau, director of palliative care at the Home Palliative Care Society of Grand Montreal, patients would be refractory to pain treatments in 8% of cases.
At the very end of life, doctors then often resort to palliative sedation, which comes to sleeping the patient until the moment of his death, either sporadically or permanently.
You can no longer pretend not to hear that part of suffering.
More and more, the unleashed patient will have the possibility of having this palliative sedation.
The sick who are not relieved always say the same phrase: "I want to die."
But that doesn’t necessarily mean “I want you to euthanize me,” that means “I want to be relieved.”
This reporting was made possible through a journalism scholarship from the Canadian Institute of Health Research.
Large Real Estate Scandals in Quebec
Street officials, BTP entrepreneurs, political party funding collectors and Italian mafia specialists tell day after day what they know of a formidable “system” mixing building industry, officials, politicians, syndicalists and mafioso.
A "industry" that cost very expensive to the Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000.
“It’s curious how the system has collapsed since we’ve taken the great means,” ironizes Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec deputy and former police chief of Montreal.
It was by him that the scandal broke out in 2011, through a thorough investigation of the malversations related to road works contracts in Quebec, to which the then liberal prime minister, Jean Charest, had only agreed to retreat.
The Duchesneau report established a direct link between industry, occult party financing and official corruption.
"Since the start of the investigation in 2010, he emphasizes, the only transport ministry would have saved a billion dollars on the contracts," some refraining their instincts to touch a quota!
The Charbonneau Commission "has already dropped two mayors," he added, hoping that it will succeed in "to demonstrate the strategies behind the individuals."
A permanent anti-corruption unit, established in 2011
The Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit, established in 2011, is also involved with its army of government inspectors, investigators and analysts.
More the police officers of the "Marteau Squad" who, since 2009, would have led the "cartel of waste" in Montreal to put the sweet pedal on the swelling of contracts...
In recent weeks, she has carried out serial investigations and brought charges for fraud and corruption against municipal elected members, such as Frank Zampino and Richard Marcotte, mayor of a suburban city.
The next on the list will be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned from his post of mayor of Laval, the third city of Quebec.
He is suspected of having picked up repeated wine pots in exchange for public contracts.
In addition, engineers on the road in Montreal and entrepreneurs of Italian origin, including Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, are formally charged.
The latter made sensation by explaining to the commission the mechanics of the “system” of obtaining public contracts.
He himself paid for years 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related mediator who returned the money to Union Montreal, the mayor's party Gerald Tremblay.
Mr. Zambito has seated at all winds in the 2000s, giving more than 88,000 Canadian dollars (approximately 68,000 euros) to provincial parties, especially to the then-powered liberals.
He also acknowledged he had organized an illegal collection of funds for former deputy prime minister, Nathalie Normandeau.
Contracts of waste whose costs were overwhelmed
In Montreal, the “corruption system” worked roundly.
Gilles Surprenant, a former public work engineer, detailed it well before the commission: in ten years, he received from construction companies gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, hockey matches and pot-de-vin totaling $736,000, in exchange for waste contracts whose costs he flourished.
Other road officials have admitted that they have been fated the leg by swallowing 30% to 40% of the bills, by false extra.
Then a mayor’s party organizer, Martin Dumont, accused Mr. Tremblay of deliberately closing his eyes on a parallel budget feeding his pockets with dirty money.
Following these revelations, Mr. Tremblay resigned in early November, immersing Montreal in a major crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of Montreal’s first elected to sound the alarm.
Mayor of the district of Rivière-des-Prairies, in the east of the island, she revolves since 2010 against the sale of a municipal land purchased for $5 million and sold... 1.6 million to promoters, in full real estate boom.
70% of money in the election campaign
From the investigation that will eventually be carried out, she says that she “strikes on a wire allowing to understand the functioning of the system, infiltrated by myrtles, to stop the gangrene and scratch the guilty.”
The process, she says, is “doorsome but positive.”
We are cleansing the wound but it would need a clean investigation unit in Montreal and a prevail, so as not to see the doubtful practices back.
How to make households.
and regularly.
Jacques Duchesneau notes on his side that “officials have stolen hundreds of millions of dollars”, but is mostly concerned about the role of “elected knowing the strategy” when they didn’t get into the fool!
Estimating to 70% the dirty share of money in the financing of election campaigns in Quebec, he ironizes: "I was told that it was just a blurry reflection of reality."
The Quebec government proposes to limit the donations to $100 to the parties but this will not change the situation, according to him: "As long as we do not strictly limit the electoral spending, there will be dirty money in politics."
He advocates a complete review of the system of public contracts and party financing: "You can't go lower; going to the bottom of things, with courage, will allow to rebuild the house on a stronger basis, with more controls and laws."
If this story shines the international image of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to look at in their own court.
PSG is not the FC Barcelona.
This season, you have taken a new scale with the PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
This can be explained by an individual awareness, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have arrived.
Every day I go alongside them.
The technical staff also contributed a lot to me.
Every day, these elements push me to raise my level of play.
In the game, it’s easier.
Everything goes very quickly in football.
I am not burning.
From my beginnings to the Preformation Centre of the INF Clairefontaine to my passage to Saint-Etienne, I have always advanced by stairs.
You will take advantage of the competition established by Carlo Ancelotti.
Recruits this summer are used to playing high-level matches.
They also know that every training is crucial.
That makes a player like me want to face and provide the maximum.
In addition, Carlo Ancelotti brings me a lot about my positioning.
He is shouldered by assistants like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Ancelotti the man of the situation?
of course.
Ancelotti inspires respect among all technicians.
Today, he has no equal in League 1 and is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He has a great experience and has won a lot of titles with hupped clubs.
He had great players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
In January, I had a comforting conversation with him.
I got out of a series of injuries.
The confidence he gives me explains my performance as well.
What do you look at the first part of the PSG season?
In Ligue 1, Lyon took us the position of leader.
But we remain in embrace.
One of our main goals is the Champions League: we qualified for the final 8th with the way.
What is the goal of the club in this competition?
We will try to go as far as possible.
From now on, everything can happen.
But we will have our word to say in front of very good European teams.
We want to finish first of our chicken, before Porto, to be able to receive in the eighth final return.
Can the PSG become a big European club in the short term?
He already has the budget.
To become a big European club, Paris needs to win titles and register in the duration.
Today it is not so.
Finally, the PSG gives itself the means for this project to be realised.
Not winning the title, like last season, would be a big failure?
Of course, this would be a big disappointment.
This year, we really want to win this champion title.
Last season we did not go far.
In May, there was disappointment because we had the qualities to finish first.
We had a very big season.
We finished with 79 points.
With 79 points, we are supposed to be a champion.
But another team, Montpellier, made an even more fantastic season.
I think this year is the right.
Even though big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux are struggling for the title, I think we have the weapons to win it.
Do you think the media is waiting too much for PSG?
It is normal that we expect a lot from us given what has been invested and the players we have.
It is fully accepted.
Afterwards, when we win 4-0 at home against Troyes and we still find things to reprove us, it’s sure that it’s a bit frustrating.
I wonder what people expect more.
We can never win 4-0 every weekend.
We are not the FC Barcelona.
We are trying to create a game project.
A team is built with time.
We showed in the Champions League that we could be present.
Watch Manchester City who has not been able to qualify for the eighth final for two seasons, they have also made huge spending!
Looking at the amount invested, you were imagined with 15 points in advance!
It was to ignore our opponents and the championship of France.
Lyon and Marseille, which were not good last season, were “boosted” by this new PSG.
This shows that League 1 is exciting.
I hope that in May we will be able to have the smile by telling us that, despite all the difficulties, we ended up winning it.
The PSG seems completely dependent on Zlatan Ibrahimovic's achievements.
It is better to say that there is a “Zlatan dependency”.
This means that Ibrahimovic is very performing and he puts a lot of goals.
He came for that and proves that he is the star of League 1.
He demonstrated everywhere he went that he was a great player, a world star.
Within the group, we respect the man and the player.
He also respects the people he has around him.
What he did is really exceptional.
This encourages others to raise their level of play.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone to progress.
How did you live the Euro 2012 with the team of France?
Like a disappointment.
I wanted to participate in this Euro.
Unfortunately, my injury prevented me from grabbing the game time.
I saw things there and came out strengthened.
Today, I can play good matches in selection.
That’s what I’ve hoped since my baptism with the Blue.
We learned the lessons of what has happened in Ukraine and we must have an exemplary behavior today.
What do you look at the first months of Didier Deschamps in the head of the Blue?
He has the results for him.
We are well placed in the qualification group for the World Cup.
The selector is rigorous, close to the players, and inspires the victory.
As was Laurent Blanc.
I don’t want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the Euro.
I hope Didier Deschamps will lead the Blue to Brazil.
Is the good zero (1-1) removed on October 16 in Spain a founder match?
This match gave us confidence.
Everyone fought for everyone.
Before this shock in Spain, I had never experienced such a match in my career.
With Bitcoin, Pay and Sell Without Banks
All the opposite of current monetary exchanges, based on central banks, identified transactions and processing costs between stakeholders.
Moreover, as often in these technologies, a political vision is palpable: the belief that the current monetary system, made of bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, Bitcoin, invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym), is both a virtual currency (but convertible in dollars, euros...) and a secure exchange protocol in the way of BitTorrent, which allows the exchange of files from pair to pair.
About 200,000 transactions have already been recorded through 15,000 computers on the network.
A few thousand websites accept bitcoin as a donation or a means of payment.
The price of bitcoin, after reaching a top of $30 (23 euros) in June 2011, fell to $2, five months later, before returning today around a dozen dollars (the prices are listed on the site bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing very impressive, compared to global exchanges in real currency or financial products.
However, the European Central Bank (ECB) was interested in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
It describes bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "in competition with the dollar or the euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin distinguishes itself from other types of virtual currency such as the “credits”, used to advance in a video game that you win by playing or that you can buy (and sometimes exchange in return).
The social network Facebook has also developed this kind of system.
But, every time, a central authority controls and deals with the exchanges.
With Bitcoin, all the network nodes are both account book depositors, verificators, currency emitters, and buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Each transaction between two users is actually done between two email addresses in the way of an email.
Unless a user can choose a different address for each payment, thus ensuring anonymity.
A set of information related to this transaction is signed electronically by a double-key encryption system.
The network can therefore verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Thanks to the file content, it is also possible to make sure that the exchanged bitcoins exist well in the public account book, broadcast throughout the network.
The key step is to write this new transaction in this book.
It passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge launched on the computers, and whose winner, a kind of temporary central banker, will have the privilege to add this additional line.
This is a file hashing phase, i.e. transforming a large file into a shorter and unique digital footprint.
Computers "tak" the new transaction and add a number to it before "hacking" the set.
The goal is to find the number that gives a particular footprint (a lot of zero at the beginning).
Once this number is found, the other nodes easily check that it is the right one.
The transaction is then indestructively linked to the chain of all other transactions; any change would change the footprint.
If, for fraud, a user wanted to pay twice with the same money very quickly (less than ten minutes), only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other remaining orphan because both have different footprints.
The computer that has solved the challenge wins 50 bitcoins.
To avoid inflation, this reward is divided by two regularly, probably before the end of 2012.
The number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but they are divisible up to a hundred million, leaving the margin...
The difficulty of the challenge is also highlighted with every increase in calculation power.
The life of the network has already had high and low.
Websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and Bitcoin deposits stolen.
“The fault used does not concern the protocol itself,” says Pierre Noizat, who just launched Paymium, a real-money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports the possibilities of money laundering through this anonymous service.
However, cash also has this deficiency.
Weight players like Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
Others, such as the WordPress blogging platform, accept them.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron, from the Weizmann Institute in Israel, analyzed the book of accounts and showed that 80% of bitcoin is not circulating.
In November, “Gigant Soldiers” were launched.
“Thirty thousand dollars have been exchanged,” rejoices Jon Holmquist, who works for Coinabul, who turns bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, also author of a pedagogical book on this currency, believes a lot in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system, Paytunia, is equivalent to a credit card (in real currency) or a contactless mobile payment, but it uses Bitcoin to validate transactions, which thus return cheaper.
The carrier also manages his identity and can therefore be anonymous.
The system is easy to implement with traders, who do not need to install new terminals or software.
It is enough for them to communicate an address that a phone can “photograph and recognize,” says Pierre Noizat, who assures to have thousands of users.
There is a general movement of questioning hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems.
“It will take time for Bitcoin to be required, but 2013 could be a turning point,” he predicts.
The ECB, in its report, also plans to re-evaluate the various risks, now considered to be high, if this currency succeeds.
We left Afghanistan.
And after?
The French troops left their responsibility zone in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the U.S. are expected to follow by the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghans to choose their future, without expecting anything from us.
It is especially the Afghan peasants that we have punished by considering them terrorists.
And we ourselves, with our 88 soldiers killed, and the wounded, the mutilated.
The Taliban are made up of foreign extremists, former Pakistani refugee leaders, but often of peasants who refuse the presence of foreign armies, like the Soviet times.
They want to defend their ancient and archaic traditions, even if they have been joined by jihadists, Pakistani, Arabs, Uzbek, Tadjik.
Tolerated, sometimes helped by local insurgents, these will no longer be when the Western will become more discreet.
The departure of the French troops from the Nijrab base, which I observed from the top of the hills planted with almonds thanks to French credits, was done in order.
Truck and blinded convoys reached Kabul without being attacked, overflyed by helicopters.
There will be no Taliban deferrants in Kabul by the end of 2014.
The circumstances have changed since their irresistible progress from 1994 to 1996.
Kabul was then empty, the country of fire and blood due to the struggles between different factions.
Their control over the country was then perceived as a sort of liberation, a return to security.
The Afghans have paid the price of the obscurantism of these al-Qaeda organizations exaggerated farmers, but their situation has not improved today.
Former Mujahideen, Afghan government and current Taliban join together in the desire to keep women in a lower position.
The main notables of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They moved into affairists, capturing government land to sell them to land to build to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, benefiting from huge U.S. subcontracts.
They disregarded themselves; most of them did not fight themselves.
People, as I have heard in the councils, seek a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave, as they will leave those who have learned to enjoy the American widths: the leakage of capital is considerable.
The young people are tired of the war and its ideologies.
They met the modern world during their exiles in Iran or Pakistan, they appreciated the advantages.
About 65% of the population is under 25 years old; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, a fifth of the total population.
In the cities, government schools are full of girls and boys.
It will be necessary to provide work to those young people who will no longer want to return to the obscurantism of former parties or to the corruption of some leaders.
Everyone, including the armed opponents, are fans of mobile phones; television, and its Turkish sheets that present a modern world, is followed everywhere.
The army is now present.
Will the authorities that will order it be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already worried about the reconstitution of provincial milices, which will escape the central power.
Afghanistan, a mountainous country with strong local identities, should be able to benefit from some decentralization, in the image of the Western nations, but the United States wanted to transform it into a centralized state, with strong presidential power, removing the post of Prime Minister that existed since the Constitution of 1964.
President Karzai does not want foreign controls, on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
But its country is, since the 1950s and already long before, dependent on foreign aid.
No industry has been rebuilt, no barrier is in state, no important irrigation system is repaid.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced except fruits and vegetables.
Priority is left to the private initiative.
In a country ruined by thirty years of war, government control of infrastructure would have been needed.
The noise was spread that Afghanistan possesses enormous mining wealth.
This only added to the feeling that the Westerners were there only to take it.
Without energy to process the iron or copper mining on the site, nor means of transport to export it through the mountains, there is no mining.
The Chinese have already almost left My Aynak Copper Mine, allowing international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) to explore the enormous Buddhist site and remain the most important employers in the province.
It will also take a day for Afghanistan and Pakistan, whose imports and exports are largely dependent on, to restore normal relationships.
The departure of the French troops ended on November 20.
The new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high school for girls, boys, French department to the university, French Institute, cooperation in the military, legal, medical and agricultural fields, support for the Archaeological Delegation.
Since 2009, to try to “give the hearts and the minds” and to accomplish the task impossible to match aid and offensive actions, a service of “civil-military actions” of the Ministry of Defense (Cimic), removed in 2012, has led, and has been carried out by a small French NGO, many work of collective interest and agricultural rehabilitation actions in dozens of mountainous villages.
These works, gourmands in local workforce, have been able to help contain the insurrection: irrigation, wells, drinking water, rebound, fruit trees, soil protection and increased cultivable surfaces.
What will we leave as a reminder, after two billion euros of military spending?
A much more modest budget would contribute to the improvement of local, very hard living conditions in these valleys often located at more than 2,000 meters of altitude.
The embassy received dozens of written requests for small agricultural achievements from local communities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for them to get rid of the insurrection led by foreign groups, what farmers told me to wish, a small, well-controlled and directly touching civil aid should beined in their favor.
A forceps constitution in Egypt
This is a new poker hit by President Mohammed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever around the constitutional declaration, which provisionally gives it full powers, he decided to play his way.
Taking all of the court, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would vote its final text the next day.
Just a week ago, the head of state had given two additional months to this assembly to finish its work.
Soon two years ago, Egypt is relying on a provisional text, repeatedly amended, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal imbroglios.
This new initiative only increased the fraction in the country.
For his opponents, the President persists in his “autocratic choice”, continuing to “trace his word” and “trace the right.”
On the side of its supporters, it is assured that it is a way to end the institutional and political crisis as soon as possible, by accelerating the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 15 days.
A very short period of time that forces the Brothers to give up their plan to explain the text, article by article, to the Egyptians.
For the President, it is also a way to regain a popular and democratic legitimacy while the protests rage throughout the country.
Mohammed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably, as he said in an interview with the American weekly newspaper Time.
Especially as this recourse to a hurry vote lies with the ultimatum to the Egyptian people: "Of you vote for my text, or I keep the full powers," these must supposedly end after the adoption of the Constitution.
It is in a strange atmosphere that 85 members of this Constituent Assembly, with a large majority of Islamists, voted the text yesterday.
The majority of the liberals missed the call.
In mid-November, shortly before the Constitutional Declaration, they had clocked the door, believing they couldn’t make their views valid.
Representatives of human rights, religious minorities or civil society did the same.
In order to reach the required quorum, 11 people, replacement members, were added to the hurry, yesterday morning.
Some are very close to Muslim Brothers.
Not surprisingly, it is most often unanimously that the articles were voted.
Some commentators have also been delighted with the fact that one of the only differences of the day has been expressed around... the time of prayer, some members of the committee considering the pendule of the constituent was wrongly arranged.
The text, which was still being voted last night, contains 234 articles.
Subject to all attention, article 2 remains ultimately identical to that of the Constitution of 1971, stipulating that “the principles of sharia are the main source of law.”
The salafist parties, for which the establishment of Islamic law is a major claim, hoped to be able to replace "principles" with "rules", which would have allowed a more strict application.
For Islamists, the fact that this article has not been modified is a guarantee of their goodwill and respect for the other components of the Egyptian society.
“Hypocrisy,” the liberals answer, who see it only a blow of communication.
According to them, the Islamization of the Constitution is done through other articles.
They are referred to in particular to Article 220, which gives the University of Al-Azhar a consultative role, in particular with regard to verifying the conformity of the laws with the sharia.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because “the people called to vote are not elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
We can see the primates of a theocracy.”
The fears of the liberals are also driven by the fact that the next rector of this university should be much less moderate than the current.
“At present, there is no concrete religious involvement.
With this Constitution, we remain within the framework of the civil state.
The majority of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not olemas but academics, for some trained in the French system" temper Alexis Blouet, who prepares a thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
But he acknowledges "that there may be ambiguity around article 220, because the terms used lend to the religious vocabulary.
There is a reference to the “fiqh” in particular [Islamic jurisprudence, ndlr].
And the question could be in the future, to what extent civil judges are competent to judge.”
Beyond its religious aspect, the text voted yesterday is highly criticized due to the extended powers it gives to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brothers claim that these are significantly reduced compared to what they were under the former regime.
Another controversial point: the powers conferred to the army.
In accordance with the desire of the military, the review of the Defence Budget will not be submitted to the Parliament, but to a National Defence Council.
No more that civil trials in military courts will be prohibited, as human rights associations demanded.
They also express their concerns about the text, which they consider liberticid.
The crime of blasphemy isined and insult is now prohibited, which could have serious consequences on freedom of expression, the press.
Moreover, no article is more echo to women’s protection, says Heba Morayef, from Human Rights Watch.
According to her, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
The word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak last night on television, protests are scheduled this afternoon.
The support of the head of state will disappear on Saturday.
In Israel, holy places, the center of the world and a sea of salmon await Ukrainian tourists
The Promised Earth brings together the greatness of biblical truths, modern comfort and wild nature.
Argoumenty i Fakty has found five great reasons to go to Israel.
Go to adore the holy places
Meet the inevitable: the shores of the Jordan, where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that anyone who enters these “baptism funds” will be touched by the Divine Grace.
As for Galilee, it is the land of the miracles of Jesus: where the water was turned into wine, where Jesus walked on the water, where he calmed the storm, or where the fishing was miraculous.
This is exactly where Jesus appeared before His disciples after the Resurrection.
But where you will find the most holy places, it is in Jerusalem.
The faithful go through the Road of Suffering or the Road of the Cross (Latin: Via Dolorosa).
This path begins near the fortress Antonia (the Pretory), where the trial took place, and then leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Cemetery on the Golgotha, to the place of the Crucifixion, and then to the Stone of the Onction and the Tomb.
Here is the Christian center of the world, a symbol of the salvation of mankind.
According to the Christian legend, the Monastery of the Cross is erected where the tree used to make the cross on which Jesus was crucified grew up.
Jerusalem also houses the most sacred place of the Jews: the Wall of Lamentations which constitutes the rest of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 BC.
According to tradition, people of different confessions leave small words accompanied by prayers that are then fulfilled.
Travel in height
Visit the ruins of the fortress Massada, an ancient refuge against enemies built by Herod the Great in 25 BC for his family.
These ruins are found on the abrupt rocks of a mountain at 450 m above sea level.
Only alpinism lovers can reach it by their own means.
For others, a telepheric takes them to this summit full of history.
In the north of the country, between 1,600 and 2,040 m of altitude, is the ski resort of Mount Hermont which welcomes many tourists in the winter.
A car can take you from the foot of the mountain.
The ski trails have a total length of 45 km.
The ancient beliefs want the pagan gods to have once lived at the top of the mountain.
Visit unique museums
It is home to about 300 museums.
It is impossible to visit them all during a single stay.
Here are the five most interesting ones that really worth the tour.
First: the Museum of Israel located near the Knesset (parliament).
It houses the very ancient Manuscripts of Qumran, or Manuscripts of the Dead Sea, discovered in the caves of the Desert of Judea, as well as 500 miles of archaeological and anthropological objects.
See also: Tel Aviv Museum of Art.
It exhibits mainly the works of the impressionists and expressionists Monet, Pissarro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Acre, the Hammam Al-Basha awaits you with its Turkish baths composed of mouldings of visitors and observers of the time.
Once in Caesar, enter the only private Ralli Museum where you will be able to admire the sculptures of Rodin.
There are no guides or souvenirs shops.
Entrance is free and donations are prohibited.
The fifth museum is the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem Memorial, located in Tel Aviv, which runs on the most dramatic historical pages of history.
The most tragic part is the children's memorial, built in memory of 1.5 million children killed in concentration camps and gas chambers.
You enter and enter into a full darkness.
The stars shine.
Then you will hear the names of the Jews and the names of the countries in which they died.
Ukraine is also mentioned.
Health and well-being
The three major swimming stations of Israel are located on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
Each of them offers swimming pools, aquatic parks, delphinariums and giant aquariums.
Note: you will be able to swim in the Red Sea even in winter, because the water temperature does not fall below 21° while the air temperature can reach 23°.
The Dead Sea is even more hot and you can swim there throughout the year.
Moreover, it is the most unique sea in the world: it occupies the lowest point on Earth, or 417 m below sea level.
The blue water contains salmon and easily retains swimmers, even those who don’t know how to swim.
The landscapes around it are of surrealistic beauty.
We come there to perform a treatment on the basis of salt water, lemon, healing mice and to treat various diseases such as dermatitis, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes but also to simply relax.
Discover the Secrets of Antiquity
They are kept by the old town of Tel Aviv, Jaffa, on the Mediterranean Sea.
It is crossed by the famous Via Maris that connects Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to the legend, it is here that Noah built his ark and that Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda, with whom he lived a long and happy life here.
Tourists like to walk in the narrow streets that carry the name of the zodiac signs.
It is said that if you touch the walls of the street corresponding to your sign, the fate will smile to you.
In Jaffa you will be able to cross young weddings coming to take photos from all over Israel and even from other countries.
In Caesar, the city of King Herod, you will be able to walk in the Roman theatre, "conquer" the fortress of the crosses.
Under the Roman Empire, Caesar was the main city of Judea and the residence of Roman prosecutors, including Ponce Pilate.
The carefully restored theater is now used for evening concerts and opera shows.
Note to tourists
If you’re going to Israel, don’t worry about your English: about 30% of the population speaks Russian.
For your trip, it is better to prefer the dollars to the euro, as they are easily exchangable in shekels (today 1 dollar is equal to 3.8 shekels).
As for urban transport, it is mainly buses, but Jerusalem is equipped with a fast tram and Haïfa has the only metro line in the country, composed of six stations and capable of connecting the lower and high parts of the city.
This is almost a subterranean funicular.
Travel in all kinds of public transport costs 6 shekels and allows you to make changes for 1h30.
In Israel, the Jewish tradition wants to celebrate the Sabbath on Saturday.
From Friday evening to sunset on Saturday, the markets, shops and public transport stops their activity.
And the working week begins on Sunday morning.
Many cafes, restaurants and hotels serve only casher food, which excludes pork, seafood, stainless fish and dishes composed of both milk and meat.
It offers a whole multitude of dishes based on apple and beef, soups and desserts based on coconut milk but also humus, traditional Jewish paste, different sauces, moulded butter balls, falafel, fruits and vegetables.
There are no dogs in the streets of the Israeli cities.
There are many well-fooded cats that walk in the high air.
You can see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
They love passing places and do not refuse to give them.
The rental of a car varies depending on the brand from $37 for 24h (Hyundai Getz) to $188 (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs $15 per day.
Renting a bicycle will cost you 15 shekels a day.
An entrance to the museum costs an average of 30 shekels.
The language of numbers
Three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel in 2012.
They were mainly people who came to travel and rest from the United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England and Ukraine.
118.8 million Ukrainian tourists visited the Promised Land from January to October 2012, 51% more than in 2010, before the visa cancellation on February 9, 2011.
"Who has a language, to Moscow goes": migrants save money to learn the language
While parliamentarians and human rights activists polemic about what the law on mandatory language testing will give, fraudsters selling “false” certificates have already made their appearance in the country.
Every year, 13 million migrant workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other Russian cities.
Most of the time, they are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to make money to help their families stay at home.
From December 1st, a law has entered into force and stipulates that every migrant worker must pass a Russian language examination.
Currently, this rule applies only to those who intend to work in the services, housing, private services and retail sectors.
However, with time, the Federal Migration Service promises, the tests will become mandatory for all immigrants.
Moreover, the knowledge of the language, but also the knowledge of the history of Russia and the foundations of law will be validated.
You will need to validate your language knowledge in Russian to obtain and renew your work permit.
Only citizens of the countries where Russian has the status of official language are exempt.
Persons who obtained certificates or degrees of education before the fall of the USSR in 1991 are also not affected by this law.
Benefits, negative attitude and protection of rights
The network of exam centers will be under the edge of the Pouchkin Russian Language Institute, the University of Friendship of Peoples, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other higher education institutions in Russia.
Immigrants will be able to pass the exams in all cities in the country: more than 160 centers have already been opened throughout the territory.
This initiative to introduce examinations was supported by the Deputies of the State Douma and the Federal Migration Service.
But, before the law came into force, human rights defenders have already repeatedly raised the question in the press: what will it give?
What is the obligation to know the Russian will change for the Russians and immigrants?
First of all, the representatives of the Migration Service respond, this will allow to reduce the number of people suffering “from slavery at work”.
Many are talking about the defense of the rights of migrant workers, explains director of the office of the Russian Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Victor Sebelev.
The protection of the rights must begin before they leave.
Only an organized selection system will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
The problems arise for migrants without profession, without training, those who don’t know the language and who don’t have medical certificates.
Without the understanding of the language, the future migrant is intended to cross unrighteous people who, under the pretext of helping him, will provide him a "travel" in a overpopulated household where he and dozens of his relatives will torment for months without food and paper and will have to trim between 12 and 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
“At home, one thing is promised to them, and when they arrive, they are deceived, they take their passports, and they do not touch the planned salary,” confirms the head of the Migration Services Directorate for the work of the Migration Service of Tajikistan, Tolib Charipov.
Don’t dispute with me, Mr.
However, many citizens of Central Asian republics who want to come to make money in Russia confess that they don’t only know the language of the country where they want to go, but also that they write hard in their own language.
Of course it is not their fault, but their misfortune: little Turkmen, Uzbek, Tadjik can afford to follow even a passable primary education.
In fact, their families don’t even have anything to feed their children without talking about dressing them properly and equipping them for school.
As soon as they reach the adolescence, these young people go to make money as soon as the opportunity comes.
It’s hard when you don’t know the language.
“You feel diminished and diminished.”
Human rights defenders, however, notice an important aspect of the language law.
The exam will be intended only for migrants who have a legal status.
Without the status, there will be no exam or official work later.
However, most migrant workers continue to live illegally in Russia.
“Welcome or Defense to Enter”
Many immigrants explain that it’s not so easy to get an official status in Russia.
The reason? the administrative barriers and always those language difficulties.
Moreover, legalization costs money: between 12 and 16 miles of rubles.
And then, you can get a fake record quickly for just 1,500 rubles.
The Russian police know that we have false documents, that we don’t have records, therefore the cases of extortion.
“They ask us 100, 200 rubles, what to buy cigarettes, tea,” Tajikistan citizen Oumed Khouchkadamov told reporters.
“Do fast, don’t lazy and buy yourself a beautiful work of art.”
From the first day of the entry into force of the language law, it was discovered that the registration papers of migrants were not the only to be false.
Several false language exams certificates have already been confiscated by employees of the Federal Migration Service.
False papers come out of a regular color printer.
Of course, their new owners didn’t have them for anything: every immigrant who hoped to thus facilitate the task of the exams had to pay seven thousand rubles for this document.
This is two and a half times more expensive than the official procedure: this will cost the migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Representatives of power and human rights defenders agree to say that the short-term goal is to protect the system from corruption so that it is impossible to simply buy these “paper boots”.
The authorities may give migrant workers who have not been able to validate the first-time examination time to attend language courses.
In addition, immigrants who do not know Russian will be offered a job in areas that do not involve actively communicating with people.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is not concerned with the weapons market
The proportion of crimes involving legal weapons is very low.
The Russian Ministry of the Interior proposes to strengthen the law against civilian weapons holders.
This is the reaction of the authorities to recent incidents: whether it’s shooting during marriages or the murder organized by the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov, who killed seven.
Police want to ban the carrying of rubber-ball weapons in public places and raise the legal age of obtaining the weapons carrying license by making it pass from 18 to 21 years.
The idea was supported by the head of the Duma Security and Anti-Corruption Committee, Irina Yarovaya who promised that amendments to the weapons law will be introduced in the State Duma soon.
Not everyone is pleased to see that the Russian authorities are trying to solve the problem by "sliping the wire".
A open letter appeared on the Net in which its authors, representatives of various shooting centers, demand to give up “this insensate hardening.”
The percentage of crimes committed with a recorded weapon is minimal, Russian law enforcement officer Vasiliy Lesnikov told the BBC.
According to the Ministry of the Interior statistics, over a six-month period in 2012, 142 crimes were committed with a firearm registered in the police services while 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded in the same period.
The authors of the open letter are confident that the strengthening of civil weapons laws will not prevent criminals from supply themselves to the black market.
According to them, today in Moscow can be found any weapon at a reasonable price.
However, the Ministry of the Interior says it controls the dissemination of illegal weapons.
Suppliers: From Factory to Officer
The black market of weapons is supplied through several channels.
The main channels are five, says Victor Baranets, a retired colonel who served for ten years at the Ministry of Education and the General Quarter.
Screenshot taken from a site taking arms commands
The first is the “military trace”, i.e. the weapons that were stolen during the military operations in the Caucasus.
“These weapons were stolen by Russian officers, but also by Caucasians,” Baranets said.
The second type of weapons from the black market are those stolen by criminals to the law enforcement.
Baranets explains that these are both weapons stolen in the police stocks and those stolen directly to the representatives of the law enforcement.
Illegal weapons are sold from military warehouses.
Many of them often suffered explosions.
"Tested versions indicate that some fires were intentionally triggered to hide the deficit," the former military said.
For Baranets, weapons manufacturers are there for something.
“We see private weapons factories that do not compete with competition on the international market and weapons flow on the black market, especially in Moscow,” a expert said.
One of the other sources of black market is the counterfeit.
A large portion of weapons and pistols come from poor countries, such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is a local production, sometimes craftsmanship, a mafia has been formed and the supply is organized,” the former military said.
Where do weapons come from?
Experts assessed the approximate share of each source of illegal weapons on the black market.
A report on the issue was prepared in 2011 by the Center for Problem Analysis and Study for Public Administration.
Specialists analyzed the reports of the Ministry of the Interior and Rosstat, criminal records and public data of weapons-related portals.
The vast majority of illegal weapons, the researchers explain, comes from the army and the law enforcement forces.
Half of the weapons present on the black market were found there “for the fault of employees whose work is linked to weapons,” the report explains.
According to the researchers, 17% of the weapons come from military conflict sites, 14% are stolen at the time of manufacture and 5% are from "legal fools".
A seller and consultant of a weapons store who has asked to keep the anonymity assures that for a long time no one has bought the weapons found by these illegal detection specialists; they are too old.
Most often, according to him, sellers will search for new goods in military warehouses.
The person purchases through a teaching unit, for example a TT pistol.
It is delivered to him by passing the goods through a grill.
“He transports it to the city and sells it for €900 by the unit with two chargers,” he tells.
“It’s true that the police are aware of all the cases, so when crimes are about to be clarified, they make a control purchase from illegal weapons dealers,” the seller added.
“As in a luxury store.”
The seller and the buyer usually find each other through knowledge.
I consulted sites, blogs, until a guy manifests and suggests me to come to the Begovaya station where someone was going to take me into a "coin" to shop.
The price of the pistol was given to me.
Victor Baranets as Military Observer
To find a gun, I need to know someone who has a contact, explains the seller. I know someone, but I don't trust him.
There are sellers on the markets, but there you must also come by saying, for example, "from such a person, who asked me to transmit that his daughter lost a tooth."
Now I even buy a couple of American pounds with the help of a person I trust.
He only gives them to me because he knows that I will not give them.
The young people are looking for weapons in different ways.
Former military Victor Baranets tried himself as an illegal weapons buyer in the mid-1990s when he was preparing to publish an article on the subject.
The schemes, according to him, have not changed.
He was given a photo album in which there was "everything we wanted."
“I thought I was in a luxury store,” the military remembers.
There is no secret for the buyer, Baranets explains, we can try everything.
As a potential customer, I don’t just buy, we go with the seller in the forest and set up a target.
“They let me shoot and when I’m convinced that the weapon works well, we start negotiating,” the expert describes.
A shop from the sofa.
Search engines display sites and groups on Vkontakte where weapons can be purchased "for different uses".
There is no need for any documents and anyone to meet.
“It’s enough to have a precise amount of money,” it is written in a advertisement on the site “Buy a gun or a fighter gun.”
Users leave their request and ask their questions.
Is it sold to minors?
“Without permission, of course,” asks the user “Ivan” (preserved ortography).
“Achete TT. Moscow,” wrote “Fedorenkov” in his very direct request.
The Federal Security Service has broadcast an immense network of fake sites and gathers people who want to buy combat weapons.
People rush on food like hungry wolves and then they find themselves exploiting coal in Siberia.

I have heard of this type of schemes: generally, the site is registered outside the scope of Russian laws.
People take orders.
The buyer makes the payment on the automatic boundaries.
"He receives a photo and instructions indicating where the weapon is hidden," said Dmitry Kislov, secretary of the "Right to a Weapon" association.
Victor Baranets says that by making a request on the site, you can find yourself without weapons and behind the bars.

Makarov for $100
Buying an illegal firearm, experts estimate, can cost between $100 and $900.
According to Dmitry Kislov of the "Right to a Gun" association, one can buy a Makarov pistol for $100-300 dollars.
We will have to wait about a month and a half.
It is out of long-term warehouses by the direction of these medium-sized warehouses.
According to the official data of the ministry, compared to the January-October 2011 period, the number of these crimes in total decreased in Russia by 7% and rises to 22.9 miles, while the proven cases of theft and extortion of weapons, ammunition, explosives and bombs decreased by 7.8%.
US: fast food and supermarket employees are in strike
Approximately a quarter of American teenagers go through a cash job at McDonald's
In recent days, a wave of protests has risen against the low wages practiced by the Walmart supermarkets and famous fast food chains such as McDonald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
For the moment, no one can predict whether this wave will grow or soften quickly.
These actions are supported by trade unions and a number of leftist associations.
Along with the increase in the modest wages perceived by the basic employees at Walmart and in the fast-food chains, the organizers of the demonstrations want to get the creation of trade unions.
This sector is not covered by the trade union movement.
40 cents per year.
The demonstrations began last week, after Thanksgiving, the "Black Friday", at the time when a flooding rain of salts taking millions of inhabitants dropped over America and sometimes triggered scandals.
On that day, some Walmart employees, which employs 2.2 million people worldwide, left their post to organize strike pickets with trade unions and leftist activists in the company’s stores whose products are intended for consumers of the modest and middle class.
Walmart sells everything: from layers to hunting rifles to car batteries, dampers, eggs and milk.
Products are 8% to 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
That’s why many poorly paid Walmart employees run their races only on their workplace.
The price and product selection have made Walmart one of the most powerful groups in the United States.
According to criticisms, Walmart can afford to sell its products cheap, especially because of the low wages of its employees.
The latter also complain about difficult working conditions, such as the lack of lifting cars or portable scanners.
Participants in the "Black Friday" demonstrations demanded a salary increase, they complained that the price of the medical insurance provided by the company had increased from $30 to $100 a month.
For the basic employee at Walmart who touches $9.5 per hour, it’s a sum he can’t afford.
Scientists from the California University of Berkley show that if Walmart raised the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost the group $3.2 billion.
This is 1.1% more than it is currently spending.
If Walmart transferred all the wages on the shoulders of consumers, each race in the store would return to them at 46 cents more.
They will spend in just a year $12.39 more than now.
Walmart supporters are pleased to note that the protests took place in only nine states and did not hurt the group.
The "Black Friday" continued in the stores from 8 p.m. to midnight the next day and Walmart sold over this period 5000 items per second.
The company has made a total of 100 million transactions for Black Friday.
The company’s spokesman Dan Fogleman said in an interview with the left site Huffington Post that in all “less than five” Walmart employees had left their positions and that the protest was just a “operation of like among so many others” by the organizing syndicate.
“The next customer!”
The protests continued this week in New York and concerned neither the Walmart shops (in this progressive city, they are not very appreciated, therefore they are not yet implanted there) but the McDonald's and other cheap restaurants.
McDonald’s announces to sell billions of portions and after they don’t even give you illness holidays and don’t pay you the job you’ve done honestly!
Jumaane Williams, member of the New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage provided by federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
Fast-foods increase them over time, but little, on average, its basic employees reach $8.90 per hour in New York.
No one touches less than them in this city.
It is unimaginable for me to live with that money in New York.
It was a time when almost a quarter of American teenagers worked at McDonald's after high school while living with their parents.
Few people saw their main source of income or wanted to stay there for a long time.
Today I find myself interviewing McDonald’s employees who complain that they have to live with this salary and sometimes have to feed their children with.
On the other hand, on the Wall Street Journal forum there are comments saying it’s irresponsible to have children if you don’t know what you’re going to feed them.
Demonstrators who launched the movement on Thursday at 6:30 a.m. near McDonald's on the 40th Street and Madison Avenue demanded that cashmakers and fast food cookers be paid at least $15 per hour, a multiplication of more than twice the current minimum wage.
They also demanded the creation of trade unions in the fast food sector.
The U.S. law prohibits the administration to hinder and punish the protesters of a trade union by brimades or dismissals.
However, administration rarely simplifies their lives.
For a trade union, taking fast restoration remains a difficult task, and that, for concrete reasons.
One of the main is the extraordinary rotation of staff.
They do not agree
Other tumultuous manifestations were held near several other fast restoration chains.
The brilliant moment of the protest was the mid-day gathering near the McDonald's of Times Square with the intervention of several local democratic politicians, including the one of Jumaane Williams, a member of the municipal council, who said: "McDonald's announces to sell billions of portions and after they don't even give you sick holidays and don't pay you the work you've done honestly!".
The protesters were supported by other New York Democrats in view, including the mayor candidate Bill De Blasio who said that “we all have to support the fast-food employees so that they get a fair salary and the economic well-being that each New Yorkese deserves.
The New York Times has characterized this demonstration as the most important that has been known by the fast food industry throughout its history.
But only a few hundred people participated without counting that not all were fast food employees, who employ tens of thousands of people in New York.
It is for now difficult to say if this mass movement brightness will make little ones.
“For the moment, we can only averagely deceive the brain.”
Recently, new technology fans have become accustomed to perceiving augmented reality through special glasses.
Initially, it was Google who revealed its current model this summer at its annual conference and in November it was learned that Microsoft had made the patent application.
However, it follows from the interview with the director of the interactive 3D technology group at the Microsoft Cambridge Laboratory, Shahram Izadi, that for the scientists of this company, the glasses are already of ancient history.
They are tempted by the perspective of manipulating virtual objects in the air with naked hands, by creating open virtual spaces.
Can you tell us in a few words what your research team is doing?
We work on the interaction between man and machine and at the same time we try to expand the boundaries of this interaction.
Humanity as a whole has remained at the moment with the pixels on the flat screen and sometimes with the touch.
We want to look 5 to 10 years ahead of us and guess the radical changes that will occur with this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect sensors are a step forward, and almost no Xbox is sold today without Kinect because everyone is interested in ordering by the gesture.
What reserves the future for us too?
Although the Kinect has made the physical interaction, a lot of things happen on a flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information has been improved (the system receives more data), but the performance, for now, is not really.
We are trying to change this and we are working on truly 3D imaging systems that work on different technologies, including projection technologies.
We need to make the computer world out in our own, in the physical world, making it more touchable.
For this, however, it is necessary to identify not only the user, but also the space that surrounds him.
Thus, we will be able to complement the real world with virtual objects in a more practical form.
And first, let’s get rid of these stupid virtual reality helmets!
What do you think of the voice command?
It is appreciated, but is it not overestimated?
It cannot be said that this is the panacea: the question of confidentiality arises because you don’t always want to inform others of your actions or intentions.
In fact, every type of interaction with the computer is good, but each in its niche.
For example, to order the devices in public places, we had a project for which we thought of gestures, not broad gestures, but rather of discreet, limited gestures.
The gestures were not captured by the camera of the device, but by a handwoven bracelet that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is currently large, but it is theoretically possible to reduce it to the size of a clock.
In fact, the future will be marked by the mixed command, for example: gesture + voice.
That to say?
- For example, how would you ask me to give you this pocket?
You would do it with the word and the gestures.
Usually I just talk.
It will be difficult to recognize.
So, do you want to force users to adapt according to what the machine can or can’t do at a given time?
Not necessarily, but it is a mutual approach.
I think very soon we will have to work on the development of new types of sensors that will allow us to better identify human reactions.
These can be, for example, laser sensors, they produce a pretty good depth resolution and that’s very important.
If you’re interested in your work on Xbox Kinect sensors, what do you don’t like in modern cameras?
Do they lack resolution, depth or anything else?
In principle, it is on the present generation that we are based on our work on 3D recognition.
It would obviously be good to get about 8 megapixels with a speed of 1000 c/s.
But the problem is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and depth.
Compared to this last point, all current technologies are quite good, this adds work to algorithm designers.
The resolution must be kept in mind according to the axes X and Y, but also Z.
The speed also matters a lot, the number of frames in the second.
Human movements are quite dynamic, and 30 c/s are not enough, especially for gestures.
Steven Bathiche, from our Redmond laboratory has given the touch of the sensors a regular treatment delay between 1 and 100 μs, the current sensors being closer to the second value (60-100).
Not everyone understands how much this affects the interaction of man and machine.
I would need a device of this type in my work, but don’t need to touch, to have more frame in the second.
Do you need to increase the number of cameras?
Today, the Kinect has three “cams”, one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the second, a reflective signal receiver.
And the third camera is actually a usual visible field sensor.
It is not used to define the depth of the object.
Many cameras can solve this problem.
Or worsen it by increasing the required volume of calculations.
It would be interesting to create a flexible product similar to Kinect, to play with the camera curve and see how it could help to define the locations.
As far as I remember, Microsoft, unlike Google, has not presented its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that from the point of view of the daily use of augmented reality technologies, glasses are one of the most prospective platforms?
- Of course, walking all the time with a hand lifted smartphone is not practical but here’s what I think: the best option would be an “transitory” augmented reality that would allow you from a cloud platform to pass glasses to the smartphone.
Glasses are a very personal device and that’s what makes their strength (personal elements are those you’re the only to see) and at the same time their weakness: augmented reality from glasses will not allow you to work on virtual objects in collaboration with other people.
Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is only accessible to Tony Stark in Iron Man but also to the simple mortal.
There is a problem on which the opponents of this idea point the finger: there is no touching feeling!
The hands do not feel anything.
What are the responses your team prepares for this challenge?
In my lessons, I often say that augmented reality is the seventh breakthrough in the interaction between man and machine.
I think the eighth could very well be the addition of touch sensations.
For now, one of the interesting techniques is the use of the second hand to serve as image support.
It captures the pressure perfectly.
But there are also technologies that are actually intended to attribute palpability to these “images in the air”: for example the interference of several ultrasound rays directed to a specific point where the finger is located and which gives you the feeling, for the moment still weak, of an air breath on the edges of the fingers.
There are also bracelets on the arms that influence the nervous endings of the fingers, they are also a work axis with prospects.
Have you tried to deceive your brain?
Make him believe he feels what he should normally feel at the moment he sees something?
This is a good idea, we haven’t tried it yet.
There’s still one task below which will take a long time to get off: the way to make someone who is physically in a very small space believe that he’s running in a almost infinite open space – we’re working on the concepts of racing tapes (nothing to do with those we’re in fitness clubs), mobile platforms and also giant balls.
Currently, we can only averagely fool the brain, there are still many years of work left.
This is what makes the work on virtual reality so interesting for the researcher: many things are still in the absolute state of fertilization.
The reign of taste and not of culture - Rosbalt.ru
"Rosbalt" continues the project "Peterburg's avant-garde" dedicated to citizens who are in advance, to the avant-garde of culture and art.
This ultra-selective list has already welcomed prominent actors from the art scene of St. Petersburg whose achievements go beyond the city’s border and who have found a recognition in Europe, after being known throughout Russia.
The new hero of "Rosbalt" is the extraverted painter Kirill Miller.
The whole city is known to Kirill Miller, this pretty brown man, all in red clothes that you can cross near the Russian Museum, the Summer Garden or even in the holidays and flavors.
Kirill Miller's paintings always gather the crowds, regardless of their exhibition place.
He is one of the fundamentally social and philosophical Petersburg contators, one of the founders of the new myths.
Kirill Miller is an outstanding representative of the Petrograd avant-garde of the late 1980s and early 1990s.
It is also the symbol of the city, its appearance makes the inhabitants smile and puts them in good mood.
He recently took into his hands a barbarism orgue and became the symbol of this instrument in St. Petersburg as he had mature enough for this difficult role by his existence, his philosophy and his image of Bohemian.
- Kirill, why do you travel the city all in red and not in yellow or turquoise blue for example?
I chose the red as a couturier specializing in appearance and image.
In this world, red is a compromise between the painter, the image creator and society.
Even if in society, everything that is not gray causes aggressiveness and negative agitation.
But my provocations are intended to start the discussion.
The whole story of my provocative actions is an invitation to the discussion.
When did you know that you should be a painter?
- At the exhibition of the Nevskiy Palace of Culture where my works were located.
I realized that this was my way.
Then the wave of old non-official painters had passed and the new, free, in my kind, were incomprehensible.
I started connecting in friendship with the painters of the new wave, with those of the Postgazonevchtchina who gave birth to "Pouchinskaya-10" and then there was no more wave.
I am interested in theater, fashion, music, all genres except words.
It was important for me to find myself at the center of the culture of St. Petersburg where the best creative forces must gather together.
In 1995, I took place in Pouchkinskaya-10 which had before the works a musical and artistic club, a bohemian club, the house of the Petersburg bohemian.
Many were born there: The NOMs, Tequila-jazz, I still see Chnour come with the project "Van Gogh's Ear".
Chnour and his friends sang easy-to-play songs in molding t-shirts, they counted among them Igor Vdovin, composer today in fashion.
When the band began to appear live, it became "Leningrad".
Trakhtenberg animated a lot of broadcasts before the time of Hali Gali.
We gave them Trakhtenberg and it was then that his great career began, but his training and basic education, it was at us that he received them.
Gallery "D137", Club "Griboïedov": these are the repercussions of the Art Clinic.
Our employees went there as usual.
I am a hero of the past century, of the time when culture wanted to mean something.
In 2000, a survey was organized in the press: it was the prize "The personalities of our city".
I was named the "Painter of the Year" and it was then that my kingdom ended.
It is not convenient to work in a new era with old rules, I am a representative of the truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Today it’s easy to become popular, but culture and popularity are different things, you can be popular, but not really a person of culture.
Your work is characterized by a recognizable style.
“Many of my paintings are hits, they have a very strong actuality and sharpness.
I’ll have a programmed exhibition “The Russian Museum Through the Clowns”.
Clowns belong to an intemporary category.
Before I was a social person, today it’s painful and it’s fearful to be so.
But with the clowns, everything disappears, the tragic falls.
I love grotesque, I have grotesque ideas.
For example, the idea of saving the world through the complete and mandatory disguise.
Today, it is the clothes that matters, we are interested in the external mechanism, but not inside the person.
Maybe you can’t give him the hand, but rather you have to crack him in the stone.
And the lies will be deleted by the disguise.
- Recently we have seen you in the role of the Barbarie organ player. - A cultural city must have this type of hero.
Anyone other than me can play it.
But maybe business art can also be beautiful?
- Today the commercial art must be careful, delicate, liquid.
A disintegration of culture is happening.
Before, the people were divided into cattle, the supporters of the Bohemian loved one thing, and the nicked another.
Today, everything is divided into micro-communities, it’s hard to please everyone.
I’m not a $100 ticket to please everyone.
Now you have to think who you will like.
Each star has 100 fans.
Thousands of people come to Stas Mikhailov.
It’s the people we’ve thrown out who come to see it, it’s the sexual and social side that works.
But for the cultural side, 300 people will come, 10 miles will not come and at the end it is less management, money, everything is gone.
I have my fans, the main thing is not to deceive them, not to ruin the experience.
When I was young, I painted paintings that a collector hanged next to Falk or Larionov.
I started with the paintings that are usually those we paint at the end of life.
Today, ideas are often confused.
It is said that there is spiritual culture, the culture of consumption.
Consumption has no culture, it has nothing to do with.
I am a representative of yesterday’s culture, I grew up with the example of painters who lived in poverty and died in poverty and who refused money just for painting.
I am for this culture.
What is missing in St. Petersburg?
Good cultural experts.
There is this concept: the official of culture.
But not everyone can work in culture.
Under the rule of the good tsars, it wasn’t so, the tsars didn’t understand the culture well, but they understood that the good experts should be kept.
There are good consultants in Moscow today.
We have people here in St. Petersburg who might be experts, but they are excluded, because we need higher experts who will correctly evaluate these experts and make them a way.
Nowadays, it is the “realm of taste” that blooms.
The same Erarta, but they differ in that sense that they honestly say they do not take all contemporary art, that there are painters who have to find themselves from other museums.
What is St. Petersburg?
- St. Petersburg is not the cultural capital, there is much more culture in Moscow, there is a ground for it.
And on our stones, art is hard to push.
We need a cultural ground and we have more writers than readers, that’s bad.
In Europe, there are many curious who will see exhibitions, concerts.
At home, this is very nice.
We have to make art fashion as it was at the beginning of the last century.
Project made with the support of the St. Petersburg Stock Exchange
Birth in space
The Earth is in danger.
Climate warming or collision with a deadly asteroid.
Carvans of spacecrafts with terrestrians on board are leaving in search of a planet of rescue.
To save mankind, a big question is raised: how can we continue to make our species live in appetite or even on a planet of rescue?
I think there is not a lot of choice.
There are actually two real planets that can be conquered, even if only by hypothesis.
“It’s about Venus and Mars,” says Vladimir Sourdine, a researcher at the State Astronomical Institute of P.K. Chternberg (GAICh).
If on Mars the conditions are more suitable for life, the temperature on the surface of Venus is 500.
You can only live there at a very high altitude or on the orbit of Venus ... in space.
We began to be interested in the issues of reproduction in space by focusing on flora.
Half a century ago, we were doing experiments on plants.
Four generations of small beans cultivated on the orbit did not differ in any way from terrestrial varieties.
Then, insects were put on the orbit, small reproductive drosophile mows.
In 1979, sheep eggs were sent into space to see how an embryo was developing.
At the end of the day, you get a normal chicken.
Then the problems begin.
"The problem is related to the fact that the chicken has to find a support, he has to put himself on his legs and start moving," explains the director of the laboratory of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences (IMBP) Vladimir Sychev.
Not found any support, the chickens handed in an irregular way.
And after 10 hours, the newborns saw their instincts completely disappear.
The chickens did not react to the light or the sound.
Unfortunately, they would just die after four days.
"We scattered their eyes twice, then we abandoned, because it's simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sychev explains observing the failure of the experience with chickens in space.
The latest biological "miniature ark" with animals was sent on orbit 16 years ago.
The experiment will continue in the spring of 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will only embark on species of the same sex.
There was an experiment with rats sent with their fetus into space.
In principle, nothing surnatural has been discovered.
“There were still biosatellites and then it’s the only experiment. we need to do this kind of research,” says Vladimir Sychev.
After the landing, the spacecraft gave birth to their descendants.
However, it is not yet possible to perform reproductions directly in space.
This is not a small affair.
By losing their usual environment, animals are no longer able to realize their sexual instinct.
Unlike animals, man is capable of doing so.
Homo sapiens has abstract thinking, it is able to create a suitable emotional background.
This type of experience is not done for ethical reasons.
Women have been in space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was taken by Terechkova.
And the female body is what humanity has the most valuable.
Our mouth was flying and no one on Earth could say if it would hold after a flight into space.
If she could have given birth to a child after the flight.
“No one answered this question,” explains Vakhtang Vatchnadzé, a retired from the missile and space sector.
In June 1964, just a year after her flight into space, the first woman cosmonaut Valentina Terechkova gave birth to a little girl.
The child's father, Andrian Nikolaev was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman cosmonaut Svetlana Savitskaya, after having been on orbit twice and even worked in an extra-vehicular environment, gave birth to a son.
However, the risk persists.
We have few, even very few cosmonauts who have had nothing and who give birth to a healthy descendant after long flights.
"And if they are longer, it poses a danger even during orbit flights," concludes the pilot and cosmonaut, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of Russia, Valeriy Poliakov.
However, humanity has to look for new solutions in biotechnology, radiation protection and the creation of artificial gravity.
Hydrology Laboratory of the Cosmonaut Preparation Center: the compulsory stage of flight preparation.
Here, in zero flottability, cosmonauts train on extra-vehicular outputs.
The water imitates the appetizer.
If for adults, the water is comfortable but yet a foreign environment, for babies, it is their real element.
The little amphibians seem to confirm this: life on Earth comes from the ocean.
As the baby develops about 9 months in the mother's lymphatic fluid, it's easier for him to get used to water.
This is in principle logical, because from his birth to his first bath, it lasts only 2 weeks.
“It’s very little to forget,” explains swimming instructor for babies, Marina Aksenova.
In a word, if for the newborn child the pregnant is a more natural state, the woman needs gravity, a weight force.
During pregnancy, the muscles of the abdomen, the basin are atrophiated very quickly, the baby's ability to push is lost.
Well, let’s ignore this by relying on the birth simulators.
You can, of course, prepare a birth in a special room, the woman will get it out.
“And then?” asked Valeriy Poliakov to invite to reflect on this complex question.
The child also needs artificial gravity.
If it does not feel the Earth's attraction, the body does not form the skeleton or the muscle system.
You cannot dress a baby as an adult with a special combination for the training.
He will simply be deprived of his vital needs.
"And this experience that we would consider in this case by imagining the birth of a child in a foreign environment will lead to the return on Earth of a disabled child, completely disadapted," predicts Director of the Bioethics Committee of the Institute of Medical and Biological Problems of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Igor Pestov.
The birth of children in space is still under theory.
However, with time this will become reality, when the Earthans will go in their vessels to a distant planet that will become the habitat of their descendants born in space.
The head of the ISC (Higher Institution of Public Finance Control) said: "the control of the pseudo-independent work (in Czech "Svarc system ") failed due to politicians.
In the field of public procurement, the Czech Republic has competent inspectors and a quality legislation, but it is behind in terms of its application.
This is what Miloslav Kala, the Vice-President of the Higher Institution for Public Finance Control, said in an interview with Aktuálně.cz.
"The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and, in my opinion, that's what lacks us," Kala said in his comment on the current situation.
A check conducted jointly by Czech and German inspectors also suggests similar conclusions.
He cites as an example of abusive practice the approach of the “Svarc system” by Petr Nečas.
Mr. Prime Minister has recently stated that the ODS will not interfere with entrepreneurs with controls; is it permitted or prohibited?
“The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of the government can’t prevent an authority to go to inspect and require compliance with the law,” says Kala.
At the meeting of the Supervisory Committee at the House of Representatives, you discussed a Czech-German project in which the legislation on public procurement of the two countries was compared.
What was it specifically?
This is a parallel control that we launched about two years ago.
In simple terms, the European legislation provides for how to manage public procurement and the specific national legislation, as well as a practice that is called followed by it.
We’ve gathered all this and although this control procedure is not yet completed, very interesting differences have appeared to us: generally speaking, our legislation may be “more strict and better quality”, yet, according to some parameters, the practice as such is better in Germany.
This therefore confirms that it is not sufficient to constantly develop more and more detailed rules but that it is necessary to dedicate itself to the implementation of the law itself.
What can this project actually help you and what is the result for you?
A common control of this type should just help us stop trying to clarify the laws, lower and improve thresholds, when this does not have a really positive effect.
The principle of good management means getting the matter at a reasonable price (which does not always mean the lowest), in order to exclude any enrichment and possible criminal activity.
But by lowering the market thresholds, this goal will not necessarily be achieved.
It could be that this system is so immersed by the paperasse that those looking for the faults will find much more opportunities than if the threshold had remained higher.
You are talking about internal issues regarding the implementation of public procurement legislation.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there an organization similar to our ISC or a different way of organization?
As for institutions, the same as the ISC, the Bundesrechnungshof works there which is organized similarly, it also has a council composed slightly differently, but these two institutions act fundamentally in a similar way.
The skills are also, to a certain extent, similar, with a nuance however in relation to our system: Germany is a federal structure, therefore it also has such accounts at the level of the different countries.
The BRH can only control federal money, which in our country corresponds to the state resources.
The public funds managed at us by the regions and municipalities, are there controlled at the level of the countries’ accounts.
Is it more simple than our legislation?
I’t want to make a general comparison without concrete data, however, in some areas, Germany is often referred to as a model but it can’t be said that it does better in all areas.
Could it be because they have better inspectors?
No, not, but I repeat, I don’t have comparative data.
However, it must also be said that this country that we consider as a model is also faced with a whole series of problems.
Otherwise they would have no advantage in cooperating with our institution, isn’t it?
With regard to national legislation, what has meant for you, as an institution, the amendment of the law on public procurement, its effects are already felt?
Since this amendment has entered into force relatively recently, it still has no impact on our control operations.
As we do a posteriori checks, we need to count on a certain delay.
Our observations concern only, for the moment, the process of preparation of future controls - we launched a new instrument of "detection of the risks of mismanagement" with which we passed to the crib of 14,000 public procurement - there these changes will, of course, be felt, because the thresholds have been changed as well as the conditions of certain types of procurement procedures and so on.
Do you therefore consider the adoption of this law rather as an advantage or as an additional burden for the administration?
I think this law is a step in the right direction and I hope the future will confirm it.
The problem that may arise is that these rules become more strict and it is not possible to comply with them.
Already under the regime of the previous regulation, the provider (e.g. the regional council, in the case of regional operational programs) compelled the controlled subjects to accept that any breach of the law on the markets means a breach of the budgetary discipline.
Is it really useful to make the law stricter in this way?
No, not in this way, I think.
The system must exclude those who want to attack or abuse the system but do not punish those who make formal errors without consequences on the decision-making process.
Such a system will put pressure on the administration.
So what is the solution to get out of it?
Let’s look where we don’t go.
Recently, the prime minister said that the ODS would not disturb entrepreneurs with the so-called Švarc system controls - what does it mean?
Is Shvarc system prohibited or allowed?
The law must be applied in one way or another, so if it prohibits something, even the head of the government cannot prevent an authority from acting to go to inspect and to demand compliance with the law.
He can say, “We’re going to change the law and allow it,” but he can’t say we’re going to act as if nothing was.
The law on the markets contains relatively strict rules on the formalities to be carried out and that, precisely in order to protect the tender.
But it is also tragic that a subjector is eliminated only because of formal defects.
The law will never be perfect, but its application must be fair and that is, in my opinion, what is missing in us.
The roads are frozen, but most of them remain practical.
In some places in the Czech Republic, the roads are frozen and also snowed.
However, the network remains mostly practicable, in some places with increased vigilance.
Province of Karlovy Vary
In the Karlovy Vary region, the roads were practicable this morning, but by frozen and snowed places.
The temperatures have fallen and oscillate between -5 ° and -10 ° C but they should slightly rise over the day.
The snowfall has stopped in the area and there is only a fine layer of snow left in the plains.
However, the crusts of the Metal Mountains (Krušné hory) are covered by approximately 30 centimeters of snow.
The data from the regional road maintenance service shows that due to the cloud, visibility was reduced by places.
The R6 Highway and the national roads in the region are now practicable without difficulties.
However, vigilance remains to be put on, for example, on some bridges whose coating can be frozen and sliding.
All departmental roads and third-class roads, including mountain roads, are also practicable.
There are still remains on some of their pieces of frozen snow remains and in places stumbled by traffic.
Especially in areas located at altitude, drivers need to strengthen their vigilance.
Regions of Pardubice and Hradec Králové
The Road and Highway Directorate reports on its website that some Eastern Bohemian roads are threatened by the formation of stains and that snow layers trapped by traffic can be found on the roads in mountainous and altitude areas.
The road maintenance services are warning drivers of the risks of steel formation in the areas of the Pardubice region located in altitude.
There can be wheels in the surroundings of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy or Vysoké Mýto, and that, mainly on departmental and third-class roads.
The roads I/43 and I/34 around Svitavy were chemically treated.
Snow is found mainly in the Giants Mountains (Krkonoše) and Eagle Mountains (Orlické hory).
In the districts of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov, a layer of snow damaged by traffic is present on the roads in the areas located in altitude.
In Eastern Bohemia, the weather will be today dry, most often open, with possible cloud passages.
It will blow a low wind and temperatures will usually oscillate between -3 ° and + 1 ° C.
Region of Pilsen
The roads in the region of Pilsen are now practical, although, by places, it is necessary to be more vigilant and adapt its conduct to the weather conditions.
It freezes this morning, the temperatures oscillate between -3 ° and -9 ° C.
After the last snowfall and the cooling that followed, some communication routes may be by frozen places.
Drivers can expect to cross cloud areas, but visibility will gradually improve.
This is the result of the information from the regional road service.
The D5 highway is practicable almost without difficulties, but road communications maintenance services recommend increased vigilance between the 80 and 131 kilometers.
The surface of most national roads is dry and frozen.
Some pieces can be frozen in the district of Pilsen-South and in the district of Tachov.
The departmental and third-class roads are wet and in this case the warning against frozen pieces is applied.
Drivers should be careful, especially on the less frequent roads in the Šumava region.
Region of Olomouc
Drivers traveling to the areas of the Olomouc region located in altitude must now count on a thick and soft snow layer on the roads.
This layer remained on the so-called "Červenohorské sedlo" and on the road towards Videlský kříž, after the chemical treatment operations.
The snowfall forced the road maintenance staff to go to the ground; according to the road service, it fell more than three centimeters in the district of Šumperk.
In other parts of the region, most of the roads are practicable without difficulties.
"On the heights of the district of Šumperk there are snow remains.
Drivers circulating in the direction of Jeseník must expect to meet the "Červenohorské sedlo" a thick and soft snow layer," said today to ČTK the head of the road maintenance services of the Šumperk district.
Their colleagues from the Jeseník district also visited the site during the night; according to the latter, after the chemical treatment, the roads are now free and wet, even in the highest areas.
In the Olomouc district the roads are practicable without difficulties, in the Šternberk district the drivers should, however, be careful in the pieces in forest areas with the remaining wet roads.
Regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec
From this morning, the maintenance services of the North Bohemian roads have several difficult tricks.
According to police data, in addition to some places covered with snow or glass, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice na Ústecku is closed.
Temperatures will remain below zero at lower altitude, and therefore snow and glow should remain on the roads. In the plains, especially south-east of the Central Plateau of Bohemia, there is, on the contrary, no problem and the roads are generally dry.
No traffic difficulties have been for the moment.
The road maintenance services the presence of strawberries, in the vicinity of Štětí.
According to the meteorologists, the night conditions were ideal for its formation: rain and snow flour during the day, light sky and ice during the night.
There are also signs, from the main traffic axes, of difficult conditions on the national road 13 at the border between the regions of Ústí nad Labem and Liberec.
The closure of the traffic between Telnice and Knínice is due to branches of trees that have curved under the weight of snow until they reach the road.
Shimon Ornest said: “In concert, we want to gather positive energy.”
What do you think about the fact that in less than a month it should be the end of the world?
This is just one of those alarming news, the kind of traps in which we love to fall.
In our TAP TAP group, we laugh rather and say that we are the only group capable of gathering a remainder of positive energy in order to push or prevent the end of the world.
In addition, in December, you will run a completely unique project: three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you present this project more in detail to our readers?
This is a charity that we have been preparing for for two years.
We decided to use the marketing potential of the end of the Maya calendar announced for December 21 at 11:10 am.
On December 20th, three concerts will be held simultaneously in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
They will almost end at the time when the Maya calendar will end on the island of Kiribati which is in the Pacific Ocean, on a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who had that idea?
At first I think that was my idea, then we designed everything with our creator, Honza Augusta.
Apart from the fact that we want to gather enough positive energy to save the world, we also want together, with the public, to reflect on the state of the world that we leave to our children.
At the end of the Maya calendar, we created a collection of unique items, including shoes, T-shirts, bags, and original keys against the end of the world, by buying them online at www.e-tap.cz people can also support us.
The TAP TAP group with other interpreters also recorded a hymn against the end of the world entitled "The end of the world cancelled" (in Czech "Konec světa zrušeno ").
It’s already very popular on YouTube, will we hear it at these charitable concerts too?
Of course, all at the end, finally, if we succeed and the end of the world does not take place ...
It will be singed simultaneously by all the performers in the three concerts.
The hymns will also be joined at a given time as part of a completely unique live broadcast from Czech television.
The words of this song were written by Tomáš Hanák who also holds the main role of Jesus in the clip, Xindl X is also singing...
How did you come to cooperate with them?
We collaborate with other figures of the Czech show-biz, because we organize numerous concerts and charitable events...
We strive to encourage them to participate intensely in these projects.
It turned out that most of them are interested in such cooperation and that it entertains them.
What are the benefits of these concerts against the end of the world?
To equip the Studeo training center that is accessible to people with reduced mobility and which we work to realize within the Jedlička Institute, with the Tap association, and that for six years.
Teachers regularly visit the students of the Jedličkův Institute and offer them activities that interest them and entertain them.
Students themselves do not have the means to go to courses, we try to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the construction of the Jedlička Institute, we will transfer this project to a new independent building.
Will there be a number of music groups and performers on stage at each of these concerts?
According to what criteria do you choose them?
We have tried to develop a program that is aimed at all generations, including children.
For example, in Prague, they will rise on stage Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý.
You will find all the details at www.kpks.cz.
Are you preparing for other “mega events” like this in the future?
In May, we will play for the first time as part of the Prague Spring; there too, we will prepare a quality program with interesting guests.
We would also like to play next year at the House of the Czech Republic in New York and personally, once on the site in the United States, I would like to combine concerts in Washington and Chicago.
Your international projects are minimalist, so far you have played for example in Madrid, Brussels, London and Moscow.
The Tap Tap is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage the organization and logistics of your tour?
It’s not so terrible that it looks like at first.
We have five members in the electric chair whose engines have to travel in a row, of course we also trimball a lot of luggage and instrument boxes.
So far everything went more or less always well, ČSA and British Airways were always perfectly prepared for us, they surprised me more than once.
Even in Moscow, where we recently came home, everything happened without problems.
Through your travel abroad, you can compare how these countries differ in terms of access facilities for people with reduced mobility, the attitude of the public towards people with disabilities and so on.
What have been your experiences so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other places where everything works better than at home, we just witnessed in Moscow that the east is all still only in an initial phase.
Compared to Prague, Moscow is still very little accessible to people with disabilities; there, it is not yet common that a person moves alone on an electric chair in the center of the city.
They still don’t consider it an obvious evidence of giving priority to a person in a chair in an elevator.
Fortunately, there also, an association that strives to attract attention to the problems of people with disabilities is being created.
What do we need to do with the more developed countries?
There are a lot of things we are still late for.
It is important to mention that improvements and improvements always depend on the efforts made by the persons concerned.
In London and Madrid, it is quite common that people with severe disabilities move alone in public spaces; they can go to the toilets, to the museums, anywhere...
It is nevertheless not very common there that a large number of people with disabilities participate actively in social life, at this point, you, The Tap Tap, are rather on the top of progress!
Respect for the public and access facilities are one thing, but the situation will really begin to change when we will have among us famous athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers.
Currently, these are only isolated cases of people who have a strong will.
The Tap Tap group is currently very popular, let’s go back a few years, what pushed you in 1998 to create this group?
I started working as an educator at the Jedlička Institute, where I was surrounded by a lot of young people willing to invest in something.
And as I am myself a musician (I play, among other things, saxophone), with a colleague, we created a music activity.
And then, with time, as our moderator Láďa Angelovič says, we have a little lost control of the situation (laughs).
The success has only happened over the past few years, if I’m not wrong?
It is true, creating links with well-known singers and working actively to promote the band has helped us.
We understood that, if a work is not visible, it is as if it did not exist in the bottom.
Thanks to the EU subsidies, we can, in addition, allow us to have quality teachers, equipment, and so on.
Did you aim to reach such a level with The Tap Tap?
From the beginning, I felt there was a potential to change things.
The show business is full of things that copy each other.
In a certain way, it is logical: everything that is new is accepted with caution and it lasts a long time.
There are few original projects, and I dare to say that Tap Tap is one of them.
The first impression of a person who sees us for the first time is naturally compassion, it is naturally ...
But compassion is completely useless, because people with disabilities are not suffering beings, abandoned by all, which we have to take in compassion.
They are people who can live a whole life and prosper, provided that they have the necessary resources of it, of course.
I often say that when people with disabilities succeed in achieving something, it is not just a progress for them but for the whole society.
Is your success not also due to the fact that you are a demanding leader, as you are qualified by many people?
If we want to do quality work, we need to be intransigant in many fields and require a certain discipline.
But I think that’s quite normal.
Some people come to us with a romantic vision and head in the clouds and, when they realize that they have to come to repetitions twice a week, follow preparatory courses and spend a lot of time on the roads for concerts, they quickly lose their enthusiasm.
But it works the same way in every group who wants to work and goals.
The TAP TAP Group currently has twenty members.
How many of them were there in 1998?
One is Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group, people enter and leave, we can’t do anything.
Our doors are always open to those who wish or wish to join us.
This will be the case on the eve of the scheduled day of the end of the world, on Thursday, December 20, 2012 from 21h.
This event will take place in Prague in the Incheba Arena, in Brno in Fléda and in Ostrava in Plynojem with the participation of twelve groups and other musicians from the Czech Republic.
At the end of the evening, these three cities will be connected by audiovisual releases when the band's song "The Tap Tap's End of the World Canceled" will be singed together.
The goal of the concert is to gather funds (at a height of 25 million CZK) to equip the Multifunctional Training Centre Studeo located in Prague in the Jedlička Institute.
The price of a ticket to this concert is 400 CZK, entrance is free for children up to 12 years old, the pre-sale of tickets is open at Bohemiaticket.
Poland and the cosmos.
Last week, at the meeting of the ministers of the countries of the European Space Agency, Poland was admitted as the twentieth member of this agency, it is the second member of the former Eastern Block (the Czech Republic became a full member on 12 November 2008).
Poland had started a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and over the following years participated in a number of agency projects.
However, the route from Poland to space began much earlier.
Even before World War II, passionate Poles worked on space flights; they did not always encounter understanding.
I would like to mention, for example, A. Šternfeld’s conference at the Warsaw Astronomical Observatory, on 6 December 1933, during which he presented ideas drawn from his avant-garde work entitled “Introduction to Astronomy.”
The developments of this young engineer (born in 1905) left the listeners cold and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski was interested in his work.
In 1934, Šternfeld received the Robert Esnault-Pelterie and André Louis Hirsch Prize in France for his book Introduction to Astronautics.
Ledit Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became a great promoter of astronomy and astronomy.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish newspapers and wrote many books dedicated to this scientific discipline.
Gadomski became a promoter of world-renowned astronautics, his contribution was rewarded by the fact that his name was given to one of the craters of the hidden face of the moon.
Since 1925 a drainage was built in Poland to be equipped with a rocket engine.
Unfortunately, neither the author nor the details of this project are known.
It is also unclear whether the missile should be used to push or freeze the drainage.
The only information known about this drainage is that of the press of the time.
From 1933, the Polish artillery began to dedicate itself to missiles.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in collaboration with professors Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Gustaw Mokrzyckiego.
The preserved documents show that this research had reached the stage of the trials.
Of course, with the arrival of the German armies, the research was interrupted.
In 1937, the plans of a photovoltaic hunting missile, drawn by engineer Rohoziński, appeared in the specialized press and the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" was published by an author named Leliwy-Krzywoblocki.
The two projects were aimed at the military use of missile engines.
Just before the war, all the projects of using the missile technique were conducted by the provisional scientific consultative committee ("Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo-Naukowy"), which coordinated all the work.
This committee was established in 1937, but after two years of operation, the beginning of the war ended its activities.
After the war, other work dedicated to aeronautics was published in the Polish press, thanks to the Polish Astronautical Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
For the first time, it is a company in the November 1954 issue of the problem newspaper, which contains four more detailed articles dedicated to aeronautics.
In one of these articles, written by Professor M. Subotowicze, it is proposed to create a company dedicated to astronomy.
At that time, artificial satellite projects had already been launched and it was clear that the field of space research had a future.
At the beginning of 1956, the Polish Astronomical Society (PTA) deployed efforts to join the International Astronomical Federation (founded in 1951) and since autumn, the PTA became a regular member of it.
The following year, the first president of the PTA, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902 - 1959), became vice president of the International Astronaut Federation.
He kept his office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA contributed significantly to the successful development of the meteorological missile RM (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), which became the first Polish missile to carry out scientific research.
The first model, RM-1, was completed in 1957 and the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
This 1800 meters wide missile had a length of 80 cm and weighed a little less than 5 kg.
Later a improved version, RM-1A, was built and, during the summer of 1959, two-storey RM-2 missile flight tests began in the Bledov desert.
The missile had a length of 1.4 meters and was likely weighing 11.5 kg.
The following prototype should be able to perform concrete scientific work - the RM-34 should have a range of up to 14.5 km and serve to observe the wind at altitude.
But in 1963, all the development work was stopped.
The Meteor-1 was developed between 1962 and 1965, successed to the first RM-type missiles.
The missile, designed with two floors, had a total length of 510 cm and an initial weight of 32.5 kg.
Three models (called Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C) were developed; they distinguished themselves by the dimensions of the space reserved for scientific tools.
The Meteor-1A missile had a space offering a volume of 0.4 liters, while in Meteor-1B this volume was 0.34 liters and in Meteor-1C 0.62 liters.
The maximum range of all these types of engines was 37 km.
In the period 1965-1968, the Meteor-2 missiles were developed in the Aeronautical Institute, the first flight tests began in October 1970.
The Meteor-2 missile had an initial weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a useful load of 10 kg at an altitude of about 60 km.
The new versions were Meteor-2H and Meteor-3.
It should also be mentioned that Poland entered the COSPAR (Committee for Space Research) in 1960 and the creation of a COSPAR national committee two years later.
In the framework of the Interkosmos program, Poland also participated in space exploration on Soviet artificial satellites and, in 1978, the pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became, after Vladimir Remek, the second non-Soviet cosmonaut of this program.
The abolition of the law on public utility works is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court abolished the law on public utility works.
This decision raised a strong discussion in the public.
It is undoubtedly interesting to look at this issue from a broader point of view.
Liberalism-oriented economic systems, both in the EU and in the context of globalization, are based on the principle of more unregulated economic competition.
This concrete means that the different economic entities and national economic systems are constantly in conflict with each other.
This is the result of the principle of freedom of trade and of free (without limits) circulation of private capital allied to a narrow financial speculation.
The considerable differences in the labour price (wages) generate pressure on the prices.
It should be put under this term the following meaning: a producer strives through the import of low-selling goods to resist economic competition by “making” the competitor’s price, in order to remove a greater part of the market and thus increase his own profits.
On a large scale, this means for most entrepreneurs: either transfer production abroad, or buy at a low price, or disappear. The result is a significant unemployment in countries where labour prices are high compared to other economies.
Since the private capital has no social responsibility and therefore responsibility toward the unemployment it generates, the social burden of the state necessarily increases.
All this situation intensifies the perfect bad will of gentlemen entrepreneurs to pay taxes and thus compensate for the economic and social damage caused to the whole society by this race to profit.
This situation is so popular that it is not necessary to provide concrete statistical data.
The scrupulous practices of private capital generate in the different economies a situation in which governments of different countries are forced to engage in mutual competition in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population in order to attract foreign capital to their homes.
In other words, governments put their own population to the mercy of private capital without taking into account the social collapse.
This is mainly manifested in the amendments to the laws in force.
The objective is to economically force its own population to accept the dictates of private capital prices, in the field of wages.
This occurs, on the one hand, by a system of economic restrictions in case of long-term unemployment and, on the other hand, by the restriction of workers’ rights in the field of labour legislation.
This results in increasing poverty and deepening the differences between the rich and the poor.
In RFA, there have been for years points of public distribution of food for the poor who cannot supply their needs with their own work.
The number of these people is already counted by millions.
As part of the increased competitiveness of the German economy, it becomes quite common that employees receive such wages that the state is forced to pay a supplement so that they reach the vital minimum.
For example, such a scandal has been updated in the case of employees working as assistants in the federal parliament.
The economic measures of almost all the southern member states of the EU generate, without a doubt, a similar situation in which, under the pressure of a catastrophic collapse of society, people are forced either to emigrate (as it was in the nineteenth century), or to live with wages of misery, on the margins of society, in the hope that one day the private capital will invest in their country.
Here we have to ask ourselves the question: where will this capital come from?
If it comes from other EU countries, then poverty will pass from one country to another; that capital may not come either, or then a Chinese, an Indian, a Brazilian, a Turkish, a Moroccan, an Egyptian or African will continue to work for a fraction of a European wage.
This also applies to Latin America.
The liberal theory and the media claim, to get tired of it, that the state cannot make capital investments in its own economy, that the governed economy leads to an economic catastrophe.
Private capital strongly defends the idea that the state cannot interfere in the economy through regulatory interventions.
We must then wonder whether private capital does not influence and, even, does not today, according to its own selfish interests, lead politics and by the same way, the whole state.
The answer to this question is undoubtedly yes.
The proof of this is that there is a practically all-powerful and present lobby in all states.
It results in a desperate situation manifesting itself in the field of corruption, by the provision of mutual benefits, in the legislation, where everything is condemned but not punishable.
In RFA, the situation is such, that due to the lack of funds, the national ministries delegate the drafting of laws to closely related lawyer offices.
The draft law was then adopted by the Bundestag.
The whole power does not come from the people, as the constitutions of the Western type declare, but from powerful financial groups serving their own interests.
It is obvious that liberalism-oriented democracies are now rapidly faced with the situation described by Appianos in his book entitled “The crisis of the Roman Empire in the time of Caesar and Pompeii”: “The state was long in full delicence and the functions were attributed by violence.
The pots-de-vin, the benefits obtained illegally, and the stones and swords were also used to obtain these positions.
The bottom-to-table and corruption spread unlimited and the people went to the elections with already sold voices..." ... "The honest people did not seek to obtain functions at all, it resulted once the state remained eight months without consuls" ... "We really began to say that the remedy for this difficult situation was an autocracy and that it was necessary to choose an energetic man..." It is true that Appianos had in the mind Pompée, but it is Caesar who irreversibly transformed democracy into an absolute regime.
In conclusion, as in ancient times, today’s society is based on the preference of personal profits, regardless of the interests of society as a whole.
In its essence, private capital is no longer able to understand and claim the interests of society as a whole.
It results, today as before, in an unprecedented decadence of elites, without any effort to carry out profound reforms.
We must therefore look for the causes of the emergence of fascist and communist regimes in the scrupulous liberalization of the economic systems of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.
In the present state of things, the disappearance of these systems for the benefit of liberal-type democracies can be seen as a kind of break before a new stage.
The fact that today’s elites completely ignore the possibility of hundreds of thousands of future human life losses, the humanitarian and social crises we are witnessing today, and the crimes against humanity as we know them from ancient and recent history.
The abolition of the law on public utility works is not a solution, at least in the long run.
Under the pressure of economic competition, both at the international and domestic level, the government of the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to seek ways to decrease the social level of the population.
This trend is systematic.
The solution consists of sociopolitical reforms, which will strengthen state capital investments in the economy, increase citizens’ influence on the government and weaken the position of monopoly of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
The Laboratory of Chaos.
“Nothing will never come out of violence and will never be able,” Sting says in the song ‘Fragile’ whose main verse is ‘Don’t forget how fragile we are’.
"If my sons didn't want wars, there would not be," said Gutele Schnaper, the wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild on her death bed in 1849.
Following the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as usual, many reactions have raised.
Some take the party of Israel, arguing its right to self-defense and placing the Palestinians in the role of terrorists, others support the Palestinians, invoking the racism of the State of Israel, the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs and considering Israel a terrorist state.
I don’t want to think about the question of who is guilty and who is victim, in its waves of recurring murder; in all, the current inhabitants of Israel, including those of autonomous territories, have been born in the present political situation and have not experienced the beginning of violence.
I would like to offer the readers a point of view " behind the curtain", on the one they mostly benefit from tensions that have lasted for more than 95 years (from the Balfour declaration in 1917) in a small part of the Middle East countries.
Some of these reflections rely on historical facts available to the study, others come from my own understanding of that, or more precisely of the group of individuals, which is the main trigger of the events of modern history.
The history of mankind is above all the history of a struggle for power.
At every time we can find an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is not so obvious is whether these individualities acted independently or whether they owe their acts to the throne to someone who directed their acts according to predefined goals.
We have to admit that we live in a time when global wealth is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals and that this financial concentration generating certain powers has not been possible for a single generation.
Among the families possessing astronomical wealth is the Rothschild family, which could be considered the head of the pieuvre (I don't know if these families still have a leader but I don't exclude him).
There is little written about them.
of course.
Since the 90s of the nineteenth century, they have acquired the first world news agency (Reuters) to put an end to the establishment of links between their names and serious criminal acts to which they were involved and which had always meant for them a strengthening of their power, an increase in their fortune or both.
They have major shares in almost most central banks in the world and prepare or conduct wars against the countries in which they still do not have such shares (before the invasion of Afghanistan the number of these countries was 7, after the invasion of Iraq of 5, after the overthrow of Gaddafi only of 4, while Russia placed the Russian central bank under the control of the Russian government).
Anyone who has tried to fight against this family is dead.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew to the Bank of America of the Rothschilds the status of central bank and began to issue during the Civil War his own money (governmental, I hear well) and was murdered in a theater in 1865.
JFK began to issue clean money and wanted to dissolve the FED, he was murdered in 1963, the deputy Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 while he wanted to attempt a trial against the FED for having triggered the great economic crisis of 1929.
Their thirst for power at the world level led in the years 1859 to 1871 to the formulation of a plan of three world wars by Albert Pike, a franc-mason initiated at the 33th degree, being the highest level.
The first war was intended to eradicate the great state monarchy of Europe, the second was to eradicate colonialism, especially British, and the third was to reduce the world population between 1 and 0.5 billion individuals (this number of slaves is sufficient for their luxury and comfort), to create a single universal religion (because ecumenism is nothing but the beginning of such a solution) and, in the end, to acquire an absolute power.
The method used by the clan of the richest families with their heads the Rothschilds consists in creating a crisis and then proposing a solution (to give ab chaos - the order following chaos).
These solutions are false and always lead to an aggravation of the situation (see the creation of the FED aimed at avoiding the repetition of crises such as those that they caused in 1907).
After they managed to trigger the First World War by the assassination in Sarajevo of Ferdinand, Habsburg's heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, they destroyed Tsarist Russia by provoking the Bolshevik revolution.
The First World War suddenly ended with a German capitulation without any economic and military justification (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of Tsarist Russia) and it was followed by the fragmentation of Austria-Hungary, the power of Central Europe.
For a easier start of the Second World War, the bankers allowed politicians to create a latent conflict situation: on the one hand, they imposed on Germany farming war repairs thus generating the conditions of a radicalization of the poor masses (there is enough for them to place a sufficiently energetic leader, showing the finger of the guilty, proposing simple solutions) and on the other hand, they created a Czech Republic composed of different nationalities, including a strong German minority that had to play the role (which it actually tinted) of the fifth column to put the fire into the powder and trigger a war.
At the end of the nineteenth century, the Rothschields inspired the creation of the Zionist movement, one of the branches of which aspired to the creation of a Jewish state, preferably in the historic Judea region with Jerusalem as the capital (return to Sion).
The Balfour statement mentioned above put the foundation for a massive Jewish emigration to Palestine and the first frictions with the local Arab population began.
Terrorist attacks were committed on both sides.
The Second World War broke out; it is difficult to appreciate whether Hitler broke the chains in which international bankers had held it initially; or if everything he did was planned, the fact is, however, that the suffering of the Jews of Europe in concentration camps created the foundation for the acceptance of a Jewish state by the world community.
Israel was officially founded in 1948; in the same way as the war repairs imposed on Germany were the source of the Second World War, the foundation of the State of Israel burned a firehouse that could cause a Third World War.
If international bankers succeed in triggering this war, the Jewish population will be as it was during the Second World War, the first victim of the battles, this time the same as the Arab or generally Muslim population of the Middle East.
Israel is like an immense laboratory, the source of discord and chaos, not only in this country, but on the international level (it’s enough to see how people are sharply divided between Israel’s supporters and defenders).
Who is guilty and who is a victim in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, where one evil generates another evil according to a circle of endless violence and where, at the origin of everything, is found the cupidity of certain individuals and their desire to gain power over the whole world?
Here we have to make the difference between the simple citizens of Israel and their leaders, because as in us, international bankers offer people to the elections only their own candidates.
The current Prime Minister of Israel is a typical example of fascist, loyal to international bankers, who does everything to trigger a war with Iran, which could, due to the country’s accession to the Shanghai cooperation organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan, etc...) extend to become a global conflict and, given that Iran controls the Hormuz Strait through which it passes 20% of all world oil (this naval corridor has a width of only 2 miles) and generate a destruction of the world economy.
In 1994 David Rockefeller said, “The only thing we need is a general crisis and people will accept a new world order.”
In their idea, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which a few aristocrats of finance are served by the rest of the human population.
A world in which every newborn is seen to be implanted at birth an electronic chip making him a fully controlled being.
Let them force all individuals, small and big, rich and poor, free and slaves, to carry a mark of iron on their hand or on their front, so that he may not buy or sell anyone who does not carry the name of this wicked beast or the number of his name.
It must be understood: that whoever has good sense counts the numbers of this ferocious beast.
This number indicates the man and it is six hundred and sixty-six."
The film Argo: When everything goes worst, call Hollywood.
In November 1979, a crowd of Islamist students attacked the U.S. Embassy in Tehran and held 52 diplomats as hostages.
They had to be released in exchange for the Shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who, after the revolution, had fled to the United States, which supported his regime for several decades.
The situation did not offer the U.S. administration a positive outcome, it could not, in fact, abandon the Shah, because it would have seriously shaken the trust of its allies in other countries.
However, in Iran, where the revolution had led to the establishment of a theocratic regime, it was unable to obtain the release of the hostages.
It was a hard blow to the prestige of the United States, a blow further aggravated later by the fiasco of the attempt to release the hostages by force.
The captured diplomats were finally released 444 days later, following negotiations organized by the Algeria government.
Their fate raised a wave of solidarity and an anti-Iran feeling in the United States.
The Iranian defeat contributed greatly to the defeat of Jimmy Carter against Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential elections.
The film Argo, by actor and screenwriter Ben Affleck, describes an episode of this story that offers a little victory to America.
Just before it was occupied, six employees fled the embassy.
After complicated periods, they found themselves in the residence of the Ambassador of Canada.
In collaboration with the Canadian authorities, the CIA managed to get them out of Iran through a rocambolic cover: they left the country with Canadian passports as members of a filming team that came to make signs for the filming of a great science fiction film.
Combination of gender
The plan of exfiltration expert Tony Mendez requires the collaboration of Hollywood.
In order to make the legend more credible, specialized stores this film project, press conferences were held and a fictional production company had real offices.
The details of the operation remained secret for a long time, the film was based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
The Affleck film is an unusual combination of several genres.
This is part of a political thriller designed realistically but also a "caper movie", the story of a successful blow, a betrayal - like, for example, in the Ocean's eleven, twelve and thirteen trilogy.
The atmospheres are successive: documentary-style Tehran sequences (in the subtitled sequences are presented iconic photographs of the time of events and how, thanks to these photos, these same situations were retranscribed in the film, there are no big differences),
light passages of Hollywood, treated with irony and a little exaggeration,
And then scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions with dressed men discussing the situation around conference tables, in the corridors and by telephone...
Ben Affleck has managed to reboot his career in a remarkable way.
As a ridiculous actor, he became a respected scenery and his acting game ceased to raise ironic remarks.
Argo is his third long-movie after the dark police "Gone Baby Gone" (2007) and the thriller "The Town" (2010).
It’s also Affleck’s first film that doesn’t take place in his hometown, Boston.
The sense of the atmosphere of a place is one of the characteristics that placed its first films above Hollywood standards.
Affleck also demonstrates that sense of the atmosphere in Argo where the role of Tehran “is held” by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets, during the reconstruction of real facts; the initial sequence of the fall of the embassy is impressive by its clarity that also suggests the confusion and unpredictability that occurs when suddenly, in a given place, a page of history is written.
Affleck and his collaborators get a similar effect in fictional scenes (the false filming team in the Tehran bazar).
Too much action in too many places
The screenwriter had to satisfy himself with a subject that in fact offers just a few exciting scenes, in the cinematographic sense of the term.
It goes out very well, it sometimes adds some elements to reality and there, the result is not always as elegant (the scene in which the crisis threat at Tehran airport is removed by a phone call in America and the pursuit on the landing track are quite pulled by the hair).
The weakness of Argo lies in its dissipate character, due to the need to show too many events at too many different places.
If it is true that Alan Arkin and John Goodman are quite charming in their role of Hollywood co-operators, their characters would have deserved a greater place and they are not, far from that, the only ones in this case.
Affleck's film lacks a bit of dramatic tension, it leaves itself to be seen with a moderate interest, appreciating the performance and retro style of the 1970s.
He trains the spectator, but with difficulty.
As a reminder of a story yet, in a certain way, unfinished to this day, and as an illustration of the exaggerated character of the representation of the secret services as omnipotent and omniscient, he does the case.
Rules for swelling ballons, bananas and the circus
The server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which conduct a public investigation of the most absurd bank expenses every year, has now decided to launch the contest of regulations or ideas from the most absurd "EU workshop".
“The fact that the EU is considering, in recent times, to adopt a quota of 40 percent of women for the management of major European companies has been the source of our decision,” said Patrik Nacher, the organizer of the survey.
Among the absurdities mentioned, there is, for example, already the recent decision of the European Court to unify the insurance prizes for men and women.
Until now, however, women were beneficial in terms of life insurance rates because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
People can report until the end of the year any other such incredible idea of the "EU workshop".
“The vote will take place before the end of February 2013,” Nacher said.
Among the controversial EU regulations are, for example, the obligation to add organic components to fuel, which has harmful consequences for the environment, or the prohibition of using reliable mercury thermometers only because they contain a relatively small amount of a dangerous substance or the directive on the size of the cages of chickens, which led to an increase in the price of eggs.
Criticisms have also been issued in the past against the prohibition of the use of the expression "butter" or the withdrawal from the sale of traditional lamps.
The quality of the bananas must have a size of 14 centimeters.
The European administration often reacts under the pressure of a commercial or industrial lobby whose requests are usually defended in Brussels by a state or a group of states (thus the Czech Republic currently imposes requests from its banks by threatening to use its veto right).
The interests of pressure groups are also, for example, the source of the fact that in the Union, bananas should not be of a size less than 14 cm or present an abnormal curb.
The European Commission defended itself by argumenting that it was only to harmonize non-homogeneous national standards that complicated trade.
The standards for fruits and vegetables have been relieved despite the opposition of some states, claiming that existing directives lead to food waste.
The first prize may be awarded in this survey to the last year’s EU regulation that must contain on the swallowable ballons a warning indicating that children under 8 years should not swallow without adult surveillance.
The EU has referred to a U.S. investigation that ballons are, among the toys, the main cause of children’s deaths from drowning.
A similar restriction applies to children under the age of 14 when it comes to breathing in fair trompets.
We also have some strange ideas.
The following rule concerning the European officials themselves is quite absurd: due to the sensitivity of this topic to Greece, any person having an official function within the EU cannot use the name "Macedonian" and must, instead, speak of FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia).
In collaboration with the association "Let's Do" which group liberal economists, the server Bankovnípoplatky.com named in this investigation, in addition to some of the absurdities mentioned above, the EU Regulation on the volume of food reserves on the territory of the Czech Republic.
The EU had set maximum volumes for food reserves that may be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our membership to the EU.
The Czech Republic then exceeded, for example, the fixed volumes for conserve fungi and therefore threatened a heavy penalty.
The organizers of this investigation found interesting the idea of paying amounts of money to some countries because they don’t have access to the sea and the idea of granting a subsidy to request the grant.
These ideas, however, are not from Brussels but from Prague.
“The fact that we don’t have sea is a disadvantage.
We will ask the European Union for a refund."That said in the autumn of 2004, the Minister of Agriculture of the time Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD).
He argued that, due to our wheat production, and after the so-called “interventionist” purchases, the state had found itself with full stocks that it had to then export.
According to Palas, the EU had to pay us millions of euros, because the Czech Republic is far from the ports.
Finally, the European Commission responded positively to the Czech demand and organized an offer call for the purchase of wheat from countries without maritime access.
Subsidies for the obtaining of subsidies were proposed to the municipalities by the Ministry of Local Development led by Minister Pavel Němec (US-DEU), these should, concrete, serve to write the subsidy applications granted by Brussels.
The EU declares: “Strange regulations are rare.”
Although regulations often raise criticism in the Member States, according to many experts, the EU’s efforts to regulate and improve the effectiveness of the functioning of the Union as well as in the field of its overall development are rather worthy of praise.
More serious is, for example, according to experts, the problem of the use of EU subsidies for projects that have absolutely nothing to do with the strengthening of European integration, but which have been imposed by the Member States during the budget talks.
The fact that the Czech Republic, like other EU countries, has to struggle in Brussels for the right to use specific names for these traditional products (the struggle of which it does not always come victorious) raises vibrant emotions among the Czechs.
If after six years of battle against the Germans and the Austrians, the Czechs successfully defended the denomination "Olomoucké tvarůžky", for the denomination "Tuzemský rum" that dates back to us in the 19th century, our producers had to replace it with the denomination "Tuzemák".
Only cane sugar alcohol-based products, not cane sugar-based products, can be called rum.
In the official list of EU registered products, today in company are world-known cheese such as Feta or Gorgonzola, Lübeck bread or Parma jambon, Karlovy Vary cookies ("Karlovarské suchary"), Pohořelice and Třeboň carpes ("Pohořelický a Třeboňský kapr") and Žatec houblon ("Žatecký chmel").
Pardubice spice bread ("Pardubický perník") and cakes called "Cornets de Hořice " ("hořické trubičky") can also be proud of their community brand.
People want me to save the Republic, but I'm just an amateur, Senator Okamura says
How do you think you want to participate in the presidential election?
It is not to be a senator or president that matters to me.
If everything worked without problems in our country, I’t be a candidate anywhere.
But I can no longer see how the country has been stolen over the past twenty years, that the thieves are not under the roofs and the taxes and the age of retirement are increasing.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I don’t like, then I try to bring a solution so that it changes.
And since I’m over forty years and I’m an independent member, a member of no party, I don’t have any other solution to influence the situation than to present myself to presidential or senatorial elections.
You have entered the Senate but you have quickly moved to the Castle (N.d.T.: headquarters of the presidency).
Do you not turn your back to those who have chosen you?
I’ve always said I’m going to go into the battle for the castle according to the results of the Senate elections.
I later said that if I were elected Senator, I would present myself to the presidential elections.
My goal is not the function, it is only an instrument that allows me to realize my vision.
That is why I need the greatest influence and the broadest mandate.
The problem is not only that as a nation we rally in the bar or in front of our TV station, but it is also that we hurt those who try to bring change.
It adds that the press breaks the reputation of people and confuses freedom of speech with freedom of lie.
For instance, it has been affirmed about me that I sweat journalists or that I was Jiří Paroubek’s counselor.
Let’s come to your visions.
You have started the struggle for the Castle with as a battle horse the themes of the material and criminal responsibility of politicians and retroactive tax statements beyond twenty million [of CZK].
You must change the law for this purpose.
As a president, you do not have such a power and only the Senate as a whole can propose laws.
How do you want to solve this problem?
When I, as a citizen, made pressure to make tourist guide activities a liberal profession, I gained a cause gain.
The problem is politics: when someone comes from left or right with a good project, this is consciously rejected and it delays citizens.
As an independent member of no party, I have a much greater chance of getting the support of all parliamentary parties.
I have the advantage of power, without categorization and dogma supporters, to take from each party what is best for our country and implement it.
Do you consider yourself a right-wing or left-wing man?
From a Czech point of view, I have the impression that people place me rather to the left.
For me, whether it’s a little left or right, it’s not really important.
The most important thing is that we are going forward.
What matters to me is not that people are left or right, but to gather people.
I always support any solution contributing to the common good, even if it is proposed by the Communist Party or ODS and I act equally impartially against bad ideas.
Are you angry when someone says you are a populist?
But what you said does not prove it?
When you develop a business plan in a company, you also have a certain optimal goal and a vision.
You are trying to get closer.
Some may call it populism, but all the proposals I am talking about have been applied by the world and recognized experts have talked about it.
But without the support of the parliament, you have only slogans left.
You will not survive long in politics with this.
Do you think that if you go to see people and talk to them, you will succeed, for example, in imposing material and criminal responsibility?
I have no other option.
I have to convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to bring them together in my camp to impose it.
If I were elected president, it would not be a problem to broadcast live on television my request to the presidents of parliamentary parties to legislate on the material and criminal responsibility of politicians, officials, judges and prosecutors.
They should explain why they don’t want it.
When there will be a strong personality that will identify abuses, it will be possible to make pressure on the political scene.
Take for example the election of the president by direct vote, it was obtained through the pressure of the public opinion.
I admit, without ambitions, to be an amateur, not a genius or an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my opinions and visions.
I just started politics and I try to get the support of the majority for my program.
I try, alone, to get things forward, and if it doesn’t work, I’ll stop in six years and return to the private sector.
It was a bit like Okamura had to save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that one person can’t make the difference, that’s why I went to see a number of personalities to ask them to participate also in the Senate elections.
I met Radim Jančura, but he refused because of the amount of work.
I at least supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová who revealed the fraud to the mazout.
I presented myself because people are really unhappy but now I doubt.
Seventy percent of people did not vote and what they did, mostly, gave their vote to a representative of the establishment.
In the Senate we are only two independent people.
People have chosen a Senate that will hardly impose changes.
Nevertheless, I will fight for my vision, for example, the direct vote of the mayor and prefects of regions.
Are you planning to set up your own party?
No, not yet, because I don’t have the time to check if the past of each potential member is untouched and then I don’t have the financial resources.
I also don’t have money for my presidential campaign, I only have twenty thousand on my “transparent” account.
Do you have no money?
You are talking about taxation, what is yours?
I am estimated at about 60 million the value of my personal property.
I have in Prague a land worth 25 million, an apartment worth ten million, another apartment worth eight million, a collection of works of art worth about ten million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škoda Superb worth 1 million and a few million on my account.
By the way, I own an Aston Martin, because it was a child's dream: I always loved James Bond, who was driving a car, was galant with women and fought against evil and abuse.
You run on Aston Martin, you have a wealth worth 60 million and you don’t have money for your campaign?
Do you want to change the country but don’t want to invest your own money in it?
This is not very convincing.
I don’t have $15 million for this campaign.
Should I borrow?
I have already invested 2 million and a half in the campaign.
The fact that I have no sponsor shows well that my program does not raise a lot of interest.
I have no obligation to pay this campaign from my pocket.
My campaign fees are generally covered by the remuneration I will receive as a senator.
But I couldn’t live, for example, paying my son’s English school which costs 30 thousand a month.
If my only goal was to make money, I won’t present myself to any election.
So will you continue your business to be able to live?
Didn’t you say that you’re going to put your activities in dirty?
But this is not related to the amount of this remuneration.
As I promised, I partially cut my activities.
For example, my adjunct will take the direction of the travel agency in the spring.
People would want me to be a Samaritan who saves the Republic.
I have to live from something.
What was your usual monthly salary when you were an entrepreneur?
I won and I continue to win between two hundred and four hundred thousand.
If I were president, I would end my business.

The architects of the MVRDV office prove that real adventures are not just a matter of imagination. To convince yourself, you just need to contemplate Spijkenisse and the newly erected book mountain - 2 photos
“I think this building is fun, it’s very futuristic, finally something interesting to see,” says Lisette Verhaig, a passenger on the bottom of the street.
Stefan Spermon, a computer scientist in a large neighboring company, tells us: “Yes, it’s really pretty, this building.”
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
Everyone has an internet, an iPad and e-books.
Nowadays, no one is going with his full will in one of these ringard libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a city-dortoir that has nothing attractive at the gates of Rotterdam, holds a quite special record.
The municipality of 80,000 souls shows the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to return some neurons to the brain, the city decided, a few years ago, to contribute to the general culture and to reproduce the seven fictional bridges that appear on the euro bills in the form of beautiful small miniatures of painted armed concrete.
The success of the cultural offensive remained limited.
This is how the city authorities realized that there was only one way to get back on statistics: building a library!
Winy Maas, from the Rotterdam Architects Office MVRDV, the master of brave stick diagrams and creator of mindful and often cynical buildings, accepted the project with its usual flegm and presented himself to the competition in 2003 with five books under the arm and a scratch on the face.
And while the jury members were still looking at each other, disconcerted and lifting the shoulders, Maas, the crushed, scratched his choice books by order of size to make it a pyramid, and ended his speech supported by activist arguments by one: "good common!"
Here is my proposal for the Book Mountains of Spijkenisse, or, as we say, the Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the mountain of 30 million euros came out of land.
The building is part of a revitalization project that also includes a ground parking, a supermarket, a post office and a few buildings and citizens' houses for a total of 50 houses.
In early November, the Book Mountains received the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
In addition, the project was selected for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
That is how this small town, which so far had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian area and a city of an upset wrath, whose white facades invite to think that they are home to a dairy, has enriched itself with a contemporary architectural work.
The most important thing is that Spijkenisse now possesses the first public cultural building in its history.
The Long Way to Reading
First impression: Eldorado of the book under the cheese clock.
Certainly, an elevator carries you to the heart of the massive, but the real joy of reading and architecture opens to you when you walk the floor of the building to discover its topography.
The whole glass interior is bright and clear, the Dutch roof floor and the elegant reverbers speak the language of the municipal public places.
The urban atmosphere is perfect.
We are already looking from the sight of public banks, dogs and little boys and little girls playing the ball.
And everywhere books, books and more books.
“Normally, the library rays are located along the facade and in the middle is a large and dark room, which is often uncomfortable and impersonal,” says Willy Maas.
We completely disrupted the classic space configuration and opened the reading spaces from inside to outside.
The interior of the book mountain was carefully arranged: in the middle are the offices, the Internet library, the chess club, the center for the environment and the building’s technical center.
A particular beauty lies in the black rays of the library, which are sometimes lambris, sometimes balustrades, sometimes trap ramps.
A new experience for sight, touch and smell.
Even the architects and engineers of the hardened building do not want unknown materials.
“We wanted to work with recycled materials,” explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at the Spijkenisse municipality, in a response to Standard.
This is how one day we found in a frisonne agricultural enterprise an ad hoc waste from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, a millimeter thick synthetic membrane has been used for years as a substrat in greenhouses and fields.
It’s cheap and we save time.
The fine membrane is used for one or two seasons, then it can be thrown.
For the library, the membrane was compressed, for the first time in such amounts, in plates of a thickness of four centimeters.
Under the effect of heat and pressure, the "Landbouwplastic" (KPL) changes color and turns into a dark, homogeneous and resilient material, whose smell refers to both a new car and sports shoes.
At the top of the 105 stairs is the top of the mountain.
After almost 500 meters, the literary cafe offers a stunning view of the city, but also Dutch croquettes and pot ficus.
These create an atmosphere, but they mainly contribute toining the ideal level of moisture of the literary mountain air.
Donations for the new soul
“It’s incredible, but despite all the glass surfaces, this building is a model environmental project,” Trouborst says.
The temperature of the building is regulated by geothermia.
Although the mountain of books is located below a glass clock, the sun lights only a short time inside, even in the days of good weather.
The thick wooden potters mounted from the glass facade serve as a sunshine, intercepting a large part of the rays.
The atmosphere is very pleasant.
The fully automated stores charge the rest.
Stefan Spermon, the above-mentioned septic computer scientist, has already risked to enter the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was there too.
Cynthia Bogarde, a professor of traditional Chinese medicine, describes even Boekenberg as the "finally found soul" of Spijkenisse.
A few weeks ago, during the inauguration, each citizen was invited to donate a book from his personal library.
This measure allowed to fill the vacuum of the library that was not yet completely garnied (today it has 70,000 pounds).
The concept is a success.
The rays are overflowing from all sides.
According to architect Winy Maas, “There is nothing worse than a half empty library.”
“I believe that our invitation has created a certain relationship between each citizen and this new building.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
But it’s just for decoration.”
This is how MVRDV has achieved the master discipline that is called, in the professional jargon, “the creation of an identity.”
Spijkenisse has written a new page of literary history.
She may seem young and uneducated.
This is finally a new starting point for the birth of a identity.
Szabo: “The Germans must play a greater role.”
Germany voted on the admission of the Palestinian state.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on relations between the United States and the EU, this decision put Berlin in a delicate political situation.
Deutsche Welle: Earlier this week, Germany had announced its intention to vote against the Palestinians' request to obtain the status of observer state from the United Nations.
He then chose to abstain.
Why to?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not approve what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
However, Berlin must be cautious because it has special relations with Israel.
But I also think it does not support the US position.
Germany wanted to declare its independence, but not to be too critical to Israel.
During the March 2011 Rebellion in Libya, Germany also chose to abstain when voting on the establishment of an air-exclusion zone.
At the end, NATO imposed this measure.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position on major international issues?
The answer is yes.
The reason for this is that Berlin is reviewing its foreign policy, seeking to get away from a policy so-called defined by the Americans and to establish a German foreign policy.
Furthermore, the lack of coherent and common policy within the Union complicates the situation.
The Germans are facing on several fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I think they’re still struggling to find this role, but they’re on the way to a “more normal” foreign policy.
A foreign policy, such as France or the UK
What does the term “normal” foreign policy mean for the Germans?
It shows the willingness to adopt positions independent of those of the United States and European partners, including with regard to national records.
I believe that German foreign policy is also determined by its economic policy, therefore by its exports and relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
German economic interests are, to a certain extent, different from those of other great powers: therefore Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced Germany’s position towards the conflict in the Middle East and the abstinence during the UN vote?
Germany first has significant outbreaks in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf countries.
Therefore, Berlin must be careful not to hit the public opinion, but also the elites of the Arab countries.
This is undoubtedly a decisive element.
However, I’t give it too much importance, because it’s not a exclusively unilateral relationship.
But this is in any case a decisive element in the German strategic reflection.
Does Germany damage its relations with the United States by choosing abstinence in major votes, as in the case of Palestine?
I think Europeans and Americans understand the position of Germany perfectly.
That’s why I think the fraction is not as serious as it was in the case of the Libyan issue.
Maybe even Germany will be more respected.
In fact, Germany has demonstrated that it must be taken seriously as an international actor and that its interests must be taken into account.
In Europe, the views on the Palestinian initiative are different.
The United States has announced its veto with a clear voice.
Are the opinions different between the United States and the majority of European countries?
There have always been differences due to the U.S. internal political scene.
I believe that the Obama administration secretly shows a great understanding of the European position.
But given the political configuration of the country, the government cannot, of course, defend its position publicly.
I believe that the real differences of opinions are not so large as they always seem.
If you look at the relations between Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, you will notice that Obama is far from filling with enthusiasm towards Netanyahu’s policy.
Does Germany experience difficulties in conciliating its close relations with Israel and the United States, on the one hand, with the position of the great European partners, on the other hand?
This does not make it easier for the Germans.
Of course, it would be a little easier for the Germans if there was a coherent and uniform European policy, but today it is not the case.
They cannot therefore enter into a broader political line and must affirm their unique position.
This is what they are doing in the euro issue.
In my opinion, Germany will take on a locomotive role in the future and will push Europe to adopt a European position.
This is not easy for Germany, especially because of relations with Israel.
This question has always been delicate.
But I think the Germans are well aware of the fact that they must play a role that marks more their independence.
Does Germany see itself playing a role of weight actor on the international stage, does Germany just want to take on a key role?
Or is it always difficult to take on top roles?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is always uncomfortable to it and, for obvious reasons, the country is still experiencing difficulties to play a more important role.
If we look at, for example, the euro crisis, we notice that every time Germany decides to weigh more, many anti-German feelings are heard.
This does not make it easier for the Germans.
In fact, it’s always the same problem: we don’t want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
From this point of view, Germany is in a much more delicate position than the United States.
It has to compone with very diverse neighbors and opinions, and that’s not easy.
Today, the influence of the United States on European policy is only decreasing, but at the moment, the EU does not fill this emptiness, then what remains?
The Germans will just have to play a bigger role.
And even if they don’t like it, even if it’s unpleasant to them and if they’re just less appreciated, it’s life!

"Brand Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani Suddenly Become Chinese
Armani and Polo Ralph Lauren are brands known worldwide.
Armani Polo, what is it really about?
Behind this name is a trademark officially registered in China, but that has nothing to do with the original company.
The brand enjoys such a protection that the company that carries its name cannot complain.
And even if she could, it’s not sure she would get a cause gain.
“It’s increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China,” says Thomas Pattloch, a lawyer at the Taylor Wessing cabinet specializing in breach of property rights in the Far East.
Every week a new file comes to my office.
Imitators only need a few additional letters to be able to record their trademarks.
So instead of Gucci, Lu-Gucci is recorded, and instead of Prada, Prada-Kny is recorded.
German companies are also legally copied, such as Puma, the manufacturer of sports items.
Pattloch opens a booklet in which the records are recorded at the Beijing Brand Office.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company submitted the brand Zegna DF Puma, a name that the company artificially created by owning a part of the name of Ermenegildo Zegna, the fashion house.
It is a well-known fact that the Chinese have become the world champions of copying and violating intellectual property.
In large cities, there are multiple-storey shopping centers that almost only sell counterfeits.
However, Pattloch’s cases are different: its mandates charge him to deal with the fact that the Chinese Brand Office officially gives Chinese companies the right to use a name that is already protected in another country.
The Chinese people speak of "Bang Mingpai", a parent brand.
The term is derived from “Bang Dakuan”.
It is with this term that women marry wealthy men.
The Chinese authorities say they have nothing to blame.
“It’s bad for business, we have to fight this trend,” Pattloch claims.
“The brand is sweetened, the singularity disappears, the damage to the reputation is huge.”
Financial losses and justice costs amount to millions for the sectors concerned, especially when it comes to expensive high-end products.
According to the market analysis company CLSA, China represents, with an annual volume of €15 billion, the world’s third-largest luxury product market and the fastest growing market.
However, it is not easy to delete the doubtful records from the trademark register and these procedures are expensive.
These can last up to nine years, and the outcome is never certain.
Pattloch reports the trials during which the court rejected the complaint, because after a long period, the denomination criticized had become a “market reality.”
Pattloch explains that if the complainant has no luck, he may even be forced to pay money to the plagiarist, because he would have damaged his brand in China.
Sometimes this is the rule of the jungle.
Famous cases are also related to graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler had lost a legal battle against the construction machine maker Sany, the same company that just bought the beton pump maker Putzmeister.
That’s why the Chinese can use an emblem that looks like the Mercedes star.
Geely, the Volvo acquirer, used before a blue and white logo that reminded the BMW. The conflict was resolved and Geely had to modify it.
The fashion house Lacoste had lost against the plagiars of Hong Kong and Singapore who had reoriented the look of the famous crocodile in the opposite direction.
The Chinese authorities say they are not guilty of anything.
The CTMO brand office in Beijing, however, admits that it had some difficulties in 2010 due to a lack of staff and space.
However, the office would have passed last year from a “urgency situation in the course of the work to a normalized.”
So, the number of untreated opposition procedures would have decreased by 22%.
Nearly 57,000 cases of this type would have been closed, which is an increase of 75% compared to the previous year.
However, 81,500 procedures are still suffering in the office.
Action is expensive
As often in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, CTMO received more than 1.4 million registration applications, a third more than in 2010.
According to the office, this is a record and this means that China is for the tenth consecutive time in the top of the ranking for the number of new deposits in the world.
This would also apply to the total number of legal brands, which is 5.5 million.
In 2011, the office had accounted for 1.8 billion yuan of registration rights.
In other words, each registration an average of 1,280 yuan, or 160 euros.
A legal battle costs much more, as illustrated by the case of the German family company Freudenberg.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting a Chinese plagiarism.
Of course, the Germans were able to obtain that the illegal manufacturing of vehicle components was suspended.
However, the imitators were able to maintain their Chinese rights on the Freudenberg brand.
“It’s our fault, because family names cannot be protected in Germany,” says Hanno Wentzler, chairman of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich.
The brand office therefore rejected the Munich’s objection.
Freudenberg has gained cause in the following two instances, but the opposite party continues to fight until today.
The vigilance is put on
The case is currently in court at the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident, he believes in a positive outcome from the trial and praises the professionalism of judges.
However, he adds: "The procedure is long, challenging and it costs us a lot of time and money."
It is also difficult to assess the internal costs. The archive service has even had to review the acts of the last hundred years to provide evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg even proposed in vain to the opponent a “growth six-digit euros” to resolve the dispute.
“It’s what we see what it represents for us,” Wentzler says.
The dangers of the Far East even threaten to rise to Europe.
This would be the case if the imitators of this region would ensure the exploitation of unprotected brands.
For example, a Chinese manufacturer wanted to deposit in Germany the name of Freudenberg for a shoe and leather manufacturing company.
The company had long abandoned this sector, but it was still able to prevent the deposit.
Wentzler adds: “The vigilance is put on.”
Pattloch and he advise German companies to be very cautious in their trade relations with China.
It is not enough, according to them, to rely on international trademark law, foreigners should rather "register also in China everything that is likely to be protected," as Wentzler says.
Otherwise, the costs may be much greater than those of registration.
In fact, if Freudenberg lost the battle in the last act of his legal drama, the company should pay license rights to the opponent for the use of his own name, as Wentzler explains.
Or then we would lose our place on the market segment in question.
World AIDS Day: Fighting, Singing, Helping
The Imbongi choral repeats in Heidelberg, and Swaziland’s AIDS orphans are delighted with their arrival.
This is the story of a link that passes much more than a distance of 8,733 kilometers.
First, we tape the foot: cowboy boots, baskets, scarpins for ladies and mocassins for men seek the rhythm by hitting the floor of the foot.
One, two, three and four.
Then the voices of the singers are slowly enlarged - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - they take, swallow and follow each other.
Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old orchestra boss, almost loses his tile shoes when he directs the orchestra with his gestures of wild flexibility.
We are Monday evening, the Imbongi choral repeats a new song in the music hall of the Heidelberg Institute of Medical Psychology.
Fifty singers and singers aged 23 to 69 have come, from geneticist in human medicine to man to home.
"Om'Obani" is not a easy piece, each chorist has different words, all in a very exotic language: the zoulou, a language spoken by 11 million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and some regions of Swaziland.
To be helped to help
The UN AIDS Programme estimates that 34 million people worldwide are affected by this disease.
23.5 million of them live in South Africa.
In Swaziland there are 245,000 people infected.
More than 40% of the population is HIV-positive.
180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni found sponsors in Germany thanks to the association "Voices for Africa".
70 of them attend a secondary education institution.
For 15 or 20 euros at least, you can become a sponsor.
This amount guarantees the child money for school, a school uniform and a daily hot meal at the gogo center.
Imbongi means in zoulou "contor of stories" or even "singer of praise".
No one can speak the bandou language in this region, but everyone can sing it.
For 10 years, the choral has repeated songs in this foreign language that it has brought to Germany and now returns it to its native region: South Africa.
For 8,733 kilometers from Heidelberg, northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, is Esitjeni, the village that depends on the vocal power of the German choral.
40% of people affected
The village has approximately 2,000 inhabitants, some live in modest huts of palm or land and most of them are children.
More than 300 of them are orphans, because HIV took their parents.
In Esitjeni, we can observe on a smaller scale the diseases that catch Swaziland: the highest rate of HIV infection and the lowest life expectancy in the world according to UNICEF.
The population practically never accepts male circumcision, a measure that however guarantees a proven reduction of the risk of infection by half.
More than 40% of the population of Swaziland is carrier of the immunodeficiency virus and it is not rare to die in the middle of thirty.
During a group trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choral had been able to discover the village. The Imbongis mostly saw many children on the street to whom it lacked not only parental care, but also simply everything: food, clothing, education.
In a poor country, without a school degree, there is absolutely no perspective.
At first, it was only a few people who personally committed to paying a few euros each year so that they could send a child to school and offer him a hot meal per day.
But just a year later, the choral founded “Voices for Africa”, an association that since then almost professionally deals with Esitjeni’s AIDS orphans.
Facts About Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the most common sexually transmitted diseases?
Among the bacterial ISTs are syphilis, chlamydia and blennorragia (or gonorrhea).
Common ISTs are HIV, human papilloma virus, genital herpes or hepatitis.
The puppies of the pubis and the gall belong to the parasitic ISTs.
Which groups are mainly concerned?
Syphilis and blennorragia often occur in men who have sex with other men.
The Robert-Koch Institute estimates that male sexual intercourse causes at least four out of five cases of syphilis in Germany.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia-related infections, trichomonase, candidosis (phongic), blennorragy and human papilloma virus are common sexually transmitted diseases.
The rate of HIV spread among heterosexual adults is relatively low in Germany. However, about 20% of new HIV infections are observed within this group.
In young people, the rate of chlamydia-related infections is significantly higher than in other population groups.
According to European reports, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15 to 25.
In Germany, human papillomavirus is common among young people.
What is the number of infections?
It is not mandatory to report all sexually transmitted diseases.
According to the Robert-Koch Institute, the number of cases of syphilis has more than doubled in 10 years: the figure increased from 1,967 in 2001 to 3,698 in 2011.
Since 2007, the number of new HIV infections has decreased.
In 2011, there were approximately 2,700 cases.
This is a decrease of a tenth compared to the previous year.
What are the symptoms of a sexual illness?
Infectious diseases can cause abscesses in the genital organs, urinary pain, white loss, pain in the lower end, as well as the appearance of buttons and verrues.
However, they do not regularly cause any pain or other symptoms and therefore remain hidden.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of infection, but they do not protect to 100%.
The reason is that the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted by lubricating infection or through close body contacts.
Experts therefore recommend that anyone who often changes sexual partners regularly pass tests.
Most rapidly detected ISTs can be healed and late sequels can be avoided.
Through the sponsorship, the donations, but above all the funds that the chorists collect through their voices across all Germany, the funds accumulate.
“In all, we’ve already sent about 200,000 euros to Esitjeni,” said Annette Lennartz, chairman of the association.
In the village, Zodwa Dlamini, a self-sufficient woman who still gets what she wants, manages the money from Germany.
She also ensures that the orphans are well housed, for example, at one of their grandmothers.
The gogos, so it is called the old women in zoulou, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them host up to 14 orphans, they offer them a roof and make sure they go to school every day at a time in their uniforms.
The orphan who no longer has anyone is welcomed in a safe place, at Khanyisile, a woman who lives alone and is paid by the association, as well as the two cookers who prepare meals every day for more than 200 hungry children.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" created a coating school and allowed the construction of two chickens. With the contribution of the American Health Organization PSI, the association organized a HIV screening test for many inhabitants.
This is not obvious, because even though the disease is well visible throughout the country, it remains a taboo subject.
A King and His 14 Wives
“AIDS is a true taboo,” Annette Lennartz explains, “because it’s a subject that touches sexuality.”
This is quite curious, coming from a country whose king has 14 official wives.
The last absolute monarch of Black Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
These patterns sanctioned by the state, among other things, are responsible for the rapid spread of HIV observed in recent decades.
Migrant workers have also spread the virus throughout the country.
However, preservatives are found at every corner of the street, adds Annette Lennartz, “but almost no one uses them.
The culture is different, flesh against flesh.”
In order to promote some cultural exchange, the Imbongi chorists go together on a trip every two or three years to South Africa and sing songs full of nostalgia, courage, confidence and black identity that many inhabitants of the top of the black continent still know of the time of apartheid.
The bus filled with white people singing in African language is a sign of recognition such that it generates not only good mood and joy, but sometimes also removes tears to some scary border guards.
The bus always takes them to Esitjeni, where the chorists visit their boys.
Although it’s hard to find the small village on a map, Esitjeni is well known in the Ezulweni Valley.
“Go to Esitjeni, you’ll find the light there,” the people there say.
And after a journey of 8,733 kilometers by bird flight, returning to Heidelberg, in front of these chorists who stick with the foot in the repetition room of the Bergheimer Straße, the light is also found.
NASA Discovers the Presence of Ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe evidence of the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice layer could reach 20 meters thick.
The U.S. space agency NASA has confirmed the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although this planet is the closest to the Sun, it contains frozen water, as explains three studies published on Thursday in the specialized magazine "Science".
The Messenger probe evidence of the existence of a ice cover in the region of the planet constantly immersed in the shadow.
This cover would have a thickness of at least 30 centimeters that can reach up to 20 meters.
The water is probably coming from comets or asteroids that would have hit Mercury.
However, no one makes a link between the discovery of water and the hypothesis of a presence of life on the planet, explains the chief scientist of the Messenger probe, Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach 426 degrees Celsius.
The discovery could help to understand how water and other vital elements have arrived in other regions of the solar system.
Unnoticed by the inhabitants of our planet, sondes, telescopes and small robots like Phoenix explore the depths of the universe.
From time to time, they send images to the earth, such as small interstitions through which infinity is observed.
The image comes from a photographic device developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck Institute.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the planet naine Ceres.
As Pluto, which orbits around the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not considered a “planet”, according to the new definition of the term of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This detail of an infrared photograph taken by the Spitzer telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: the oldest stars are blue and the pink points, more difficult to identify, are the "newborn" in the birth room of the universe.
The Spitzer telescope has discovered this region where the stars are born, called "W5", a very unromantic name, in the constellation of Cassiopeia, 6,500 light years away.
NASA’s Spitzer telescope photographed the bright brightness of a star dying.
The beignet-shaped circle is made up of elements that the star project when it dies.
In the enormous Nebula Trifide, 5,400 light years away from Earth, gas and dust form new stars.
The Spitzer telescope photographed this galactic birth room.
Pléiades, also known as the seven sisters, can be observed with the naked eye during the night.
However, the telescope increases the value of the colors.
On this infrared picture, the Nebula of Hélice, like a red eye, looks directly to the spectator.
It is 700 light years away in the constellation.
His resemblances with a continent of Earth have valued him the title of North America.
The combination of normal photo and infrared photo allows you to observe a spectacular shade.
Only the Spitzer telescope’s infrared detectors were able to capture an image of the new star in all its beauty.
One of the greatest mysteries in astronomy is the creation of Saturn's rings.
One theory is that the rings are the remains of a Saturn moon that disappeared 4.5 billion years ago without leaving traces.
One of the biggest and clearest photographs taken by the Hubble telescope is that of the Tourbillon galaxy.
According to the shade, the photographs of the spiral galaxies can become real works of art.
The photograph published by the European Southern Observatory shows the Trifide Nebula in the Sagittarius constellation, several thousand light years away.
The name Trifide comes from the Latin word "trifidus" (divided, divided into three), because three dust trains divide the bright heart from the place of birth of the stars.
Astronomers photographed the preliminaries of a cosmic carambolage in the Serpentary constellation: 400 million light years from Earth, the nuclei of two fusion galaxies rush to each other, collision is inevitable.
The Hubble telescope observed the birth of these stars in the M83 spiral galaxy.
If you don’t like the technical abbreviations, you can use its surname “South Fire Wheel”.
The photo of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a detail of the Iris Nebula in the Cephée constellation.
The nebula is 1,400 light years away and is composed of dust grains that are ten to hundred times smaller than the usual domestic dust.
This photo was made from the optical and radiographic clichés taken by different telescopes.
The circle of the black holes is located 430 million light years away from Earth.
The space telescope photographed for NASA this group of galaxies called Arp 273.
Scientists have named the largest spiral galaxy "GC 1810".
In this Nebula is the youngest star group of our Milky Way.
The heavenly castle always gives birth to new stars.
These star clouds, which are connected by the Rosette Nebula, also constantly create young stars at 5,000 light years from Earth.
In this galaxy with bright rays and scattered by a small black hole, there is still no dust, there is only gas.
Scientists think it was born shortly after the bigbang, when the universe was composed largely of hydrogen.
Our view of the universe: the main telescopes
The telescope was invented in 1608 by Hans Lipperhey, before Galileo used it a year later to observe the stars.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have not ceased to grow and thanks to them, it has been possible to see more and more in the universe.
For 30 years, between 1947 and 1975, the Hale Telescope of the Palomar Mount Observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror on this image had a diameter of five meters.
In Arizona, the United States, there is the Large Binocular Telescope.
It allows you to observe the universe through two mirrors each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The stomach of the Gran Telescopio Canarias in La Palma, the Canary Islands, is immense. the mirror alone reaches a diameter of 10.4 meters.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa has been segmented to make savings.
The diameter is approximately 11 meters.
The disadvantage of the economic construction method is that the telescope is fixed at the vertical angle level, which limits its mobility.
The Hobby-Eberly telescope in Texas is also fixed on the vertical angle level.
Its particularity depends on its great ability to collect light.
Despite a relatively small mirror diameter, this capacity is closer to those of the world’s largest mirror telescopes.
Scientists listen to the universe in search of extraterrestrial signals using the Arecibo (Puerto Rico) radio telescope.
This radiotelescope has a diameter of 305 meters.
Anyone who owns a computer can help with the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI, or "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence") by contributing to the computing power of his machine.
The European Southern Observatory (ESO) is located in the Chilean Andes.
Here is the Very Large Telescope ("Very Large Telescope"), an installation worthy of its name.
With a total of four mirrors, this telescope can illuminate the medium infrared spectrum.
The construction of a very large European telescope (European Extremely Large Telescope) is also planned for the ESO site in Chile.
Its main mirror is expected to reach the impressive size of 42 meters. It will consist of 1,000 mirror elements.
However, the telescope will not be able to take clichés before 2018 as early as possible.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano of Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They had two mirrors of a diameter of 10 meters each.
Keck's telescopes are part of the Mauna Kea Observatory that observes the sky with the Subaru telescope and the IRTF.
A giant new telescope is also expected to be built on the Mauna Kea and the diameter of its mirror will reach 30 meters.
This illustration allows you to admire it.
However, the most important images of space come from the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, he has given us images of the distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for exoplanets, mostly those that are habitable.
NASA announced on February 2, 2011 that it had found 1,235 candidates planets since the start of the mission.
This photo illustrates the latest preparations before the launch of the Kepler Space Telescope.
The James-Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be sent into space at the earliest time in 2018 on board an Ariane 5 missile.
The first mirror of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 meters.
The telescope will have the mission to find the light projected by the first stars and galaxies after the bigbang.
Scientists believe that the Southern Pol of Mercury also houses ice.
However, no reliable data on this theory exists, as Messenger orbits much closer to the North Pole of Mercury.
Radar data have indicated the presence of ice on Mercury for decades.
Thanks to the launch of the Messenger probe in 2004, the first to orbit around Mercury, scientists are now sure of it.
Drink butter every day and live up to 168 years.
In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the ages worthy of the Bible patriarchs.

In southern Azerbaijan, many people reach the ages worthy of the Bible patriarchs.
There is a museum of longevity.
A survey on a country, in which we are still relatively young at 97 years of age.
The trip to the Talysh mountains is a romantic.
Around the many rounds of the road, the small bus cows along wooden hills, torrent rivers and modest farms.
Everything is green and fertile, we would almost think in the Black Forest.
But we are here in the deep south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is just a few kilometers away.
This is where the Caucasian ethnic group named Talysh lives, about which we don’t know much, except that they speak perfectly Persian and Azerbaijan and that they have a very longevity.
It is Lerik.
The small town plastrone with its too aggressive Soviet-era architecture that does not match at all with the picturesque mountain landscape.
European tourists are rare here, the journey from the capital of Azerbaijan, Baku, is very difficult.
It takes eight hours to travel the 323 kilometers, as the road has only one path.
The province has not yet taken advantage of the legendary wealth that the country owes to its oil reserves in the Caspian Sea.
However, Pilata Fatulayeva, 48 years old, is convinced that Lerik has the potential to become a tourist destination.
“Bakou became famous in May thanks to the Eurovision competition, and next year there will be the world’s oldest people’s festival,” Fatulayeva explains.
She is the director of the longevity museum, the only museum of this kind in the world.
There you can discover the life of about eight dozen Talysh in the region who are over 100 years old. Fatulayeva shows us a photo in black and white.
Here is my grandfather, he has reached the age of 120 years.
A child is 136 years old.
But the controversial star of the museum is Şirali Muslimov, a shepherd who would have been 168 years old.
There is no birth certificate.
And when it is thought that the oldest person documented was 122 years old, the age of Muslimov seems more than doubtful.
“He was born in 1805 in this region, he died in 1973,” Fatulayeva said.
The man would have married three times and had 23 children. at the age of 136, he would have still conceived a daughter.
Should Shirali Muslimov be mistaken for a few decades by calculating his age?
Rembrandt Scholz, a gerontologist at the Max-Planck Institute in Rostock, also heard him talk about the man in the great epoch of Central Asia.
“Surprisingly elderly people also live in some regions of China, Japan or in the Hunza Valley in Pakistan,” Scholz explains, “in Sardinia too, there are men who live incredibly old.”
However, it is impossible to establish a scientific proof due to the absence of the documents, without considering that there was no civil status register.
Every day a glass of butter
However, it is a fact that people in the Lerik region often reach an age worthy of the Bible patriarchs.
Today, 20 people are over 100 years old.
So what is the reason for longevity in the south of this country?
Farid Mugimzadeh, the Azeri tourist guide, explains that the Talysh have specific genes.
Fatulayeva, the director of the museum, believes that it is a matter of food.
However, it does not seem plausible, from a nutritional point of view, that calorie-rich meals of the Talysh, who love meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of floured butter daily, are good for health.
Or is it the simple way of life that preserves the youth of people? In Cengemiran, a small village near the city of Lerik, Rubaba Mirzayeva lives.
At the age of 97, she is still relatively young for the region.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a modest wooden house, as it is typical to see throughout the Caucasus region.
She is sitting on the ground next to a bar, whose contents she beat inadvertently.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of the sons of Mirzayeva and a daughter, who have long been adults.
Two kids are also playing in the house.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests served in typical armadus glasses in the shape of the stomach.
Mirzayeva’s white teeth are perfectly aligned, and under his foul is hidden of long traces of a dark blonde that his son reveals to us with pride.
I’ve always washed my hair with milk, and that’s how I’ve never lost them and they’ve kept their color.
“I’ve never used shampoo,” Mirzayeva adds.
Monthly retirement is enough to live.
She has always eaten what comes from her own farm: tomatoes, potatoes and small beans.
I’ve never bought any food in a supermarket.
Then she tells us about her husband who was in the army.
The worst times were after World War II.
But everything improved when the "loved father" Heydar Aliyev took the commands.
The language of propaganda surprises in the mouth of an old lady.
However, the cult of the father’s figure of the nation, a man who has yet managed his country as a dictator, knows almost no boundaries in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, his son Ilham successed him later.
Anyway, the elderly people in Azerbaijan do not know the trouble.
Mirzayeva receives monthly 230 manats (approximately the same amount as in euros) for his retirement, a sum that guarantees a good way of life in the region.
And the long-gray son of Mirzayeva is right: “The elderly enjoy great respect in our culture.”
They are the center of the great family, they are loved, cared and happy.
This is a good reason to live as long as possible.
The “Human Rights” in the Constitution
The revolution is in Cairo.
Rival protests reveal the deep fracture of the country.
The draft constitution based on sharia is violently controversial.
The Egyptian president is not avar of words filled with emotions.
We must succeed in the transition.
“And this success is my responsibility toward the people and toward God,” he told state television.
His speech was addressed to the whole people, but also especially to the Copts Christians, to the liberals, to the illuminated and secular Muslims.
For all members of the confused and desperately disappointed opposition are afraid.
They are afraid of a theocracy on the Nile in the hands of the powerful Muslim Brothers.
Morsi said, almost apologizing, he had temporarily restricted the jurisdiction of the Constitutional Court and extended its "to save the revolution."
However, the Egyptians and the world don’t really know what this 61-year-old engineer, who has a doctorate degree from the American University of Southern California, wants to save.
Will the judiciary be overturned?
The 234 articles written in a hurry by the mostly Islamic constituent assembly of 100 people during a fifteen-hour night tour of force are actually worrying to a certain extent.
As in previous constitutions, the bill provides that jurisprudence is based on “the principles of Islamic law”.
What does the word “principles” really mean?
It was and remains a question of interpretation, and there are good reasons to fear that Islamists will use the vague formulation and the legal maneuver outcome to apply a stricter interpretation of the sharia.
In any case, it is that gives to mind a newly introduced article stipulating that, as regards all subjects affecting the sharia, the Al-Azhar University must be consulted. The institution is the country's most important Islamic institution and its brightness radiates over the entire Sunni Islamic world.
This may, but does not necessarily mean that the clergy will monitor the legislative system, which would de facto lead to the guarantee of the judicial power.
Many points of the draft constitution are subject to interpretation.
Another problematic aspect is the likely maintenance of military jurisdiction.
During the rule of Mubarak, these courts worked to repress the opponents.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held by the military.
The state must also, as can be read in the project, protect “the true nature of the Egyptian family” and “promove its morality and values”.
From a legal point of view, the formulation is so vague that state institutions could even control the contents of the art of cinema and literature.
It would simply be censorship.
Furthermore, no article expressly guarantees equality between men and women.
Instead, another article prohibits offending or diffaming the Prophet Muhammad or his messengers.
However, the article does not define what an offence is or how it should be punished.
Just as doubtful is the phrase leaving to hear that it is prohibited to “offend people.”
Is it enough to draw a caricature of the president or to tell a joke at the expense of a lawman?
Many points are therefore subject to interpretation in the draft that Morsi submits to the vote and which, according to his own words, will be “very soon” the subject of a referendum with the Egyptians.
“The Revolution Is Renewed”
The opposition has been mobilizing for weeks against the digital superiority of Islamists.
On Friday evening, tens of thousands of protesters gathered in an unusual concord on the Tahrir Square in Cairo, promising to bring sharia down before it comes into force.
“The revolution is coming back and we’re going to win,” said Hamdin Sabbahi, who was third in the presidential election.
Nobel Peace Prize winner and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Mohamed El Baradei said the draft Constitution is "to go into the rubbish of history."
On Twitter, the instant messaging service, he accused Morsi’s supporters of wanting to promote a “putsch against democracy.”
“If he proclaims the referendum, we’ll go to his palace and we’ll break it down,” said Jasser Said, an opponent.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers is not yet expired," Khaled Ali, a political man and opposition member, told Egyptian media.
Moreover, several judges have announced they do not want to monitor the referendum, which would result in its nullity.
“The Qur’an is our Constitution.”
On its side, the well-organized Muslim Brotherhood called for a counter-manifestation not on the Tahrir Square as a precautionary measure, but on the other shore of the Nile, where a great prayer was organized in front of the University of Cairo.
The sealed women and the supporters of the salafists, who participated in large numbers, scanded: “the people demand the application of the law of God.”
They asked Morsi, saying, “The Qur’an was their Constitution.”
A struggle for sovereignty on the symbolic Tharir Square, where everything began, would soon have generated a situation similar to that of a civil war.
Of course, that’s what Morsi’s supporters wanted to avoid.
The Muslim Brotherhood said that the opponents to the draft constitution, as well as its supporters, expressed themselves loud and strongly.
According to them, it is now time to let the people decide by the urns of the direction that the country should take.
The Islamist project will win the majority.
“Human rights are not mentioned once”
Hafez Abu Saeda is angry with this imposed constitutional process that had to extend until February and cover all social forces.
This 48-year-old human rights lawyer and president of the Egyptian Human Rights Organization (EOHR) had defended Muslim Brothers when they were in prison or before the courts under Mubarak.
He did it not because he shared their conception of the world, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
That’s why he was shot, judged and imprisoned.
"And now, the term is not even spoken once in the new Constitution," he regrets during his interview with the Welt am Sonntag.
The extension of Morsi’s powers to the three powers disagreeed the lawyer.
These measures are striking violations of the rules of democracy and they will create a new dictatorship in Egypt.
“Instead of strengthening civil society, the president de facto takes away all his powers,” Saeda regrets.
Democracy cannot work without civil society.
Saeda feels abandoned, including by the international community, who looks at the battle between the different political ideologies on the edge of the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and nervousness.
That could be paid.
A protestant on the Tharir Square warns: "You are giving birth to a monster that you will no longer be able to control."
The Rakfisk of Norway: is it the most odorious fish in the world?
The five million people in Norway enjoy one of the highest levels of living, not only in Europe, but also in the world.
Could the secret of the country’s success be linked to local people’s appetite for an extremely odorous fish?
Take advanced cheese.
Place them in the middle of a pile of wet and dirty football clothes.
Wait for a week.
And you get the disturbing smell of rakfisk, one of the most popular dishes in Norway.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about 3 hours from Oslo.
It is snow, the landscape is spectacular - and this odor, all-present, penetrates the air.
The rakfisk consists of salt-pulled and fermented trout in water for a period of time – depending on the smell you want it to exhale – which can last up to a year.
When the darkness is installed and it is cold, the Norwegians gather in mass to attend a festival that takes place here, in Fagernes, dedicated to this incredible culinary speciality.
“You eat raw, then you swallow a glass of aquavit,” says Havard Halvarsen, a full-time local firefighter, also known as “Rakfisk General”, responsible for the festival’s management.
Around us, people swallow small pieces of fish and swallow a large amount of drink.
“Some people prefer aquavit to rakfisk,” Havard adds.
Drink kills the smell.
I try a few pieces.
If you can avoid making it pass under your nose, it’s not bad – it reminds you of a sushi that would have spent long hours in a bus.
Rakfisk dates back to a time when Norway was poor, before the invention of the refrigeration, the fish was immersed in air-to-air water barriers, then salted in autumn.
Then, during the winter, once well fermented, the fish comes out and - without a doubt with the senses diminished by alcohol - eaten.
In the previous generation, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country to find work, mostly emigrating to the United States.
Now the population is growing rapidly – more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by full-time, high wages and a complete healthcare system.
The Swedish, their old rivals whose country was not so long ago rich than Norway, cross the border to come to work.
Rakfisk is regarded as something important, a vital, although aromatic, element of the past of Norway.
It comes from the most expensive dishes.
But everything is expensive - a small piece of beer or a sandwich will cost you 10 € each.
Norway does not often talk about it in international news, which is not to dislike it.
Here, people are not willing to talk about Anders Breivik, the right-wing racist who killed 77 people, including women and children.
When they talk about this murder, they talk about “the July 22 incident.”
The Norwegians are hard to accept that in their peaceful country, one of them could have committed such a act of barbarism.
Since the early 1970s, Norway owes its wealth to its oil and gas industry, one of the largest in the world.
"But oil is not the only reason to justify our success," says Anna, our servant, with blonde hair and eyes of a transperating blue, the image of Nordic well-being, with a rakfisk plate in hand.
We are – as you say – prudent people.
His English, like that of most people living here, is perfect.
We are discreet, we don’t like to be noticed.
Norway has managed its oil wealth with great caution – everything, except a small percentage of money from this industry, is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
When other countries were throwing money through the windows, during the years that led us to the international financial crisis, Norway was able to keep the bonds of its stock exchange tight.
“As long as we can ski in winter and walk in summer, we’re happy,” says Anna.
“Without forgetting the rakfisk,” she adds in an insightful laughter.
I’m standing under the snow and I’m making the tail to buy something to eat – I’ve got my rakfisk dose.
In the menu, a hamburger composed of impulse, a real discovery, it’s great.
The smell of the fish is everywhere.
The hotel in which I stay is one of the many places where you serve rakfisk for dinner and where you can vote for the best of them - or for the most odorful of them.
There is a TV show where the presentator wears a papillon nod, surrounded by rakfisk plates.
I think it was the Eurovision competition.
“What score did you give to the best fish, in the mountains of Thor-Juergen?”
“This is our point, Havard.”
We hear laughter and applause.
A man falls from his chair, because of the abuse of aquavit.
Or maybe it’s because of the fish.
Mexico’s Enrique Pena Nieto is on a difficult start.
While entering President Enrique Pena Nieto is preparing to take office in Mexico, Will Grant, from the BBC, is interested in the difficulties that await him and the expectations of the people, which are numerous.
The road traffic in Mexico is bad at the moment.
In a city where bullets are legion at normal time, a security barrier has been set up since Monday, blocking several key road accesses in the capital and causing real chaos on the roads.
However, the goal was not to prevent people from going to work, but to prevent protesters from reaching Parliament.
Next Saturday, Mexico’s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential charp to become the new president at the head of the nation.
A complicated task awaits him.
Mexico’s economy is going well, the results are due to the outgoing president Felipe Calderon, but the country is stuck in a drug war that has already cost the lives of about 60,000 people in six years.
"My government has made a commitment to the Mexican people to reduce violence," Pena Nieto told U.S. President Barack Obama at the Ovale Bureau a little earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to this goal.
Before meeting with the U.S. President, Mr. Pena Nieto was the Governor of the State of Mexico.
A very populated and tentaculary state that shakes the capital. On its land of preference, the opinions about this new leader are divided.
A direct man
In the Bucolic municipality of Valle del Bravo, for example, it is recorded in the memory of all.
The locals attribute it to the development of tourism and infrastructure in the municipality.
To get to the city, you can take one of the new highways of M. Pena Nieto, a significant improvement has been made to these roads, once shrinked and full of scratches.
Plaques with its name are hanging outside a new sports complex and an impressive interactive museum dedicated to climate change.
“We count on him to make sustainable changes,” said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, a member of the congress and party of Mr. Pena Nieto, the PRI.
In terms of security and economy in particular, we hope for a real change that our country so needs.
After 81 years without failure in power, the PRI was evacuated in 2000 by Vicente Fox.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years spent outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, there are many expectations within the party regarding Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the criticism of the opponents who accuse the new president of lack of charism.
He is a whole man, very engaged, with a great vision of the country.
He is a great man and above all he knows how to listen.
However, this is not always the image that people have of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast with the paved streets of Valle del Bravo could not be more obvious.
Hidden under the highways, it constitutes, in many ways, a suburbs of Mexico City.
And the problems in the municipality are also concrete and urban.
Earlier this year, soldiers were called for rescue to fight the narcotic gangs in the neighborhoods, and the violence against women is severe there.
In a wounded area, the bodies of dozens of women murdered in the last two years have been found, on the edge of discharge.
More than 1,000 women were killed in the state of Mexico while Mr. Pena Nieto was governor, a much higher rate than in the very violent city of Ciudad Juarez - a sadly famous place for the number of innocent women who were killed there.
Mr. Pena Nieto’s critics say that in the best, he failed to end the problem of murders committed against women when he was in office.
In the worst, they accuse his administration of refusing to see reality in front.
In a concrete house, typical of this devastated neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles to retain her tears when she shows me photos of her dead daughter, Mariana Luna.
The official version reports a suicide committed by Mariana in 2010.
However, her family believes she was killed by her partner.
“When I arrived at her house, it seemed to me that her body had been washed,” says the lady Buendia.
Signs indicated that it had been beat, and the body rigidity was already started.
While her mother tells the story, a photo of Mariana clothes the wall, next to a cross where the word appears: Justice.
However, this is exactly what the family has been denied.
The authorities treated me as if I was an old comer, a fool of trouble, a crying.
They want us to accept what they say and be silent.
"But it is not normal that there are so many irregularities and omissions," she said.
When President Pena Nieto receives his shark on Saturday, she will be accompanied by a heavy responsibility.
Tens of thousands of families have been affected by crime in Mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised that he will prioritize it during his term.
“I hope he will be as good as president as when he was a governor,” said Olvera, a member of the Congress in Valle del Bravo.
However, this is exactly what the families of the victims of Ciudad Neza are most afraid of.
Bradley Manning has not complained of bad treatment, the prosecutors say.
Prosecutors are trying to counter the claims of abuse that Bradley Manning had been a victim during the detention.
Manning was arrested in a military prison in Quantico, Virginia.
The defence wants to classify the case on the grounds that Manning's kidnapping was done under extremely difficult conditions.
The soldier is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents.
Prosecutors tried to demonstrate on Friday that soldier Bradley Manning — accused of being the source of the largest flight of confidential information in the history of the U.S. army — missed many occasions to complain of the misbehavior he allegedly suffered during his military detention.
During a counter-interrogation with Manning, during a preliminary hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Prosecutor Maj. Ashden Fein claimed that records of weekly visits rendered to Manning by officers during his nine months of detention in Quantico, Virginia, did not reveal any complaints regarding his treatment.
The counter-interrogation -- during a hearing, the defence submitted a request requiring that the Manning case be classified on the grounds that the kidnapping was done in very difficult conditions and constituted a sufficiently severe punishment -- took place a day after Manning testified his desire to commit suicide during his detention.
The military intelligence analyst, arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents during his service in Iraq.
The documents were then published online by WikiLeaks.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed that Manning was their source.
At the Friday hearing, Fein examined with Manning the forms that officers had filled after their meeting with Manning, during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he was subjected to a maximum prison isolation from July 2010 to April 2011.
Officers asked questions to Manning and recorded his answers.
When Fein mentioned the forms on Friday, Manning acknowledged that the treatment that his guards reserved for him was "excellent" and that the treatment he had in prison was generally "very professional."
The forms do not report any complaints for ill-treatment, although officers have directly questioned him about his prison treatment, Fein said.
Manning replied that he had verbally expressed concerns regarding certain issues and that the visiting officers had discussed his concerns and said they would take care of it, but they did not record the issues mentioned.
"They wrote 'no problem' (after dealing with the concerns), and yet that didn't mean I didn't raise any problems," Manning said.
The military judge Col. Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain of his treatment during an interview in January 2011 with the special commission that had gathered to discuss the suicidal thoughts he had expressed in writing a few months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to change his restrictive status indicating a "risk of injury."
The military said they had assigned him this restrictive status — a level below close surveillance for suicide risk — for his protection and the safety of others.
“I wanted the staff to know that I’m going well, and I wanted to be withdrawn from this status... to benefit from a better quality of life from my point of view,” Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest in Iraq and his transfer to Kuwait, where he was detained for two months before being transferred to the military prison of the Marine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia, in July 2010.
He said he planned to commit suicide when he was in Kuwait and once disappeared due to the heat.
He added that the fact that he was not kept aware of what was going to happen to him or what was going to happen in the rest of the world was very angry.
“My world was reduced to Camp Arafjon, to this cage,” Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
Once at Quantico, Manning said he had spent the clearest of his time in a small cell -- at least 21 hours and sometimes more than 23 hours -- without company.
Manning also added that the only objects he had were a mattress, a cover, tongs, clothes and his glasses.
He tried to stay in motion, because sleeping or lying during the day was contrary to the rule.
Manning also specified that when he tried to sleep, he had a light in his eyes, lighted outside his cell.
If the guards did not see his face when he turned in the night, they woke him up so that he could see his face.
Manning’s lawyer filed a formal complaint for Manning’s treatment in January 2011.
Manning was placed in a military prison in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, in April 2011.
Also on Friday, the judge asked Manning about an allegation in his Thursday testimony—that after being forced to sleep naked all a night in his cell in Quantico, he was forced to stand naked before the guards and other prisoners one morning, during the appeal.
Manning testified that at no time he was allowed to cover himself with a cover during the appeal.
During the question of the judge on Friday, Manning said he had deducted from the order of his guard that he had to release his cover that could have hidden his nakedness, but he acknowledged that no one had ordered him to release her.
Manning testified on Thursday that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night because he had tried to prove to a officer that he was not a danger for himself.
Manning had told the officer that he could have used the elastic of his slip or tongs to hurt himself, but he did not.
That night, Manning testified that his underwear, his tongs, and his glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that at least the judge will take into account the experiences he experienced during his detention and that he will considerably reduce his sentence if he should be found guilty before a martial court, a trial that is expected to take place early next year.
Defence said Manning intends to claim guilty of the less serious crimes and to fight for the abandonment of other charges considered too extreme.
The hearing is expected to start again this weekend, with prosecutors who should argue that the conditions of detention were justified.
The Pentagon has confirmed that Manning was imprisoned in accordance with the regulations governing the conditions of detention of all prisoners in Quantico.
The charges against Manning include the theft of goods or public documents, the collusion with the enemy, giving rise to the illegal publication of information on the Internet, and the transmission of information related to national defence.
If all accusation heads are arrested, he is sentenced to perpetual prison.
The Mexican-American identity crisis
He says many have been forced to leave Mexico because of the lack of opportunities.
The Mexicans tend to blame those who have left; they remind the Mexicans of the difficult times, he said.
Navarrete says the Mexican-Americans are caught between two worlds.
During a recent trip to Mexico, arriving in the hall, in front of the customs and immigration services, I felt lost.
Panels indicated two roads: one for the “Mexicans” (“Mexicans”), the other for the “Extranjeros” (“Strangers”).
I stayed immobile for a few seconds, not knowing to which direction to go.
I grew up in the center of California, where I was called the "Mexican" all my life.
It’s an ethnic qualification, just as my Boston friends use when they say “Iranian” or my New York friends when they say “Italian.”
Then I became a Mexican-American.
But here it was Mexico.
And on the earth that saw my grandfather be born, there is no need for special qualifications or unity traits.
I was just an American.
I speak Spanish, well enough to manage an interview in one or the other language.
But I don’t have an indigenous vocabulary, and I can’t lose my American accent.
Then I took my American passport and went to the “Strangers” line.
I thought about that time of the week when the new Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto visited President Obama at the White House.
Generally, when the leaders of these two countries meet, their favorite topics are immigration, drugs and trade.
Pena Nieto also wanted to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons that push Mexicans to stay in Mexico rather than risk themselves in the United States.
He wants to join the United States and Canada, and create a trade union on the model of the European Union, but in North America.
And Pena Nieto is committed to continuing the war against drug cartels in Mexico, although he has not provided more details.
For Mexico, the relationship with the United States is complicated and filled with bitterness.
Most Americans probably never thought about the fact that in 1848, the United States invaded Mexico and forced its leaders to give in writing half of their territory to the top of the gun.
But for the Mexicans, who think in terms of centuries, and not minutes, memories are everywhere.
Therefore, as soon as a U.S. official formulates any criticism of Mexico, you begin to hear — in the Mexican press, and among the elites — complaints about how Americans violate the sovereignty of their neighbor.
And the children of Montezuma are looking for the fight.
And yet, for Mexico, the hardest relationship is that the country has with the more than 35 million Mexican-Americans living in the United States.
Do you want us to address the subject of bitterness?
There are many.
Mexico has its winners and losers, people for whom the country offers opportunities and others for whom the country does not offer.
The only reason that explains the great number of Mexican ancestors in cities such as Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver or San Antonio, is that at some point, in our genealogical tree, a person, a parent or a grandfather, did not find any opportunity in Mexico and had to go to the North.
And most often, that person corresponded to a typical profile -- a dark skin, poorly trained, from a poor village, etc.
We are their descendants, and we are loyal to them.
Not to Mexico.
And even if we currently live the American dream, that we have gone to good schools and that we have good situations, we should never lose sight that it is the American dream that we live, and not that of the Mexicans.
Our identity is sometimes troubled, but our loyalty is obvious.
We give it to the United States.
In addition, we know that a part of the Mexican elite among the ruling class doesn’t like us.
The feeling is mutual.
We remind them of a humiliating defeat and they toss us as if we were people of lower race and not enough Mexican.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties with Mexico will never be strong enough.
For them, our existence is synonymous with failure.
If our families hadn’t failed when they lived in Mexico, they would never have left.
And we would not find ourselves stuck on the right side of the barrier, living comfortably in the United States, but as lost souls.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and who legally emigrated to the United States when she was a child, reminds me that there are frictions between the Mexicans and the Mexican-Americans, because the Mexicans claim more firmly their identity and the Mexican-Americans are angry.
Although she is an American citizen, she has the feeling of being part of two countries.
Moreover, many Mexican-Americans I know don’t feel like they’re part of one country or another.
We love the music of the Mexican band, Los Tigres del Norte, but also the music of Bruce Springsteen.
We have the best of both worlds, but we are not rooted in any of the two.
In Mexico, we are seen as Americans.
In the United States, we are considered Mexicans.
And now, to make the relationship a little more complicated, as I learned during my stay, some Mexican leaders and some of the intelligentsia want to get closer to the Diaspora.
They want the Mexican-Americans to work as wealth ambassadors for Mexico, representing its interests in the United States.
We will have to explain to our American compatriots that Mexico is a great country that absolutely needs to be visited and put pressure on political leaders to strengthen their ties with Mexico.
Yes of course.
This will not happen.
There is too much bitterness.
And, if we consider the wage inequalities, corruption and drug-related violence that are all-present, many of us are not convinced that this is a fantastic country.
You will have to do it alone, friends.
It is normal.
If some Mexicans are not yet ready to forgive the United States of the way they treated Mexico a century and a half ago, they must therefore accept that some Mexican-Americans still want them of the way their family members were treated not so long ago.
and Hmmm.
Maybe we’re more “Mexican” than I thought.
New Middle East, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is still a failure for peace.
Will there ever be a sustainable peace between the Arabs and the Jews in the Middle East?
Another bloodshed seems to indicate that such a hope is vain.
While the same foolish arguments persist to know who started, dozens of buildings were cut into dust; more than 140 Palestinians, most of them were civilians, and six Israelis were killed; and, for the first time, missiles shot from Gaza landed near Tel Aviv, the metropolitan of Israel, and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But while Israelis and Palestinians seem to be blocked in their old conflict, all around them, the Middle East is in full change.
The Arab spring has struck everything, and whether we want it or not, the Palestinians and Israelis are caught up by this regional turmoil.
Per their struggle will intensify a little more.
However, there are all the reasons to think that this could help them get out of this deadly impasse.
A war that makes no losers and no winners.
At first glance it seems difficult to be optimistic.
Although the ceasefire granted on November 21 continues, the struggles this week have strengthened the supporters of the force on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has led Gaza since 2007, will argue that they have forced the Israelis to leave, even though Gaza has shut down a rope.
Having killed some of its leaders and deported the 1.7 million inhabitants of Gaza into one of the world’s most miserable and overpopulated corners, Israel has failed to destroy Hamas.
In fact, Hamas gains ground on the West Bank, the other part of Palestine is currently in the hands of their rivals of Fatah, the other more moderate Palestinian faction.
Moreover, Hamas leaders could say that time is their ally.
The influence of the Islamists in the Arab world is increasingly strong, and Hamas has become rich and powerful friends.
Turkey, a growing regional power, once the closest Muslim ally to Israel, has taken a cause for Hamas; just like Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic states in the Gulf.
Members of Hamas jubile and say that the growing Islamist curves around Israel, from Lebanon, north, where the Hezbollah militia exercises its domination, through Syria, where the Islamist-tendent rebels can overthrow Bashar al-Assad, and to Jordan, where the allies of Hamas threaten the king.
And most importantly, on the southern side of Israel, the rise of Muslim Brothers under the presidency of Muhammad Morsi in Egypt, far most populated and most central of the Arab countries, has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until its fall in 2011, had little time to dedicate to Hamas.
On the contrary, the Muslim Brothers are cousins of Hamas, and their leaders are easier to give up to the public.
In future diplomacy, Hamas may emerge as an important actor that can no longer be excluded even by Israel and America.
Meanwhile, the supporters of the Israeli hard line will draw the reverse conclusions.
In military terms, Hamas was put back in a box.
The missile interception system called Iron Dome has proven its effectiveness and many Hamas missiles have been destroyed.
The Israelis will be able to sleep on their two ears - for a while.
In terms of diplomacy, America renews its indefectible support; and many European countries have blamed Hamas for being the source of the last wave of violence.
But above all, Israel has prospered, under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has completely ignored the peace process.
Although Gaza's missile shots have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, Israel has been saved by suicide attacks, including thanks to the separation barrier that impeats the West Bank, the main piece of what could be a Palestinian state, and which protects the Jewish colonies that continue to expand despite their illegality in international law.
Netanyahu, whose Likud party fused with an even more balistic party, the leader Avigdor Lieberman at the approaching of the January 22 election, has the good part.
Why do Palestinians give them a state?
If they were directing the West Bank, would they not launch missiles, as their compatriots did in Gaza?
It is better to keep them behind this wall and hit them as soon as they get out of the head.
Per the supporters of the hard line will win it; but it is possible that the Arab spring changes the scene.
Even though Islamists who take power in Egypt and elsewhere appreciate Israel little, their priority will be to address problems in their own countries.
Israel’s defence budget is greater than that of its four Arab neighbors.
Starting a war with the local superpower will not help the new Arab governments to fix their savings.
Mr. Morsi has worked with Barack Obama to get a ceasefire which is hopeful – and could mark the beginning of something.
The Israelis should also think about the future.
With the rest of the Arab world becoming more democratic, depriving the Palestinians of their right to self-determination could create a powder that is destined to explode one day in the territories occupied by Israel – a bit like the bus that exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
Repression already weakened democracy in the Jewish state, and demography worsened this problem as the Arab population increases.
Bloody missions against Gaza every two or three years to call Hamas will have a diplomatic prize.
Both sides need to be pushed by those from the outside.
The answer remains that supported by the reasonable people that are found on each side, and by the majority of the outside world and by this newspaper: two states, with a cession of territory by Israel in exchange for security.
One hope, short and short-term, is that the ceasefire will give the opportunity to the outside people to defend this cause.
Egypt, which now has to endeavour to end the arms circulation to Gaza, like Turkey and Qatar, is better than ever placed to persuade Hamas to accept the idea of a Jewish state in accordance with the 1967 borders with land exchanges and a shared Jerusalem.
Foreign Arabs should also press Hamas and Fatah to unite.
This would contribute much more to the creation of a Palestinian state than the next proposal for a pseudo state to the UN.
Obama also has any interest in Israel to agree to negotiate.
During his first term, he did not present his own peace plan.
Back to the White House, he seems equally rejective to establish one.
This is a very narrow vision.
The stability of the Middle East is a vital challenge for America.
This is a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Neutral cigarette packaging laws come into force in Australia
Warnings and photos of sick organs cover dark green packages that are all identical, regardless of the brand
This law came into force in Australia is a world first, the logos and colors have been replaced with a dark olive green and horrible photos of sick organs and representations of children and babies whose diseases have been caused by their parents’ smoking.
Apart from the different photos and health warnings, the only difference between the packages, since this Saturday, is the brand name, printed in small characters on all packages.
It is the world’s most strict tobacco packaging regime.
The Australian federal government said the goal was to dissuade young people from smoking by removing any glamour representation.
Studies have shown that if people don’t start smoking before the age of 26, there’s 99% chance they never start.
“Even when they’re very young, children understand the message carried by tobacco manufacturers through their brand image,” said federal health minister Tanya Plibersek, citing studies that have revealed, for example, that children associated the crown of a logo with a princess.
Although Australia has the lowest smoking rate in the world and these changes have little impact on the profits of multinational companies, other countries are considering a similar approach.
The tobacco industry has pushed against this law.
Tobacco manufacturers said that this would reset trade from the black market, which will provide easier access to cheaper cigarettes.
“There will be negative consequences from this legislation,” said Scott McIntyre, British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will sell much more counterfeit cigarettes in Australian streets.
Others said that the law had boosted their activity.
Sandra Ha de Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family company, said that the demand for cigarette slaughter, including silicone to hide the horrible packaging, has grown sharply two months ago since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco contested the law and lost before the Australian High Court.
Ha said Zico sold 6,000 to wholesale and is waiting for stock renewal.
For us, the business is good.
The only fatigue, experts say, is the popularity of social media and the targeted population.
After a series of Australian laws prohibiting TV advertising, sports sponsorship and the obligation for retailers to hide cigarettes, tobacco marketing is now available online.
Australia has banned advertising on the web by local companies and websites, but it cannot prevent foreign websites from doing so.
“If you’re working on tobacco marketing and you’re only having a small window to promote your products, the Internet is the indispensable place for excellence,” said Becky Freeman, a public health researcher at the University of Sydney.
Freeman noted an increase in the contributions of some Lambda citizens to social media brands such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.
We have to ask ourselves if it’s a simple citizen who loves Marlboro cigarettes and who’s worth making a video, or if it’s a marketing campaign orchestrated by an agency?
British American Tobacco Australia said that the industry focuses on the new current regulation rather than on marketing.
The industry has gone to pay to Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic to challenge these new judicial decisions - these countries told WHO that trade is unfairly disadvantaged, although none of these countries had significant trade with Australia.
A WTO decision is expected to be made in 2013.
Plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries on similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to make packaging warning photos mandatory in 2001.
Now these warnings are present in 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
More strict laws are currently being studied in England, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many smokers in Australia remain insensitive to these photos.
The pictures don’t bother me.
I ignore them.
"You take a cigarette and you arrange the package," Victor El Hage said when he bought a package on which a picture of a tumor of the mouth was shown.
To be honest, the only reason that will stop me is my little girl.
James Yu, manager of the "King of the Pack tobacco" in the center of Sydney, said that the uniformity of the packaging made it difficult to store the packages on the stretches.
“In the past, it took me an hour to discharge a package, now it takes me four hours,” Yu said.
“The government only had to ban them once and for all and we would have said OK, it’s okay, we stop and put the key under the door,” he added, lifting the arms to the sky.
In a constantly connected world, it can be good to get bored.
I spent five hours at an airport during Thanksgiving period because our plane had mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane to arrive.
Therefore, I had enough time to think about the topic of fatigue.
I will not lie to you.
Spending half a day at an airport to wait for a flight is quite boring, even when you have books, magazines and iPhones to distract you (without forgetting duty-free stores).
But more and more, some academics and experts specializing in the development of the child make the praise of fatigue.
It’s perfectly normal for us – and our children – to get bored from time to time, they say.
This forces the brain to take interesting paths, or even to feed creativity.
And as we are, mostly, constantly facing several types of screens, we no longer know the benefits of fatigue.
So should we welcome tiredness with open arms?
and yes.
And not.
But I will come back.
First, like many people, I thought that tiredness was a rather recent phenomenon, especially since we have more free time.
But this is not the case, says Peter Toohey, Professor of Greco-Roman History at the University of Calgary, Canada, and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011).
“The fatigue goes back very far,” he says.
On the walls of Pompeii appear Latin graffiti that evoke fatigue, they come back to the first century.
Then there is the definition that we give to fatigue.
The problem is that it was defined, and discussed, in different ways, said John D. Eastwood, aggregate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada.
After travelling through numerous publications and submitting the idea to a discussion group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and colleagues defined fatigue as an experience that consists in “to want to do something, but not to succeed in starting into a satisfying activity.”
What differentiates fatigue from apathy, he says, is that the person is not undertaking a task even though he would like it.
With apathy, he says, there is no desire to do anything.
What is at the heart of fatigue, he said, is "the interruption of the process of attention, associated with a bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Fatigue can very much resemble depression.
But Professor Eastwood said that if both can be connected, people who get bored tend to think that the problem comes from the environment or the world, while depressed people think that the problem comes from them.
Sometimes we think we’re bored while it’s actually a concentration problem.
As part of their study, "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", which was published in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science" in September, Professor Eastwood and colleagues highlighted an older experience in which participants listened on the cassette, the voice of a person reading a magazine article.
Some groups heard, from the room next, the too high sound of a TV show that had no report, others just heard the TV show, and the third group did not hear the band at all.
Those who heard TV at a low sound level said they were more bored than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating, but didn't know why, and attributed this concentration problem to fatigue.
When you’re trying to focus on a difficult or busy task, an interruption of attention can lead to tiredness, said Mark J. Fenske, a joint professor of neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the contrary, when you do a boring task, "like watching objects on a mounting chain, music can help you not get bored."
In fact, he says, now we know that when you’re tortured or chewing, these gestures, often considered signs of boring, are actually a good way to stay physically more alert.
“Studies have shown that children who are allowed to gigate learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to stay unmoving,” Professor Fenske said.
We all get bored one day or another - the delay of my flight, a speaker with a monocord voice, a boring film.
But some people are more likely to get bored than others.
To measure this, researchers developed a “Scal of predisposition to fatigue” in the 1980s.
The scale includes statements such as, "Most of the tasks I do are repetitive and monotonous," and "I have so many centres of interest that I don't have time to do everything."
Using such a scale, researchers found that boys tend to get bored more often than girls, said Stephen Vodanovich, a professor of psychology at the University of West Florida, and especially need numerous and varied stimulations.
But in general, adolescents are rapidly blasphemed.
In 1991, Reed Larson, a professor of individual and community development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment during which he contacted 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day via a beeper.
He noted that 32 percent of teenagers said they were bored at school and during their home tasks, while 23 percent said they were bored when they were not at school.
Three percent of parents say they’re bored.
Professor Larson said he didn’t know if the percentage of fatigue today, or 21 years later, would be higher or lower.
But he added that he knew that “adolescence is a period when fatigue reaches its highest level,” especially because children and adolescents don’t have much control over what they want to do.
If I rest my question: is fatigue good for you?
Sometimes not, because in its extreme form, it can cause people to take absurd physical risks, make bets or abuse of certain substances to spend time, as studies show.
On the other hand, many philosophers and writers mention a link between fatigue and creativity, said Professor Vodanovich, who has studied the problem for more than two decades.
“The fatigue is the way the brain has found to tell you that you should do something else,” said Gary Marcus, a professor of psychology at N.Y.U.
But the brain does not always know what is the most appropriate thing to do.
If you get bored and you use this energy to play guitar and cook, it will make you happy.
But if you watch TV, it will make you happy in the short term, but not in the long term.
So if your child is bored and you give him an iPad, he will not be bored anymore, but he will not have learned to take care of himself or to self-regulate, says Professor Fenske.
And “this self-regulation passes from one situation to another,” he says.
Your child not only learns to have fun, he gets more mastery of himself in other fields.
I don’t think we should glorify the boredom.
I don’t think we should criticize it either.
Feeling comfortable outside the constant boiling that activities and technology generate is the goal to which we should tend.
Professor Eastwood is agreeing on this.
“We need to get bored more often, but boredness awakens an acute and frenetic desire to be connected to something that has meaning,” he said.
According to him, what people are looking for is a way to disconnect and appreciate stop times.
“In an environment where we are constantly hyperstimulated,” he added, “it’s hard to find ways to get into something when noise stops.”
In Colorado, no directive for the new marijuana law
Anthony Orozco, 19 years old, a college student and football player in Colorado, is accused of something that will soon become legal in his state: possession of marijuana balls and a pipe used to smoke them.
Mr. Orozco said that one day, in September, he and a few friends were on board a car in Lamar, in the middle of the fields, near the border with Kansas, when they were arrested.
After the police officer found the marijuana in the car, Mr. Orozco received a quotation to appear for possession of drugs and material that could serve to his consumption - minor crimes, each accompanied by a $100 fine - and a date of appearance.
“We are treated as criminals,” Orozco said.
But is there one?
During the weeks of uncertainty that followed the Colorado vote to legalize the consumption of small amounts of marijuana for its personal use, the response to hundreds of involving low drug use depends more on the place than on the law.
Here and in the state of Washington, which adopted a similar measure, hundreds of crimes involving the use of marijuana were classified without follow.
Police have ceased to accuse adults aged 21 and older for minor possession of marijuana, as the law will enter into force in the coming weeks.
But the prosecutors who are in the more conservative districts of Colorado have called for accelerating existing marijuana cases and continue to blame people who possess it.
At the same time, several cities from the suburbs of Denver to the western mountains are currently voting to prevent the opening of state-approved marijuana stores in their neighborhoods.
“Things are changing so quickly that I don’t know what the future reserves us,” said Daniel J. Oates, the police chief in Aurora, east of Denver.
The Washington State regulatory agencies also raise a lot of questions.
They are looking for guidelines on how to install a license system, allowing to produce, manufacture, distribute and sell - before the deadline of December 1, 2013.
They say that Colorado, whether or not, is ahead of most states in regards to marijuana regulations, first in terms of therapeutic use and now in terms of personal use.
“Colorado has a more regulated market and is a good indicator,” said Brian E. Smith, a spokesman for the Washington State Liquor Control Board.
But no place or system, says Mr. Smith, can do more than suggest what works.
“There is no real precedent on which we could rely,” he said.
The Washington law, which is called I-502, comes into effect on December 6, leaving a legal vacuum of one year, during which the permission system will still not exist, while possession of marijuana will be legal.
Meanwhile, practical questions remain suspended: how to balance the mandate of the state that guarantees appropriate access to authorized marijuana and prohibits the installation of cannabis stores in a radius of 30 km around a school, a park, a playground or a kindergarten.
“There will be no more difficult places than urban areas to establish an authorized cannabis trade, in the metropolitan area of Seattle,” said Ben Livingston, a spokesman for the Cannabis Legalization Centre, a recently formed research group.
On November 21, the police chief, Oates, in Aurora, sent an email to his officers announcing that the "City attorney" (representative of the public ministry) would no longer prosecute people aged 21 and older who possess small amounts of marijuana, and that the police had to stop accusing people for this type of crime "in immediate effect."
Chef Oates said the police would apply the new judicial decisions that regulate the activity of those who cultivate marijuana for medical purposes, and that he would continue to prosecute drug traffickers and dealers.
In Weld County, in northern Colorado, the “district attorney” (the Prosecutor of the Republic), Ken Buck, carries a stricter vision.
After the vote, he said his office would continue to deal with marijuana possession affairs, mainly in order to press users to be detoxified.
At present, 119 people are accused of possession of 56 grams or less of marijuana, but many of them are subject to other charges.
“Our office has the obligation to begin prosecution against those people who committed a crime that at the time of the facts was a recognized crime,” Buck said.
Reactions have been complicated even in rural places such as Mesa County, where voters rejected the initiative for restricted marijuana consumption.
Police in Grand Junction, the county’s largest city, no longer show adults for ownership of limited amounts.
The county public ministry representative, Pete Hautzinger, supported this decision, but also decided not to classify all cases of marijuana detention.
“I don’t feel like I’m losing my time continuing to apply the law until it changes,” he said.
Although 55 percent of Colorado voters have supported the measure, offering an appropriate legal and governmental framework for personal marijuana consumption is not easy.
And the contradictory reactions that have been observed in different U.S. cities highlight the deep ambivalence among local officials as regards the legalization of marijuana.
"This is a cultural barrier" with the representatives of the public ministry, said Sean McAllister, a Denver lawyer who represents the people accused of marijuana consumption and who expresses himself as a local spokesman for the "National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws" (National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws).
“They’ve spent a lot of their lives prosecuting people who consumed marijuana, too, they’re hard to accept that it’s legal,” he said.
As the first states to deal with restricted marijuana consumption at the same level as alcohol consumption, Colorado and the state of Washington are going to become a case of jurisprudence for drug legalization.
While defenders and state representatives are planning a new boundary of legalized sales, they are looking forward to the directives of the federal government, which still conceives the sale and culture of marijuana as federal crimes.
The advocates of marijuana legalization hope the Ministry of Justice will surrender.
Despite some mediated arrests of therapeutic marijuana patients and sellers, the federal government has mostly allowed marijuana for therapeutic purposes stores to exercise in Colorado, Washington and 16 other states.
While it is true that the police will probably not close the doors to capture small drugs bags, it is strong to bet that it is opposed to authorized stores of marijuana for personal use authorized by the new laws, said Kevin A. Sabet, a former political adviser to the Obama administration.
Many cities in Colorado have not expected the federal authorities to act.
Long before the votes, some local governments approved moratoriums regarding the creation of new marijuana stores, although it is just a one-year delay.
Last week, the city of Montrose obtained a six-month moratorium, and it is expected to impose this ban next week.
"We don't want to find ourselves in a situation where a license is granted to someone and then find ourselves faced with a federal problem," said Bob Nicholson, a member of the municipal council.
Our community voted against this amendment.
We are interested in the vote of the community rather than the vote of the state.
A lot of questions are asked.
Petronella Wyatt: I was mismanaged and excluded from Oxford because I was a "Tory" (conservative).
Not only today’s students are attacked for their opinions.
As far as I remember, I always dreamed of entering the University of Oxford.
My father and my older brother studied in what was for me an outstanding place to know, a kind of modern Greek amphitheatre that stimulates the two piles of civilization, free thought and tolerance.
However, two weeks after I was settled at Worcester College at the end of the 1980s to study history, I decided to make my bags, causing the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed and began to cry.
My friends were disconcerted.
The L'Evening Standard newspaper claimed that I had left this university because I had objected to the fact that primary students had sex in the room next to my.
Author A. N. Wilson said with facetity that I was leaving after being forced to drink in broken cups.
The truth was less funny.
I have fled.
Yes, I fled, because I had been a victim of intimidations and was the subject of constant brimades.
Not because of my name rather overrancing, nor because I came from a private school.
I was persecuted for one and only reason, and in this basement of the so-called know, I was a victim of a racist and barbaric behavior: my regretted father, Woodrow Wyatt, was a very influential adviser to Margaret Thatcher and I was a partisan of the Conservative Party.
Why to talk about this today, you will tell me.
And well, recent studies have revealed that a new generation of center-right students suffer the same type of persecution.
The growing and institutionalized hatred of Tory students in Oxford is like last week, some of them demanded protection of their rights, just as those of gay, disabled and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Corpus Christi College’s Student Room (JCR) said they were “often isolated, personally attacked and felt unwanted” because of their political opinions.
They want a representative within the University Committee for Equal Opportunities so that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation has not been facilitated by the recent documentary broadcast on BBC Two "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right" ("The Land of Wonders: Young, Intelligent and Right"), dedicated to the policy among students, and which depicted "Tories" as excentric and neonazi.
There was the student Joe Cooke, former president of the “Oxford University Conservative Association (OUCA)”, who moves in Rolls-Royce, trees a whole silver and moves with a chromed head can.
In other universities, conservative students say they are treated as messengers of the establishment of increased scholarship fees.”
Luke Black, 20 years old, vice president of the "Nottingham University Conservative Association", told a Sunday newspaper that "there is a growing left-wing party in universities.
People think we’re like the Bullingdon Club without even meeting us.”
Samuel Roberts, 21 years old, a history student at Corpus Christi, who proposed a motion for more protection, says such a climate is "uncomfortable", and Stephanie Cherill, 19 years old, OUCA president, says there has been a deterioration of the JCR members' attitude towards people who are center-right.
“This constitutes an obstacle to the freedom of intellectual debates, as well as the well-being of members,” she said.
I was the only one to think so during my first weeks spent in Oxford.
I entered in September 1986, when I was 18 years old and with a paralyzing timidity.
The hatred of the conservative party was very virulent.
In the previous year, the university had voted to refuse to grant Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree, due to the reduction of funding for graduate studies.
The atmosphere was loaded with Stalin vibrations.
From the first days of the host week, when the new students got acquainted with the others and the teachers, I had an advance of what was going to happen later.
I discovered that the teachers not only participated in the sarcasms against the Tory students, but they also it.
It was as if the policy on the strike minors, privatization and government opposition to the sanctions against apartheid in South Africa was grabbed in the woods of the classrooms.
The first sarcasm I was victim of was a translation into English of the French texts of the 18th century, and I was not prepared for it.
“Miss Wyatt,” said Professor Harry Pitt (now dead), “please translate the first paragraph.”
I lost my foot.
Pitt, a little man with a pustulous face, was easily overcome.
“Do the Thatcherists refuse to learn French or are they just stupid?” he asked.
The other students laughed.
The tears burned my eyes.
“I suggest you take French courses during your free time – finally, if you’re not too busy making friends,” he said.
I went back to my room, unconsolable.
During dinner that evening, I sat alone and then I felt a light tape on my shoulder.
It was a second-year English student named James, who presented himself as a member of the OUCA.
“I know who you are,” he said, kindly.
I am very afraid that this will happen.
Any person suspected of being a Tory (conservative) is taken as a target.
It’s hard enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it’s going to be even harder for you.
Most young Tory claims to be Labour (workers).
Later, in the local pub, I lazyly tried to hide myself.
I insisted on the fact that I did not agree with everything Mrs. Thatcher said.
This strategy failed.
A student in the first year of philosophy, political and economic sciences who, ironically, had studied at Eton, said: "You are the daughter of a fascist pig."
You are contaminated.
Other students have taken the refrain.
I was perverted, dirty.
“How do the Tories do love?” asked one of them.
They strike each other, isn’t it?”
I felt like homosexuals before the liberal legislation of the 1960s.
Would I only have been able to live a normal life in Oxford?
Would I have been forced to meet people who share the same views only after the fall of the night?
Should I become a Labour and deny my opinions?
The next three years would look like a purgatory of ostracism and isolation.
The only openly Tory professor was Norman Stone, a professor of modern history, who taught at my university.
He was hated not only because he was a conservative, but also because he was a foreign policy adviser to Thatcher and one of the authors of his speeches.
He was almost never there.
He hated this provincial and insignificant place, as well as its adherence to the Marxist-Determinist point of view of history.
In 1997, he accepted a post of professor at the University of Bilkent, Ankara, Turkey.
“You won’t be happy here,” he said.
I started traveling between Oxford and my parents’ house in London, finding refuge with my family and my more open-minded city friends.
I told my father I hate Oxford and I explained to him why.
He was unbeliever.
During his studies in Oxford, in the 1940s, all political points of view were accepted.
“But it’s the best place in the world,” he told me pathetically.
They would not do that, not in the city of the dreaming clocks.
Even my communist friends had irrevocable ways.
He had tears in his eyes.
Leave them a chance.
I’m sure it’s to tick you.
It would break my heart if you left Oxford.
I was tired of my frequent travel to London, my emotional resistance gradually deteriorated.
A friend, also Tory, died under pressure and gave up his convictions.
During a work session conducted the next week, when another history teacher suggested the world’s most seriously, that I was “a enemy of the people,” I decided to do the same.
Rushing inside of shame, I admitted to be a victim of my parents’ brainwashing and treated them as “old fools.”
The rest was short.
It was my father who dropped the last clay of my Oxford coat.
At that time, he wrote two columns in Murdoch's press every week.
My door was closed.
I stayed taped in my room, and after five minutes, my prosecutors left.
When they left, I made my suitcase and took the first train to London.
I have never returned.
You can treat me as a wet chicken.
But no child aged 18 should be a victim of such intimidation in a school institution.
The most tragic is that it was Oxford, which not only produced 14 Prime Ministers Tory, but also enjoys an unbeatable reputation of equality and freedom of thought.
“Valentino prefers elegance to fame”
As part of the exhibition "Valentino: a Master of Couture", inaugurated this week in London, ABC interrogated Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza and other famous clients of the Italian couture.
Somerset House, the former residence of Elizabeth Ire of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of receiving an exhibition on Valentino Garavani.
The couturer recognized it at the inauguration of "Valentino: a Master of Couture", a prestigious retrospective that brings together more than 130 high couture models created for his couture house over the past 50 years.
“I love this palace,” he said with his imitating Italian accent.
This exhibition is the body of a story whose only protagonist is "He signs" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his famous clients.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the closed world and apart from nobleship.
In the first room of this exhibition, open until March 3, there is an impressive number of private letters and photos signed by the creme of aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Lord Snowdon, through Princess Mary-Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England.
Valentino exposes his personal memories as the trophy of his social ascension: from the modest couturier of the city of Voghera, northern Italy, to the idol of the international jet-set.
There is nothing wrong to love the kingdom.
“At least they don’t break their cigarette bulbs on your beautiful carpet as some pop music stars do,” says Baron Fiona Thyssen-Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s, we both lived in the Alps and we were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular host and receives with generosity and elegance.
"We all loved to be invited to her Gstaad chalet," says the former wife of "Heini" Thyssen, an intimate friend of past time beauty such as Marella Agnelli or Eugénie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to fame.
Even so, he is a star.
Valeria Mazza with a Valentino model
The Argentine model, Valeria Mazza, has not even forgotten the charism of the couturier.
A few years ago, after a parade on the Square of Spain, in Rome, we went to dinner in his apartment.
We were about twenty people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
We saw and felt his mind in every detail of his apartment, in the decoration, food, music.
“With him, every guest felt important and appreciated,” the “top model” recalls, which began working with him during the Haute-Couture Week in Paris in 1995.
“He will never go out of fashion, because his creations are works of art,” she concludes.
The line of nobility
Garavani’s life is not a story of obsession but of shared love.
He loves good people and with the greatest titles and they love him as well.
One of the Somerset House galleries has been transformed into a glamorous podium of seventy meters wide that proposes to exchange roles: the visitor takes the place of the models and must surf on the podium to admire a "public" of dream carrying the main creations of Valentino, such as the cutter that Jackie Kennedy had chosen for her marriage with Aristotle Onassis, the costume that Monica Vitti wore in "The Night", or a wol and hairy mantle belonging to Emperor Farah Diba.
Among this audience of models, there are names such as Sybille of Luxembourg, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette-Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sophie of Habsburg.
Naty Abascal and the Couturier in 2006
Many of his customers say that Valentino’s first clothes are like the first love, “impossible to forget.”
I remember it perfectly.
It was a pants, a shirt, a "gillette" jacket and a jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn-winter collection.
“It’s a gift he had given me,” said Naty Abascal, one of the couturer’s museums.
“I prefer him to all others because of his femininity, his great love for women, and because he glorifies our beauty,” said the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses, they are bright and light the face.
The proportions are perfect.
The princess and fashionista Patricia della Giovampaola of Arenberg cannot, either, forget the first time she wore a Valentino model.
When she was a teenager and lived in Italy, she dreamed of having the age and the opportunity to wear one of her evening clothes...
It was possible at the end of the 90s.
I bought my first Valentino model for a party in my cousin's castle, Prince Edward of Line.
It was a red evening dress, with a wheeled jacket, a drawn buster and a decolletate to fall.
“It was a dream that became reality,” said Rodrigue’s widow of Arenberg.
“Valentino is indifferent to fashion, he is obsessed with the timeless,” the Italian aristocrat who shares his life between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires explains.
Princess of Arenberg keeps the couturer's evening clothes with "the greatest care, because a night dress is not just a dress, she is also the whole of the memories she carries."
The “King” of Fashion
The great final of the Somerset House exhibition is Marie-Chantal Miller's wedding dress wearing during her marriage with Paul of Greece in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "ragazze" (the couturer so calls his coutures) to make this elephant silk dress with pearls incrustations, twelve different kinds of teeth and a four-and-a-half-meter stretch.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the supreme authority of the specialized press, this dress represents a historic fact of the high coat of the late 20th century, “the return of the customers of the high society.”
Obnubled for years by the "know-being" of the nobility, Valentino is now his best representative.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the greatest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commander of the Order of Arts and Letters, awarded the Legion of Honor, Garavani accumulates as many honors as any spouse of his clients.
“His refinement, his calmness, his careful and perfect appearance have always jumped in my eyes,” Arenberg acknowledges.
The last time I saw it was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Orsay Museum.
He was sitting at the table of Countess Jacqueline of Ribes, one of my great friends.
“He was impeccable, the years have no effect on him.”
If it is a princess who says that...
The hardest job in the world: Kawah Ijen's human mules
For four euros, Indonesian volcano carriers risk their lives and health by carrying 70 pounds of sulfur through sharp stone trails.
There are people for whom work is hell and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case of Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by carrying sulfur from the Kawah Ijen volcano, east of the Indonesian island of Java.
It must work every day to the bottom of the crater, where the sulfuric gas coming from the enters of the earth solidifies to the contact of the air.
After collecting large sulphur rocks, which weigh a total of 70 kilograms, he installs them in two bamboo baskets he charges on his shoulders through the sharp paths.
There are only 250 meters to the peak of the volcano that culminates at 2,386 meters of altitude, but exhausted carriers take more than 40 minutes to climb this distance, to a turtle shade, keeping the balance and measuring their steps so that they don’t break down and fall into the precipice.
They know that a false step could cost them life, as it happened to a French tourist who made a deadly fall in the Kawah Ijen volcano several years ago.
Kawah Ijen miners earn 5 cents of euro for every kilogram of sulfur extracted.
Once up, there is a road between the tourists who photograph them as if they were circus animals, and wearing heavy baskets, they walk the 3 kilometers to the balance that a mining company has installed a little down at an altitude of 1,850 meters.
It is PT Candi Ngrimbi, a company that has exploited the volcano since 1960 and, can be said, its employees, to whom it pays 662 Indonesian rubles (5 cents of euro) per kilogram of sulfur.
It then sells it for 10,000 rubles (83 cents) to the petrochemical industry since this mineral is very present in everyday life and is used to make candles, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even serves to whiten sugar.
“As we carry about 70 pounds, we earn about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) on each trip,” Anto explains, who generally carries three trips a day.
Each takes him 3 hours and he ends exhausted, but this allows him to earn 138,000 rubles (11,50 euros) at the end of the day.
Although it seems to be a misery for such superhuman effort, it is the triple of what it would win in the fields.
“The income of minors is very high here, where coffee harvest is paid 15,000 rupees (1,20 euros) per day and where the average monthly salary is two million rupees (167 euros),” says the carrier who once worked as a mason on the tourist island of Bali.
There, her salary was 75,000 rupees (6.20 euros) a day and the job was not as hard, but Anto returned near his family in Banyuwangi, a village near the volcano, for a reason that, in Indonesia, is as indisputable as sulfur: "I married a young girl from Bali, where they are Hindu, and I brought her back to Java so that she converted to Islam."
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing hard, constantly coughing and his eyes are irritated by toxic gases.
At the age of 27, he spent three of his life challenging the danger on the Kawah Ljen, but sulfur has already begun to make him pay the invoice although he covers his face with a mask and wears special gloves.
Anto suffers from asthma, breathing hard, constantly coughing and his eyes are irritated by the toxic gases rejected by the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to pursue his dream.
“I’m going to work for another two years because I want to open a store or study Spanish or French,” he promises in an English more than acceptable.
Destroyed by life, this sympathetic and intelligent young man could be a tourist guide, servant or receptionist in a hotel, but instead he does the work of a mule.
It shares an unhealthy wood measurement with other carriers, rises every day at two o'clock in the morning because sulfur does not cease to go out at night, when its characteristic yellow color becomes blue and shines in the middle of darkness.
Challenging the darkness, Anto descends into the crater, illuminating himself with a small lamp attached to his helmet, which he bought himself with his own money.
About 400 carriers load the sulphur baskets on their shoulders from the bottom of the crater.
Despite its comfortable profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulfur extraction to save costs and does not provide any equipment to carriers who work on their behalf and are paid for weight.
In addition, they don’t even touch a sub of the 30,000 rupees (2,50 euros) by camera increase, in addition to the entrance of 15,000 rupees (1,20 euros), which the guards of this natural park charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and its human mules.
“This work is done for the animals, not for humans,” says Madrusin, a 42-year-old body carrier who has been working in Kawah Ijen for thirty years since he left college.
Capable to carry up to 110 pounds, he assures that he will not stop working "as long as he can", because he needs money to raise his 3 sons, aged between 10 and 18 years.
I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano is my whole life.
Although sulfur damages the throat and irritates the eyes when the wind turns and traps the miners into the thick smoke columns that come out of the volcano, they are so hard that no one complain of suffering from serious diseases... to which they obviously add their usual respiratory problems, arthrosis, pain in the knees and shoulders, deformed by the weight of the baskets.
By balancing the basket on his back, Unainik, 53 years old, can load only 50 pounds.
Every day, his companions and he extract 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which three trucks carry to the warehouse of Tamansari, 18 kilometers away by a cow path invaded by the bad herbs.
“I’m not going to retire, I’m going to die here because the volcano is all my life,” says Unainik, opening his mouth, revealing several missing teeth.
The oldest of his five children, 30 years old, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but perpetual misery from generation to generation is one of the hardest occupations in the world: the one that the human mules of the Kawah ljen volcano do.
Singapore is looking for babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans put the responsibility for this absence of children on the career, stress and the cost of access to the property.
“The population of Singapore needs to grow.”
I am a husband and a patriot, you are my wife and a patriot, let us fulfill our civil duty and give life!
It may seem unlikely that these words come from an advertisement for menta pills, but despite that, or thanks to that, the video spread like a powder trail on YouTube in Singapore at the beginning of this year.
The words come from a rap group that uses local references such as "Let's put a polychinel in the box" to laugh at Singapore's birth rate.
BBH, the advertising agency that originated the video, hopes to attract the attention to the problem in a fun way through this advertising.
His creative director, Douglas Hamilton, said he wanted to use the power of music so that people fulfill "their national duty".
It is intended only for the Internet, so we could make it fun and fun.
This is the main problem in this country.
We are the worst in the world in the field of birth, so we felt that it was a topic we had to address.
We knew that the government had tried several things such as throwing perfumes to pheromones or organizing speed-dating nights.
Many of these ideas were creative, but they didn’t necessarily work.
So we told ourselves the following thing: what is more creative to solve this problem than to make it a rap song?
1.2 Children
The government of Singapore does not take it so lightly.
He spends $1,300 a year on policies to encourage his citizens to have more children.
A government measure for marriages and fathers gives up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity holidays and distributes tax gains.
But all of this had little effect.
Singapore is a rich and high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for the conservation of its leaders and its strict social controls.
Singapore’s birth rate, according to its national population allocation, is currently at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time it was above 2, considered the renewal rate, was in 1976.
So why do not Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Managing Director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Division, says that it is due to a "better education" and "a broader choice of career opportunities".
“This has allowed people to have a broader range of options in terms of life goals and priorities, beyond marriage and the formation of a family,” she explains.
These changes in social standards have contributed to the increase in the number of single people and to the delay in marriage and births, resulting in a decrease in birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at radically increasing immigration to counter the decrease of the population has created a resentment within the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites that enlarge a barely disguised xenophobia against new immigrants, especially against Chinese who are accused of pulling the wages down and not integrating.
The increase in immigration is also perceived as one of the reasons why the party in Singapore saw its worst election results last year since independence.
Since the elections, they have tried to fix the problem with the establishment of higher quotas and taxes for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the fall of birth rate has known effects on a country’s economic growth, tax revenues, health costs and immigration policies, Singapore’s example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to avoid the construction of many small houses.
For example, this has started to affect the real estate sector.
Urban development authorities have begun to control the number of small apartments, known as "shoes box", which can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have an area of 46 square meters and their sale wins a lot of success.
However, the authorities are concerned that they can promote a single lifestyle and discourage promoters who want to build large family houses.
But Lim Yew Soon, Chief Executive Officer of the real estate company EL Developers, says that its “shoe boxes” sells much faster than larger houses.
They are more popular, in the sense that these houses are built much faster than those of greater size.
That is why it is much more profitable for our cash.
However, he admits that the new standards give clearer instructions to promoters, who were previously placed stalls in the wheels if they wanted to offer too small housing in a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
If so long that these new regulations can be a step towards the national birth rate increase, discussing with the Singaporeans who work in the center’s financial district, it would seem that they won’t have a lot of effects.
“People are very stressed, houses are expensive, just like education, that’s why people give it back later,” a young man said.
Other people may have children.
“But for me, it’s important to be able to have my money and my time,” says another young man of about twenty years old.
Men and women mention their career, stress and the cost of access to property and education as the reasons that prevent them from having children.
Thus, although the government tries to convince its citizens to have children, when it comes to making babies, Singaporeans themselves have the last word.
What is private offline is private online
confidentiality
According to the Dictionary of the Royal Spanish Academy, it is about the quality of the private domain or "the domain of privacy that we can protect from any intrusion."
What is private domain for children under 16 years of age?
How to apply this definition in everyday life and on social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he is exposed by broadcasting on the Internet of events that he’t share offline?
The newspaper elPeriódico interviewed five young boys, aged 10 to 15 years, frequent users of the web.
In four of the cases, they associated the term "something very personal" on the personal level and "password and user name" when they applied it to social networks.
"I will not reveal my most personal secrets in a post," says Jorge, ten years old, when he tries to explain the meaning of the term private on sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has a account for two years.
“These are very secret secrets, my mother can know them, but not everyone,” he says.
On FB, I’m posting good pictures or games.
I also talk to my friends.
“I’m not going to share any of my photos or someone who would do the fool,” he says.
The boy acknowledges that it’s bad to post obscene photos, neglected people, crimes, or to write humiliating or violent comments.
Jorge says he knows his 35 friends on FB as well as his nine Twitter subscribers.
The majority are of the family.
Her mother is part of it, she knows the password of one of the accounts.
I opened a Twitter account to express myself and write interesting tweets.
“I don’t know if they’re answering me, I’m just posting them,” he added.
“Social networks are fun, I can talk with remote parents or with my friends, quickly,” he says.
He says he will never accept the request of an unknown person.
He will not trust anyone who would recommend him a stranger.
The case of Joseph, 14 years old, is different.
The teenager has accounts on Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask, on the latter, he admits he does not know 20 of the people registered on his list of friends.
“It doesn’t worry me because we have something in common, music for example,” he said.
According to the boy, no one made any advances to him or asked him for his address or phone number.
“If they pressed me or demanded it, I would simply remove them from my account,” he acknowledges.
José subscribed to Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
The experiences we know today under the name of cyber harassment are not strange to the young boy.
A close friend of one of my friends was rocketed on a social network.
They threatened and demanded money.
“He never knew who he was,” he said.
The victim, according to Jose, did not close his account.
“He only spent it on a private profile.”
He then explains us a series of manipulations to configure his account safely.
Unlike Jorge, this young man would post photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do it if I was angry or angry.
“Even if I know it’s cyber harassment,” he said.
Key Questions
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English and graduate in Education and Learning, considers that, to guide children and adolescents, one must understand that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
“Internet has emerged as a way to search for information but, with the appearance of these sites, the rules of the game have changed,” she says.
Porras points out that academic Marc Prensky, who possesses a Master in Pedagogy at Yale University and author of the book "Digital Natives and Immigrants", uses these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, children and young people who are born with technology.
“We are the digital immigrants who must teach them there, while we are learning ourselves,” she says.
He adds that the topic is complex, "because we ask them to have a defined criterion on what is appropriate to disclose, publish or say to an age where they don't have the necessary maturity to do so."
“We also ask them to be selective while what matters them most is to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences,” she added.
According to the specialist, the most effective way to teach privacy to children and adolescents is to use questions that make them think.
“To tell them not to do it has nothing to do,” she says.
Then, Porras lists a few examples: there are things you’t tell a stranger, why do you do it on the Internet?
Or would you like them to post a photo of you like that of a friend you posted?
Do you know what others publish about you?
When you identify party photos, do you ask others for permission to identify them?
And also, everyone needs to know what you do at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they have to act online as they do offline.
These are the same rules.
“Outside the Internet, everyone must act with respect, morality and other principles, it must be the same on social networks,” she says.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary teacher and educational adviser, says it is essential that parents read consciously the conditions of use of social networks.
Understanding each of the terms, they will have a solid basis to discuss with their children the implications of opening an account on the Internet.
“For example, the age and what is allowed to share or publish,” he says.
According to Guardia, it is essential to remind children that they should not talk to foreigners.
The UNASUR summit ended without the Lima Declaration being made public
The sixth presidential summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) ended today in Peru without the Declaration of Lima being made public, although it has been previously announced and theoretically adopted by the seven members present.
Efe has repeatedly tried to access the document signed at the VIth Ordinary Meeting of Unasur's Heads of State and Government, but the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Presidency have initially that it will be disclosed after the closure of the summit, and then claimed that it will be published from time to time on the Peruvian government's website.
When interrogated on the text, they that its content had been exposed by the President of Peru, Ollante Humala, during short press statements.
The access of journalists to information about the summit has been constantly limited.
During the day, only the video without the sound of the presidential assembly with the message "private session, audio restricted" was broadcast in the press room.
The little information that circulated among the journalists was that given by the press attachments of some of the Unasur governments who attended the meeting, with the exception of the Peruvian spokesman.
The only document released during the day was the list of presidents present, which caused some discomfort among hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more important information.
Later, the Presidency of Peru sent an e-mail to the media with the "final declaration" of the summit, but it was the speech of President Humala and not the official document that concluded the summit.
Last October, Peru was the host of the 3rd Summit of South America (ASPA) and, at this occasion, although this was instinctively requested by the press, it had not also broadcast the statement also called the Declaration of Lima, as it had been previously announced.
On the official website of the ASPA, it can be verified that the document was published in March last year.
During the two international meetings, the Peruvian authorities tried to establish secure transmission systems for all journalists, but they limited to the maximum access to information.
The summit also concluded with the joint agreement of Chile and Peru to accept a judgment of the Hague Court that resolves a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met at the regional meeting and said they would respect the CIJ’s decision to hear the claims of both parties in the trial that Lima brought against Santiago and which begins Monday in The Hague.
“We will respect and execute the verdict that will resolve the disputes we bring today before this international court,” President Humala said, alongside his Chilean counterpart.
“Chili has always been, and will continue to be a country that respects international law, the peaceful resolution of disputes, treaties and international courts,” President Piñera added, giving a hand to President Humala, next to the flags of the two countries.
The confirmation of the two presidents that they would submit to the CIJ took place after Colombia denounced this week the Bogotá Pact by which it had agreed to submit to the decisions of this international court, after a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua which it considered seriously wrong.
The summit was held without the presence of Brazilian presidents, Dilma Rouseff, Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, Bolivia, Evo Morales, and Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, suspended from the UNASUR since 2011 after the resignation of its former president Fernando Lugo, has not participated in the meeting.
The host president, Ollanta Humala, was charged with opening the talks in the morning and closing the summit shortly afternoon in Lima.
The mandate read the final document in which he announced that 16 agreements had been adopted and that the action lines of 31 projects had been fixed between the South American countries for a total of $17 million investment.
Among the agreements adopted, he mentioned that the countries of the UNASUR will set up "important steps to the goal of South American citizenship by developing agreements on residence permits."
He informed that actions would be put in place to improve "cooperation in the fight against urban insecurity and international organized crime, actions for better access to drugs, affordable internet access throughout South America, and to evaluate in a joint and effective way the risks of natural disasters."
With Europe in crisis, “economic consolidation (Latin America) must not have a triumphal matrix but must help increase our productive matrix and see a better future for our populations,” President Humala concluded.
“We have decided to prioritize a group of 31 iconic projects that improve the connectivity of South American spaces, especially in rural and border areas... by uniting our countries and generating new economic circuits,” Peruvian President said in a speech.
Among these projects, he mentioned that five concerned Peru and were on the transversal axes of its territory, from the coast to Brazil, and that two aimed at a greater connection with Ecuador although he did not give the wider details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
“We hope that this country’s electoral process will allow its reintegration into the Union of South American Nations,” from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain a region of prosperity and peace, integrated and having good relations with its neighbors, is another topic discussed at the summit.
In this sense, Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said, before starting the regional meeting, that he hopes to meet his Nicaragua counterpart, Daniel Ortega, next Saturday in Mexico to calmly discuss the maritime dispute through a CIJ judgment requested by Bogota.
“It is possible that tomorrow (Saturday) I will have a meeting with President Daniel Ortega,” President Santos said.
“We will review all these paths, they are not exhaustive, including the Treaty with Nicaragua that will ask for a discussion with this country,” he said.
“I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will resolve this in the most civilized and respectful way possible,” Santos added.
Presidents Santos and Ortega will meet on Saturday in Mexico where they have planned to attend the assumption of the country’s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
Similarly, as part of the summit, the bloc’s Defence Ministers will meet in advance to approve the 2013 Action Plan, which aims to strengthen dialogue and consensus in terms of defence in the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Surinam and Paraguay are part of the UNASUR, although the latter country is suspended.
Peru assures the pro-temporary presidency of the regional block.
“South America must learn from Europe how to integrate a citizenship,” said Rafael Correa.
Ecuador’s president, Rafael Correa, said today that the creation of a common citizenship was a goal for which “South America, in this case, should take an example on Europe.”
President Correa, who took part in the 6th Summit of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), located in Lima, told state television, TV Peru, that the Europeans "have spoken during the Second World War" and during other conflicts, "but that they now form almost a homeland."
In this sense, he defended the project to establish a South American citizenship encouraged by the UNASUR member countries.
“It is necessary to the free movement of citizens and workers in any South American country, as is already the case for members of the Andes Community, but there are still reactionary areas that we want to make belong to the past,” he warned.
In addition, the President of Ecuador showed himself in favour of the reconstitution of the Organization of American States (OEA) with the aim of reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon States and taking into account the signatories of the San Jose Pact on Human Rights.
Those who swallow our ears never compromise anything, on the contrary, we, the South Americans, all have signed it.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is in Washington under the funding of the United States," he said, referring to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange.
Correa assures that he does not regret his decision, because he himself has not betrayed his principles, but on the contrary he has respected his "deep democratic values and human rights."
He concluded that at that time, "there were justified suspicions that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his trial would not be respected."
He also criticized the Swedish justice that demanded that he submit himself on his territory to an interrogation regarding a alleged sexual crime while “the Swedish own legislation allows to do so by video conference, which could be done since the Ecuador Embassy in London.”
Correa said there was a risk that Assange's mental and physical health would deteriorate.
"I haven't talked to him since he was in our embassy, but the ambassador told me he had a small lungs problem, but nothing serious," he said.
It is possible that your physical and mental health is deteriorated by being locked in a small space without being able to do outdoor exercises.
“This affects everyone’s health,” he concludes.
Correa notes that the asylum solution granted to Assange since June at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London, which would be the granting of a safe-conduct that would allow him to go to Ecuador, is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and European judicial authorities and he emphasizes that he had discussions in London to find a solution to the arrest of the founder of WikiLeaks.
We do not negotiate with human rights, we do not use this word in this case, but there have been permanent discussions.
“The solution to this problem is in the hands of Britain, Sweden and the European judicial authorities as Assange’s lawyer Baltazar Garzón has launched a whole series of procedures with different European bodies,” he said.
And he believes that "if Britain granted the rescue from tomorrow, it would end."
And if Sweden, as its legislation entirely permits, and as it has already done in other cases, interrogated Mr. Assange at the Embassy of Ecuador in London, or interrogated him via Skype tomorrow, the problem would also be solved.
Correa took advantage of this to reaffirm himself as a defender of the freedom of the press and said that what he would not tolerate was “mediocrity, bad faith and lies that harm freedom of expression.”
“The greatest enemies of the freedom of the press are not the evil or perverse politicians but the bad journalists at the balance of avidity, chantage and extortion,” he said.
In this angle, he congratulated himself that this is not the kind of journalists “neither the bankers nor the hegemonic and bourgeois countries that dominate Ecuador” and, instead of promoting his re-election, “it would deepen the revolution to continue the path and draw the right path.”
Correa also supported the decision to keep the veto on Paraguay within the Unasur at least until the upcoming elections, arguing that the organization “should be firm and not tolerate opportunism and disguised coup attempts,” because in reality, “this destroyed the legitimacy of Paraguay democracy.”
Moreover, the Ecuadorian president considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries through the judgment of the International Court of Hague, which will strengthen the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
This judgment is currently not respected.
It is a problem between a South American country and a Central American country.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome by the will to move forward together.
They need to be resolved in their entirety to overcome them and move forward.
At the same time, he said he was confident in the correct resolution of the maritime border dispute that opposes Peru and Chile within the same court and said it is "beneficial for Latin America to arrest international instances if the two countries agree to accept a so firm judgment that is."
Referring to the possibility of his presentation as a candidate for the future presidential elections in Ecuador, in order to strike a third consecutive term, he that he saw this possibility "with a lot of optimism and joy, although this is sometimes quite difficult".
Correa assured that, if he lost the primary in February 2013, he would withdraw from public life.
At the personal level, power has never interested me, but in situations as unfair as those of Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be solved through political power.
“My political movement believed that it was me who guaranteed that possible victory but we must accept that responsibility,” he said.
If I win, it would be my last presidential term and then I will withdraw from political life.
If we ever lose, I will do it as well.
“This is my decision,” he said.
Correa also referred to the new medical treatment of Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez in Cuba.
I just talked with Venezuelan Vice President Nicolás Maduro and he told me that a routine medical treatment was already planned and that he was waiting for the end of the campaign to return to Cuba.
“This does not mean a decline in President Chavez’s health,” he commented.
The Ecuadorian head of state participated today in Lima at the 6th Summit of State and Government Chiefs of the Union of South American Nations (UNASUR) which ended with a call to better regional integration in order to support progress, equality and security.
AIDS-related deaths are due to late detection.
Fabrizio was 21 years old when the test result was confirmed: seropositive.
“It’s as if heaven had fallen on my head,” he said, referring to the moment of the announcement, that the doctor had tried to make “less painful” in vain.
The young man hid him from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness alone and began informing about him and his harshness was like he just celebrated his 43th birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest HIV patients in the Guadalajara Civil Hospital (HCG) HIV unit, in which he found himself in 1994 after numerous battles.
Fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) for 22 years, something difficult to imagine in the early 90s, where there was a lot of doubts, little choice of treatment and more stigma.
So even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye to him "because he was without a voice."
At that time, having AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is possible to survive this syndrome and have a good quality of life.
However, ignoring their disease, many people still come when the virus has already caused damage, "exhausted" their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, in all cases after the first cases, "the great victory is today that the survival of a patient who started treatment at the right time and the survival of the population in general is exactly the same," said the head of the HIV unit of HCG, Jaime Andrade Villanueva and he takes for reference that this information was validated in April of this year in a prestigious scientific publication.
Infectiologist and HIV/AIDS expert, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008, scientists have concluded that AIDS was no longer a fatal disease, but that the number of years of survival and quality of life depends on the level of immunity affected by patients at the time of diagnosis, with better prospects for those who do not consume drugs: up to 30 years for a CD4 rate of 200 and up to 50 years for those who reach a 500 CD4.
Simply speaking, this means that for someone who would receive a HIV positive diagnosis at the age of 25, "so long as he remains under control, he will be able to live without problems up to 75 years," the scientist explained.
To restore this progress in its context, it is necessary to know that the life expectancy of the Mexicans is now 76 years in average.
Although it is true that mortality has decreased significantly in recent years, in the case of Mexico, the number of people who died from AIDS followed increased from 6,678 cases in 2007 to 4,862 cases in 2011 (according to the annual UNUSIDA report), but it is also true that, since the appearance of AIDS, 60% of patients identified on the basis of national data have died.
Only in Jalisco, 255 people died in 2011, and there were 187 deaths until May of this year; however, we are assured that access to antiretroviral drugs is universal since 2005.
So why are there still deaths?
I think the problem does not come from access to treatment.
That’s what I see, that’s what’s happening in my hospital.
Over the last 12 years at least we have never missed medications, the problem is that patients reach very advanced stages because they don’t know they’re infected, or then they learn it at advanced stages of the disease.
It gives us an indisputable fact "nine out of ten patients arrive when they already present an opportunistic infection, what is needed to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and, for this, it is necessary to offer massive screening tests, to all people who ask for it."
Specialists and members of the State AIDS Prevention Council of Jalisco (Coesida) agree on his proposal, as well as the patients themselves, such as Fabrizio, who had to do his screening test in a private laboratory, simply because a friend had done it and that, despite his young age, he was already a carrier of AIDS and suffered from Kaposi sarcoma, a cancer tumor that is one of the common complications.
Everything changes when you learn that you have AIDS.
Some think they’re going to die and don’t want to know anything.
"If I'm going to die, it's better that I break out three times a week," they say, it's not my case.
The change was beneficial, I eat well, I do exercise, I take my medications.
Until now, his parents only know that he suffers from cancer.
I have a normal life, like anyone else.
"I work, I have a lot of activities, I travel, I have an active, but responsible sexual life, I pay attention to myself and the other person," says Fabrizio, who agreed to share his privacy with MILENIO JALISCO to help, thanks to his testimony, those who are afraid today, during the World AIDS Day march.
Let them do the test, if they have taken risks, the earlier they will know if they are HIV-positive and better it will be, and if they already have the diagnosis, they must know that one can live like everyone, being responsible.
His message summarizes the slogan of the fight against AIDS in this year 2012.
Preservatives on the container
There are many gap between health programs and the ordinary citizen, says Ricardo Salazar, a Guadalajara journalist who kissed the cause of HIV.
The most important thing is prevention.
In all places dedicated to this, "we have actually increased the distribution of preservatives, before we were given one or two, now we are given packages of a hundred, it's very good, but it results, that even today, some have no access to preservatives," he says.
Among the most vulnerable to new infections are adolescents.
The question: "What are you going to do with it?", asked with sarcasm and valuable judgments by social workers, guidance counselors, pharmacists and health professionals, is the question that teenagers don't want to hear, the journalist assures.
It proposes to reorient this inefficient distribution; that the preservatives are not only sold to stores, but that they are found in the distributors of public toilets and in the places that young people visit.
It is not about encouraging promiscuity.
It is also not about paying them the girls and the motel, as Governor Emilio González had answered when he was asked if there would be a distribution of the preservatives within his administration.
“It’s not how sexuality works, it’s best to provide preservatives to people who are already sexually active,” he said.
The figures in Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulated cases (12,158 of AIDS and 1,317 of HIV).
The state is the fourth state in the country in the number of new cases and accumulated cases of AIDS and 13th for the number of HIV patients.
92% of infections are sexually, 6% by blood and 2% perinatal.
It is estimated that 50,000 people live with HIV, since for each recorded case there are 4 or 5 people who don’t know it.
A judgment ratified in appeal by a U.S. court ignores the restructuring of the debt of the Vitro group consented through a commercial bankruptcy in Mexico. The scenario causes a negative precedent for all national companies having ramifications in the neighboring country and having solvency problems.
It would therefore seem that the survival procedures of the companies authorized by Mexican laws are not valid in the country at the star banner, contrary to international agreements.
From a practical point of view, the blow to the judgment made on June 15th by Judge Harlin Hale of the North Texas District Bankruptcy Court, leaves Mexican companies undefense in the face of the possibility of embargo of their properties beyond the Bravo.
However, the resolution will allow the main Mexican glass manufacturer to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on the basis of three incoherences.
First, while the judge of the case points out that creditors must register according to the U.S. Bankruptcy Act, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeal, sitting in New Orleans, claims that the main proceedings are the formalized commercial bankruptcy in Mexico.
The first point would involve denouncing international cooperation in case of insolvency of companies with a transnational profile.
In fact, the United Nations Model Law for the Uniformity of International Commercial Law was created for this purpose by taking the American Law Institute as an arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment establishes that without the intersociated vote, recognized in the critical mass of commercial bankruptcy, the debts agreed by Vitro’s subsidiaries to the parent company, the majority required for the approval of the restructuring would not have been obtained.
However, the Mexican laws recognize this possibility.
In fact, the case of Vitro is not the first to use this plan.
There are here half a dozen examples, among which Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose Federal Institute of Commercial Bankruptcy had guaranteed debts.
Furthermore, what is certain is that, since there remained the votes of the subsidiaries, in any way the Vitro creditors who fought against this in the U.S. courts, i.e. the "vautour" funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained the majority.
The vote was 45 votes against 37.
The data was omitted by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro was blamed for the difficult situation he encountered since 2008 without ceasing to the severe economic crisis faced by the United States, affecting the costs to the country.
For now, the company of the family González Sada will appeal before the same appeal court so that the vote will take place in its entirety, i.e. with the five judges, since only three had voted.
The insurance appeal will demand non-prosperity and requires the review of the trial by a higher court, in this case the U.S. Supreme Court of Justice.
The worst is that the court had ignored a document sent by the government of Mexico in the name of the amicus curiae ("friend of the Court") in which was detailed the proceedings followed by Vitro within the framework of the Commercial Bankruptcy Act, indicating that this freed him from the conventions signed by the two countries to put it at the same level as paragraph 15 of the US Bankruptcy Act.
Furthermore, it points out that the country has adhered to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the rules set for cross-border insolvency cases, which guarantee equality for debtors and creditors.
Carambolage of two parts: they assom Vitro and they assom the country.
The general balance
The complaints of the Mexican Aviation Society syndicates against the company’s former boss, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, have been silent for several months, he was accused of fraudulent administration, the Aviation Pilots Syndical Association has already met problems.
The court, headed by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau, has just filed a criminal action against the National Banking and Values Commission, which is accused of obstruction to justice.
According to him, the inspection authority has systematically denied to provide information to the Prosecutor General of the Republic about an operation carried out by the entrepreneur to withdraw from the fideicommis F/589 from the IXE bank 198 million pesos on behalf of the Mexicana de Aviación.
The funds would have been used for the purchase of shares from the Professional Hotel Administration.
As everyone knows, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
The Dragon Mart
A group of national and foreign ecologists, university professors, entrepreneurs and members of civil society, gathered in a weekend at the University of the Caribbean amphitheatre, approved the creation of a broad front of opposition to the inauguration of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancun.
As you know, we are talking about a colossal sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean of the Great Wall Country products, with a residential area for employees of 150 companies.
Previously, the Canacintra (National Chamber of Industry and Transformation) had managed to unite the governors of the Southeast area to oppose the monumental project that is partly on protected areas and represents the greatest of all threats to the industry.
The ACTA is dead.
The government has raised a request from the Senate to explain under what terms and circumstances the ambassador of Mexico in Japan had signed the Commercial Anti-False Agreement, known as ACTA, according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property, this topic is already of ancient history.
As everyone knows, it was good that the Senate itself had condemned this possibility, because it was considered a violation of freedom of expression on social networks.

Héctor "Hetin" Reyes "Basketball is all my life"
The global basketball player "Hetin" Reyes has spent more than 60 years of his life in connection with the field and, thanks to him, has traveled around the world.
Few people in Puerto Rico have a knowledge of the history of the local basketball as big as that of Héctor "Hetin" Reyes.
The reason for this is that before a brain bleeding condemns him to the wheelchair in 2008, Reyes has been immersed in this sport for more than 60 years, whether it is as a player of lower leagues, player of the national basketball team, manager and manager of the national team, the BSN, with the Vaqueros of Bayamón or as president of the basketball federation.
“I’ve been wearing several helmets in basketball throughout my life, and even several at the same time, as when I was BSN’s chairman, national team’s general director and federation’s chairman during the 90s,” Reyes recalls during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
“Basketball is my whole life.”
Reyes does not exaggerate when he makes that statement.
The walls of his house, almost all decorated with photos and memories that remind his out-of-standard route, witness this.
Bayamón in the heart
Of all his memories, those he loves most are those that remind him of his passage as a player within the Vaqueros team in the mid-50s to 1982, after spending 15 years as co-manager or team manager.
“These were my best years, those of which I’ve most profited because I’ve had the chance to participate in eight Vaqueros championships since 1967, whether as manager, co-manager or manager.
This has been a lot of years of satisfaction, including the five championships played from 1971 to 1975.
I then retired at the championship in 1981, the year when Jerome Mincy joined the BSN team.
From there, "Cuco" Ortiz, who was a great manager, took the head of the team," says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who had been the leader here and who was at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), told me, “I have a hard player for you, he measures two meters.
You want it?”
This is how to start Mincy, one of the best players that Puerto Rico has ever had.
Bartow then recommended me Raymond Gausse, who was naturalized and who was one of the best shooters.
I remember that he said that if Mincy had allowed Bayamon to win a championship, Gausse would help us to try to win another.
He rejoiced the Vaqueros championship with Gausse, but only at a distance since in 1988 he was already the great manitou of the federation.
At that time, he preferred to take advantage of his tasks and those of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won it for the first time in the United States at the pre-olympic tournament in Mexico in 1989.
Then there was the 1990 World Cup where we reached 4th and where we would have had to win the bronze medal if this Canadian judge had not made us replay the last match, Reyes said.
Is the 1990 World Cup the best national team you’ve ever seen?
She is one of the best, just as she defeated the Dream Team at the 2004 Olympics.
But my favourite is that of the Pan-American Games in Cuba in 1991, when we won the gold and we put a rack on the U.S. team, which was quite similar to that which had won the bronze at the World Cup.
This team was not only composed of Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), there were also the young (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who had not been able to attend the world of 90 due to a knee problem.
A team that was not the best in terms of individuals, but it gave us a gold medal and a great joy at the pre-olympic tournament in Neuquén in Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner in replacement of the players suspended by the Mar del Plata Pan-American Games, we won the gold against all the forecasts.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
There is no doubt that it is Piculín Ortiz.
His statistics on international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated at this level as Piculín did.
And that without taking into account his trajectory in the different leagues for which he played.
Who was the best portorican leader?
It is very difficult to say.
We had a good team composed of Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
In young people, I really like the work that Leo Arill does.
What is your biggest success in the Federation?
Having been part of the most glorious time of the national team between 1988 and 1995, and the fact that in the early 1990s the BSN had up to 17 teams in one season.
What do you have to do?
There are things I would have wanted to put in place, such as the regionalization of minor categories.
For example, Ponce boys only play in their area and only face teams from the other corners of the island during national play-offs.
Today, young people travel and play too much while it is not necessarily necessary.
I have at least seen the advantage of mandatory certifications and courses for managers, field staff and arbitrators.
This makes me happy.
What do you do today?
In general, I listen to music, I watch videos of my time on YouTube, I enjoy my grandchildren and, from time to time, I watch basketball matches.
And of course, I enjoy the company of my wife, Isabel, who has always been next to me.
Death of actor Larry Hagman
Larry Hagman, born on 21 September 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas), became worldwide known by the main role of John Ross Ewing, more known as J.R., in the television series "Dallas", in which he incarnated a scrupulous, scary, and manipulative businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the scrupulous oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the TV series "Dallas" has become a symbol of wealth in the 1980s, has died.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who had returned this year in the role of J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday evening from complications of a cancer, according to a family statement sent to The Associated Press for Warner Bros., production house of "Dallas".
"Larry was back to his dear native town of Dallas, playing again the ironic role he loved most," the family said.
Larry’s family and close friends were with him in Dallas on this Thanksgiving holiday.
Linda Gray, who played the role of her wife in the original and subsequent series, was with Hagman when he died in a Dallas hospital, said her adjunct, Jeffrey Lane.
He brought joy to all those who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, affectionate and talented, and he will miss me a lot.
"He was an exceptional person and he lived life in depth," Gray said in a statement.
The doctors had diagnosed a liver cirrhosis to Larry Hagman in 1992 and had recognized that he had drunk a lot for many years.
In 1995, he was diagnosed with a malignant liver tumor and was transplanted.
Several years before "Dallas", Hagman had made himself known on television in the role of a ordinary guy in the series "Jinny of My Dreams" broadcast by NBC from 1965 to 1970.
In this, he played the role of Captain Tony Nelson, an astronaut whose life was transformed when he discovered a fascinating genius, played by Barbara Eden, and that he brought it home.
He also played in two comedies that remained shortly on the antenna, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971-72) and "Here We Go Again" (ABC, 1973).
Among her roles in the film, there are roles well received by the critic in "The Band", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was thanks to his magical interpretation of the deliciously hateful J.R. that Larry Hagman experienced his greatest success.
The CBS drama series on the Ewing clan and their relatives was broadcast from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who Killed J.R.?", invented to maintain the suspense around an emotion-filled episode in which Hagman's character is almost murdered, has generated speculations around the world and millions of dollars played in betting.
Thanks to this, among other things, the series has reached a record of audience at that time.
When the answer was revealed in a November 1980 episode, 41 million viewers were on average in front of their screen and made Dallas the second most watched entertainment program in the world, after the final episode of "MASH" in 1983, which had gathered 50 million viewers.
It was the sister of J.R., Kristin (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot her up.
J.R. had put her pregnant and then threatened to accuse her of prostitution if she didn’t leave the city, but other people also had reasons to attack her.
Hagman played the role of Ewing as a corrupt and insatiable man but with a charismatic smile: an unrighteous entrepreneur and an unfaithful spouse who tried to intern his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
“I know what would be needed as a epitaffe for J.R,” Hagman said in 1988.
It should be written: “This is the honest citizen J.R. Ewing.”
This is the only part he lost.
Victoria Principal, the coprotagonist of the original series, remembered this Friday of Hagman as a "immensive man, both on the small screen and in life."
It is unforgettable, and irreplaceable, for millions of fans around the world, and in the heart of each of us, who have had the luck to know and love him.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcast a few months ago with great success on the TNT channel.
The recording of five episodes is already completed for the second season and a sixth is being performed, the channel.
For now, neither Warner nor TNT channel have announced how Hagman's death will be integrated into the series.
Originally from Fort Worth in Texas, he is the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who knew the fame with classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Mary Martin was still a teenager when she gave birth to her in 1931 when she was married to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He made his first steps on the New York Theatre scenes in the early 1950s and then served in the Air Force from 1952 to 1956 in England.
There he met the young Swedish interior decorator Maj Axelsson and he married him.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and lived many years in the California city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001, he titled “Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life” (Hello Darlin: The Immaculate Memories of J.R.)
"I didn't write anything in this book that could hurt someone or affect him in any way," he told the press at that time.
After his liver transplant, he became an active organ donor and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist the worried patients.
“I advise them, I give them back confidence, I come with them when they come to be operated and after,” he said in 1996.
I try to give them a little comfort, like "Don't be afraid, it won't be easy for a little while, but it will go well."
He has also been an anti-tobacco activist and has participated in several campaigns.
The “End of the World” course has just begun.
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and climate warming.
This semester, when religion professor Stuart Charmé decided to give a course on the end of the world, he knew that he was throwing an irresistible hameon there: the end of the "big count" of the Maya calendar, on 21 December, to which many people refer to as being the proof of the end of the world imminent.
But Professor Charmé had no idea of what was waiting for him over the following months: the catastrophic Hurricane Sandy, a tax gap that some have called the "Armageddon of debt" and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place where the Christian theorists of the end of time thought the apocalypse would be triggered.
"I didn't realize that this was going to be the most apocalyptic semester I've ever experienced," Charmé said to his students at Rutgers-Camden University in New Jersey this week.
If we analyze what has happened in the world today as if we were 30 days later and we were telling it, it was a very good time.
And we must remember that what is bad is good for those who believe in the apocalypse.
And he’s not the only teacher to give courses on “the end of the world” this semester, which will, in theory, be the last of history.
At Temple, Deputy Professor Barry Vacker displays the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World".
Every week, students explore apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, viruses and bacteria and climate warming.
"We analyze this because these ideas spread over time," he said, and the way they offer hypothetical scenarios guides a certain human behavior.
If nuclear weapons fall into the hands of terrorists, for example, a war could break out.
This month, students will analyze films with apocalyptic themes and study how they can be compared to real-life examples.
“I tried to inform my students about what was possible, likely, credible and impossible,” Vacker said.
On the main campus of the Pennsylvania State University, Latin American History Professor Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an adjunct professor of Art History and Anthropology, teamed to give a course, simply entitled "The End of the World".
“We’re adding ‘2012’ to have the opportunity to give the course again, in the event that the world would not disappear,” said Professor Restall.
Despite the "imminent disaster", students must study, create projects and pass their final exam.
In the state of Pennsylvania, the final examination will be passed on the eve of the Apocalypse, which does not leave the students another choice than to work “up to the very night of the supposed end of the world,” Restall said.
The courses are quite popular.
"It was complete in two hours," Restall said about his high-level student course, consisting of 35 students.
We received email messages several weeks before the beginning of the semester, from people who asked if there was still room.
Students, on their part, ensure that the course is one of the most interesting.
“It fascinates me to see what people are able to do to comfort themselves,” says Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student of religion and sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey, Rutgers-Camden University.
For the fear of the Apocalypse, whether it is secular or religious, is just a matter of comfort, or of lack of comfort.
Will Wekesa, a 25-year-old student of Psychology and Nursing, says he has watched all the apocalyptic films.
“I’ve never heard of a class that taught this subject,” he said.
I appreciate it.
But none of the students questioned, and even less a professor, told us to believe in the end date of the world on December 21.
“Our first project was about the Maya prophecy, and in a certain way we discredited it,” says Julie Zegle, a 21-year-old Temple student from West Chester.
The Mayas have never predicted the end of the world, it’s just a key date on the calendar, Restall said.
But I admit that there is an anxiety related to the apocalypse in Western culture, dating back to several centuries, which makes people react to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has caused an increase in these speculations.
“In other places in the world, people don’t think of it,” he assures.
This is mostly in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a religion professor at La Salle University who gives courses to the Philippines this year, quickly answered when asked if he knew that there were courses about "the end of the world."
“The Philippines does not participate in the end of the world,” he replied, as if it was an exception from a higher authority.
We have a grace from the Pope.
Restall notes that over the years, we have talked about the many presumed dates of the last judgment, and he affirms that if nothing happens on December 21, "People will immediately begin to think about the next date" or to philosophy on the fact that December 21 marks the beginning of a seven-year period at the end of which the world will disappear.
Students and teachers take the date to light.
Many told us that they thought to go to holidays "from the end of the world".
“Sometimes I call friends and we laugh together,” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communication student.
