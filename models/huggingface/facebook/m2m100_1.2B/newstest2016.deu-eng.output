Obama receives Netanyahu
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly.
The two sides wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran’s destabilizing measures in the Middle East.
The meeting will also focus on the conflict with the Palestinians and the two-state solution.
The relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years.
Washington criticizes Israel’s ongoing settlement construction and accuses Netanyahu of lack of will in the peace process.
The deal promoted by Obama on the Iranian nuclear program has further worsened the relationship between the two.
In March, Netanyahu had delivered a controversial speech before the U.S. Congress at the invitation of the Republicans, which was partly viewed as an affront to Obama.
The speech was not agreed with Obama, but he refused a meeting with reference to the upcoming elections in Israel at the time.
In an emergency call, a professor admits to shooting his girlfriend
In an emergency call, Professor Shannon Lamb told the police with a slightly rude voice that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house.
Lamb was important to emphasize that his "sweet dog" is still alive and probably excited, and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone.
Inside the house, officials found the body of Amy Prentiss and a handwritten note cried on a white block: "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could reverse it, I loved Amy and she's the only woman who ever loved me."
There was no indication that Lamb, who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had already travelled 300 miles to the school site, where, according to police, he shot and killed a popular history professor, Ethan Schmidt, at the door to his office.
Delta State University police chief Lynn Buford said university staff heard the shooting at 10:18.
He said Lamb made the fatal emergency call sometime afterwards.
By the end of the day, there was another death: Lamb took his own life when the police killed him.
A day after the shooting at the university, which forced students and faculty to hide behind closed doors, authorities are still trying to get a picture of what motivated Lamb.
The details released by investigators at both ends of the state, as well as what students and staff who knew him said, helped draw a picture of a talented but potentially difficult teacher.
Students said they were looking forward to his lessons.
Police in Gautier, where Prentiss died, said he had no history of violence or a criminal history.
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he mentioned the "wonderful people" with whom he shared his academic life.
Both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History, whose faculty consists of 17 members, and many students attended classes from both.
At the same time, there were some tendencies to problematic behaviors.
One student, Brandon Beavers, who praised Lamb, said he also seemed a little excited and nervous, “as if something was wrong with him.”
Another student, Mikel Sykes, said Lamm told him that he was dealing with stress at the end of the 2014-15 academic year.
Lamb had previously asked Delta State University for leave for health reasons, saying he had some health problems.
This year, he taught only two online courses.
Recent changes in the university’s employment policy meant that the PhD, for which Lamb had worked so hard, would not be a guarantee for him of an automatic path to employment as an assistant professor.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination."
These are questions that Lamb can no longer answer.
After escaping from the campus, police later found Lamb's trace as he returned to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb killed himself with a .38 caliber gun in the backyard of a house about a mile south of his parent’s home on the outskirts of Greenville, Mississippi, Washington County Coroner Methel Johnson said.
His car was still in the entrance.
It wasn’t immediately clear why Lamb went to that house, but Johnson said she believes he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in the area.
Lamb began his work at the University in 2009, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and pedagogy.
He graduated in pedagogics in the spring.
One of Lamb’s longtime friends described him as intelligent, charismatic and funny.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20, when they met through common friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar for a few years.
At that time he was the woman’s wardrobe.
All the girls melted there when he was there," said Hairston, now 40 and resident in the Jackson suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss were apparently together for some time.
In the emergency call, Lamb said, “I killed my wife,” but there was no document of a marriage.
They had a dog named Lightning who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Bayou in Gautier.
Police said the dog was okay.
Prentiss's ex-husband, Shawn O'Steen, said they were divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends and had a daughter who was now 19 years old.
"She was totally destroyed on the ground," O'Steen said about his daughter.
She and her mother were absolutely best friends.
O'Steen said he never met Lamb, but through his daughter Abigail he heard Lamb was interested in music and played blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at a summer market three years ago.
Later they played the one or the other game together.
O'Steen said his daughter is writing and singing her own music.
Prentiss was a nurse who worked for various companies online.
Mike Shaffer, a barkeeper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Julep Room, a poorly illuminated bar near Gautier, said he saw Lamb and Prentiss Night for the last time in the night of September 5 after Lamb finished his guitar and mouth harmonic play in front of a scarce audience.
There were no signs that something was wrong.
“It’s just a happy couple,” he said.
We cleaned up and joked with each other.
I think they both had a good sense of joking.
Schmidt, the deceased professor, led the first semester seminar program and specialized in Native American and Colonial History, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English professor at the school.
He was married and had three young children.
He studied at Emporia State University in Kansas and was president of his Brotherhood and Student Committee.
At the Delta State Campus in Cleveland, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members, attended a candlestick memorial on Tuesday evening.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the warning while the university choir sang "Bright Morning Star" and "Amazing Grace".
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
“We’re trying to move our students back,” LaForge said.
The crisis is over.
This is a day of healing.
Amy and Rogelio Solis from Cleveland, Mississippi.
Associated Press authors Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans contributed to this report.
This story has been corrected to reflect that police now say Lamb made the emergency call after shooting Schmidt, and that while Lamm in his emergency call referred to Prentiss as his wife, there is no indication that the two ever married.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas season
Toys R Us says it won’t hire as many Christmas season employees as it did last year, but the toy and baby product dealer says it will give current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours.
The company said it plans to hire 40,000 people in stores and sales centers across the country.
Most jobs will be part-time jobs.
The company said it will start job calls this month and the number of employees will increase from October to December.
While the holidays themselves are still months away, the Christmas business is getting closer, and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to equip stores with employees who sell, ship and deliver products.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his date with Princess Diana
The premiere of "Back to the Future" was a great professional moment for Michael J. Fox.
It was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the theatre waiting for the royals, and I notice that the seat next to me is empty, and it's gradually becoming clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me," he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary "Back in Time."
The movie begins, and it comes to mind that I’m a simulated wrinkle and an arm’s length away from being on a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back in Time, a documentary about Back to the Future, features interviews with Fox, Lea Thompson and Christopher Lloyd, as well as with director Robert Zemeckis and producer Steven Spielberg.
“Back for the Future” premiered 30 years ago.
"It's really for me," Spielberg said, "unbelievably the greatest time travel film ever shot."
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in selected cinemas in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says his response to Russia's increased military support for Syria is: "There is no military solution" to the five-year conflict, and more weapons will only aggravate violence and misery for millions of people.
The head of the UN reiterated his call on all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the Council - the US, Russia, China, Britain and France - on the sidelines of the General Assembly's ministerial session later this month to discuss the situation in Syria.
He regretted that the divisions within the council and within the Syrian people and regional powers “make this situation insoluble.”
Ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they have shown in reaching a nuclear deal with Iran.
8 survey results that show that Donald Trump is to be taken seriously.
Some have tried to brand it as a flop.
Others rejected it as a joke.
Some are waiting for a collapse.
But no matter how some Republicans try to pull Donald Trump down from the top ranks in polls, it has (yet) not worked.
Ten of the last eleven national polls showed Donald Trump leads in the two-digit range, and some are beginning to seriously wonder what it means for the odds of nominating the real estate mogul.
It is still too early in the election period.
No one claims that Trump is likely to win the Republican nomination.
Experts emphasize that at that time in 2011, Rick Perry’s leadership was handed over to the rising Herman Cain, none of whom won a single state in the nomination process.
And there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election.
But outsider groups like Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Trump’s endurance and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him.
Here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a temporary phase:
Trump’s popularity has turned 180 degrees.
Shortly before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two out of ten Republicans saw the real estate mogul positively.
By mid-July it was 40 percent.
It was 52 percent at the beginning of August.
Now, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive view of Donald Trump.
About three out of ten say they have a negative opinion.
And these figures hold in early states.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans have a good opinion of Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy with Trump as a candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would be either “enthusiastic” or “satisfied” if Trump was nominated.
Only two out of 10 say they’d be “irritated” if he were the candidate.
Only Ben Carson creates roughly the same enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they’d be “enthusiastic” versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next about enthusiasm?
Marco Rubio with only 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republican voters say they would be “unhappy” or “irritated” if Jeb Bush, the establishment’s favorite, became the candidate.
A majority of Republicans do not see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
While Donald Trump is widely criticized for his bombastic and offensive statements, 52 percent of Republican-tendent Irish voters believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament for a president, ABC News/Washington Post on Monday.
The same figure is true in the nation’s first pre-election state, Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he has the personality for a commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he doesn’t have the personality to effectively perform his job, and six out of 10 independent respondents say his temperament doesn’t fit the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they set up their scholarship, Republican voters consider Trump to be real.
When asked who is most likely to win the GOP nomination, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week, four out of ten say Trump is the best bet.
That’s a change since four out of ten put their money on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full Disclosure: GOP voters did not have the clearest crystal ball in the past.
At this point in the last cycle, four out of ten Republicans thought Rick Perry would win the nomination against only 28% for the final candidate Mitt Romney.
Nevertheless, it turns out that a large number of GOP voters view Trump’s campaign as plausible.
Even if Republicans gathered around another candidate, Trump still beats almost everyone.
Some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to Trump’s leadership, while anti-Trump support is diffused across more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll in early September shows that in a hypothetical head-to-head race between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump gathers majority support.
He has 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It’s a head-to-head race with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to beat him?
Ben Carson would beat the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hypothetical head-to-head race.
A small majority of Donald Trump fans say they have formed their own opinion.
A new CBS/NYT poll on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Trump say they have given their votes firmly.
Of course, a lot can happen to change that, and no one can really say never to change their mind.
46 percent said they left the door open to switch to other candidates.
Still, Trump’s strongest competitor at the moment is the other outsider, neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they’ve formed their opinion are twice as likely for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “rape” in his campaign peace two months ago, immigration has been a turning point in public discourse to 2016.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic expression will keep crucial Hispano-Americans away from the Republican Party and damage reorientation efforts.
But according to Monday’s new ABC/Post poll, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration issues.
So as long as immigration remains in the spotlight, Donald Trump will appear to do so.
The frustration over the government is climbing to new highs.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now have about half of the support of Republican voters, mostly because of their outsider status.
Six out of 10 Republicans say in the new Monday poll by ABC/Post that they would rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
They are angry with Washington.
A poll by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago showed that three out of four Iowa Republicans are frustrated about the Republicans in Congress, with 54 percent “unsatisfied” and 21 percent “hellily upset.”
Munich, Sylt and Co.: the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
Here in the Hobookenweg is the most expensive residential building - overlooking the North Sea waters.
On the street, a square meter of a rabbit roof house costs an average of 73,300 euros.
"On Sylt, the supply of objects is naturally limited," says the study - hence the high price.
A new study shows in which particular locations a square meter costs the most.
Of course, 18.70 euros per square meter for a student bid in Munich is not really a little.
Unlike Germany’s top residential places, however, the price is like peanuts.
The real estate service provider Engel & Völkers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices at dizzying heights.
There are several tens of thousands of euros - per square meter, noteworthy.
Well, who can afford it...
In this case, Munich is not at the top.
Champions League: Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Götze
Two-time goalkeeper in Piraeus: Bayern star Thomas Müller has just a run.
A happy hit by Thomas Müller paved the way for FC Bayern to a well-deserved 3:0 at Olympiakos Piraeus - then it went.
A sovereign start to the Champions League season.
World champions Thomas Müller and Mario Götze have given FC Bayern a dream start to the "Mission Milan" in the Piraeus witch cage.
The team of coach Pep Guardiola won their opening game in the Champions League with the Greek record champion Olympiakos in a hot atmosphere thanks to Müller’s double pack (52/90+2) and Götze’s hit (89) earned 3:0 (0:0).
The twelfth start-up success in the series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28, 2016 in Italy, where Guardiola in the third run finally wants to get the Henkelpot to Munich.
In his 28th goal in the Champions League to lead Bayern, Müller received kind help from Olympiakos goalkeeper Roberto, who passed a flanking shot of the world champion.
"We will not underestimate them," Bayern captain Philipp Lahm had promised before the game in Karaiskakis Stadium in front of 31,688 hot-blooded fans - and the Munich kept the word.
They showed a concentrated and committed representation without shining.
Pireus had won his last six home games in the royal class, including against renowned clubs such as Manchester United, Atlético Madrid or Juventus Turin.
Borussia Dortmund also crashed in 2011 (1:3).
But the Bayern, unbeaten in seven European Cup duels with Greek teams, did not want to be the next victim.
They ran courageously, but in their offensive efforts often too inventively.
The attacks were too often initiated by leaving the game on the left side of Douglas Costa, who rarely managed against former Braunschweiger Omar Elabdellaoui.
Müller had more luck from the right when his flank hit from the right half of the field in the upper left wrist.
In the 67th minute, the world champion gave the possible 2-0.
The best chances in the first half were Robert Lewandowski.
First, when Olympiakos striker Ideye Brown hit the Polish headball off the line (26).
Then by direct withdrawal, the goalkeeper Roberto paried with the knee (35).
Although the Bavarians raised their usual dominant game, Piraeus was able to put needle bites.
The goalkeeper was Manuel Neuer.
For example, when he directed a shot of Ideye over the latte (56).
Before Neuer, Guardiola had a four-chain with David Alaba in the center defending next to Jerome Boateng, who did well.
Mario Götze, after muscular problems back in the frame, was initially sitting outside.
The world championship hero has only given the green light after the final training, said sports director Matthias Sammer to "Sky": "Whoever wants to make something different from it, that is already malicious."
Even in the first shift, Guardiola decided against him when he brought Kingsley Coman for the beaten Lewandowski (59).
Götze arrived late for Arturo Vidal (76), and made everything clear 13 minutes later, by eleven meters Müller put on another one.
Before the game there was a riot in the stadium.
After a smaller group of partly disguised Bayern fans in their spectator block apparently provoked the supporters of host Piräus with words and gestures, the security forces intervened and proceeded with strokes against the Munich supporters.
At least one Bayern supporter was injured after being transported from the stadium.
People who smoke have a higher risk of losing their teeth.
Those who smoke harm not only the lungs, but also the teeth - this is suggested by a long-term Potsdam study.
The good news is that withdrawal reduces the risk rapidly.
Smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early.
This is evidenced by a long-term study by an international research team, including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research (DIfE) in Potsdam.
Compared to non-smokers, smokers had a 2.5 to 3.6 times higher risk of premature tooth loss.
The researchers followed more than 23,300 participants.
The main causes of tooth loss are caries and inflammation of the gums, emphasizes the DIfE.
Smoking is a risk factor for this periodontitis, the authors emphasize.
The link between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more common gum inflammation among smokers.
It is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of caries.
People who quit smoking could reduce their risk within a short period of time, the researchers wrote in the Journal of Dental Research.
However, it could take more than ten years before the risk drops back to the level of non-smokers, first author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham explained.
One has to convince people to become non-smokers, said study leader Heiner Boeing of DIfE: "Smoking shortens life."
Not smoking is good for the lungs and vessels and, according to our findings, also leads to good dental health up to old age.
In Germany, more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years are affected by toothlessness, the DIfE.
Previous research has shown that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss.
The new long-term study supports the findings.
Archaeologists find remains from late antiquity on the Rhine coast of Cologne
Archaeological finds have been repeatedly made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne.
Near the construction site for the new Rheinboulevard, archaeologists at the Roman-German Museum have excavated skeletons and remains of historic buildings, said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday.
Since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine, historians have been looking for so-called land monuments.
In all construction projects in the city district of Cologne, the museum is always added as a specialist office for archaeological soil conservation.
In the third construction phase of the Rheinboulevard, the archaeologists were now found.
It was already known from text documents that there was a fortress in the 4th century and a church in the 8th century, Trier explained.
In addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower, a cemetery with about 350 graves was discovered, which probably belonged to the church.
Young woman caught by freight train
After a young woman crashes at the train station in Geilenkirchen-Lindern, the federal police are asking the population for help.
Early Wednesday morning, around 1.40 a.m., the woman crossed the railroad from the direction of the station building at the end of the railway and was caught by a freight train coming from the direction of Mönchengladbach.
By capturing the train, she suffered the most serious injuries, according to the federal police.
She was treated on the spot and brought to a hospital by rescue forces.
As to the cause of the young woman’s nightly crossing, the investigating officials do not have any findings.
The incident may have been observed by witnesses or residents may have heard acoustic perceptions.
Residents or passers of Linderner Bahn, Ziegelbäckerweg, Thomashofstraße and Leiffarther Straße (L364) are asked.
Information on the cause of the accident can be provided via the Federal Police’s free, round-the-clock hotline at 0800/6888000 or any other police station.
EU Commission proposes new court for TTIP dispute
To escalate the dispute over the planned transatlantic free trade agreement TTIP, the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbitration system.
The contested private arbitration bodies for disputes between corporations and states are therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system, which in its functioning corresponds to much more traditional courts.
“We want to establish a system that citizens trust,” said EU Commissioner Cecilia Malmström.
Sweden intends to include the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the United States.
The German government announced its support.
TTIP will create the world’s largest free trade zone with 800 million people.
The plans to reform the current arbitration proceedings specifically provide that EU countries and the U.S. jointly select independent judges for a new investment court.
They should come in equal proportions from the EU, the United States and third countries.
For the first time, a second instance is also planned.
It would allow to appeal against judgments.
So far, the parties to the proceedings agreed on arbitrators, there was no possibility of appeal against their judgments.
The discussion over the past months has made it clear that citizens did not trust the old ISDS system in matters of fairness and justice, Malmström commented.
In the long run, it wants to work towards an International Investment Court.
In this case, disputes between Chinese companies and EU countries could also be resolved.
The Investor-State Arbitration (ISDS), which is mostly demanded by large corporations, is considered to be one of the main reasons for the strong opposition in Europe to TTIP.
Traditional arbitration courts are criticized by opponents as a kind of parallel justice through which companies can claim damages at the expense of taxpayers, override national laws, or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards.
In initial opinions, anti-TTIP organizations such as Campact called the proposals of the EU Commission inadequate.
They were criticized in particular for not applying to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada (CETA).
German Economy Secretary Matthias Machnig (SPD) described the plans as great progress.
The Commission takes into account the key points drawn up by German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel in the spring with other EU trade ministers.
The old system of private arbitration courts is out of the table.
The French government also welcomed the plans of Malmström.
The European business association BusinessEurope warned against limiting the lawsuits opportunities of the business by too many new rules.
Especially small and medium-sized could be disadvantaged by this.
When the negotiations on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) can be concluded remained unclear on Wednesday.
The negotiations have been ongoing since mid-2013.
The issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the United States.
Initially, a framework for the agreement should be in place by the end of this year.
This date is no longer sustainable.
Delicate People by Sufjan Stevens in Hamburg
Eleven years ago, Sufjan Stevens was on stage at the Cologne Prime Club (now Luxor).
Next to him is a flipchart on which the shy folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan with a pencil.
The entire audience, about 40 people, is almost captured by Steven’s lecture.
He tells from different places, which he repeatedly records on the map, about which his minutious and gently arranged songs report.
Where they came from and what it looks like there, in his homeland.
Since then, Stevens has proved to be a wonderfully creative madman.
With the 2003 and third album "Greetings from Michigan: The Great Lake State" appear cleverly composed songs that harmoniously smuggle very close to American folk of the late sixties, but can at any time drift into super opulent.
There is a rumor that "Michigan" would be the first part of a twisted series: each of the 50 U.S. states would be sung in a row.
However, already in 2004 and near the Rhine, "Seven Swans" has already appeared and breaks positive certain expectations.
Stevens comes down here.
He has guitar and banjo.
A year later, the New York-based musician returns to the series.
With "Illinois" ("Sufjan Stevens Invites You To: Come on Feel The Illinoise") a masterpiece was released in 2005.
Overflowing with ideas and stylistic finesse.
The album climbs into the American Billboard charts and is not missing in any of the year's best lists of influential music media.
After extremely productive experiments, Stevens then uses very extensive electronic shift pieces on "The Age of Adz" (2010) .
This sixth decent studio album is still widely orchestrated, but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and halls.
Long ago out of the smaller clubs, the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle of neon stripes and large fluorescent stage deco.
Currently, Sufjan Stevens is touring Germany as part of a five-person band.
More hamburger in the dark!
In theaters, he presents mainly "Carrie & Lowell", which has been available since March.
Although there are now almost 2,000 guests sitting in their chairs, the significantly more mature Stevens is returning to intimacy and folk.
Without addressing a word to the audience, the group of excellent musicians plays through the widely enriched album.
From the audience you hear: the lecture is "popular" and you can thus "throw the record basically away".
To one addition, Stevens thanks modestly, acoustically plays a few older songs, and eventually bows under tossing applause.
Jeremy Corbyn's debut at Prime Minister's Question Hour
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn’s debut at the Prime Minister’s Question Hour is expected with excitement
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is scheduled to make his debut at the Prime Minister’s Question Hour and meet for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will stand up to ask the first of his six prearranged questions shortly after lunch, with his performance likely to be checked closely by the media and Labour MPs.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" at this weekly event.
He also said he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues.
The meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Corbyn’s leadership, as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cabinet and after his speech at the TUC Annual Meeting on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader’s decision to remain silent on Tuesday while singing the national anthem at a commemoration ceremony commemorating the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain has provoked criticism from a number of Tory MPs and is at the center of several front-page stories in newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn’s decision not to sing the national anthem has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he had "standed in respectful silence" and he recognized the "heroism of the Royal Air Force in the air battle for England."
But a member of Mr Corbyn’s shadow cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC’s Two Newsnight program that he had advised the Labour leader to sing the national anthem “regardless” of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Corbyn’s top team, citing differences in business, defense and foreign policy, while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party originally supported him as a leader.
BBC Political Correspondent Robin Brant says political differences are also “accumulating” within Labour, following Mr. Corbyn’s statements about the position on the European Union and the limitation of profits.
Mr. Corbyn told the TUC conference that Labour is proposing amendments to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall.
Hours later, Mr. Smith, the Shadow Labour and Pension Minister, said the party was “very clear” that it was only against the government’s plans to lower the limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader to face David Cameron over the dispatch box in parliament over the past decade, since he has been the leader of the Tory.
The Labour leader, who promised a different policy approach, says he has "crowd-sourced" ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and he has been given more than 30,000 suggestions.
The Islington North MP has said that the prime minister’s question hour is too confrontational, and that he will refrain from both “strike skill” and fighting with hiccups and has instead set out to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn has said that Angela Eagle, the Shadow Economy Minister, will represent him if he does not attend - for example, if Mr. Cameron is traveling abroad.
He also introduced the idea that other colleagues occasionally take the word, and that he addressed John Bercow, the House spokesman, to discuss the issue.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to move away from politics in the style of a "Kasperle Theatre", often associated with the prime minister's question hour.
Since it was first broadcast on television in 1990, the question hour with the prime minister was seen as the main barometer of a leader’s judgment and his leadership in the House of Commons and his position among his parliamentary counterparts, although critics have argued it has become a caricature and needs far-reaching reforms.
'Shoot in Joburg': Homeless youths trained to be photographers
The city centre of Johannesburg is a tough place when you are homeless.
But a group of former street children have found a way to learn a skill and thus make a living.
“I was shot in Joburg” is a non-profit studio that teaches homeless young people how to take photos of their surroundings and make a profit from them.
BBC News met one of the first graduates of the project.

Pound rises due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
The pound rose sharply after data showing a rise in UK wage growth.In parallel, the FTSE 100 was raised by the SABMiller bid target.
Between May and July, the bonus-free earnings in the UK grew by 2.9% compared to the same period of the previous year.
This percentage was the fastest since 2009 and the most estimated at the time of an interest rate increase.
The pound rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505 and climbed to €1,3730 against the euro to 0.84%.
The FTSE 100 index closed with an increase of 1.49% to 6.229,21.
SABMiller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a 20% jump after receiving an offer of acquisition from rival AB InBev.
A transaction would combine the two largest breweries in the world and bring together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares were up 0.9% according to encouraging news from the competing luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont’s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China – a key market for Burberry – are reporting growth again.
Glencore’s shares rose by 5 percent after the miner said he raised $2.5 billion through a share sale as part of his debt reduction strategy.
The shares of the packaging and paper group Mondi were the biggest losers on the index, falling by 4.3 percent after Goldman Sachs put its rating for the company on "sell".
JD Sports increased by 3.1% after the sportswear company a pre-tax profit of 46.6 million for the six months.
The head of JD Sports says higher wages are putting expansion at risk.
JD Sports CEO Peter Cowgill says a higher minimum wage for UK employees could mean “more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers.”
But it’s unlikely that this purchasing power will offset the higher labor costs at his company, he says.
The cost could hit JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, and that could mean there are fewer additional jobs.
Justin Bieber in the capital: on Bieber Expedition in Berlin
Justin Bieber and Megastar.
Leppische 21 years young, a handful with an upper-sized frise.
The guy with the platinum blond hair weighs 100 million euros.
Rather even more.
Mr. Bieber is currently in Berlin.
The U17 generation is moving forward.
Just like Viktoria Rudzinska.
The 15-year-old has never heard the name "Ritz Carlton".
not badly .
Hundreds of fans accompanied Justin yesterday.
Ewa and Victoria from Poland.
Since 7 a.m., however, the Polin has been sitting on the cold stone plates of the Berliner Luxushotel on Potsdamer Platz.
The Bieber Building: Here you live idol whose posters have been hanging in Stettin since Monday night.
The suite, in which the Canadian singer lives, costs exactly as much per day as her mom Ewa earns in six months.
If at all.
She says, “In fact, my Victoria should be sitting in the 10th grade in high school.”
“I will fulfill her a dream.”
The school obligation?
Who is it?
The fans not.
Not even Bieber himself.
He gave up anyway.
For the ads in the Superbow’s advertising break, he made three million dollars, and a two-year deal with an anti-pickel company sprinkled many, many dollars into Bieber’s account.
And with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter, Bieber is also cashing.
When Justin Bieber drinks a cup of coffee, you’re stunned at the window.
He allegedly stole more than 100 million.
Some say the hype goes too far.
Others emphasize that Bieber is finally in the U.S. and UK with his new single "What do you mean?" at number one.
Bieber himself, whose fourth album is scheduled to follow in November, is not interested in the many zeroes at first.
At least he does so.
Pegida Poster Brings Lebanese to Potato Dinner Idea
Potatoes or Döner?
Both are possible – in the potato tuner, which was developed by Oldenburg’s snack owner Hani Alhay.
Inspired by the phrase “potato instead of Döner” on a poster of the Pegida movement, Alhay has put potatoes and meat together on a spit.
The idea brought him a poster at a Pegida demonstration with the inscription "potatoes instead of Döner", which he had accidentally seen on television.
Since then, there has been a barbecue in his store, packed with meat and potatoes.
“This is a multiculturalism for the stomach,” Alhay says.
The idea has now been registered with the Patent Office in Munich.
There, according to the authority, it has recently been protected as a usage model.
Therefore, how much meat and how much potatoes the spit contains, Alhay does not want to reveal.
Just so much: “It tastes even better together,” he finds.
Its customers also have a good international culinary understanding.
Metcash Launches Ground Stability Campaign to Combat Aldi Invasion
Metcash is trying to protect the IGA branches from an Aldi rise in South Australia and Western Australia.
Food wholesaler Metcash has launched a ground-stability campaign to defend the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a $700 million Aldi invasion.
As Aldi prepares to open two distribution centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening their relationships with local food suppliers and building the IGA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media, as well as through events such as the Adelaide Show.
IGA dealers and suppliers are jumping on board, with brands like Dunsborough ice cream maker Simmo, who distributes samples in IGA stores, and store owners who sell endorsed tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers.
Metcash is expected to release further details of its defense strategy on September 29, as the wholesaler for food, alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investor strategy day.
Much is at stake as South Australia and Western Australia account for 30 percent of Metcash’s IGA store trades and generate higher profit margins than Metcash’s IGA network in the Eastern States.
Buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are notoriously provincial and IGA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland – more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the Eastern states.
However, analysts like Morgan Stanley believe Aldi will take away about five percent of the food market in these two states 12 months after opening its first markets, taking away sales from all existing players, but mostly independent retailers.
According to a report released this week, Morgan Stanley analyst Tom Kierath estimated that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales per year and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
This forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year, generating sales of $500 million and $600 million in each market.
The loss in the food and food business and in the amounts on Metcash’s high fixed cost base could cost Metcash around $13 million in profit before interest and taxes, Mr. Kierath said.
At the same time, Metcash is losing market shares in the Eastern states, mainly to Aldi and Coles, although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that IGA buyers are the most loyal.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash’s food and food sales will drop by 3.8 percent in 2016, by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018, and will reduce its market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, top fund manager Hamish Douglass, the founder of Magellan Financial Group, told a business dinner in Melbourne that Metcash is likely to disappear within a decade.
Metcash refused to publicly respond to Mr. Douglass’s comments.
But it is assumed that a member of the Metcash board contacted Mr. Douglass last week.
IGA’s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010, and revenues from Metcash’s food and food trade, which supplies approximately 1,200 IGA retailers, have dropped by 43 percent since 2012, reflecting operational debt reduction while simultaneously putting pressure on revenue and margins.
The wholesaler, however, resists and invests more than $150 million to match sales prices with Coles and Woolworths on hundreds of products each week, improving IGA retailers in improving their stores by growing fresh food faster and delivering a better selection of private-label foods.
Metcash chief executive Ian Morrice says price adjustments and store repair programs will add to Elan and hopes the wholesaler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years.
Thanasi Kokkinakis is supported by Australian Tennis Association President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves more praise than criticism for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was one of the "collateral injuries" in the recent storm surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves more praise than criticism for his own behavior, according to the president of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo, repeatedly referred to as "Special Ks", came to light by Kyrgios's infamous confrontation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
In a fierce qualifying game in Cincinnati shortly thereafter, Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison had to be separated twice by the referee, with Harrison shouting out, "Wawrinka should have beaten Kyrgios, and I should beating the child."
While he was last seen crushing a tennis pit after a crash disrupted a potential US Open victory by Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Groth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-final against Britain.
“One thing I’m pretty upset about is the fact that, in my opinion, Thanasi was a bit involved in the fight,” Healy said.
He broke a beat when he lost because of a cramp at the US Open, but he’s not the first player to break a beat with himself out of frustration, and I know Thanasi well enough to know he’s not proud of it.
But, really, he has behaved extremely well in the US Open, even under the rather provocative circumstances with Harrison and so on, and I think he deserves a lot of recognition.
He has a great team around him, he has a great family around him, and I think he’s been treated a bit too severely.
He’s a very mature 19-year-old, he’s working very hard, and he fits into the team and so on, he’s never had a problem with the other players before, he’s respected in dressing, he’s training hard, he’s in good shape, he’s a very stable and mature young guy, and I think he deserves to be judged by his own merits.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into account in the important preliminary decision that begins on Friday, and he describes the “joint decision” as the right one for all, but he assures the Canberra man to return to the team as a long-term fixed part.”
“First, we want the team to be fully focused on the competition and not on all the controversies around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick has made the rise very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray have pointed out. He rises in the eyes of the public, and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets, but we try to support him, we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions.
European refugee crisis: Hungary declares state of emergency, closes its border, holds refugees back
Hungary declared a state of emergency and shut down the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and arrested all who tried to illegally enter the country.
Chaos followed at the border as hundreds of migrants gathered in a no-one country and Serbian officials reacted with indignation.
People fleeing violence were stuck for an unknown period of time in a strip of land on the road between the two checkpoints of the countries and built tents and settled there.
But the frustration increased.
As a police helicopter floated over them, the migrants shouted “Open the border!” and shouted insults against the Hungarian emergency police.
Some refused food and water for protest.
Serbia’s foreign minister said it was “unacceptable” that migrants were being sent back from Hungary, while more and more arrived from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution and not a collateral damage.
Talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days," Dacic said in Prague.
The turmoil on the Hungarian-Serbian border came a day after the 28-nation bloc failed to agree on a common immigration policy at a controversial meeting in Brussels.
However, the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in overcrowded Italy and Greece.They expressed their hope that eventually - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that EU countries would receive another 120,000 refugees, including some from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday called for a special European Union summit to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent.
However, Hungary did not put its hopes on a soon-to-be action from Brussels or its neighbors.
The state of emergency declared on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis, allowing them to shut down roads and speed up asylum procedures.
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto, meanwhile, said that his country also plans to build a barbed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influx of migrants through the country – after it has completed a fence on the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie D'Agata that even prisoners were employed in the race to create the stitch wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a significant gaps and a point of entry to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East.
But Prime Minister Viktor Orban has insisted that most of the arrivals are economic refugees who are looking for a better life, not war refugees who are entitled to protection – a view that is heavily contradicted by other EU countries, including Germany.
The new laws, which came into force at midnight in Hungary, make crossing the border or damaging the 4-meter (13 foot) high fence that the government had built along the southern border to Serbia a crime.
"Due to the situation created by the mass migration, the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency," government spokesman Zoltan Kovacs told reporters in the southern city of Szeged.
We say it very clearly: Illegal border crossing is a crime.
Parliament has yet to approve the military deployment, which is expected for next week, but Associated Press reporters have seen heavily armed soldiers carrying vehicles and dogs on the border for days.
Gyorgy Bakondi, Orban’s national security adviser, said authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border, 15 others had already penetrated deeper into the country.
They come across by damaging the fence, they are now in police custody and are accused of committing crimes under the new laws.
Authorities are working to repair the fence quickly.
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossing points with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wagon had arrived to close the border.
Chaos surrounded the main border crossing near Roszke, Hungary, when the Hungarians opened a small office in a metal container to process people’s data and pushed a crowd into it.
About 20 managed to enter, but thousands remained outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they were allowed to enter Hungary.
2016 Elections: Hillary Clinton's Advance Over Bernie Sanders Halved in National Survey
Former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for nomination at the national level, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins against her on the ground.
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of Democratic voters in the preliminary election (58 percent earlier), while Sanders is second with 27 percent (a 17 percent increase).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for the presidency, receives the support of 15 percent of the Democratic pre-election voters.
More than five months before the start of the primary elections, most Democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is firm on which candidate they will support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll, Clinton has lost in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders has made some gains.
Clinton holds a large advantage among women and moderates, but these advances have diminished.
Their support among the men has dropped significantly, and Sanders is down here with only 5 points.
Clinton’s advantage over Democratic voters under the age of 50 has flattened, and she and Sanders are now on the same level.
But Clinton still has a big advantage over the elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton was ahead of Sanders with a two-digit advance over the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point advance over that group.
About half of Democratic pre-election voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she was nominated by the party.
A quarter would support her with some reservations and another 15 percent would support her just because she is the candidate.
6% would not support it.
Per not surprisingly, Clinton’s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her.
The views are more mixed among those who currently don’t support Clinton – only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic pre-election voters say they support Clinton with enthusiasm, fewer Republican voters say so about their top candidate Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked in an open question why they want her to be the candidate, the most common answer is that she has the right experience (16 percent), followed by the view that it is time for a woman to become president (13 percent) and that she is the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton’s supporters also mentioned her connection with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Consent to dealing with the problems and selectivity are also cited.
As the vice president throws a potential for the presidential office into the scale, 57 percent of pre-election Democratic voters would like to see him in the race — although one-third believe he shouldn’t.
When Democratic pre-election voters are asked who would be their second choice for the party, Biden is at the top.
More than half of Clinton supporters say Biden would be their second choice far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders will increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him in the race.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chances of winning the election; however, this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month.
Biden is far from a second in this measurement, but the percentage that considers him the "most eligible" has risen.
Nevertheless, when asked what is more important to a candidate, Democratic voters call questions about eligibility.
Similar to last month, no Democratic candidate or potential candidate stands out for these pre-election voters as unacceptable.
The Democratic candidates or potential candidates perform well on some key characteristics among voters of their party’s preliminary elections.
The majority consider Clinton, Sanders, and Biden to be honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities.
Biden scores best in honesty among the three candidates, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many say that about Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no opinion about him.
Democratic pre-election voters also generally see Clinton, Sanders, and Biden ideologically in line with their views.
In all these measurements, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders.
As questions about Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email address and a server during her term as Secretary of State continue to be asked, most pre-election Democratic voters are satisfied with their statement on the matter, saying it hasn’t affected their views overall.
But it’s a different story in the American public as a whole.
Half of Americans are now dissatisfied with their statement, while only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion on this was divided in March, shortly after the problem came to light.
Most Americans said the email controversy had no impact on their general opinions of Clinton, although 36 percent said their opinion of her has worsened.
It’s mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, who say their views of Clinton have gotten worse.
Although Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by voters of her party, this remains a problem for them among registered voters overall: Only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy, eight percent less than last month, and 15 points less since May.
62% of voters do not consider them to be honest and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 percent of voters across the country also view Trump as unfair and untrustworthy.
But Clinton and Trump get good grades in leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush cut the best in honesty.
A majority consider Sanders to be more honest, but like Carson, many have no opinion of him.
The error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters in the primary elections is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in national polls
Ben Carson is close behind Donald Trump in the latest CBS News/New York Times poll
The two candidates are now losing half of the voter’s support in the new poll, and others are losing dramatically.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in large numbers, growing from 23% in the latest CBS poll, which was conducted before Fox News debate last month, to 27% in the poll of Tuesday.
But Carson jumped from 6% to 23% over the same period.
The survey also found that Carson gets well in demographic groups and outperforms Trump among Republican voters with higher education.
The rest of the field, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, has been defeated with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who has fallen the lowest, from 10% support last month to now 2%.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are third with 6%.
The error margin in the sample of 376 individuals of Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6% and was carried out in September.
The latest CNN/ORC poll, released last week, shows that Carson is rising in polls – he ends up with 19% support among Republicans, behind Trump with 32% support.
The recent poll by ABC News/Washington Post also showed Trump clearly ahead of Carson.
Looking at an upcoming Carson last week, Trump found some sidewraps for the former neurosurgeon even after Carson apologized for questioning Trump’s belief.
"We need energy," Trump said last Saturday during a campaign appearance in Iowa.
Pleasant bathing temperatures: The eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees.
Even though peak values are only measured in the distance, a trip to the Mediterranean Sea is enough for swimming holidaymakers to find warm water.
A bath in the North Sea or the Baltic Sea is likely to be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees.
Some are no longer going to the sea: the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week, the German Weather Service (DWD) reports.
Bathing temperatures, on the other hand, continue to offer the Mediterranean: in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees.
It is 25 degrees in the Adriatic and 23 degrees in France.
The Red Sea in Egypt rises to 28 degrees.
Five Brotherhood members charged with the death of a Baruch college newbie
Nearly two years after a student died during a bullying ritual at a student association in Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania, murder charges are filed against five people.
Members of New York's Baruch College Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood brutally attacked Chun "Michael" Deng during an introductory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transportation to the hospital, which contributed to his death, police said.
Officials said he had been loaded with closed eyes with a 30-pound backpack full of sand, and had been repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target across a frozen field.
Mr. Deng eventually complained of headaches, then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi-Delta-Psi Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Deng became impotent and allegedly waited an hour before taking him to a hospital, police said.
However, they had time to change Deng's clothes, google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the Brotherhood, to seek advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a news conference.
"At this point, the members began to hide utensils and put the well-being of the brotherhood above that of Michael Deng," said police chief Wagner.
He could not be revived, and he died the next morning from his injuries.
Following an autopsy report, Deng was repeatedly injured with silent force in the head, trunk and thighs.
"Too many families have been destroyed by the harassment of the brotherhood. at least one student dies from the harassment every year since 1970," Douglas Fierberg, a lawyer representing Deng's family, said in a statement.
Brotherhood and its members must be held accountable, and this step by authorities is very important.
A County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended a third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two members of the Brotherhood, including Mr Meng, are also charged with harassment attacks and the formation of a criminal association.
“We want to hold not only the people involved accountable, but if there is an organization that – officially or unofficially – has sanctioned this, we will hold them accountable,” Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday.
The Baruch College has banned the Brotherhood, and the National Brotherhood has revoked its belonging to the local group.
This will happen if the Fed raises interest rates
An increase in interest rates will come, and the rise will swing, yields on bonds will rise, and the economy will slide into a recession.
We know that.
What we do not know is how long this all will last and how long it will last.
In particular, history provides little guidance for the economy.
A recession came within just 11 months of the first interest rate hike and lasted 86 months.
The Federal Reserve’s aggressiveness in raising interest rates is often, if not always, a factor in how the economy and financial investments react.
That’s why representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it starts raising interest rates, but rather on the time needed for normalization.
In fact, several variables play a role.
In the end, however, market participants might find that all the excitement over an interest rate hike may have been exaggerated.
“The Fed’s first increase since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of ‘cheap money’,” Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, said in a statement to customers.
In contrast, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal heights, but still at levels too low to lead to the seismic shock that many seem to fear.
However, this does not mean that there will be no effects.
Here is a look based on historical trends on how some sectors of the economy could react:
As the market has seen over the past month, anticipating interest rate increases can make things volatile for a while.
Once the increase comes, the impact is not so dramatic.
"There appears to be a tendency that asset revenues are slashing 12 to 24 months after the first increase, which may again reflect the delay in monetary policy," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what happens after Fed interest rate increases.
More specifically, the market is mostly on the uptrend over the past 35 years — about 14 percent — on the path to interest rate increases, fairly flat in the 250 days afterwards (average gain of 2.6 percent), then back to normal after 500 days, with an average return over the past six cycles of 14.4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob Doll, chief investment strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, at Barron’s.
Deutsche Bank said the impact on stocks tends to occur later in the increase cycle and the yield begins to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but interest rate increases often encourage them.
In the current case, the Fed is facing some conditions that did not exist before and that could accelerate a recession.
Very remarkable here is that the gross domestic product will be close to its lowest point when the Fed raises interest rates.
According to Deutsche Bank, in the 118 interest rate increases since 1950, the nominal GDP was only twice below 4.5 percent.
Although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent, few expect it to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Rate increases in such a fragile economic setting could be risky and raise the question "whether it will be different this time," Deutsche Bank said.
Market participants have been focusing on a Fed interest rate hike all year round, and all eyes have been on the Federal Open Market Committee meeting this week that ends on Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could approve an increase in this session, the futures trade only gives a 25 percent probability.
“In our study, all growth cycles from 1950 to the present day have taken place in a super-cycle with increasing GDP momentum and shadowed pre-recession heights very quickly after the start of recovery,” the report said.
In contrast, this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase.
The current cycle is by far the longest the Fed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and this is 74 months so far.
Fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an interest rate rise, and the pattern is pretty similar to that of the capital market.
The main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than on stocks when they change their strategic course.
In bonds, yields appear to change direction as soon as the first increase/decrease occurs in the cycle.
At the end of the increase cycle, bond yields drop immediately, Deutsche Bank said.
Charles Schwab’s strategists believe that the rise in interest rates will cause returns between longer and shorter bonds to come closer together and lead to a flattening of the curve.
High-interest bonds often bring better returns in such a climate, although “we’re still cautious to expect higher returns,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab, in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adjusted to Fed’s strategic expectations.
“In addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are some signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy,” she wrote.
Short-term interest rates have risen, the yield curve is flat, credit margins have expanded and volatility has risen – all features of the market as the Fed tightenes its strategy.
Overall, companies that operate most of their business in the U.S. will benefit from rising interest rates and increasing the attractiveness of local products.
High-debted multinationals will be worse off as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market, as is the financing of their debt.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate hike,” Goldman Sachs analysts said in a customer report.
Companies with a strong balance sheet surpassed companies with a weak balance sheet by an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004.
Companies with high capital returns and low volatility in their stocks also outperformed their low-quality counterparts by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
Debt becomes a big problem.
Companies with a high percentage of flexible interest rates will lose the most, Goldman said.
Outside the pure stock games, consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar.
Savers might see profits from higher returns, even though experts differ on how quickly that will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative member of parliament criticized the broadcaster for its "dumbness"
He argues that he is increasingly indistinguishable from commercial rivals.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, saying they only mimicked The Brits
Parliamentary colleague Damien Collins attacked The Voice and said it wasn’t very original.
BBC Radio 3 "transforms" into Classic FM, claims to be a leading MP and increases new pressure on the station, proving that it does something that the private stations don't do.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC boss that the public-right radio station is "dirty" and increasingly indistinguishable from its commercial competitors.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word "dumb" - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM," he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, which began last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, seem to be The Brits just under a different name.
So, if you’re trying to do something different – these are two spontaneously mentioned examples where you’re actually just imitating what’s already on the market,” Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC director-general rejected the allegations, arguing that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and public education.
What I learn from Radio 3 I won’t learn from classical music anywhere else.
And there’s a commitment to live music and music making that’s truly unrivalled.
“And I think Radio 3’s commitment to finding new music and ordering new works is really important,” he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Davey argued that it was necessary to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music.
However, Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production to be fired during the hearing in the Committee on the Selection of Culture, Media and Sport to step on the foot of the commercial rival.
Tory MP Damien Collins attacked The Voice – the BBC musical talent show that was bought by Dutch producer Talpa Media for an estimated £22 million.
Do you see why this program is often discussed because it’s not original and not striking?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show – with Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges – was produced “in a special BBC way.”
He added that he hopes the company will “find a hit from our home stall” the next time it launches an entertainment series.
However, he refused to rule out ordering more series of The Voice in the future or spending the payers’ money on other entertainment formats.
Internet sales rose slowest in August and Black Friday may be responsible
In the first three months of 2015, there was a seven percent increase in online sales.
Last month had the lowest result since the start of records in 2000
Online sales increased three years ago due to the use of mobile phones for shopping
Experts believe Black Friday has slowed spending in November
For over a decade, virtual shopping has boomed, and many of Britain’s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities.
But experts say there are now signs that online sales are stagnating, after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015.
Total spending for August showed the lowest growth since the start of records in 2000, with only five percent increase over the previous year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are stagnating after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000, that has always evolved over time," said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG Sales Index to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales intensified three years ago as buyers started making purchases with their phones.
It meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments, such as at home on the couch.
But now that’s swinging in, and we’ll probably see growth slowing down.
The Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for declining sales.
Experts believe that buyers will hold back their purchases before this event, which takes place each on the last Friday in November.
Last year, the average number of buyers crashed five times around their computers to make their deals, and some merchant websites crashed.
Experts believe that Black Friday, where buyers fought for bargaining, could prevent buyers from making purchases.
A study by the British Retail Consortium found that out of £5 spending, just over £1 was spent online.
For some products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than a third of purchases are now made through web shops.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online rather than at the fashion chains in the downtown.
Muslims buried those killed in the crane accident in Mecca - Bin Laden's family is sanctioned
The bodies of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims at the first funerals in Mecca
Saudi Arabia Charges Partly the Collapse of the Giant Saudi Bin Laden Group
The Ministry of Health said a total of 394 people were injured after the crane crashed.
Hundreds of Muslims gathered as 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane crashed into the Grand Mosque of Mecca.
Lamenters, largely dressed in white, filled the track to show their respect when the first of the dead embarked on their final journey to Al-Moaissem Cemetery.
The mourning procession passed at the Holy Place, where only days earlier a construction crane fell through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the praying.
The bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi king imposed a sanction over the bin Laden family’s construction company over the disaster, which also left 394 injured.
The bodies of 29 beggars who were killed when a crane crashed through the Great Central Mosque of Mecca were carried through the streets.
Among the dead was Qasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, a father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane crashed down.
Mr. Akram was with his parents in the Great Mosque before the beginning of the annual hadj.
Saudi officials have already firmly promised that the hadith to Mecca will continue with thousands who will continue to come to the city.
King Salman said today that the bin Laden group should not have stopped the arm of the crane when it was not used.
An Arabic version of the decree, released by the state Saudi Press Agency, said the Bin Laden group was co-responsible for the collapse.
The news agency’s English-language service did not report this detail, but said that the company’s management is prohibited from travelling abroad.
Earlier this week, Salman vowed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into an inner courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered before the Hadesh, which will take place later this month.
The Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements about the collapse of De Krans, and its representatives were not available to comment.
The Royal Decree also blamed the group for not taking up-to-date security measures and for not cooperating with meteorologists.
Dozens of cranes surrounded Mecca’s Grand Mosque as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden group.
The Bin Laden family has been linked to the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and is taking over larger construction projects.
The deceased leader of Al Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a rebellious son who was expropriated by the family in the 1990s.
The crash of the crane came amidst strong winds and rain, just days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslim.
Officials said 158 people remained in the hospital.
Government officials ordered that 1 million rials (£174,000) be paid to the relatives of the dead and the same amount to permanently injured.
The other injured receive half of that amount.
B&Q Boss says the time of cheap Eastern European craftsmen is over
Britons are increasingly hiring craftsmen, says Veronique Laury
The number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
This leads to the opening of 200 additional Screwfix stores targeting craftsmen
At the same time, Kingfisher will close 60 B&Q stores nationwide
Rupert Steiner, City chief correspondent for the Daily Mail
It is claimed that the British lay down their hammer and brushes in favor of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen who perform the work in their home.
If you can skillfully handle a hammer or brush to stain walls, you seem to belong to a minority these days.
Brits are increasingly hiring craftsmen to do homework in their homes, according to the head of the company behind B&Q.
Véronique Laury, the new CEO of Kingfisher, who owns the building market chain, said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at low prices is now outdated.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open 200 additional Screwfix shops aimed at craftsmen and close 60 B&Q stores.
Mrs. Laury said she wants to employ more women in B&Q shops, as eight out of ten shopping decisions in the store are made by women.
At the moment, employees are predominantly men.
She said it is necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households doing more renovations than in the past.
Mrs. Laury said, “There’s still a majority of men working in our branches.
We need to move this more toward a balance.
Basically, half of our customers are women with 80 percent of the purchasing decisions made by women.
Women play a major role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laury, who is one of only five women at the top of a UK leading company listed in the FTSE100 Index, has also restructured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions.
Kingfisher is almost the only company to have exactly 50 percent of the team made up of women, including its management and financial board.
Mrs. Laury said, “This was a conscious decision – diversity is an important issue here.
It was not difficult to find good women for our board.
Kingfisher a decline in half-year earnings and revenue after the group borne the cost of closing the stores.
Because of the trend, Kingfisher, which owns Screwfix and B&Q, will open 200 new stores.
Aich/Dob officials prosecuted for infidelity
In Klagenfurt on Wednesday, two officials of the Austrian volleyball vice champion Aich/Dob had to be held accountable for disloyalty and tax evasion.
The accused acknowledged no guilt.
One of them was also charged with abuse of office.
He was acquitted of this charge in May.
The current process has been postponed.
According to Chief Prosecutor Robert Riffel, the preliminary investigation revealed that the defendants in the years 2006 to 2011 used funds from association accounts, over which they were allowed to dispose in their functions, for private purposes.
The damage is estimated at around 400,000 euros.
The sports officials are also charged with financial offences.
This fact was dismissed by the chairman of the Senate, Judge Michaela Sanin.
It will be negotiated at a later date.
As a charge of infidelity, the defense stated that the association had not at any time suffered any disadvantage.
The sports officials had only charged compensation and removed the sports club, for which they worked from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money, from the debts - the liabilities amounted to around 600,000 shillings (i.e. 44,000 euros) in 2001.
"At that time we were faced with the situation: will we continue to lead the club or will we shut down it?" said one of the defendants, in the profession of large-scale auditor of the tax office.
Together with his colleague and co-accused, he decided to take on this task.
With all risks.
“We fired money in advance, put our life insurance as collateral at the bank,” he said.
It has been agreed with the association: you can manage the money freely, there can only be no debts.
Furthermore, in the event of a corresponding financial success, the payment of expenditure compensation was decided retroactively until 1991.
Therefore, part of the expenditure compensation was not paid until years later, namely from 2003, when a plus was on the account.
Therefore, package and not detailed billing also appeared, the former obmann explained the processes.
The accounts and savings books were managed jointly by the two defendants, the second accused said.
Why were the payments not disclosed to the association in detail, the judge asked.
The association was not interested in the details of the financial payment, only the debt freedom was important, according to the answer.
When in 2011 an investigation began against one of the officials for abuse of office, an amount of 120,000 euros was transferred to the association account.
This was the case, the accused said.
This investment account ran on the name of the second defendant and was not known to the association, according to his statement.
“Why?” the judge asked.
The respondent did not know the answer for a long time.
He then said he believed that this was the best for the club.
If anything had happened to him, no one would have known anything about that money, the prosecutor put in the room.
The accused was informed, the officer justified himself.
This transfer was formulated as "denial of damages".
“Why damages?” asked the judge and the prosecutor.
The first accused stated that he did not agree with this statement because the association had never suffered any damage.
But what should I do if the lawyer says, “With this you’re all out of the carpenter.”
“Am I a legal representative?” he asked.
Furthermore, the official said he never received a penny salary, he only charged kilometers and diets.
He charged the club 1,000 euros per month for diets, but the actual cost was much higher, he added.
Accurate documents for the early years were not available to the defendants.
These were no longer kept after an operating audit in which everything was assessed as correct, they explained.
The second accused was also charged kilometers.
All corrections were made in cash, so he had to go from his place of residence Völkermarkt to the bank to Bleiburg, he explained in his statement.
The hearing will continue on September 23 with the hearing of witnesses.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
In addition to the personnel cuts that have been ongoing for three years, the computer giant will also cut off more jobs when the company is split up.
The job cuts at the U.S. computer giant Hewlett-Packard (HP) are not ending.
The U.S. technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its customer division as part of its restructuring.
This will save $2.7 billion ($2.4 billion) in costs, the company said on Tuesday.
The move will result in a special burden of approximately $2.7 billion, which will apply from the fourth quarter.
The cut of 55,000 jobs that has been ongoing for three years has not yet been completed.
HP still had around 302,000 employees at the end of the 2013/14 financial year.
In the aftermath, Hewlett-Packard shares fell 2.3 percent.
The printer-grown group from Palo Alto, California, is currently dividing up: the computer and printing business will be bundled into a new society today - separate from the more future-oriented areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services.
Both companies are listed on the stock exchange.
Once again, disappointing PC sales, as well as a weaker demand from corporate customers for its services, lasted the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer after Lenovo.
In the third quarter at the end of July, PC and printer sales fell by 11.5 percent.
Sales fell by 8 percent to just under $25.4 billion.
The revenue fell in 15 out of 16 quarters.
HP responds to the change in the industry with a split and massive job cuts.
The 76-year-old company led by Meg Whitman has only reacted late to the fact that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and doing more and more business online.
Whitman’s restructuring plans include a total of around 55,000 job cuts.
Conflict: Majority Supports Anti-IS Training Mission
However, a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be largely rejected: 54 percent voted against it, 35 percent agreed.
That other countries are carrying out air strikes against ISIL in Iraq and Syria, 61 percent of the respondents are positive.
Twenty-four percent are against interfering in the conflict.
Cooperation with Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad is opposed by 51 percent of respondents, while 20 percent are in favour.
29% could not decide.
Car: Second Press Day at the 66th IAA
The focus of the trade fair will be on connected, self-driving cars and electric mobility until September 27.
After two press days, German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 66th International Automotive Exhibition under the motto "Mobility connects" on Thursday.
The public can visit the IAA from Saturday.
The organizers of the auto association VDA expect about 900,000 visitors as they did two years ago.
Röszke: Violence erupts on the Serbian-Hungarian border
Hungarian police have used tear gas and water throwers at the Serbian border near Röszke against several hundred uprooted refugees.
Euronews correspondent Dániel Bozsik witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border checkpoint.
He told me by phone:
A group of refugees crossed the border.
A police line had formed behind them, and behind the policemen was a water-throwing machine.
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones, sticks and plastic bottles at officials.
Initially, the officers continuously used pepper spray.
The police then used tear gas.
A lot of tear gas was poured toward the refugees.
This dissolved the group.
The refugees have already retreated.
A pregnant and apparently injured woman was taken out of the zone.
Children who had inhaled the tear gas were screaming.
Other refugees collapsed and suffered from shortness of breath.
Serbian police officials were also injured by the use of tear gas and pepper spray.
Time of Decision on Interest Rates for the US Central Bank
The world is watching the U.S. Central Bank meet on two days, Wednesday and Thursday, to make the important decision whether interest rates will be raised or not for the first time in a decade.
A survey of 80 economists surveyed by Reuters found that a little more than half of those who thought the Fed would do so last week now think the Fed will stay a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0-0.25 percent.
It’s a historic event because it’s been seven years since the Fed set interest rates to NULL.
"For the first time, we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may be leaving the zero range and initiating a process of normalizing interest rates," said Angel Ubide, senior associate at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance, trillions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation.
However, the Fed cannot ignore the less rosy outlook on global conditions.
It has warned the markets to adjust to an increase, but the signs suggest that the odds against such a move are good.
The decision will be announced at 20:00 MEZ on Thursday.
Delta State University shooter left an apology letter
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before shooting and killing his colleagues later on the day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he was "sorry" for the first murder and wanted "he could make it happen," authorities announced on Tuesday.
Police in Gautier, Mississippi, said Lamb, a professor of geography and social science education at Delta State University, called the emergency number around 10:00 on Monday morning.
He said he shot someone and killed someone.
Lamb told the emergency center employee that the police should send police to his home.
He said, "I shot my wife last night" and he also mentioned that there was a "sweet dog" in the house, but who "will not bother anyone," but probably will be excited.
The police asked the caller for his name, but he did not give it.
Lamb gave no explanation for his shots.
When police entered the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, saying, "I'm so sorry, I wanted to, I could reverse it.
I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me."
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a professor of history, before finally taking his own life on Monday evening as police surrounded him.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "of course there was something in Mr. Lamb's imagination."
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed Prentiss also had a relationship with Schmidt, authorities said on Tuesday there was "no information, no evidence" for a "triangle relationship."
Prentiss was described by Shawn O'Steen, who confessed that they were married for about seven years, as a "good person."
The two divorced 15 years ago, but remained friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentiss have a daughter who is 19, and she is "destroyed on the ground."
He said Prentiss was her daughter’s “absolutely best friends.”
Prentiss worked online from home, according to Linsday Knowles, who was identified by the Sun Herald as a close friend of Prentiss.
Knowles said Prentiss, who owned a dog named Lightning, had met Lamb for about three years.
“She always wanted to help other people,” Knowles said.
Police said Lamb called relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them "he won't go to jail."
When police picked him up on Highway 1 near Greenville later that night, Lamb drove his car to the side, fled on foot, ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot.
Lamb received a Ph.D. from Delta State University in the spring of 2015, according to his CV on the university’s website.
Stars Who Lost Their Happiness
The actor (left), in the picture with his son Redmond (right), had some stressful years.
In 2001 he fought with leukemia, and in 2009 he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also allegedly fought with drugs, and in 2008 he was convicted of drug possession.
All this deserves his tribute.
Eurowings: Lufthansa to Rebuild Group
Lufthansa is planning a major corporate change.
The Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation alone.
150 of the world’s approximately 1,000 executives will cost the company’s job.
There are new negotiations with the trade union.
Lufthansa is rebuilding its corporate structure and evaluating its low-cost subsidiary Eurowings.
The goal of the reorientation is to contribute about 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue synergies, the airline said on Wednesday.
Lufthansa will no longer have a board of directors for the passenger business.
The Eurowings low-cost airline should be developed as independently as possible.
In the board, headed by Carsten Spohr, Karl Ulrich Garnadt will be in charge of Eurowings in the future.
With the reassembly, Spohr underlines the importance of Eurowings, with which the group intends to compete against Ryanair and Easyjet in the future.
Until now, the organization of the 120,000-strong company has been complex.
The airlines entered under the roof of the Passage Airline Group, which accounts for three-quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros.
Negotiations with the pilots
In the collective conflict with the pilot association Cockpit (VC), negotiations are to be resumed after the strike stopped by the court on Thursday.
This was shared by the trade union.
The subject of the talks will be the retirement scheme for pilots.
Cockpit aims to sustainable results “in one year with a forecasted record result” as soon as possible.
The conflict between the trade union and the airline has led to various strikes in recent months.
The background is, in addition to the transitional support of the pilots, the "Wings" savings concept.
It provides for Lufthansa to outsource routes to its own low-cost Eurowings in the fight against competitors.
Under the title "Morgenzug in den Süden" are paintings by Leena Krüger displayed in the Artist House.
The Finnish woman, who has long lived in Göttingen, has compiled a selection of untitled works for the White Hall of the House, which encourage her viewers to embark on a thoughtful journey.
Luke Shaw of Manchester United can't play for months due to double fracture
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture of his right leg in Manchester's Champions League defeat against PSV Eindhoven.
While this made the left-backed defendant cry and will exclude him from playing for at least six months, Louis van Gaal does not give up hope that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury was caused by a ruthless attack by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after the 20-year-old Shaw broke into the PSV area.
He was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: "He has a double leg fracture and is in the hospital."
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester.
It’s terrible – a boy who comes to Manchester United at 18, has it very hard and then plays fantastic, and then that happens.
In the dressing room he was wearing an oxygen mask.
He was crying.
I’m not a doctor, but if you have a double fracture, it will take six months and he won’t play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the imposition of an elf meter.
Nicola Rizzoli, the referee, did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal suspected the Italian referee was wrong.
You can judge for yourself if I say that an eleven meter and a red card were due.
It was a terrible attack with both legs.
One tweet on Shaw's account read: "Thank you all for your messages.Words can't describe how broken I am, my path to recovery begins now, I'm coming back stronger."
Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Shaw in defeat at PSV
The England defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover by next June.
Phillip Cocu, the PSV coach, said: “It’s a very bad injury.”
When a player leaves the field with this type of injury, everyone is very sad about it.
It is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent.
Moreno suffered a leg fracture when Mexico played against Van Gaal's Holland team at the 2014 World Cup.
"He's doing very hard because it wasn't his intention to hurt the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very bad injury, that's not good," Cocu said.
It was impossible for me to see the moment.
The only thing I could see was the ball moving in a different direction so it looked like he [Moreno] had touched him, but I couldn’t see the attack on Luke.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it feels, I know how difficult it can be.
I feel very bad about it, sorry.
PSV player Andrés Guardado was also taken to hospital - after a foul game by Chris Smalling.
Did David Cameron know the Lorax?
It’s one thing that all parents will soon learn: If your child loves a book, it won’t take long for you to know it almost in vain.
Unless you may be David Cameron.
When asked by a provider of childcare systems to name his favorite children’s book, the prime minister chose The Lorax, Dr. Seuss’s 1971 environmental fable.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a message on the company’s website SuperCamps, and continued: “funny, moving, creative and with a powerful message, it’s a book I like to read to my children because there always seems to be an image or a message we’ve missed so far.”
Everything nice and good, except that the subsequent paragraph, in which Cameron allegedly describes the plot of the book, instead represents a content statement of the 2012 film version, which added new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text.
"In the middle of the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree," reads one.
As if that’s not yet suspicious enough: Cameron’s text reads in part like the summary of the Lorax movie, presented on the Internet Movie Database website and begins like this: “In the walled town of Thneed-Ville, where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams.”
Although he admits to being a pragmatic father, it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the plot of the book.Here an unnamed boy hears how the local environment is devastated by the money-loving, tree-falling, thneed-striking Once-ler despite the protests of the name-giving Lorax, a hooking, crawling creature "which speaks in the name of the trees".
Most likely, such a relatively low PR task was delegated to an assistant who did not read The Lorax to a child 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text probably came from Cameron's electoral district office.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron's staff, but did not give any further immediate comments.
Adam Lyth was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England’s team, but it’s still hard
Stopping Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a tough task, but when you see the team England has chosen for the tour, a repeat of the 3-0 test series defeat is not on my map.
I would not rule out a victory.
Alastair Cook’s side may be less experienced than the one three years ago, but there are good spin players in the batting set, and the community spirit is strong; they will not bear any scars of 2012, just a youth-positive attitude.
With the ball, Moeen Ali develops as a spin bowler and Adil Rashid, even if he represents an unknown size at the test level, is an option for the attack.
Adam Lyth resigns from England test and is replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to skip Adam Lyth is, of course, hard to analyze for me as his head coach in Yorkshire.
In his seven tests, there were two good attacks under difficult conditions, and the simple but harsh reality is that cricket players are focused on results.
There were no question marks at Joe Root, for example, and that led to the nomination since – and I’ve said this before – players are their own best selectors.
Long ago the course of Lyth would have been extended, but he had control over his own fate.
If he hopes to beat out more races for Yorkshire, another chance will come.
England coach Trevor Bayliss praised his attitude, even though he didn’t do so well, and that doesn’t surprise me; he’s above all a team man.
The question of how much time a test striker gets to put his character is difficult.
Lyth got seven chances - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton got nine.
Only Compton had the chance to play at home and out.
The only accusation to be raised was that England first deployed Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean – when Lyth was in top form – but that lost chance is now in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he’s a drummer I highly appreciate.
He’s an X-Factor cricketer, what we saw at Yorkshire early this season when he scored 236 against us on a Trent Bridge spot, which struck us a lot.
He must get at least the same chances as those ahead of him, but this, of course, depends on the team layout in the United Arab Emirates.
The idea of letting Moeen beat next to Cook, which would make an extra spin bowler and get four quicks, came up, and I don’t mind it.
I don’t see why a striker can’t beat there, and that left-handed man has already shown that he’s a devil of cricket players.
Moeen may not have done his job for his County Worcestershire, but he’s a number 3 for them, and there’s no big difference.
My former teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 tests in the first drop before appearing as an opener in 2001.
He made three hundred runs immediately and didn’t look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the squad as a back-up spinner, and in my limited dealing with him he has impressed me very much as a young man.
People may look at his statistics — on average 31 with the beat and 35 with the ball — and think it’s a punt, but there’s not a large number of backup spins raising their hands and the coaches have chosen youth.
He will learn a lot on this tour.
Apart from the team, England has made some clever additions to the coach staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, the Sri Lankan Batsman, as the advisor for the test games could be a master coup.
He is one of the most nice guys in the game, who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played in all conditions and against all attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful effort into the setup.
I always felt that he was created for the international cricket competition, as a player or as a coach, and like Mahela he has insights that we can benefit from.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room can bring fresh wind, even if the news is consistent with what was said before.
Colly’s teammate at Durham, Ben Stokes, won’t play at the One-Dayers, Root got a similar break against Australia and for my part I don’t have a problem with it.
While some will disagree, coaches and team creators don’t set the schedule.
And you have to remember that, like with the players, their jobs depend on the results.
Such decisions are not made with ease of heart.
The Brexit camp (Brexit = Britain’s exit from the EU) could gain momentum if the economy crashes by 2017
David Cameron’s unsuccessful re-negotiation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble with every day, even without the choice of the brilliant Jeremy “Is it yes or no?” Corbyn to lead Labour or the TUC, which is fiercely divided over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners also have their Corbyns and Nigel Farages.
A friend of European diplomats said recently that some member states, as deeply embroiled in various crises as the EU is now and not always by their own fault, are tired of Britain’s own agenda with split concessions and disturbing treaty changes that they mostly don’t want.
In Brighton, the TUC decided at its annual assembly that it does not like them if they endanger social protection.
We could also call it Dave and George’s Selfie Agenda.
Prime ministers and finance ministers climb to summits or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals, take a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument, with or without local greatnesses, then come home and say they are gaining allies for reforms.
It is always about me.
My European friend, who wishes for an outward-looking Britain inside the EU tent – “Let’s not be alone with France,” says Berlin – and makes a glimpse that more and more short-sighted ministers and officials in some capitals have come to the point where they don’t care whether we stay or leave.
Germany’s cautiously thoughtful Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her, as has happened to the excessively long-lasting such as Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French President François Hollande is looking to be re-elected or replaced in 2017.
He is also a fainting force.
Poland may soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain a left-wing.
It’s hard to imagine they’re going to tear off one leg to help the selfie British whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don’t want because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
Therefore, some such ministers may even intentionally plan unhelpful remarks, entirely in the SNP style, during Britain’s 2017 referendum campaign to accelerate the Brexit process, my friend suspects.
"The renegotiation was a failure" and "Great Britain has gained nothing of value from the renegotiation."
Europeans know how predatory Fleet Street can be at their own expense, and what EU skeptics the oligarchy of the press barons is, as they did not during the Tony Benn-inspired 1975 referendum, which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2:1.
You can hardly remember Boris Johnson, the erz-euro-opportunist who made a name for himself as a “EU-Gerade-Bananen” Brussels correspondent in the early 1990s.
In all his madness, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
This included the medley of tax-fearing villains, phone-hacking foreigners, and the pseudo non-domestic who own most of our major newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair thought similarly about her, but noted that if you sit in a cage with a hot gorilla, you better distribute bananas to distract him rather than become his lunch and dinner.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairian than Blair himself when he opposed Cameron’s referendum whirlwind, as Blair had put the principle over the unadopted EU Constitution, which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which thus opened a backdoor to him.
The press has never forgiven him.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn, who gave me a friendly knock on my back on Monday in Westminster — I told him he didn’t need to waste time for me anymore — seems at risk of repeating Neil Kinnock’s boycott Murdoch’s strategy of the 80s, a mistake then and today.
It may take time, but he has to develop a coherent strategy to win the media, not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday.
Corbyn’s official position on Europe is – I would say it kindly – in development.
He says we should stay in a reformed EU.
Well, most people outside of Ukip’s traditional blue-colouring tendency and the wilder fields of Tory’s Little Englishism can probably say yes to it.
It’s what Hilary “A Benn but no Bennite” Benn said on radio and television this week as the pathfinder in him struggled not to admit that Corbyn’s appointment of the provocative John McDonnell as shadow chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s when his old father tried on television to be unloyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job.
Hilary’s fight was even more attractive.
But struggling to stay “in all circumstances” – Benn’s expression – wasn’t what McDonnell said, nor was JC telling his fellow members and MPs after all the reports at their council meeting on Monday evening.
Whatever the moving bottom-up image of Corbyn wants to convey—remember that he even touched me—news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and, above all, in the strudel of social media, a breeding place of paranoia and betrayal.
It’s right not to give Cameron a free card for Europe that allows him to take Labour’s support in the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins thinks so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn’s fundamental ambiguity about EU membership – in line with their Bennite siege economy, their anti-capitalist past – is no longer just a matter of esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents, for whom the narcissism of the small difference is a central principle of dogmatic disputes.
As with his ambiguities about NATO—Tom Watson is firmly convinced that JC is not launching a campaign to withdraw—foreign diplomats will be forced to try to find meaning in everything for their superiors at home.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital – they also have suspicious voters – to make concessions to the British, when all this can be pointless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a cost reduction of the Tory government in power, which I was reminded of at the launch on Monday by something called the British Influence Security Forum.
Experts criticize Public Health England report on e-cigarettes
A government-funded agency’s claims that e-cigarettes are less harmful than smoking came from a meeting of 12 people, some with links to the tobacco industry, researchers said.
Experts writing in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet by criticizing the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released the “Principle Report” last month, describing it as a “comprehensive review of evidence.”
However, some researchers have questioned the resilience of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry.
A editorial article in the medical journal Lancet last month attacked the “extremely windy foundation” on which PHE founded its most important conclusion.
Two other researchers write in BMJ and have asked if the claims are “built on stone or sand.”
Martin McKee, Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, Professor of Clinical Epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said the public expects PHE’s claim that “the current best estimate is that e-cigarettes are about 95% less harmful than smoking” to be based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling.
In fact, this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were summoned to develop a model for Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions about the harm of different nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting were summarized in a research report.
McKee and Capewell said one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEOs are said to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) for an independent study.
He also signed BAT’s public health references in a sustainability report, they said.
One of the 12 participants at the meeting stated that he was receiving funding from an e-cigarette manufacturer, but not the funding he allegedly received previously from tobacco company Philip Morris International, they added.
The reasons for selecting panel members are not provided, but these include several well-known e-cigarette champions, some of whom also indicate industry funding in the paper.
Some other participants in this session are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The tobacco management of PHE also participated in the meeting.
The group’s research work “confirms significantly” that there is a lack of “hard evidence for the damage of most products to most criteria,” McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s claims that “there is no evidence so far that e-cigarettes serve as a way to smoke for children or non-smokers” were premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, director of health and well-being at PHE, said that BMJ’s claims have been responded earlier.
He said, “E-cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking.”
One in two lifelong smokers dies from their addiction.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of e-cigarettes are low compared to that, but that we continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what it does not, especially when there is so much public confusion about the relative hazards compared to tobacco.
Nearly 80,000 people die each year from a smoking-related disease, and smoking costs the National Health System £2 billion a year.
By clearly presenting current evidence that e-cigarettes are not without risk, but represent only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking, we are fulfilling our national competence.
BBC should give up EastEnders, says former chief executive of Channel 4
Former chairman of Channel 4, Luke Johnson, has said the BBC should stop broadcasting programs like EastEnders and The Voice. He said commercial rivals would "give their right arm" to hit shows like the Albert Square Soap.
Johnson said the broadcast fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast through other UK channels.
He criticized the BBC for placing public programs, likely to be seen by a smaller audience, in heavily controversial time windows against the most popular shows of its rivals and from broadcasters such as BBC4.
After BBC chief executive Tony Hall said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations, Johnson said he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success.
"I have problems with the idea that the BBC would order or broadcast programs that would clearly be shown even by unsubsidized rivals," Johnson told the House Communications Committee as part of his investigation into the future of the BBC.
If you want to keep the broadcast fee, which I don’t think is a good idea in the medium or long term, you should at least produce on programs that others don’t do or order.
They are broadcasting The Voice in a first-class time window because they want to get as broad support as possible for their future.
The idea that no one else would show this is a joke, it’s ridiculous, it’s nonsense, of course.
Johnson said: "I don't see why a regressive tax funds programs that could be funded even without subsidies.
The Voice is one such program, EastEnders is another, admittedly both own productions.
Honestly, other channels would give their right arm for it.
I’m trying to see how this should be public television.
I don’t think this would reduce the BBC at all.
Johnson, a serial entrepreneur who ran Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, said the BBC was guilty of the hunt for reviews "because of the ambitions of the people who work there, and because they believe this is the best way to secure long-term support."
His comments on the BBC’s most popular shows reflect what former Sky director Tony Ball suggested in his MacTaggart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC should sell shows like EastEnders.
Johnson said that the more public-law niche programs “should go to BBC4, where you can hardly measure the audience, but they do their job, and they can argue when they go on their hypocritical missions to justify £4 billion broadcast fees, “Well, of course, we’ve created all those obscure programs that no one has seen.”
They put them in a window of time where no one ever wanted to see them.
On broadcast fees, Johnson told the committee, “I urge you to find a rather regressive system in terms of conditions, who can get the best value out of it.
Of course you all think, we all think you get a great value here for £150 a year, but for people who are a lot of money for £150, ask me if that’s true because they don’t consume much of the BBC.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief David Elstein, who also testified before the committee on Tuesday, called for the BBC to review its Reithian mission to “inform, train and entertain.”
He said little of the BBC’s production would now be officially classified as education – he said it’s 1% of their TV production and 0.1% on radio – and they should take an example on public television stations in Australia and Canada to change this to “inform, enlighten and entertain”.
On the issue of partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of celebrities, of which he said only a handful will be shown on television, and make alliances with commercial broadcasters to make everything available online.
'Sonogenetics' Can Control Brain Cells Through Soundwaves
The video shows how the nematodes change direction at the moment when they are irradiated with sound impulses.
Scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by outbursts of sound waves.
The tiny nematodes change direction in the moment they are irradiated with sound impulses that have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard.
The impulses work by turning on motoneuron cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Researchers Read and Write Brain Activity with Light
The researchers said the worms showed the power of a new process called sonogenetics, in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain, heart, and muscle cells outside the body.
Sreekanth Chalasani, a researcher at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the procedure could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that emits electrical impulses into people’s brains to treat Parkinson’s symptoms.
Worms generally do not respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani noted that they did when surrounded by a liquid with microscopic air bubbles.
The blisters, he found, amplify the ultrasound waves, which then penetrate into the worms.
The amplified ultrasound waves act on structures called TRP-4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worm cells.
The sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are associated, according to a report by Nature Communications.
In order to create ultrasound-controlled nematodes, Chalasani genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neurons carry TRP-4 ion channels.
When he applies ultrasound to the modified creatures, the sound waves are amplified by the micro-bubbles and transferred to the worms, where they turn on the modified motor neurons.
The procedure has some similarities with Optogenetics, a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with light impulses.
But Chalasani said that sonogenetics could have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which has to be sent down by an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain, low-frequency ultrasound waves can pass through tissues unhindered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull.
"We believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily make targeted human neurons susceptible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments," Chalasani said.
Other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin-producing cells, he added.
Illegal torture devices - right at your doorstep!
Advertisements Shame on Britain's Arms Trade
Amnesty International Anti-Weapons Exhibition.
A terrible killer drone.
Foot broken legs.
The bombs!
And electric shock sticks that cause tormenting pain but leave no trace!
The joyful voice and cartoon images leave no doubt that this ad for the world’s largest weapons fair is a combat parody produced by Amnesty International to highlight the British government’s willingness to supply weapons to repressive regimes through the Defence and Security Equipment International Jamboree at the ExCeL Centre in Docklands, London.

But a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stops and in metro trains that require a second look.
"Important announcement: Will you drive the DLR from September 15 to 18?" (Docklands Light Railway) is read in the fonts of the London Underground and the mark of the DLR line, which turns into an image of a tank.
In September, a bunch of arms dealers will drive with the DLR ... customers are asked to help stop the arms fair.
The 300 posters are by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Designs in Banksys Dismaland.
A collective called Special Patrol Group helped with the distribution in London and used "Ad Space Hack Packs," a £6 pack of inbound keys that is claimed to gain "access to about one-third of the bus stop advertising spaces on the planet."
Transport for London does not find this poster- "vandalism" funny.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Crueol Designs and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more critical and trying to bring political works to the audience outside of galleries.
Many artists work with activists within protest movements and find that they have to go out into the real world in order for their art to have an impact on society.
Another of the anti-weapons trade posters greeting pendants in the subway.
The Amnesty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency VCCP, which works with the graphic artist and voice-over artist for free.
VCCP Creative Director Matt Lever was amazed at the silence that ruled around the weapons trade fair advertisement – through an empty piece of the ExCeL calendar – and thought, “Let’s give them the campaign they’re trying to avoid.”
They played with the invention of a more realistic twisted corporate advertising, but “through blending with bright colors and animation, it remains stronger attached.”
“They have done a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness about the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair,” said Tom Davies of Amnesty International.
What we need now is a British government intervention and the guarantee that torture devices will not be traded illegally in front of our doorstep.
Per the most creative art around the weapons trade fair comes from the area within ExCeL, where exhibitors stitch fantasticly euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order from the U.S. Army for the "AT4CS RS shot down from the shoulder."
This includes a “uniquely shaped combat head that delivers outstanding after-effects inside the target.”
Whatever this causes, it will not be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules for Living in Student Homes
Eleven years ago, as a self-forgotten 19-year-old, I moved to a student residence, still believing in Berets and moral relativism, but only now can I remember the tense smiles of those I annoyed - and the numerous, long-lasting complaints about others.
Most of what I’ve learned can be distilled in eight simple rules.
Entry into student residences ranges from slightly nervous to absolutely frightening.
It’s tempting to sweat: people tell you where you come from, if and where you took the Sabbath year, where you stand in relation to Corbyn and why you “honestly neither love nor hate Marmite because seriously, guys, it’s just a yeast extract HAHAHA, I’m in my room.”
Breathe through .
And help others do the same – ask questions and show interest.
It guides the conversation and helps you find out the people you like as opposed to those you’t talk to, even if your eyelids burned and those were fire extinguishers.
Leave the people.
People’s rooms often turn into drinking receptions, movie night venues, and community gatherings, but they are also the places where people dress up and put on their underwear.
Related: Don’t think about starting a relationship at university
Introverts get rough treatment at the university.
Your room should be a shelter, but many student residences form a space-to-space buzz culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifelong friendship.
This can be hell for someone trying to recover.
Nothing in the culture allows you to say, “I like you, and I want our friendship to continue, but you have to go away so I get back the energy I’ve spent on interacting with you.”
Try to feel when a companion is exhausted of sociality – and send him a SMS instead of knocking.
Speaking of knocking: do it.
A guy in my student residence had the idea that an unlocked door was an invitation.
He saw a few things.
Friendship is closed by backs.
As you start the university at the height of back mania, knocking at people's doors to imagine yourself with a plate full of brownies is less strange than the 1950s greeting "Welcome to the neighborhood, I have baked you something.
Offering homemade delicacies is a great way to make friends.
Your fellow residents will feel obliged to talk and may eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise.
Of course, this depends on whether you are a decent baker.
Poorly mixed clumps of flour, sugar, and fat cause people to fall asleep when you knock.
Theft of food is a common crime in student residences.
Of course, chewing chicken is a theft, but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too?
Check with the milk owner.
Chances are they say to serve themselves even when they are cooking inside.
When someone steals your stuff, that’s annoying, and you have my sympathy – but try to deal with it more balanced than my fellow resident who added a detergent to their milk to punish thieves.
She is now in prison.
You should not make noise that discourages people from sleeping or working.
It’s not just about being a decent person, but that in the true sense of the saying, you belong to the people sitting in the glass house.
A girl in my corridor asked her neighbors if they care about putting Drum & Bass a little quieter because it was three o’clock in the morning, and she had an exam in the morning.
They reacted with even louder music.
When they finally stopped at 5 o’clock, she kindly let her neighbors sleep for two more hours before letting her own music plunge, closing her door and going to her three-hour exam.
Wouldn’t it be romantic if your future spouse accidentally moved into the same student residence?
On the contrary, would it not be deeply embarrassing if you consider a fellow housewife to be your future spouse, cling to her, break up again, and then have to see her every day, and see her pulling all the common friends over to you?
Of course, the heart goes its own way - but if a hot companion is definitely not your future spouse, at least try to give your lower abdomen a little reason.
In the exciting moment when you notice someone has left their keys in their unlocked room, the boundary between an ulk and bullying is finer than it seems.
A good stroke is funny, but it only takes moments before it becomes a bumerang.
Give a valuable and fun lesson about safety by hiding – but never dampen someone’s room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Close their door and place their keys in a glass of water, which you then place in the freezer - but don't stick their possessions to the ceiling more than twice.
Round houses for refugees, single parents, low-income
Real estate entrepreneur Markus Gildner builds row houses in the Eckental region for people who don’t have much money.
So for example for refugees – but also as a signal: “Not only refugees need housing, but also the single mother and the low-income.”
"I show you how to build cheaply and well today," the 44-year-old said in an interview.
Thousands of refugees are pushing into the housing market.
Entrepreneur Markus Gildner believes he knows how to quickly create affordable housing: in a project he builds row houses for refugees.
Mr. Gildner, many refugees will push into the housing market.
What solution do you offer?
Markus Gildner: Mass accommodation in containers or gyms has no sustainability.
People remain here for a large part.
Given the flow of refugees, we will need enough housing in the coming decades.
A very banal, three-story row house is the solution.
Gildner: A row house needs the least space.
It facilitates integration.
This is different when people are housed in housing blocks.
Each of the six houses currently being built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seekers each.
Each residential unit has two bedrooms, a bathroom, a kitchen and a living room.
It may be that many refugees will say it’s peace again, I’m going back.
Then the houses can easily be converted according to the respective needs.
How high are the costs?
Gildner: The price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 euros, excluding land.
This is controllable.
The construction took six months.
That is appropriate.
Have the construction regulations complicated your plans?
Gildner: In terms of construction law, I have done my project correctly.
Particularly complicated is the threatening Damocles Sword Special Construction and the Stellplatzverordnung.
and horrible.
It is still assumed that anyone who creates three apartments in a row house needs at least three seats.
There is no place for it in the cities.
Refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars.
How did the locals react to their house project?
Gildner: There were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers.
What is definitely not true.
But do you not intensify the competition for affordable housing?
Gildner: It is true: we have had a construction boom in Germany in the last five years, but luxury apartments have been built that hardly anyone can afford.
My project has the message, even normal people need housing.
Not only refugees, but also the single parent or the low-income.
I will show you how you can still build cheaply and well today.
That is what it is.
Markus Gildner (44) studied microsystem technology in Regensburg and initially engaged in environmental analysis.
iOS 9: How to get the new iPhone operating system when Apple update is released
The new operating system can be requested by going to the Settings app, tapping "General" and then selecting "Software Update".
When it’s ready, the phone gives you the option to download and then install.
Some have encountered problems after installation as they receive an error message that tells you that the “software update failed.”
To bypass the problem, users are advised to either wait until the rush goes back or try to update via iTunes.
The phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process.
This may mean deleting apps to create space – but Apple has made this unlikely by slendering the update. Likewise, it will be easier to do this by using a special tool to delete apps and then reinstall them once the process is completed.
It is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the upgrade or is located near a charger so that the battery is charged.
If the charge is too low, Apple will not allow the update to continue as the phone may shut down halfway and this could cause the update to be cancelled.
iOS 9 release still on schedule despite WatchOS delay in reviewing iOS 9: the least exciting but best update of iOS 9 so far: How to prepare for the new iPhone operating system
You should also make sure you have checked through our checklist of all things before downloading to prevent things from going wrong and protect yourself if they do. iOS 9 brings new features, including a much smarter personal assistant and huge new productivity features for the iPad, as well as changes that accelerate and repair the operating system.
Rosberg's motto: Full attack
Nico Rosberg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes teammate Lewis Hamilton: "Full Attack".
The World Cup second emphasized before starting in the crucial seven overseas races "that I have nothing to lose."
53 points separate the vice-world champion before the night race in Singapore this Sunday from title defender and double-champion Hamilton.
The British has already won seven of the previous twelve races of the season and is also taking the Floatlight Grand Prix in the city state as a favourite.
In 2009 and last year, the 30-year-old British man was able to win the race.
Whether the current smog in the city state will affect the Singapore Grand Prix is still unclear.
For days, a dust bell has been hanging over the city, triggered by fires on the neighboring island of Sumatra.
Bad Kissinger Chess Club has a prominent member
The three months ago founded chess club "Chess Friends Bad Kissingen" has added another member to its ranks, thus increasing the number of members to 19 players.
The new member is the entrepreneur Paul Gauselmann, a passionate chess and tennis player who has stayed in Bad Kissingen for treatment more than 40 times.
Gauselmann is a recipient of the Bundesverdienstkreuz 1st Class and an honorary citizen of the cities of Espelkamp and Lübbecke.
The Chess Club in Bad Kissingen was supported by Gauselmann with a donation received by Chairman Alfred Klein.
This makes it possible to enroll chess players who are unable to make the membership fee.
Youth work and talent seeking should also be promoted.
Gauselmann hopes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact with the tennis club "Red-White" will be seen as an expression of his association with the Kurstadt.
District office seeks direct contact
Saludis and the Antonistift Altenzentrum have joined forces under the patronage of the Social Foundation and opened a new access point at Graf-Stauffenberg-Platz.
In addition to consultations, you can also participate in courses.
The social foundation pulls it down from the mountain to the city centre.
See also Graf-Stauffenberg Square.
A new neighborhood office was recently opened.
Here, right next to the shopping market, seniors and seekers of advice will now receive information on issues such as care insurance or the benefits of the health and care funds.
For years, with our outpatient care service, we have found that often caring relatives are left alone.
There are endless questions.
“Not too often many services from the casinos are not used, because the complexity of insurance is hardly yet to be understood,” explained the new housewife Jutta Weigand, who is also responsible for the Antonistift and the citizen hospital as well as for the ambulatory service “Amadeus” as the head of the Altenhilfe business.
In addition to the consultations, the new neighborhood office also offers prevention, health courses and wellness.
The greeting was taken to the boat.
Therefore, you can take advantage of additional offers such as fall prevention, memory training or physiotherapeutic treatment.
The offers of the Senior Centre and the Saludis complement each other in an ideal way.
Saludis stands for Prevention, Prevention and Rehabilitation.
“The senior center for care and care,” described Heike Riedel, Managing Director of Saludis.
The reason for the opening of the new neighborhood office in the city centre, both executives see in particular in the demographic change.
Because this makes a good decentralized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bamberg essential in the future.
In addition, as Mayor Wolfgang Metzner (SPD) stressed at the inauguration ceremonies, the neighborhood office is also dedicated to isolation in old age: "There are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular social gathering."
Thus, the social foundation makes a big contribution so that seniors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment.
The neighborhood office is open Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 14 p.m., Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 18 p.m. and Saturday from 10 p.m. to 12 p.m.
Eintracht Bamberg vs Würzburger Kickers on October 6
Now it is official: After the date for the match FC Eintracht Bamberg against the third-tier Würzburger Kickers had not yet been determined due to renovation work at the Fuchsparkstadion, the date was now fixed on October 6.
The match of FC Eintracht Bamberg in the semifinals of the Bayern Football Totopokal against the third-tier FC Würzburger Kickers has now been finally terminated.
The game will be played on Tuesday, October 6, at 19:00 at the Bamberg Fuchspark Stadium.
“We are pleased that we now know when the game will go over the stage, now we have planning security,” said FCE team manager Karlheinz Hümmer, who also points to the now-started ticket pre-sale.
It’s special for our team to play against a third-class player.
We therefore hope for numerous spectators, and this is not without reason, because floodlight games have a special attraction.
In the round of the last 16 teams, FC Eintracht Bamberg entered in 2010 by victories in the district league 1 FC Oberhaid (3:1) and at home against the regional league 1 FC Schweinfurt 05 (3:2).
The winner of the competition receives 5000 euros and qualifies for the first round of the DFB Club Cup 2016/2017.
The title defender is SpVgg Unterhaching.
Viennese architect Karl Mang has died at the age of 92
Karl Mang, one of the doyens of Vienna architecture, is dead.
He died on September 5 at the age of 92, the House of Art on Tuesday.
With Mang the Artist House loses an honorary member and at the same time "one of the most significant architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna", as stated in the broadcast.
Born in Vienna in 1922, Mang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna with Friedrich Lehmann during and after the Second World War.
Since 1952 he has worked as a freelance architect, but has also worked as a teacher, writer and institute director.
From 1972 to 1983 he was president of the Austrian Institute for Design.
In the 1980s, he was commissioned to set up the Treasury Chamber in the Wiener Hofburg and convert the Palais Lobkowitz into the Austrian Theater Museum.
Parking penalty: Tim Wiese calls police officer with money
Former footballer Tim Wiese has been badly noticed in Bremen.
Footballer once was, now is Tim Wiese, former national goalkeeper in Germany and engaged in Bremen and Hoffenheim, wrestler.
He says he has gained 30 kilograms of muscle mass over the past two years.
Intellectually, he did not respond.
Wiese was having his hair cut in the centre of Bremen when he saw a car park guard outdoors issuing a penalty for his white Chevrolet Camaro.
Wiese then stormed out of the store, insulted the official and threw the due fine at her feet, according to the "Bild" newspaper.
In the city of Bremen, the accusations are confirmed, but the consequences of the unusual incident are not yet clear.
"The case is still under examination," the city of Bremen said.
Only then will it be decided whether or not weed will be displayed.

Men attack 17-year-old Afghan
Witnesses are being sought by the police for an incident in Bad Soden-Salmünster: On Friday evening, around 23:45 a.m., three young men were on their way from Bad Soden to Salmünster.
One of the group, a 17-year-old Afghan, followed his two friends from a distance of about five meters and told them to wait for him.
At that time, the group was at the level of the bft gas station.
There were also three people at the gas station.
One of those men shouted at the young man and struck him in the face.
The victim suffered a fracture of the nose and bleed from the nose.
When his two friends appeared and reassured the striker, he initially abandoned his victim.
The injured young man was taken home by his friends.
The perpetrator followed the group with a car to their apartment and passed there several times.
When the vehicle was no longer seen, the injured man went outside the building to smoke a cigarette.
He was attacked by the man and another man.
With the help of a stroke, they struck the victim’s face and thighs.
The injured man had to be taken to a hospital for medical care.
So far, there is only a vague description of the perpetrator.
One of the men was about 1.80 meters tall.
The second shark was said to be about 1.65 meters tall and was dressed in a jeans and a brown-white shirt.

Silvia Müller-Gongoll and Frank Müller (from the left) take over the practice of Karl-Heinrich and Ursel Felstehausen.
This is also by the mayor of Samtgemeinde Bernd Bormann, economic promoter Uta Seim-Schwartz and the mayor of Asendorf Heinfried Kabbert.
In many places in the countryside, doctors are lacking – Asendorf, on the other hand, is lucky: there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice Felstehausen on October 1.
While Ursel Felstehausen is retired, her husband, Karl-Heinrich, is still behind his successor in the coming months with half a job.
After a transformation phase, Müller will reopen the practice on 12 October, until then he will invest €330,000 in the premises on St.-Marcellusstraße 6.
It was sympathy at first glance when the Felstehausens met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller-Gongoll years ago, who is currently completing their specialist training at the Verdener Hospital and is also planning to enter practice next year.
"We always had in mind that the Müllers would fit well into this practice," says Dr. Ursel Felstehausen and laughs.
“When it was time, I just called her.”
The Muller couple liked the idea of running their own practice in Asendorf in the future.
"The proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us," says the 39-year-old Müller.
“We want to meet and accompany the families over the years.”
He also sees it as an advantage to soon be his own boss.
And so it was agreed that the Müllers bought the house with the practice.
It is located in Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
There also grew up Frank Müller, the two-fold family father, his medical studies in Hannover followed by stages in several medical offices as well as in the hospitals in Sulingen, Nienburg and Rotenburg.
Currently he works as a general doctor in Sulingen, and in 2009 he was appointed as chief emergency doctor in the district of Diepholz and volunteers in the DRC preparedness Bruchhausen-Vilsen.
Starting September 19, the practice will be prepared for the new boss.
While the surgeon Dr. Karl-Heinrich Felstehausen works as a family doctor, his wife Ursel (internist) specializes in gastroenterology.
The Müllers, both internists, want to settle as home doctors.
“The endoscopy is therefore coming out,” says 38-year-old Silvia Müller-Gongoll.
After the renovation, the rooms will look more modern.
We will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long-term and stress ECGs and need a talk room more.
The computer is also completely renewed.
A subsidy of a total of 50,000 euros will be provided to the Müllers within the framework of a funding program from the district (25000 euros) as well as from the Sam Samgemeinde (12500 euros) and the municipality (12500 euros).
“This shows how proud and happy we are that the practice continues,” emphasizes Bernd Bormann, mayor of Samtgemeinde.
Approximately 2,000 patients come to Felstehausen every quarter, according to Silvia Müller-Gongoll, in the northern German average there are about 500.
In Asendorf there is another householder practice.
A positive side effect of the practice adoption by Frank Müller: The pharmacy remains in Asendorf, according to Ursel Felstehausen.
If there were no successor, she would have left.
Those who attend Müller’s speaking class, by the way, continue to look primarily at familiar faces: take over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the Felstehausens.
With their farewell, an era ends in Asendorf, after all, the doctors have practiced there for 30 years.
“In the beginning we only had two rooms,” remembers Ursel Felstehausen.
You can feel a little sadness after a long time.
"But we continue to live in Hohenmoor and will see many patients often," says the internist.
Her husband adds laughing, “We have a 6000-square-meter plot.”
"So far I've always pushed myself for gardening, now it could be different."
The couple has two grandchildren and they love to travel.
Croatia: “We let the refugees pass through”
"Now the border controls are also being increased at our southern border," Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said.
Meanwhile, Hungarian border controls are still in place.
It remains clear that anyone who wishes to apply for asylum can also do so "obviously".
The security and security of people are at the forefront.
But it is also clear that “clear signals are needed,” the minister said.
People need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows, not even across the Austrian-Slovenian border.
It requires a controlled approach.
Croatia considers "corridor" - Slovenia refused
The Croatian government had previously said that Slovenia would also allow arrivals of refugees to continue to travel towards Austria and Germany and, under certain circumstances, also build corridors for the refugees.
This was not the case with Interior Minister Vesna Györkös Znidar in Laibach.
The idea of corridors is "absolutely unacceptable", but Slovenia is intensifying border surveillance, especially with Hungary.
The border with Croatia, as an external border of the Schengen area, is already tightly controlled.
However, as the minister stressed, Slovenia does not want to lock off its borders for refugees.
“Every member of the EU must fulfill its obligations, otherwise the system can’t work,” said Mr. Znidar.
As the Croatian government said, the first refugees had already tried to enter eastern Croatia at the border crossing Tovarnik/Sid in the night of Tuesday to avoid registration.
Croatian police were able to catch them in the nearby cornfields.
According to local media, police vehicles with new refugees have continuously arrived in Tovarnik, Croatia.
They are mainly Syrians and Afghans, including many women and children.
Rescue services and the Red Cross are also in operation.
In the coming days, his country expects about 4,000 refugees, Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
In addition, buses from Presevo on the Macedonian-Serbian border, which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border, would be redirected to Croatia, Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday.
The Belgrade government denied, however, that it was instructing people to take certain routes: "Neither can we nor will we do this," it said.
According to media reports, at least in the morning a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Sid, in the course of the day, more buses are expected.
From Croatia, Slovenia and Austria to Germany
The inmates had been travelling through Serbia all night from the Macedonian border, which is about 500 kilometers away.
“We’ve heard that Hungary has stopped, so the police told us that we should go here,” one of the refugees said.
They wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia, Slovenia and Austria.
This could actually lead to the delay, already predicted by observers, of the previous Balkan route Turkey-Greece-Macedonia-Serbia-Hungary to a somewhat further western route.
Croatia: “Comprehensive possibilities for border control”
Croatia’s Interior Minister Ostojic had previously stressed that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible emergencies in the event of a strong influx of refugees.
He did not give details, but pointed out that Croatia, as a non-Schengen member, has "comprehensive possibilities for border control."
Strict controls are carried out in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area.
Slovenia has been a member since 2007, and since then the EU partners have given the country a good certificate in terms of the standard of border controls.
On the Serbian side, about 300 refugees are still trapped behind the Hungarian border fence.
According to Belgrade media reports, they spent last night at the border crossing of Horgos, which leads to Röszke.
According to the Hungarian authorities, the two border crossings Horgos and Backi Breg remain completely closed.
Whether the remaining refugees will now continue to travel to the Croatian border is unclear.
Serbian Interior Minister Nebojsa Stefanovic attempted to reassure the debate on alternative routes for refugees after the Hungarian border has now been closed.
At the moment, there is not a very high number of refugees.
It is unclear whether they would continue their journey through Hungary, Croatia or any other country.
Helpers advise migrants to identify - dangerous - alternative routes
However, private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps to refugees on which alternative routes through Croatia are marked.
However, the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe: in parts of the border area there are still mine fields that have not been cleared 20 years after the end of the Croatian war.
On Wednesday afternoon, Croatian police announced that a team of miners had been sent to the border region.
Exchange hackers: Ukrainians pay $30 million
Supranonok is said to have belonged to a ring of cybercriminals accused of repeatedly accessing unpublished financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire, Marketwired and PR Newswire since 2010.
The information stolen was used for insider transactions in the financial markets.
In this way, according to investigators, a total of more than $100 million was erased.
"Today's comparison shows that even those outside our national borders will eventually be captured," the SEC said in a statement.
The trial of 32 other defendants in the case continued.
Most of the defendants are from Ukraine and Georgia.
The perpetrators are believed to be from both the United States and Eastern Europe.
Ecumenical Hospizhilfe Mannheim has been around for 20 years.
Around the Mannheimer Paradeplatz there is rough operation.
People do their things, partly fast, partly comfortably.
They control the two stations of the Mannheim Auto Show at Paradeplatz.
Maintain the city railways.
Pulsifying, glittering life in the splendid autumn sunshine and in the middle of four large tablets each with the title "Before I die I want to"....
The Ecumenical Hospice Aid drew attention to its 20 years of existence with this action and faces quite mixed reactions.
"It is about killing lives, so we went into the city and among the people with the action," says Josefine Lammer.
The head of the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance is at the disposal of passers for questions and discussions as well as the volunteer staff.
While some of the passers spontaneously rush to the cry, adding the phrase of "Yes my life," "Can read," "Ride with the camper through the US," "Stop the war," or "Do not suffer long," others stay short, read, say phrases like "so far I'm not yet" and then go on.
Again and again, on the edge, small discussions develop about action itself, about life, how to deal with dying.
Peter Hübinger is also present.
“Only when I realize that at some point the end will come to me in this world, I can live responsibly,” says the director of the diocesan work of Mannheim, which together with the Caritas Association is the carrier of the Ecumenical Hospice Aid.
Therefore, this public action is good for the 20-year-old.
That not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards, however, is understandable, after all, it is a very personal matter.
The topic of death and dying is still taboo, according to the experience of Josefine Lammer, although it is the hospice movement in recent years that has contributed a lot to the openness of people.
A review that Angelika Godefroid shares.
The death and mourning accompanist is one of the volunteer employees of the first hour.
Faced with the subject through personal experiences, she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in death aid.
When the Ecumenical Hospice Assistance called for volunteers, it immediately signed up and was present when it was founded in 1995.
Godefroid is part of a team of 45 volunteers – 43 women and two men – who accompany the affected and their relatives in private households, hospitals, nursing homes and the St. Vincent Hospice.
They are all carefully trained.
Angelika Godefroid can cope well with her task and the experiences and experiences gained with it.
“I see life from a different standpoint, consider it precious and appreciate the moment,” she says.
The offer of the ambulatory ecumenical hospice service is free of charge and confessionally independent.
The financial support of the health funds and donations from relatives and associations enables the training and continued training and supervision of the death and mourning accompanyers.
Training for new employees is offered every two years.
The tablets described on Saturday are now displayed in the House of the Evangelical Church (M1, 1a) and in the House of the Catholic Church (F2, 6).
Other personal wishes can also be recorded on postcards.
FedEx result mixed, financial outlook for 2016 reduced
FedEx disappointing results for the last quarter, and the supply giant lowered its profit outlook to an entire year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its ground transport service.
The company also said it plans to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday.
At that time last year, FedEx announced that the company would hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season.
The stock fell over 2.5 percent in the premarket trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it will make a profit between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, 20 cents less than in the previous forecast.
Analysts expected $10.84, according to a survey by FactSet.
The lower outlook comes despite the price increases, which are on average 4.9 percent and come into effect on 4 January, and despite higher surcharges for land transport of heavy and large packages, which will be levied from November.
The company said it still expects earnings to rise compared to the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenue and growth in online trading.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company “provides solid returns given the weaker than expected economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade.”
The holiday employment plans were announced a day later than those of rival UPS, which plans to hire 90,000 to 95,000 additional workers, roughly the same number as last year.
In the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, 6 percent more than the previous year.
Profit per share was $2.42 per share, just behind the $2.44 per share predicted by twelve analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research.
Sales increased by 5 percent to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $12.23 billion.
FedEx has experienced a decline in international priority shipping in recent years, which has caused sales in its Express Shipping unit to stagnate.
But the boom in online shopping has boosted results at FedEx Ground.
In the last quarter, ground transport revenue increased by 29 percent, but operating profit was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self-insurance.
The Express unit recorded higher revenues due to higher prices, while earnings fell due to higher labor costs in the freight business.
In premarket trading, about an hour before opening, FedEx shares fell $3.85 or 2.5 percent to $150.15.
On Tuesday, they closed with a loss of 11 percent for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11.
At their most anticipated meeting of the year, Federal Reserve strategists spend two days this week sitting around a 27-foot Honduras-Mahagoni table to decide whether it’s time to raise the key interest rates for the first time in a decade.
Threatening over them at one end of the decorated, two-story meeting room is a wall picture of the United States.
The card is a reminder that Fed Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation above all other things.
The central bank has a double mandate from Congress: maximizing U.S. employment and keeping prices stable here.
But since the Great Recession, the Fed leaders have recognized that there is an unwritten third mandate: financial stability.
And this third term could be the X-Factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict.It will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to start to be detached from the unprecedented incentive by the near-zero short-term interest rate since the end of 2008.
Although most of the economy’s data shows that it is growing solidly, recent turbulence in global financial markets could make the already cautious Fed representatives afraid to boost this volatility by raising federal bond interest rates – even if only by a quarter percentage point.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the most important thing they’re watching first,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“But I think if they were looking for a pretext not to raise interest rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to keep waiting,” she said.
There is no consensus on what the Fed will do, which in itself makes the financial market uncertain.
About half of the economists recently polled by Bloomberg have predicted an interest rate rise this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Fed to wait, with a key indicator indicating only a 30% chance of a rise.
This suggests a decline in the stock market if the Fed raises the rate unless the strategists soften the blow by promising that another rise is far away.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial average jumped 228.89 points or 1.4 percent to 16.599.85.
The move was triggered by expectations that the Fed’s policy will maintain the rate this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
It would be a surprise if the Fed raised rates at this point," he said.
If she does, "she would have to go very far in her statement to calm the financial markets so they don't panic."
Other experts argued that an interest rate hike would calm financial markets because it would remove the uncertainty about when the Fed would trade.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed well on track to raise the rate by 0.25 percentage points this month, the first small step in a slow tightening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of the U.S. recovery.
Yellen had said in the spring and early summer that she expected an increase in the rate this year despite the complaints of liberals that more economic progress would be needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, the improvement in the labour market this year was solid.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years and close to the level the Fed considers full employment.
Wage increases have shown signs of recovery.
And while inflation was consistently below the central bank’s annual 2% target, the Fed representatives said the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices.
The economy “can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension in the labor market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
But financial markets around the world shaken at the end of last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell more than 16% below its peak in May as investors feared a slowdown in the Chinese economy would slow global growth.
The market has somewhat recovered this month, with the Dow now almost 10% below the high of May.
For the Fed representatives, market turbulence affects the complex calculation of when to raise interest rates.
"If the events in the financial markets and the news of the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks, they would have pulled the tricks in this session," said Stephen D. Oliner, senior research fellow at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the U.S. Central Bank.
Now he predicts that she will wait at least a month to get the effects better under control.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact will be on the U.S. economy, and there are almost no reliable data describing developments in China," Oliner said.
The health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the Fed, so it should not be technically involved in its decision-making.
But in the end, the Fed has become the world’s monetary authority.
The influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years.
The mere indication by then-leader Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Fed could “constrain” its monetary expansion caused confusion around the globe.
In a world where markets and economies are increasingly intertwined, Fed representatives can be expected to not only monitor developments elsewhere, but also consult with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy.
Their decision-making is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of global asset management strategy at Envestnet Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, VA., noted this month that “the Fed has a history of overreactions to financial market movements that appear to be unrelated to economic fundamentals.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, who advocates an interest rate hike, cited decisions in 1998/1999 as an example.
A financial crisis in Asia caused the Fed to lower its core interest rate by 0.75 percentage points in three sessions "despite limited noticeable effects on U.S. growth," Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed reversed these cuts.
The Fed should only put aspects of financial stability first during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market crash, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England’s interest rate committee.
Recent turbulences are not coming close to that level, he said.
“She doesn’t want to get into the situation where she’s afraid of an interest rate hike because the markets get upset,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability, and until that is changed, I don’t think it should go ahead of time.
Do you need a great Thai market?
Try LAX-C in Chinatown.
Chinatown
The market/ warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
LAX-C is commonly referred to as Thai Costco and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public.
Yes, he is in Chinatown, not in Thai Town.
The market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a confusing number of fresh, frozen and dried goods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, and dishes, furniture, religious jewelry and Christmas decorations.
There is even a car department if you need motor oil.
The store is huge, and it takes over an hour to stroll through the hallways.
If all the shopping makes you hungry, there is a meal for you at the LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen (good and inexpensive) in this store is located near the box office and has various pick-up options.
What is there here: Do you need something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C is likely to have it.
Products are inexpensive and a number of them are sold in large quantities.
Fresh products include Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs, fruits and much more.
The meat barbecue is extensive, as is the fish barbecue – the staff behind the barbecue will clean and filet the fish and even roast for you on request.
A good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department. Here you will find frozen curry leaves, bitter melon and galgant, whole ducks, fish, beef blood and bile, pig natural intestines, fish balls, regional sausages, commercially prepared foods and more.
Who buys here: restaurant owners and chefs, also individual families and individuals.
The wide passages are suitable for shopping carts and rollers.
You will find here: fresh Monthong Durian next to the box.
Where it is located: The store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original.
Parking: LAX-C has its own parking space, along with other shops and restaurants.
Even though the store is well visited, it is not difficult to find a parking space.
Hoyerswerda: Small life aid for refugees
More and more refugees are arriving in Germany.
Giving you a warm welcome is not possible without the involvement of countless volunteers.
In Hoyerswerda, too, there are a number of people who are self-sufficiently supporting asylum seekers in the city.
These include Petra and Klaus Heine.
Petra Heine is a teacher with body and soul.
She still loves teaching with her 74 lenses.
She does it every Thursday at the asylum-seekers' home on Dillinger Street.
There, she helps refugees from Syria, Kurdistan, Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German.
Of course, this is a very different class than in a real school.
Brazilian pediatric society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS is trying to shockingly educate women about the importance of good nutrition during breastfeeding, by presenting images of babies sucking on breasts painted with depictions of unhealthy foods.
Breast milk consists of a variety of proteins, fats, vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Due to the additional energy requirements, pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day.
However, new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adjustment that mothers should make.
A recent study led by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, an unhealthy diet of the child can negatively affect the immune system.
Exceptions for the new Bernrieder Sporthalle
The municipal council of Bernried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3-million-euro sports hall.
And he made an exception.
The roof can be flat for solar installations.
The planning for the long-awaited gym building at the Bernrieder Sportgelände is progressing step by step: At the recent municipal council meeting, the draft construction proposal was unanimously approved without much discussion.
Previously, the panel had, among other things, decided on a request for a construction law "exception" and "exemption" from the valid construction plan.
The "exception" was about the permission for a special form with regard to the roof construction.
Accordingly, a "sattle roof with non-middle first and roof overhead" is to be built.
The background of the planning is the planned use of the roof area for solar installations: "This gives us a wonderfully large southern roof," Mayor Josef Steigenberger explained at the meeting.
The "liberation" was, in turn, about the roof tilt, which should be below ten degrees for energy reasons - contrary to what is prescribed in the construction plan.
This significantly reduces the volume of the hall.
A "liberation" was therefore necessary because the construction plan does not allow "exceptions" with regard to the roof inclination - whereas the Bernrieder municipal council usually behaves more restrictively when applying for exemptions.
However, the construction of gyms is not a recurring project: "We do not create a precedent," Steigenberger said.
The gym building at the Sportzentrum is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bernried.
The cost is estimated at around 2.3 million euros.
Subsidies are expected from the support of school and broad sport.
In the next step of the procedure, the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will now be submitted to the council to be examined.
Clinic Peißenberg moves to Schongau
The Peißenberg Hospital is scheduled to close earlier than planned – in 2016.
At the same time, Dr. Wilhelm Fischer (66) becomes the new medical director at the Schongau Hospital.
The station and most of the staff move from Peißenberg to Schongau.
This is shown in the surprising plans of the district hospital GmbH, which confirmed the council councillor Andrea Jochner-Weiß.
However, a decision on this will be taken by the Supervisory Board, which will meet on Wednesday, September 23.
If the plans were to be implemented, then all of the 50 employees at the hospital in Peißenberg would continue to work.
The overwhelming majority would move to Schongau with Fischer and the still existing Inner Station.
The spaces exist.
Employees who cannot go to Schongau will be offered a job in Weilheim, according to Jochner-Weiß.
Employees are informed of the plans.
The change has been triggered by the resignation of Dr. Andreas Eder, who has only been medical director of the Schongauer Klinik since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private practice in the immediate vicinity of the hospital.
When asked who would succeed, according to Jochner-Weiß, the name "Fischer" came into play, who stated that he was ready to take the lead from 1 October and move to Schongau with his team.
For the house in Schongau, this means in any case a “upgrade” and an expansion of the offer in the area of “Inner Medicine”, according to Jochner-Weiß.
Fischer is a specialist in heart pacemakers and defibrillators.
Schongau (180 beds) is specialized in gastroenterological diseases at the Inner Station.
Transitionally for the next two years, Fischer and his team, if the supervisory board agrees, will manage both houses, until then next year the former Knappschaft hospital, which still has 35 beds, in Peißenberg after almost 140 years will be finally closed.
So far, the district had planned this for 2018, when the ongoing rehabilitation at the Weilheim Hospital is completed.
Councillor Jochner-Weiß, who is also the chairman of the Supervisory Board, responded to rumors that the house, which is owned by the Bundesknappschaft, will be used in the future as accommodation for asylum weavers.
As it goes on with the property, Jochner-Weiß could not say, there are several considerations.
Currently, there is a short-term care of the Caritas and a day psychiatry.
"What better could not happen to us, such an opportunity will not come again," said Fischer about the quasi move to the Lech, which was received by the staff "positive and very understanding".
A real perspective for the house, where Fischer has been working as a chief physician for over 30 years, did not exist.
He was asked by Schongauer’s colleagues to take over the position of Medical Director.
In recent decades, the Peißenberg Hospital (formerly 100 beds) has been repeatedly threatened with closure, departments have been closed, for example, the surgery and obstetrics.
The handballers of the Rhein-Neckar Löwen are called for tonight (20:15) at the Bergischen HC.
The Bundesliga leader is the clear favorite in Wuppertal, but there is no reason for arrogance.
Last season, the Bathers at BHC suffered a painful defeat and have something to do there.
Hunting accident with two injured at Pratau
Two tractor drivers were seriously injured by gunfire during their corn harvest on Tuesday afternoon.
During the burning on a cornfield near Pratau (Wittenberg district) several hunters were in operation, police said.
After a shooting, a 63-year-old and a 22-year-old man suffered serious injuries and were taken to hospitals.
How exactly the accident occurred was initially unclear.
The criminal police investigate.
Missing 16-year-old from Rheinland-Pfalz victim of violent crimes
A suspect has led the police to the bodies of the 16-year-old from Rheinland-Pfalz, who have been missing since Saturday.
During the interrogation, the 20-year-old admitted to killing the teenagers and throwing their bodies into a canal in Rockenhausen.
A 16-year-old from Rheinland-Pfalz, who has been missing since Saturday, has fallen victim to a violent crime.
The body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rockenhausen near Kaiserslautern, the prosecutor's office and police said on Wednesday.
As the suspect is considered a 20-year-old also arrested on Tuesday evening, who confessed to the act, according to the allegations, and led the investigators to the site of the body.
The 16-year-old was missing on Sunday morning after not coming home as agreed on the eve after a visit to a fall festival in Rockenhausen.
In search of the young woman, investigators first found the victim’s personal belongings.
During interrogations in the friends and acquaintances of the missing people, a suspicion was finally revealed against the 20-year-old.
The suspected perpetrator then led the police to a canal in Rockenhausen, where the body was found.
The detainee, according to the authorities, admitted in the police interrogation that he killed the 16-year-old and placed the body in the canal.
The 20-year-old was due to be presented to the arrest judge on Wednesday, the investigators charged him with murder.
Clarification of the circumstances of the incident will lead to further investigations.
Refugees need housing: study warns of housing gaps
The situation in the German housing market is tense.
More and more refugees are looking for affordable accommodation.
The pressure on the housing market is growing.
Social housing is facing a challenge.
The distribution struggle on the German housing market has already begun.
With the arrival of refugees and job seekers from the EU, more and more people are pushing into a market that is already overloaded in many major cities.
They are competing with low-income citizens for the last affordable housing.
To meet the demand for affordable housing, 400,000 new units will need to be built every year by 2020.
To this conclusion comes a study commissioned by the association "Social housing construction".
This year, 260,000 units will be completed in Germany.
There are 140,000 houses.
After the first three months of their stay, refugees are no longer required to live in an initial accommodation as asylum seekers.
Many then stumble onto the housing market and ran into the long queues in front of the rental apartments.
According to the Federal Bureau of Statistics, less than half of all asylum seekers lived in rent last year.
However, the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees.
The study also highlights significant failures in housing policy in recent years.
Germany is facing a housing deficit that is growing year by year.
Currently, about 770,000 units of housing are missing in urban areas, complains Matthias Günther, the study’s author.
Many working professionals therefore lived in big cities in WG rooms.
Young adults unwillingly stayed longer in the "Hotel Mama" due to the flute on the housing market.
In the major cities, the number of square meters per capita has declined for the first time in recent years.
To solve the problem, the Social Housing Alliance proposes a restart.
New incentives should boost social housing.
Thus, the land sales tax could be waived and the land tax on supported housing could be suspended temporarily.
In addition, attractive tax depreciation options are needed.
The State Bank KfW’s refugee accommodation support program is already reaching out to cities and municipalities.
A good week after the launch, more than half of the available €300 million had already been raised on Monday evening with €184 million.
Now the project could even be expanded.
Croatia and Slovenia open a corridor for refugees
There is virtually no passage to Hungary, as more and more refugees choose the route through Croatia.
Zagreb announces that it will allow the transit through Slovenia to the north without obstacles.
However, the route is dangerous.
Croatia wants to negotiate with neighboring Slovenia on the creation of a refugee corridor.
“I spoke with the Slovenian interior minister and if necessary, we will organize a corridor,” Croatian Interior Minister Ranko Ostojic said.
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area.
Croatia is not a Schengen country.
After the closure of the Serbian-Hungarian border, hundreds of refugees have fled to Croatia to reach Western Europe.
500 people have crossed the border near Tovarnik, the Croatian television channel RTL.
Hungary closed its border for refugees.
In addition, new laws, which came into force on the same day, make ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary practically superfluous.
Croatia wants to allow refugees to pass.
Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Milanovic said: "You can travel through, and we are preparing for this possibility."
These people are there, they are women, children and men who want to live and something.
However, there are people who did not want to live in Croatia.
The Croatian police captured the first refugees on the border of Serbia with the EU neighbor Croatia.
According to media reports, most of them came from Syria, Iran and Afghanistan.
They arrived in the Serbian border city of Sid by bus and taxi.
Immediately after their arrival, they had tried to cross the green border to Croatia on foot.
At the Croatian-Serbian border, refugees do not encounter border barriers.
The border strip has other dangers: there are still sharp mines from the Yugoslav Civil War in the 1990s.
Miners should now quickly create a safe passage.
There are no more refugees coming to Hungary after the closure of the border.
On Tuesday, the police counted 366 people arrested.
Shortly before the proposal on Monday, there were still 9380.
The new Hungarian laws classify crossing and damaging the border fence as a crime.
Therefore, 35 criminal proceedings have been initiated in the southern Hungarian border city of Szeged.
The convicted are facing prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country.
According to the immigration authority, a total of 94 asylum applications were received on Tuesday in the newly established "transit zones" at the border, almost all of which - 93 - at the most important crossing Röszke.
Among the applicants are 13 families with young children and two elderly people.
There were 40 refugees there on Wednesday morning.
However, no one has the prospect of obtaining asylum in Hungary.
Hungary considers Serbia a “safe third country”.
Refused asylum seekers should be deported.
In front of the “transition zone” in Röszke, only a few hundred refugees were gathered.
In Röszke, workers started cleaning up with it.
They gathered the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left on the streets in recent weeks.
Barrier grids were removed and one of the reception warehouses in the border town was reconstructed.
No one wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion.
Austria has closed the border between Serbia and Hungary.
The country has also strengthened its border controls.
About 20,000 migrants remained in the country, according to government data.
In Salzburg, about 1,400 people are waiting for the journey to Germany.
Train traffic from there to Germany was stopped this morning on the instructions of German authorities.
Freilassing regularly encountered smaller groups of refugees on foot.
The mayor drove "Gestrandete" across the border
"We were busy cleaning up after the bridge party on Sunday, when suddenly ten people with suitcases stood at the entrance of the tent," said Wernstein's mayor Alois Stadler.
Tourists, they wanted to take the train to Passau.
"Because Germany on Sunday had suddenly stopped rail traffic with Austria due to the flow of refugees, it was over for them in Wernstein," said Stadler, who immediately offered his help and drove the stranded together with two other helpers and their cars across the border to Near Passau.
Previously, we had the unexpected guests delighted with jauses and drinks.
We immediately said we will take you by car to Passau.
“That was obvious to us,” Stadler said in an OÖN conversation.
You were very grateful.
A man did not let go of giving a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire department.
“We were very pleased,” said Stadler.
The trains passengers were stranded in Wels on Sunday evening from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passau, in order to try to cross the border after the short-term announcement that rail traffic to Germany was stopped.
The regional train was stopped outside the border in Wernstein am Inn.
In Wernstein, cross-border transactions are generally high in course.
The brückenfest connected with the Bavarian neighbors on Sunday socially, the day before a two-bridge run sporty - organized by the Union Wernstein and Bavaria from Neukirchen.
That Viktor Orbán is now sending hundreds of thousands more to us is a logical result of a hypocritical policy:
Instead of immediately helping in the Röszke camp to establish structures that guarantee humanity, our Chancellor has highly officially and publicly pushed the position of the Hungarian government into the dunk circle of National Socialism.
Sufferers of this policy are not only those Austrians who are now facing chaotic conditions in the border areas.
The refugees will also have to realize that the “promised land” they have invited and welcomed is nothing but another refugee camp.
It will be a major challenge, given the ongoing flow of refugees and the coming winter, to create dignified conditions for refugees in our country.
And there will be one even greater –ining peace, security and stability in Austria.
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter-fashioned neighborhoods
Konrad has all hands to do with the refugee accommodation.
Christian Konrad is accustomed to the weight of his word.
The government has used the former powerful Raiffeisen banker to set up neighborhoods for the thousands of refugees.
The chaos at the Traiskirchen first recording centre has already gotten Konrad in control.
“We no longer have homeless people in Traiskirchen,” he said of his first success.
Even the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had arrived in Austria on Monday was done without much turmoil, Konrad said, praising the organizational "mastery achievement".
The Interior Ministry spoke of a “crisis situation.”
In total, Konrad expects to need 85,000 neighborhoods this year.
In order to meet the number, 35,000 more accommodations will need to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 will be provided by the states, 15,000 by the federal government.
If there are more refugees, we can do it.
“But it’s not a barrel without soil,” Konrad said.
He has already held talks with the heads of state.
They had promised to create neighborhoods for future refugees as well.
“It is going well in Upper Austria,” said Ferry Maier.
The former VP-mandatar supports Konrad.
Tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schönborn to clarify how the Church will help.
The asylum coordinator also puts great expectations on the ORF-action "Help like us".
On the platform, individuals can offer accommodation easily.
There are also hotels that are empty in the winter.
Konrad and Maier yesterday criticized the standards for accommodation as “very high.”
In times of emergency, it may not be that neighborhoods must observe a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the upper lights.
For a limited period of time, “emergency standards” would have to apply.
That, unlike the Ministry of the Interior, he was more successful in accommodation, Konrad justifies by his experience.
I am an elderly gentleman who is not always told the lie in the face.
Persuasion is his most important weapon.
Konrad and Maier do not incur costs to the Republic, as they themselves declared.
Increase the number of employees to three to four.
The quarters search has so far been unsuccessful.
Konrad wanted to set up a container at Stephansplatz as an office.
However, there are problems with the approval.
Linz calls for better distribution
For now, no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips-Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees is planned by the city of Linz.
This is not necessary at the moment, as you can currently accommodate those affected without these measures, says Mayor Klaus Luger (SP).
In case of emergency, other locations should be tested for their suitability.
The head of the city criticizes the distribution of refugees within the federal state.
Other municipalities should also contribute to this.
Seehofer: “The borders are not sealed”
In a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst Seehofer (CSU), Landeshauptmann Josef Pühringer (VP) on Monday indicated the further action on the refugee issue.
Seehofer assured me that the German borders would not be sealed.
It is still possible for refugees to travel to the Federal Republic.
However, the corresponding border controls are now in place.
There will no longer be special trains carrying refugees to Germany.
However, those seeking protection would be brought to Germany by regular trains.
From the other EU member states, Pühringer once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue.
Austria’s re-introduction of border controls is for Pühringer “a logical consequence” of the German actions.
Next Runtastic is a matter of time
The general renovation of the "Neuen Werft" in the Linz industrial line is officially completed.
In four of the six floors of the office and production building, the listed IT group S&T has moved, the rest (2700 square meters) will be leased to young, innovative companies from the technology sector.
“In IT, the smart minds are our raw material – and we must try to get them to work for us,” says S&T CEO Hannes Niederhauser.
He could imagine investing in start-up companies at the Neue Werft and later acquiring them.
From the very beginning, S&T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - which Niederhauser promises itself: "The next Runtastic is only a matter of time."
1.7 million euros were invested by S&T in the site, 3.3 million euros from Techcenter, which belongs to one-third of the city of Linz, the state of Upper Austria and the federal government (FFG).
The building is leased by Linz AG to S&T and Techcenter for 60 years.
30% of the remaining 2,700 square meters of the building are already rented, for another 40% there are requests.
Lia-Peroni owner opens second store in the arcade
In the new shop, Furla handbags are the focus.
In fact, Jutta Breit wanted to get a dog.
This project had to be postponed by the 49-year-old owner of Lia Peroni in the pigeon market arcade: finally, it has now gained growth in the form of another business premises.
In the Furla store opposite the store, where she sells, among other things, bags, suitcases, shoes and clothes from various manufacturers, it is now all about having women’s handbags of the brand Furla, wallets are from 75 euros.
Larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros.
The new store has been in operation since yesterday.
It was rebuilt several weeks ago.
“I’ve been thinking for a long time about opening another store,” Breit says.
Decisive for the decision was, among other things, that the Furla producers, who are home in Bologna, were also motivated by the idea of their own site, where only their handbags are sold.
"We are the only ones in the large area of Linz that sell this brand," says the mother of two daughters, who has Italian roots.
Her fashion interest has been widespread by her mother.
I find it best when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices.
Why so many women get stuck in the sight of a beautiful handbag, even the professional can not answer with the last certainty.
Per it’s because a beautiful bag enhances every outfit.
The Brulljesmacher from Kallstadt
The pallzer ancestors of Donald Trump came from a place whose inhabitants are called donors.
This characteristic is also associated with the billionaire who wants to become President of the United States.
Donald Trump (69) is always good for oppressors.
Whether he speaks xenophobically, defies journalists or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy – the candidate for the U.S. presidential office is heavily stirring up the election campaign.
Cut it off well.
This is also recorded in Pfalz, where the real estate billionaire’s grandparents came from.
The New Yorker with the hairstyle is a term for many in the wine village on the Wine Route.
Some in the 1200 inhabitants-place is more than -ten corners related to it.
His grandfather came from Kallstadt in the Pfalz: Donald Trump, here in campaign mode.
Simone Wendel made a film about Trump.
And what do the villagers think about his goal of becoming the most powerful man in the world?
"I think they find it somehow exciting, but they are not so deeply impressed in their cold-starring style," says Simone Wendel.
The native cold-city woman has shot a fun documentary about the place and its famous breeds, among which, in addition to Trump, the ketchup family Heinz is included.
Trump, who is not known for modesty, also comes to the floor in "Kings of Kallstadt" (2014) - so with the statement that he would surely also succeed if he lived in Kallstadt.
He did not bring it to the King of Hearts.
While there is respect for the family’s performance, there is also a tendency to think that Trump is “already a bit of a big mouth,” says Wendel.
Coincidentally, the nickname that Kallstadt has in its vicinity is "Die Brulljesmacher" - in high-German: the Angeber, she says.
Trump is from the village of Angeber.
Trump’s success story began in 1885 when his later grandfather emigrated and opened a gold mining facility in the United States.
The foundation of the real estate group was the first purchase of land in New York.
However, the grandparents' life was not free of tragedy: their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed in the Bavarian state, to which the palace belonged at the time.
He did not accept Trump because he once left without permission, the director of the Institute for Pfalz History and Folk Studies, Roland Paul, had declared to the film launch.
Trump is the grandson of an illegal immigrant.
This contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants.
He had repeatedly spoken out against Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and called for the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants.
"Just like the polter, that's not so sympathetic," says Hans-Joachim Bender, a distant relative of Trump ("Grandma was a born Trump, grandfather was a born Heinz").
The retired winemaker sees the American rather distanced, “he’s always so upset.”
Do you think Trump will come?
“I can’t imagine that,” said the 72-year-old.
“He never took care of Cold Town.”
Pension host Veronika Schramm mentioned, like some Kallstadter, that a descendant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit, which generally went well.
“I can’t imagine that about Donald,” said the 68-year-old.
She would find it better if he didn’t win the election because “he has such radical views, I don’t know if that’s good.”
If those who had said it at the time of his grandfather in the United States were like him, “he would never have arrived there.”
“There are more interesting topics than him,” says Sarah Bühler, the daughter of the winemaker.
As a President?
“It’s not my president,” she says.
“The grapes will ripen even without President Trump.”
Wendel’s film, for which Trump has long been interviewed, has seen 12,000 movie viewers, also in the US the interest is awakening.
The upper Bavarian municipality of Ramsau near Berchtesgaden is Germany’s first mountain village.
From the hand of the vice president of the German Alpine Association, Ludwig Wucherpfennig, the 1800 inhabitants village in the Berchtesgaden National Park on Wednesday received the award for gentle tourism.
There are 20 mountain villages in Austria.
In the neighbouring country, the Alpine Club is responsible for awarding the award.
A mountain village may have a maximum of 2,500 inhabitants.
At least one-fifth of its area must be designated as a protected area.
Seven's Sunrise dominates the ratings, despite Nine's attempts to take on the loss of leadership at the Today Show
Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson rush to Canberra to report after losing the leadership of the Liberals, but it has not made any major shifts in the ratings for Today.
Nine's breakfast show was broadcast from the federal capital when Malcolm Turnbull managed to overthrow Tony Abbott.
The Rivale Sunrise, hosted by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was in London as part of a one-week series of international television shows including Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This disadvantage of distance did not seem to matter to Australian TV viewers, as Sunrise reached an average of 397,000 viewers in the five capitals, compared to Today 339,000.
Today recorded a slight increase compared to Monday’s (317,000) and Last Tuesday’s (283,000) ratings, but its number fell behind last Thursday’s (343,000).
Today has closed the gap to Sunrise in recent months.
In August, Today reached an average of 318,000 compared to Sunrise’s 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has an average of 349,000 viewers, up from 314,000 on Today.
This is the most interesting thing that happens every morning.
The winds of change affect these people more than the parliament!
Karl and Lisa are okay, thank you for checking out!

The big news for Seven was the impressive 800-word debut with former Packed to the Rafters star Erik Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed father deciding to settle on the coast of New Zealand with his two children reached a very impressive 1,219 million viewers.
Critics had wondered if Thomson could wear a hit show solo without the Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night answered this with a clear “yes”.
The X-Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,136 million viewers and slightly beat The Block (838,000) and TBL Families (726,000).
Seven had mixed results on evening two of The Chase Australia.
The first half-hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new quiz show, moderated by Andrew O'Keefe, generated an average of 446,000 spectators.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) jumped to 623,000 spectators – enough for a small victory over Eddie McGuire’s hot seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of The Chase Australia reached 520,000 spectators and in the second half-hour was 720,000.
Hot seats on average 620,000.
The decline in the odds of the second evening of The Chase Australia will make Nine confident that Hot-Seat will eventually prevail at 17:30.
The Chase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that failed to overtake McGuire's show.

The last three agree: Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose?
A secret revealed?
Lana Jeavons-Fellows, Sarah Mackay and Snezana Markoski may have unknowingly revealed who will win The Bachelor.
The woman with whom Sam Wood ended up landing in The Bachelor was wrapped in utmost secrecy.
And none of the three remaining girls will surely reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose.
But when we checked in with Sarah Mackay, Snezana Markoski, and Lana Jeavons-Fellows the day before the three became two, you may have accidentally given a hint of who will be the winner.
Sam Wood holds his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
All three women were lyrical about why Wood is the perfect man, naming his sense of humor, ambition, family values and positive attitude as reasons why they want to be his partner.
However, when the question is asked, "If not you, who should get Woods' last rose?", her answers could be the game destroyer who won the heart of the bachelor.
Jeavons-Fellows and Markoski both quickly named Mackay the best partner for Wood.
Sarah Mackay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day.
“From the moment I went into the house and noticed [Sarah’s] and Sam’s energies, I felt they were pretty compatible, and I’ve been thinking about it throughout the show,” Jeavons-Fellows said.
"Sarah stands with both feet on the ground, it's so fun to be with her," Markoski added.
I’ve seen them together and they have the right chemistry.
They feel comfortable and comfortable with each other.
Sarah Mackay believes she and Sam Wood would be a good couple.
From her point of view, Mackay said last week’s home visit made her clear that Wood could be “the One.”
"As soon as I saw him with my friends and family, I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I'm now unreservedly set to him," she said.
And when asked whom Wood should vote for if not her, she was mysterious.
“I don’t know if I can say that,” she said.
I love the remaining girls equally - it's a draw between Snezana and Lana.
The Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten on Wednesday, 19:30.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after his move to the U.S. - and there were many other teams sending requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsula and it looks like a wise decision.
Some coaches had banished Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game when he lost a gerangel like the Aussie Rugby League converter did on his first Punt return on Tuesday in a 20-3 win against Minnesota.
But Tomsula trusted his husband and gave Hayne the next chance for a Punt return and also into the ongoing game after a Reggie Bush injury.
Tomsula continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game.
Instead of grinding his rookies through the mill before the rest of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly reinforced Hayne in his post-match press conference.
The 49ers sports reporter Cam Inman that Hayne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas McGaughey, who advised him to forget his patched catch and take care of the next game.
Jarryd Hayne paths at a point recovered in the first game quarter by the Minnesota Vikings
It wasn’t the start Hayne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for his NFL debut.
Hayne left the field after the Fumble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Hamish & Andy on 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his NFL career.
“That’s one thing that happens, you only care about the next game, and that’s it,” Hayne said.
Hayne compared the Schnitzer to his origin debut at the time in 2007, when a pass at his own in-goal area led to a try for Queensland.
Overall, it was a great experience for the 27-year-old.
Hayne posed for a photo with fans holding an Australian flag after the match and posted it on his Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss gay rights
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia’s richest man, was arrested on a Siberian role-playing field with arms.
After openly challenging President Vladimir Putin, Khodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company Yukos confiscated, and his democratic efforts disrupted.
Freie Wähler demands the hiring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria due to the high number of refugees.
At the beginning of the autumn closure in Großwallstadt, party and group leader Hubert Aiwanger warned of a serious crisis in Bavarian schools if there are no new teachers for the many new students: "We need at least 1,000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse," Aiwanger said.
"Otherwise, we will get distortions in the Bavarian education system."
The Landtag Fraktion of the Free Voters will meet until Friday in the sub-fränkische Kommune.
In fact, very different topics were planned.
But the record number of refugees now dominates the Free Voter Meeting.
"Of course, the issue of asylum will overlay the clause," Aiwanger said.
Aiwanger called for the establishment of UN shelter zones for refugees in Syria, as they did during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s.
"This is not the way it goes on, we have to deal with the causes," said the head of the Free Voters.
Refused asylum seekers want to expel free voters as soon as possible.
Therefore, Aiwanger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum lawsuits: "We also need at least 50 new asylum judges," Aiwanger said.
The head of the FW criticized that several federal states are not consistent: "We need unified standards of the federal states across the country."
“Bayern pushes down, others don’t.”
“We need to be more capable.”
However, the country policy should not fall under the table in Großwallstadt.
A long-standing burner remains on the agenda: education policy.
For the new school year, Minister of Culture Ludwig Spaenle (CSU) has launched the pilot experiment "Middle level plus" at 47 high schools, in which an extension of the high school middle level from three to four years is tested - as a result, it will take another nine years to reach the high school.
But this is not going far enough for Aiwanger.
"The issue of the G9 needs to be accelerated," said the head of the FW.
We demand freedom of choice for all high schools who want it.
Free ride with the G9 wherever desired.
Stronger Wall Street Helps Dax to jump
The German stock market has closed with profits after a long-distance directionless and nervous trading course.

The medium-sized MDax gained 0.54 percent to 19.552.88 points.
TecDax increased by 1.03 percent to 1736.69 points.

Many stock marketers expect that the markets will be on the spot until after the interest rate decision in the U.S. and also the great decline on futures exchanges this Friday.
The discussion about the burdens of the nuclear withdrawal has pushed RWE shares to a record low in the meantime, leaving profound traces even on Eon.
According to Spiegel, the German energy companies may be lacking 30 billion euros in reserves.
The federal government denied the figures in the press.
The shares of the two largest German energy companies then recovered somewhat, but ultimately lost 3.31 percent (RWE) and 6.15 percent (Eon).
Infineon shares rose by another 3.22 percent at the Dax top.
According to a trader, a positive report by U.S. investor magazine "Barron's" from the weekend worked out.
Therefore, investors have paid too little attention to the German chipmaker at the moment.
Investments in future-oriented wafer technologies and the focus on the automotive market should pay off.
Even in the traditionally weak summer month of August, more cars were dropped than in the previous period, as the industry association Acea announced at the start of the International Automobile Exhibition IAA in Frankfurt.

The dollar was then priced at 0.8846 (0.8875) euros.
Four killed after police shoot rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after police fired rubber bullets at a crowd protesting against the proposed new constitution, a official said on Wednesday.
Violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rupandehi district, about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, senior district official, said more than 1,000 protesters had gathered outside a police station, some of them throwing stones and fire bombs.
Mr Dhakal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before resorting to rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were injured, he said.
It was not immediately clear why the used rubber bullets, known to kill but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, apparently produced such a high rate of death.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in Nepal’s southern levels, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group say new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence.
There were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Tharus who want their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been in violent clashes since the 10th.
August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces – a major step towards a new constitution, but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been governed centrally for centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
Legislators voted on certain clauses in the Kathmandu draft constitution this week, and officials said the new constitution could come into force on Sunday.
Construction planned in the city
The estate at the Emder Youth Centre Alte Post will be rebuilt.
The city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area.
A mixture of trade, business and housing is planned - but there are no concrete offers yet.
Emden - The city of Emden plans to market a plot of approximately 4000 square meters in the immediate vicinity of the Alte Post Youth Centre.
Preparations for this are currently underway.
It is planned to use the land for a mixture of commerce, commerce and housing.
We are waiting for an offer, the city said.
Which investor is involved is not yet clear.
Accordingly, no contracts have yet been concluded.
The city of Emden had already bought a portion of the plot located on the Ringstraße / Corke Große Straße a few months ago and had the building on it demolished.
Project Hieve: Details are on the table
The plans for a holiday home settlement on the Little Sea near Emden are taking shape.
The investor presented plans for the project publicly for the first time.
Many investors are still worried - they fear the sale of their holiday shelter
For months it had been negotiated behind closed doors, grumbled, debated and drawn.
Now the plans for a new holiday home settlement on the Little Sea near Emden are on the table.
The interested party, the medium-sized Emder company "System-Bau", presented its plans publicly for the first time in the city development committee of the Emder Council on Monday evening.
This was originally on the non-public agenda.
Under pressure from the project critics and the FDP faction accusing the investor and administration of covertness, Ralf Behrends from the System Construction business management went into the offensive: “We haven’t yet gotten an answer to all questions,” he said in front of council members and more than 50 visitors.
But it is good to be able to face all the rumors now.
The project, worth between 10 and 12 million euros, has been under discussion for months.
Heated reactions among seabode owners who had come to the meeting sparked the pictures and new details of the desired hotel construction.
Roberto Schulz, owner of a seaboard and a member of the board of directors at the interest representation of the investors, Pro Hieve, complains: "This will be a giant barrel that surpasses all other buildings."
In addition, he fears, like many other project critics, that traffic would increase significantly due to the planned size of the facility: "There must come entire bus loads, so that this can be counted," Schulz said.
However, what exactly is happening on the well-acredited one-hectare area of the former cottage is still open.
There is no operator yet.
“First we need to have a conclusive concept,” said Ralf Behrends.
As this was still lacking, the construction plans are also variable.
Twins with gorillas at Frankfurt Zoo
The Frankfurt Zoo is happy to have offspring with its gorillas.
The 26-year-old Dian gave birth to twins.
Twins are rare in gorillas.
The last one in a German zoo is almost 50 years ago and was also in Frankfurt in 1967, according to the zoo.
The gender of the newborn gorilla twins is not yet determined, as mother Dian still holds them tightly to the body.
First was the “image”.
NHC predicts 60 percent chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
The U.S. National Hurricane Center on Tuesday predicted a broad-deep-pressure system about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southernmost Cape Verde Islands, which has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical tornado in the next 48 hours.
Another clearly defined low-pressure system such as in the middle between the Cape Verde Islands and the Little Antilles also has a 60 percent potential to form a tropical whirlwind over the next two days, Miami-based weather experts added.
Google launches double donation campaign to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) announced a double-donation campaign to raise $11 million to humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who have overwhelmed European nations as they flee from war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google has an unusually personal approach to announcing the donation call on its blog.
Instead of having a manager make the announcement, Rita Masoud, a Google employee who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, wrote about her personal experiences.
"Our trip included many dark train and bus trips, as well as hunger, thirst, cold and fear," she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe, many people like my family are desperately looking for help.
The donations go to four non-profit organizations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, International Rescue Committee, Save the Children and the UN High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said the first globally collected donations up to a value of 5.5 million on google.com/refugeerelief will be doubled to $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, largely caused by the four-year civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing the war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For slightly overweight diabetics, weight loss surgery can be helpful.
The benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years, according to a new study.
It’s still too early to say whether slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those receiving non-surgical treatments.
"The mortality data takes a long time to show something," said Dr. Robin Blackstone, a weight loss surgeon who wrote a editorial on the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Weight loss surgeries or obesity surgery, use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, obesity surgeries have proven to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people who are morbidly obese with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a certain level of weight in terms of size, is considered to be normal between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight, and people with a BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers from Taiwan’s Min-Sheng General Hospital used data they have collected since 2007 in a study comparing two types of obesity surgery – gastric bypass and gastric tube formation – to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight.
The average BMI among those undergoing this surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year in this study.
Meanwhile, the BMI in those receiving non-surgical diabetes treatments remained roughly the same in 29.
Among those who underwent surgery, 36% completely resolved diabetes and 28% partially.
In the medical-treated group, compared with this, diabetes resolved completely only at one percent and in some cases only about two percent.
In addition, the results in blood pressure, triglyceride and “bad” LDL cholesterol controls were “generally better in the “surgical” group,” the authors found.
The researchers also monitored patient blood levels of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects blood sugar levels over time.
Hemoglobin A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c level dropped from about 9 percent to about 6 percent.
In the medical therapy group, however, it remained stable at about 8 percent.
But this better “glycemic control” – as reflected in improved hemoglobin A1c levels – did not reduce mortality in five years, according to lead researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared average results on the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, the bypass surgical group had lost more weight (18.7 vs. 14.2 kg) compared to the gastrectomy group, achieved greater decreases in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) and more likely to complete overcoming diabetes (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not show survival benefit from surgery after five years, there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to longer lives, says Blackstone of the University of Arizona, College of Medicine Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who underwent obesity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years – compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study showed no survival benefit among surgical patients, Blackstone said it was reassuring for people with a BMI below 35 who are interested in the procedure.
"That's the critical point of this study because it says that this surgery is lower in this lower BMI group," without an increased risk of death or kidney disease, she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with their BMI is between 27 and 30.
“I think we’re waiting too long to get people to take this seriously,” she said.
I think once they’ve accumulated those genetic changes that have linked their bodies to obesity and diabetes, reversing it is really hard.”
A love story in Hunsrück
It is a topic that is currently gaining increasing attention in the literature: a young woman, unpopular and unpleasant in schooltime, after years meets with the sword of her youth, and it falls in love with her.
This is the case in the novel “We Are Not So” by Luisa Binder.
Beyond the love story, the novel is likely to be interesting especially for Hunsrücker readers, because it plays in Langweiler and the surrounding villages.
The main professional author grew up in Langweiler and is pleased that she was able to set a literary monument to her hometown.
“It’s impossible for anyone to come to Europe” – Dalai Lama
Europe cannot accept all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the countries of refugees.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten-day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethics studies.
He demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of individual nations or even continents.
He also stressed that while the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is admirable, it is not appropriate to the situation.
“It’s impossible for anyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria's efforts to cope with the crisis, he stressed that it was only a temporary solution.
"Taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful, but in the meantime you have to think about long-term solutions to how true peace and real development, mainly through education, can be created for these Muslim countries," he said.
Ultimately, we need to think about how to reduce killing in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of violence.
"The use of force has never solved these problems," he added.
The Dalai Lama addressed the problem of violence and also commented on George Bush’s actions following the September 11 terrorist attacks, showing that the violent response of the United States resulted in a chain of uncontrollable events.
After 9/11, I expressed my condolences in a letter to President Bush, and I told him that the way to solve this problem lies in non-violence.
"I know his motives were good, but he used violence, and that has caused unexpected consequences," the Dalai Lama said.
Fourfold increase in children’s use of hand disinfectant in last 4 years
Poison control centers in the U.S. report a 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age who swallow heavily alcoholic hand disinfectants, according to the Georgia Poison Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia Poison Center, cases of taking hand disinfectants in children under the age of 12 reporting poison control centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children are increasingly coming to these products, and unfortunately a percentage of them end up going to the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children deliberately drink disinfectant, while some do so to impress their friends or because of a test of courage on social media.
Videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinfectant just for a cheap experience.
Teenagers allegedly mixed disinfectants with alcoholic mouthwater to get a harder drink.
Younger children can be attracted to the attractive scents of disinfectants.
“A child doesn’t think this is bad for him,” Lopez said.
Many of the more attractive (hand disinfectants) are those that are perfumed.
There are disinfectants with stinks of strawberries, grapes and oranges, which are very appealing for children.
Hand disinfectants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol.
Especially in young children, a few injections can lead to alcohol poisoning.
“It’s highly concentrated alcohol,” Dr. Stephen Thornton, medical director of the Poison Emergency Center at the University of Kansas Hospital, told Fox 4 in Kansa City.
So, you’t let a swallow of whisky stand around, but people leave these hand disinfectants within reach of children, and when children come to it, then it’s a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who had recently taken four injections of strawberry-smelling hand disinfectant in school, was taken to an emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol concentration was 179, twice the threshold that is legally considered to be drunk in an adult, said Dr. Chris Ritchey, an emergency care doctor who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah lamented her words and was unable to walk when she arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children’s hospital for signs of brain trauma as the girl fell through alcohol and struck her head, Ritchey said.
“It was very frightening,” said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, to CNN.
It could have been fatal to my child.
Lopez has advised parents and teachers to use non-alcoholic products or disinfectant towels and store hand disinfectant outside the reach of the child.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some disinfectants were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after swallowing hand disinfectants containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
Health authorities suspect the product contained methanol, a deadly solution, instead of ethyl alcohol, which was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in the state of New York planned to poison their "common" teacher by laying antibacterial products around the classroom, according to a police report.
The teacher is highly allergic to hand disinfectant and banished her from her room.
The police regarded the defeated plan as a "discourse" and referred disciplinary measures to the school authority.
Villingen-Schwenningen: Three vehicles damaged
In a car accident on the crossroad between Nordring and On Herdenen, a 33-year-old car driver was slightly injured in a car accident.
A 60-year-old truck driver was driving on the crossroad toward Circuit Circuit Industrial Area and noticed too late that two vehicles had stopped in front of the Circuit Circuit.
He then crashed his truck into the rear of an Audi and pushed that vehicle onto a Ford Fiesta standing in front of it.
The damage caused to the vehicles involved amounted to approximately 10,000 euros, the police said.
The 33-year-old’s Audi was no longer ready to drive and had to be dragged off.
No disharmony at Celtic
Griffiths plays down the talk of Disharmonie at Celtic Glasgow, Deila admits that the Hoops are in a bad place, but that he will reverse it again.
Hearts will fight SFA over Neilson’s accusation and Warburton will be cautious about January’s new commitments that could destroy the unity of the cadre
Dons raise leadership over Celtic to five points
ADAM Rooney's eleven meters in the first half gave Aberdeen a short win over Hamilton in Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to create a five-point gap between themselves and Celtic.
Griffiths plays down talk about disharmony
There are rumors of disharmony at Celtic Glasgow, which was spontaneously rejected by Griffiths, who insisted that he and his teammates are not under increased control as they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader.
I don’t think we feel under pressure, I think the players look forward to it.
The lack of title competition in Scottish football bores Dutch - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch national player Ronald de Boer has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as there is no title rivalry with the Rangers.
De Boer, currently an ambassador for Ajax, said: “In the Netherlands they no longer show highlights of Celtic games and why?”
It’s because the Rangers aren’t there.
People here are not just talking about the return of the Rangers.
You are talking about the old company.
They talk about both teams together and that’s what they’re interested in.
There’s a lot of excitement in the Old Firm games, and it’s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games.
I will turn things around, swears Deila.
RONNY Deila has accepted that Celtic has to fight, but the Norwegian boss vowed to reverse things.
After the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent exit from the Champions League, the defeat was followed by the 10-man from Aberdeen, who are now clearly at the top of the table with five-point advance.
Deila said, “Celtic had bad times before, and we will come back.”
Now we want to get out of there as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and a lot of people are very, very angry or sad about what’s happening.
We feel that way, but we have to go on.
We really, really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better.
Standing together is so important.
Warburton wary of January transfers
Despite his comments just a few weeks ago that suggested he was sparking some January transfers, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is cautious about signing new additions and insists he doesn’t want to disrupt the unity of the Ibrox frame.
The former chief of Brentford said: “The January transfer window is very different from the summer window.”
The players coming in the summer have this pre-season time to integrate what you’ve seen with our own group this season.
The team is really good.
Sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need.
Celtic target Michu with withdrawal notice
Swansea striker Michu, who was in conversation with Celtic during the transfer period, has suggested that he could withdraw if his contract with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been struggling with an annoying ankle for two years and has failed to leave Wales this summer.
Hearts on SFA battle cancelled due to Neilson's comments
The Hearts led 2:1 when Paterson was sent out of the field and then lost 3:2, but the defender’s red card was later revoked – Collum’s third red card, which was revoked in eight months.
Neilson holds on to what he said, insisting, “I have not questioned integrity, I have not commented on performance.”
Griffiths vows to avoid Tynecastle
The irreparable Hibee was ransomed after admitting to singing a song with offensive lyrics about ex-hearts player Rudi Skacel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before an Edinburgh derby in Tynecastle in March 2014.
“It was a derby, and it was the heat of the moment,” the attacker said, adding, “it’s safe to say I won’t go back to Tynecastle unless it plays for Celtic Glasgow.”
Tannadice Supervisory Board has confidence in Dundee United management
Simon Donnelly insists that the board of directors of Dundee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things around - but admits that the downturn must end on the pitch.
I think Stephen Thompson has confidence in us.
We’ll get the boys back on track,” Donnelly said.
McInnes is happy to win against Hamilton.
Derek McInnes acknowledges that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Accies to see a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a five-point edge ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Rooney’s eleven meters in the first half.
McInnes said, “There is no team that has won everything, in cup games or leagues, that hasn’t won games of this kind.”
Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while rising in the UK as a whole.
Unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 164,000 between May and July, while the number of unemployed people for the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million over the same period.
Scotland’s unemployment rate of 5.9 percent was higher than the UK’s of 5.5 percent, according to figures from the Office of National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 over the three months, with the number of employees now at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0 percent over the quarter, a figure above the UK average of 73.5 percent.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell commented on the latest figures, saying: “The government’s long-term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It’s been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decrease in unemployment.
Drunk disrupted the process.
As security personnel could not satisfy the situation, employees called the police.
Only with the use of pepper spray could the officers arrest the intruders.
A breath alcohol test found 0.89 per cent in a 16-year-old.
The grown-up was picked up by his mother.
A 28-year-old had 2.15 promile and was initially detained.
Why I Will Be Witnessing an Execution in Oklahoma
A little later today, except for a late legal intervention, I will watch a man be put to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn’t happen, I’ll sit in a spectator gallery in the death chamber at Oklahoma State Penitentiary when Richard Glossip is executed by the poison injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation first came in January via his best friend, and although I was shocked, I agreed.
As the day approached, I began to be afraid.
So why should I do it?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty.
It would offer a unique perspective.
It is true that journalists are allowed to see executions in the U.S., and since there are often more applications than seats available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be elected.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of media locations from 12 to five.
Those who are chosen will observe it emotionally.
I cannot do it.
I will sit next to Richard Glossip’s closest friend, with whom I’ve developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two-and-a-half-hour visit.
I like the guy.
We laugh a lot when we talk.
The prison authorities say I cannot be a witness and a journalist, so I will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see.
I just have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of giving up my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the prisoner’s story as he wants it, and you get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she “could have formulated it better,” but she still thinks it’s wrong what I’m doing.
Richard Glossip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn’t tell me what I have to write, and I’t do it even if he did.
I told him that he could remove me from his list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants an international reporter to be present to write there.
When he dies, he thinks publicity work will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a reporter for the Huffington Post, will sit next to me.
If you want to know more about the case, please listen to the series of podcasts I made.
I do not want to go into all the details here.
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese would make him guilty of being a beneficiary of the act.
But I think there is a strong likelihood that he is not guilty of the murder.
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence.
I think his execution is wrong.
And from that perspective I will see him die.
I cannot claim to be really objective.
There will be other reporters you can turn to for this.
What you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death.
Man persuaded after wet police hunt to come out of Canning River
The Canning Vale policeman remained dry as he persuaded the man from the Canning River.
An attempt by a man from Perth to hang off the police was unsuccessful when he was in shallow and sumptuous waters, just a few meters away from a police officer who tried to “softly persuade him to return to the shore.”
Canning Vale police were summoned to a house-breaking incident in Beckenham on Tuesday.
When they discovered the suspect, he tried to escape them to the Canning River.
But he did not go too far.
"He stood in the water and said 'I won't get out, come and pick me up,'" said senior sergeant Shandell Castledine.
Constable Lachlan Perhavec was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet, so he applied a more reliable tactic - "A good policeman negotiates."
“Sometimes people do funny things to try to escape,” said Senior Sergeant Castledine.
Championship footballer Ben Cousins offers an unforgettable example.
In 2006, Cousins drove his car into the pit to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim across the Swan River.
His efforts were unsuccessful but inspired locals to the humorous planning of a Ben Cousins biathlon.
Peter Moody claims stewards tried to spy on him and threatens to end racing
Peter Moody claims that stewards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his stalls last year and threatened to end the race immediately.
He targeted Racing Victoria’s stewards and integrity department, claiming that they were conducting a personal campaign against him with Lady Tatai’s late scratching over a race day treatment, the last stroke on Wednesday.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he’s always tried to do what’s best for racing and he’s found himself in tough conditions when it came to the positive cobalt buffer sample at Lidaris, which he can’t explain.
He had been withheld for 18 months over the allegations of espionage and didn’t want it to “look like hanging grapes too high.”
“I planned not to say anything about it, and I’ve been sitting on it for a long time, but sometimes you’re so frustrated that everything comes out at once,” Moody said.
You know it continued.
Sometimes you react, and you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I will go home tonight and sleep well.
I want to walk around raised heads, and I want my owners to think I’m trying my best for them.
If they start to think I don’t do that, then I shouldn’t be a coach anymore.
I have to think about what to do with my license.
Earlier, Moody had released the bomb in an interview with racing.com that the integrity department had attempted to spy on his stall.
"Eighteen months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown, and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man - whom I'll name if asked - and offered him a job in my stalls to provide information about what I'm doing inside my stalls," Moody told Racing.com.
You seem to think that I am a fraud.
If that’s the case, they should definitely cling to their noses because they failed to try to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former Chairman of the RVL, David Moodie, current Chairman of the RVL, and Bernard Saundry, current CEO of the RVL, were aware of this at the time and are still doing so today.
Should this make me think it will be personal?
Has the RVL behaved cowardly and maybe made people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry?
Am I bad for the industry?
Am I so bad for the industry?
Maybe people out there think I am.
Maybe they’ll have to take my license from me and violate me, and I have no doubt that what I’m saying will make them think about it now.
But now I have come to the point where I don’t care, and that makes me sad.
That really makes me sad.
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision.
I have the support of my family and I can go.
The trainer’s levels of frustration have built up with the long-running cobalt investigation at Lidari, and the late scratching resulted in him saying he could “throw his license over the table.”
Moody, best known for his preparation of the unbeaten master Black Caviar, called the race day treatment rule "ridiculous" after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse's legs, breaking the rules.
“It’s against the rules of the sport.
I have to take full responsibility for this,” he said.
“One of my employees mistakenly applied mud to his leg.
It could have been so last night.
It could have been the same all day yesterday.
It was the same on the race day.
Moody could face a three-month disqualification for treatment with the package on the race day.
It is a joke.
People who set these rules know nothing about the horse.
“We all see that we need rules, but here we have gone too far,” Moody said.
Man arrested after driver escape
Police arrested a man on the weekend after a collision with a cyclist and subsequent driver escape in Cobram.
The cyclist was taken by helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Murray Valley Highway.
Police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured driver.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man from Nathalia stood before police in Shepparton.
He is expected to be charged with driver escape and non-assistance, as well as other traffic offences.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains in the hospital.
Melbourne Storm Coach Craig Bellamy Fights Against Rivals for Claims of Ringfighting
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy has called the criticism of tackling his players a “agenda setting” of two Premier League favorites of the NRL.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees allowed the Storm players to "ringfight" with his team during the high-storm victory in the Sydney qualifying final on Friday evening.
Brisbane Bronco coach Wayne Bennett made a barely concealed comment on the Storm team after his team scored the final victory over the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night. He called the game a "model" of the Rugby League and said the two from Queensland were not "too good" in the fight.
Bellamy defended his team’s tacklimg, saying they were only focused on their “contact” when tackling.
Bellamy added that the criticism of two top coaches on his team made him confident as it meant they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team.
“That’s coming up again and again – I haven’t heard Trent Robinson talk about ringfights when they beat us 24:2,” Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we haven’t changed anything about our defensive system or techniques throughout the year, but over the past six weeks we’ve made our contact with Tackles a real focus, and that’s made the trend turn for us.
Trent has been there for three years now, and he obviously has a great team to train.So he is probably not used to losing so it was a bit of a shock for him.
It is strange how this happens at this time of year.
Bellamy attacked Bennett’s idea of “exciting football” and reminded his mentor that Bennett’s St George Illawarra Dragons won the Premier League in 2010 with “dull” football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He compared his game on Saturday night to our on Friday night and how exciting their game was," Bellamy said.
I remember in 2010 St. George was criticized as a dull team, and Wayne said he would take care of a shit about it.
But now he has a team that can play and we see as exciting, especially his young players with their speed.
This is the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player.
He made this statement in 2010, now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play like these.
I’m building more confidence because they say these things because they’re a little worried about having to play against us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn’t think of us when it came to the Big Games.
Bellamy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. Roosters scored a higher score than the game Broncos vs. Cowboys.
The game of the Broncos was probably a good game, I haven’t watched it yet, but what was the result? 16 : 12 ?
Our game was 20:18, there were two more attempts in our game, but is that an exciting game?
Or are breaks and no points something exciting?
For me, these are the game plans.
If they mention us, it means that we will still meet them at a stage.
The Storm team is free this weekend as they won the right to receive either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks next Saturday night in the pre-final at AAMI Park.
Serbian receives $200,000 bail on drug charges
A man who could face a life sentence for trying to get into possession of 40 kilograms of cocaine smuggled to Queensland has been released against a $200,000 deposit.
Marko Maksimovic, 29, was one of five men arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Solay, which came from South America over Vanuatu and landed in Coomera in August.
Maksimovic was seen meeting his fellow defendants in the yacht port during the morning and later at Coomera Roadhouse, where police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo.
Despite a possibly life sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of cocaine, Maksimovic’s lawyer argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that it might have been in the cafe for an innocuous reason.
The Supreme Court judge, Peter Flanagan, was concerned about the danger of Maksimovic’s escape.
He has strong relations with Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia," he told the court on Wednesday.
He lied to the police about his place of residence.
Maksimovic’s mother and stepfather had jointly offered a deposit of $200,000 as a security in order to his release.
"After reading the two persons' oathing statements, it is clear that imposing a security of $200,000 represents a real financial burden," Flanagan said.
But that alone will not be enough to stop him from appearing, he warned.
Maksimovic was released on bail on the condition that he handed down his Australian and Serbian passports, to the police daily and adhere to a departure shutdown from 18:00 to 06:00.
Accident on the A5 near Karlsruhe: driver's house breaks apart
In an accident with three trucks on highway 5 near Karlsruhe on Tuesday evening, a truck driver was seriously injured.
Two of the three trucks involved had stopped in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel.
The third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to evade to the left at the last moment, police said.
The driver’s car was completely destroyed.
The driver was seriously injured and taken to a hospital.
The A5 between Bruchsal and Karlsruhe-Nord was completely closed for six hours to 2 a.m.
The damage amounted to 122,000 euros.
Stevan Hogg used girls’ phone to lure pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of an 11-year-old girl to request pictures of child abuse.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone while she was asleep, logged in to an online messaging service from which he received a series of obscene pictures of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the sleeping Hogg’s hand.
She looked through it, found the confusing messages, and immediately alerted her mother.
The police took care of it and looked at the five images, then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered "relevant" web searches that used terms for searching for disrespectful images of children.
Hogg then claimed to officials that he did it because it would lead to “pedophiles on the Internet” and he then “prescribed to be a policeman to scare them.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson told the Dundee Sheriff Court: “He said it would be addiction—that he’s addicted to scaring people.
He admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him, but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a policeman to scare off pedophiles.
He was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and who he asked to send even more photos.
He said he did it to lure her.
He said he was sick in the head when he drank, and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder.
Ms. Robertson added: “When the girl found the news on the phone, she called her mother and was shaking and crying.
She then also saw the obscene pictures on the phone and confronted the accused with them.
The girl was interviewed and said the accused used computers and Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he was.
Hogg, 23, Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty under the indictment that he had taken dishonest pictures of children on 14 June last year, violated the requirements on 25 January this year, and did not appear in court for a hearing on 24 March this year.
Defense lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to appear in the register of sexual offenders, as one could argue that "no significant sexual element" could be found in his offence.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael postponed the verdict until October to receive background reports on social work.
Hogg was granted bail in this case, but was held in custody for hearings on other pending cases.
He was included in the list of sexual offenders before the date of the verdict.
Smugglers flee small border crossing points to Germany
More and more refugees are being taken away from major checkpoints on the German-Austrian border.
Many smugglers left more and more people at smaller border crossings out of fear of discovery and arrest.
On the Austrian side, a spokesman for the Federal Police said.
Along the border river Inn, more than 1,000 refugees have been taken in the districts of Passau and Rottal-Inn since Tuesday.
They had reached the German side on foot through bridges and traffic jams.
There they are taken in by federal police officers and forwarded for registration.
According to the Federal Police, more refugees arrived at the Munich Central Station compared to the beginning of the week on Wednesday.
About 700 people had arrived in the state capital by 8 a.m. alone, a spokesman said in the morning.
After the reintroduction of controls on the German-Austrian border, 1759 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday.
Stuttgart: the outbreak of tropical storm "Henry" is expected in the southwest
Meteorologists warn of storms in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon.
Due to a low-pressure area over Western Europe, warm sea air is currently flowing into the country, the German Weather Service (DWD) in Stuttgart.
The strong depth is the trigger of the tropical storm "Henry", which has pulled over the Atlantic Ocean in recent days from the Bermuda Islands.
Heavy storms and thunderstorms are expected especially in Switzerland.
According to DWD, until Thursday morning in the Schwarzwald, on the Schwäbische Alb and in the Bodenseekreis with boeings of 60 to 90 hour kilometers can also be expected.
On Friday we can look at the sun again.
The mass is doing it: every two years, the automakers showcase their novelty at the IAA.
2015 is moving for compact cars, which are currently selling well.
Compact-class cars are currently in demand: Around 28.1% of new registrations occurred in this segment in August alone, according to the Federal Office of Transportation (KBA).
This is also reflected in the IAA (public days 17 to 27 September).
Among all the futuristic concept cars and new premium and luxury cars, many new compact models will be introduced this year.
One of the biggest premiere for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra, which will be on sale in the autumn.
“The Astra is an extremely important model for us,” Opel CEO Karl-Thomas Neumann said at the exhibition.
It belongs to the core of the brand.
In order for the volume model to sell well, the new Astra should not be much more expensive.
Opel is ahead of its biggest competitor, VW Golf, starting at €17,650.
The current Astra costs from 16 990 euros.
The Astra is available with a new 1.4-litre engine with 74 kW/100 hp.
In addition, Hessen offers other diesel and petrol engines ranging from 70 kW/95 hp to 147 kW/200 hp, including three-cylinder petrol engines for the first time.
Unlike the major competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus, the Opel Astra is only available as a five-door.
The second variant will be followed in the spring by the combi, which is already available on the IAA.
And what will be added to new compact cars in addition to the Astra at the IAA?
Renault Mégane: Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mégane into the race.
At the exhibition, the Mégane will be shown exclusively as a five-door in a conventional and a highlighted sporty GT version.
It will be available in the market at the beginning of next year, then as a car.
Infiniti is the new Infiniti Q30.
With the new model, Nissan wants to find its position in the fast-growing segment.
With its curved lines, the compact Infiniti fully fits into the brand’s design line.
The basic model will receive a gasoline engine with a power of at least 90 kW/122 hp.
However, there is also a diesel with 80 kW/109 hp or 125 kW/170 hp.
Suzuki Baleno: New in the segment is also the Suzuki Baleno, which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt.
The model is offered with petrol engines, including a newly developed 1.0-litre turbocharged engine and a power of 82 kW/111 hp.
The maximum torque is 170 Newton meters (Nm) according to the manufacturer.
Sales of the Baleno in Europe will begin in the spring of 2016.
DS 4: Not entirely new, but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4, which will be shown at the IAA.
Outside, the designers of the noble Citroën wardrobe laid mainly hands on the front part: here the refrigerator grille was redesigned and the modified headlights equipped with LED technology.
In the interior, the infotainment system was modernized, the number of buttons was reduced by a touchscreen, and Apple’s CarPlay was integrated for the first time.
In addition, a number of revisions and new variants will be added to the IAA in the compact class, such as the refreshed Mercedes A-Class or the Peugeot 308 GTI.
JVA Berlin-Tegel: Five square meters of cell is inhuman
The Federal Constitutional Court has granted justice to a former prisoner of the Tegel Judiciary, who had been housed for months in a too small cell.
For the violation of their human dignity, prisoners are in principle entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in too small cells.
This was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday.
According to the judges, the persons concerned can hope for money even if they have only been locked in the rooms too narrow for a few days (Az.: 1 BvR 1127/14).
Thus, a former prisoner was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe: he was housed in the Berlin-Tegel Judiciary Execution Institute between June and November 2009 in a single cell with about five square meters of floor area; the toilet was not spatially separated.
After that, the man, who according to his lawyer is now free, was placed in a larger cell.
His prosecution for the unworthy conditions of detention against the state of Berlin failed.
However, the constitutional judges revoked the judgment of the Chamber Court of Berlin and rejected the case for re-examination there.
You see the human dignity of the man hurt.
The Court now decides on the amount of compensation.
Even if, for legal reasons, only a few days of imprisonment from the period in question are relevant for compensation, there is a claim for compensation, it said.
Otherwise, "there would be a degradation of the legal protection of the personality to be feared."
The court now has to determine the amount of compensation.
In the past, constitutional judges have repeatedly strengthened the rights of prisoners.
In April, a prisoner was awarded compensation for being imprisoned naked in a cell.
According to a 2011 ruling, the use of multiple cells without a separate toilet is also unhuman.
Karlsruhe also confirmed on Wednesday the Berlin Constitutional Court, which in a parallel case in November 2009 had granted a prisoner an inhuman accommodation.
For more than three months, the plaintiff spent between 15 and 21 hours a day in a cell similar to that in the Karlsruher case.
The Berlin prisons have also been on the headlines in recent weeks due to a lack of staff.
Prisoners are therefore continuously imprisoned for 23 hours, the aggression increases, even battles are said to have already occurred due to the tense situation.
According to the Justice Press Office, 21 positions in Tegel are not occupied due to a shortage of young people, and 19 are expected to disappear in 2016.
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy: "We can do it"
The immigration of refugees is a huge challenge – the German Chancellor is determined to accept them.
What happens to Germany?
About 800,000 asylum-seekers will come to Germany this year, according to the German Interior Ministry’s forecasts, and according to Deputy Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), Germany is even able to accept one million refugees.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge: "I say over and over again: We can do this, and we can do it."
What is happening in Germany is shown in the following overview.
According to different forecasts, between 350,000 (estimated by the Federal Ministry of Construction) and 400,000 (estimated by the Pestel Institute) houses will be used annually - for the next five years.
This is almost twice as much as what has been built so far (250,000 homes).
The shortage of housing is dramatic, however, especially for affordable rental properties: annually 60,000 to 80,000 social housing fall out of the rental price binding, and for these affordable apartments refugees will also apply.
German Construction Minister Barbara Hendricks (SPD) wants to double the funding, from currently 518 million to one billion euros.
This is far too little from the viewpoint of the Pestel Institute: 80,000 social housing would have to be created annually and the federal government would have to invest a subsidy in the amount of 6.4 billion a year.
Scientists and the Federal Ministry of Construction agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investments in housing construction.
According to the Institute for Labour Market and Occupational Research, it is estimated that 55 percent of refugees in Germany can be employed in the long run.
However, refugees in Germany are not systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them get started, criticizes Claudia Walter, project manager for integration and education at the Bertelsmann Foundation.
But for the integration of refugees, it is crucial whether they find work in Germany.
Work is the key for social contacts, for appreciation in the host society, but also for the self-esteem of immigrants, says migration researcher Dietrich Thränhardt.
In Germany, according to Thränhardt, there has been a political turn: from the ban on work for refugees to the recognition of work.
While there was previously a ban on working for asylum seekers for up to five years, it was reduced to three months in November 2014, as was the residence obligation, which restricted asylum seekers to a place of residence.
In society – also due to the shortage of skilled personnel – the view that refugees should be allowed faster access to the labour market has become prevalent.
One of the major obstacles to accessing the job market is the lack of knowledge of German.
Until now, there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses.
Research also shows that jobs are most often mediated through personal contacts.
The construction of networks is therefore, in Thränhardt’s view, the royal path to labour integration.
The school administration in Berlin has found that only a few refugee parents give their children to the kites, an estimated 10 to 15 percent: "For the unrooted parents, it is very important to keep the family together," says Ilja Koschembar, spokeswoman for youth and family in the Berlin Senate administration.
However, in order to convince the family of the benefits of Kita, the administration distributes handbooks in various languages.
Should the demand for female educators increase sharply due to the large number of refugees, the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example, by allowing more specialized schools.
In the countries, students without German skills are prepared for lessons in welcoming classes.
However, they are not always taught by fully trained teachers, but, like in Berlin, also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language.
There is no shortage of them, says Beate Stoffers of the Berlin School Administration.
The German Student Work estimates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany.
In principle, no federal state prohibits asylum seekers or patients from studying - the only exception so far was Berlin, but Interior Senator Frank Henkel (CDU) has now given up his stance.
Study-willing refugees could be facilitated access to university.
Refugees with a residence permit or tolerance will no longer receive benefits under the Asylum Seekers Benefits Act when they start their studies.
The latter do not receive Bafög in principle, since they do not fall within the circle of Bafög entitled persons.
Patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far to be eligible for Bafög, from 1 January 2016 this period is shortened to 15 months.
But this financing gap must also be closed, call for Steffen Krach, Berlin’s State Secretary for Science, and the Deutsche Studentenwerk.
Students should get Bafög immediately.
Islam will play a more important role in the future, as many refugees are Muslims, and for many, religion is an important part of their identity.
The state should gradually grant Islam the same rights as the churches, and further develop the existing state-church right to a new state-religion relationship.
It would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare association that professionally takes care of the newcomers.
Rights also include duties.
For example, the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be willing to cooperate with the state in many areas and give it certain control options.
This also includes the willingness to oppose religious fundamentalism.
The chairman of the Central Council of Muslims, Aiman Mazyek, on Thursday expressed concern that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany.
Those who wanted to engage in such conflicts in Germany “have their right to stay here, in Germany, lost,” he told Bavarian radio.
He proposed translating the Basic Law into Arabic.
In the future, integration will be a matter of society as a whole much more than it is today.
The majority society will also have to change, and the elimination of discrimination and racism will become more urgent.
Germany has, as a result of European decisions, had an anti-discrimination body and a general equality law for a short decade.
But it learns very slowly, as the NSU murder series showed, in which police and authorities systematically ignored the racist motive.
Equal opportunities for all: What immigrant organizations and non-white German interest groups have long demanded and what international agreements such as the anti-racism convention obligate Germany to do, must become a reality in the coming years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens use their opportunities – for the good of all.
In general, Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees, says medical president Frank Ulrich Montgomery.
“As for manpower and capacity, we can do that,” he told the Daily Mirror.
Additional money must be added to the system.
To avoid congestion, Montgomery urges all arrivals to issue health cards at the time of registration.
The services provided could later be settled with the federal states.
And in the long run, it is highly questionable to feed so many people with the limited catalogue of benefits provided by the Asylum Seekers’ Benefits Act.
Otherwise, doctors primarily create language barriers.
As the Berlin health scientist Thea Borde has shown, immigrants are less educated about their diseases than other patients.
Not only in clinics, but also in medical offices, interpreting costs would have to be borne.
Many refugees would be helped, but also with more general medical access points in the emergency ambulances.
And with a different diagnostic look.
For example, among refugee children there are significantly more untreated disabilities, and among young people it is HIV education.
With the somewhat different diseases, however, German doctors came out of their training clearly, Montgomery thinks.
"Parasite infestation or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognize."And as for the shortage of doctors, the refugees may even see relief in sight.
The Syrians have a highly developed education system, some refugees are even doctors.
However, in order to practice, they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take exams again.
At least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill, according to estimates from the Federal Chamber of Psychotherapists (BPtK): most suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or depression.
Refugee children are vulnerable, explains Dietrich Munz, president of the BPtK.
A recent study published by TU Munich shows that one in five Syrian refugee children arrives in Germany traumatically.
Those who suffer from a post-traumatic stress disorder suffer from, among other things, so-called flashbacks with shortness of breath, dizziness, heart rage and death fears.
Other symptoms include sleep and concentration disturbances, severe fearfulness and emotional numbness.
To prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic, early treatment is needed, Munz explained.
So far, however, only four percent of mentally ill refugees receive psychotherapy.
Although mentally ill asylum seekers can apply for psychotherapy in the social services, the processing usually takes several months.
In addition, in the social offices, case workers or doctors who are not trained for mental illnesses would mostly decide whether therapy is necessary or not.
This often leads to miscalculations, says Munz.
Manege invites to dream
With the new staging "Passion", the Circus Probst draws back to the traditions of circus art.
The goal is to attract every age group to fascinating acrobatics, animal dressing and unique entertainment.
Now the Circus Probst invites you to dream in the manege on the brick.
“My passion is the circus.
“I can’t imagine living without my circus family,” says Stephanie Probst, animal teacher and junior boss.
"Passion" - under this motto stands the current manegeninscenation.
For more than 33 years, the circus has been in the hands of the Probst family.
So the gift of enthusiasm lies in the blood of the family.
"It is important for us to take people away from their everyday mess and take them to a completely different world for two hours," said the 27-year-old junior chief.
“Manegencocktail with world city flair,” Director Reinhard Probst calls his concept.
Fifty cities on the almost 3,000-kilometer tour can now experience this flair.
The programme of the circus convinces with talented artists from all over the world.
Outstanding at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo, the Russian Stoliarov Clown Family attracts the audience with its joke and charm.
The Castillo Brothers also understand their craft.
With the heroes of the silent films, the Cuban duo wants to capture it loosely.
Ease and agility - with these words they identify.
Her humorous art on the mast is meant to conquer women’s hearts in the storm.
In addition to its numerous salves, the acrobatics of the Circus Probst also fascinates with fingertips and jointness.
Balancing the wheel on a ball?
No problem for Yuan.
Serpent people fascinate and scare at the same time.
Wang Lin from China is familiar with the oldest form of acrobatics like few others and is fascinated by its agility.
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way.
“The animals belong to our family,” says Stephanies mother, Brigitte Probst.
Abuses in the posture of circus animals are too often a topic in various animal welfare organizations.
Stephanie Probst also takes a position on this: "If our animals are not well, we are not well."
Approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each stroke unit.
To the “four-legged artists”, as they are lovingly called, every wish is read from the eyes, if possible.
We want to work with animals and have fun with them.
If the animal does not feel comfortable, it does not want to go into the manege.
The main principle is to take good care of the animals.
Especially on their Zebroid Jumbo, a mixture of a ShetlandPonyhengst and a Zebrastute, the Probst family is proud.
The two animals lived together in one cage for eight years and nothing happened.
“But then, suddenly, our little jumbo was there,” says Brigitte Probst.
Although the Zebroid is not yet ready for the Manege, it is the unique maskot of the Circus Probst.
There is something for every visitor.
“One thing is for sure,” says Stephanie Probst, “whether it’s five or 1,200 spectators, we’re always doing our best and with all our heart.”
The Circus Probst invites you to perform every day from 17 to 20 September at 17 and 20 a.m.
On Sunday, the program starts at 11 and 16.
Thursday is Family Day, for the performance at 17:00, prices are reduced.
The animal show is open every day from 10am to 6pm.
Robert Mugabe speaks wrong in parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa’s oldest leader, fell down the stairs from a podium earlier this year.
He remained uninjured, but the video of the case quickly spread on social media.
The opening of parliament was also stifled by claims from opposition members that they had received anonymous death threats and were warned not to accompany Mr. Mugabe’s speech with screams.
Last month, they had struck him out and interrupted him during his speech on the state of the nation in parliament — this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, a spokesman for the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones warning them not to interfere with Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
"The message comes from a number that doesn't show up, but it's titled 'Death'," he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warns the members concerned that immunity in Parliament ends, and as soon as they leave Parliament, their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective.
The chief spokesman said the party led by Morgan Tsvangirai was "preoccupied" about the dangers to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard to cut 30,000 jobs
Hewlett-Packard is expected to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs as part of restructuring and savings efforts in the company’s services.
HP will split into two listed companies later this year, separating the computer and printer business from its fast-growing enterprise hardware and service business.
The expected job cuts will result in a burden of over $2.7 billion from the fourth quarter, HP said in a statement.
"These restructuring measures will enable a more competitive, more sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett-Packard enterprise," said Meg Whitman, HP chairman and chief executive who is expected to lead the unit after the breakup.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today, and we have a broad and in-depth portfolio of to help companies transition to a new style of business,” Whitman said.
As an independent company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise has more than $50 billion in annual revenue and “will be focused on delivering unparalleled, integrated technology solutions to,” the company said in a statement.
It divides a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical installations and whose Palo Alto garage has been called "the birthplace of Silicon Valley."
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to cope with the shift from traditional PCs to mobile devices.
HP, the world’s second-largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. technology companies, is the latest in this field, based on the belief that tightly focused companies deliver better performance.
FC Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says teammates must be behind injured Jack Wilshere before the game against Dynamo Zagreb
Wenger stressed to Wilshere that it is only September and so long as his rehabilitation goes according to plan, there is no reason why he can't play again before Christmas.
This optimistic scenario already means that Wilshere will surely miss at least the next four games for England, and given its history, his participation in the European Championship next summer is surely still uncertain.
The big shame about this current problem is that Wilshere had severely ended the last season after a separate ankle injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pre-season.
"This type of injury does not threaten the career," Wenger said.
It’s a bone that didn’t heal well.
This is not a bigger matter.
This was just an accident.
It was not related to his ankle or the injuries he had before.
This may be true from a purely medical point of view, but as Wenger also acknowledged, there is the associated risk of further injury whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season.
There is also an unpleasant pattern.
The investigation by Premier Injuries Ltd recorded 23 different conditions of Wilshere since its debut six years ago.
He also played in only 65 of Arsenal’s 157 league games in the last five seasons.
The broader picture for Arsenal is that in six out of eight seasons since 2007/08, they were one of the two Premier League clubs with the most injury days to record.
Wenger accepts the potential of a vicious circle, but Arsenal believes an improvement in injury rate will continue during the last season.
“Sometimes, when you come back from an injury, you have a vulnerable period, a time when you need to strengthen your body and gain fighting power,” Wenger said.
Jack is young enough to do that.
I hope his body stabilizes, I’m confident he’ll do it and he’ll go through a career of the kind he deserves.
Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Dinamo Zagreb ahead of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger sets up a rotation within the team.
Héctor Bellerín and Aaron Ramsey have not traveled to Croatia, which means that Mathieu Debuchy and Arteta are likely to start.
Wenger can also start with Kieran Gibbs and Olivier Giroud instead of Nacho Monreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep the balance and give the players who need it a little break," Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are clear favourites to move through Group F, the Maksimir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the fields with the greatest intimidation effect in Europe.
Dynamo is still unbeaten after 41 games after the "invincible" campaign launched last season.
The stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night, measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
This year it was the 10th in Zagreb.
Wenger believes Arsenal learned from last season’s Champions League capitulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope of leading the club to its first European Cup triumph with his management.
“This drive is immense,” Wenger said.
It has never worked for Arsenal.
We were very close to it in 2006, but on the other hand I’m in business long enough to be realistic.
We are ambitious, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men’s friendship
The absence of similar representations in shows is obvious, especially in terms of how the need for men to open up has now become even more desperate than ever before, as suicide rates among young men prove at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the leading cause of death among men aged 20 to 45 in the UK, and it remains three times more common among men than women.
In an effort to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM) announced 2015 as the Year of Man, with the aim of challenging the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depressive symptoms found that if the sufferer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with “healthy mood,” his chances of recovery doubled.
For those who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends halves the risk of mental problems.
But of course, you have to have friends first so that a friendship can work.
In the age of social media-driven communication, with its emphasis on style over substance, the immediate response is often more important than meaningful contact.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong, lively and successful, even though in reality isolation dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the expense of intrinsic values – our inner longing for personal development and friendship, which has a much deeper impact on our mental health.
And as a video game inventor and billionaire recently explained, money can really not buy luck.
The beautiful thing about Friends was that this focus was put on the head.
Each character was not defined by his work, but by his personality, shining through interaction as a friend.
The humour of Joey and Chandler’s frequent hugs, moments of watching football in cozy chairs, and Ross’ longing for Rachel – all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it, even though they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
“My listening role for people who are feeling depressed and at risk of suicide has really clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference.”
The men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying “I can handle it” has a huge effect, like feeling that it is perceived as weakness when you talk openly about problems.”
Friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer more long-term coping mechanisms.
It clearly shows the small moments of male friendship.
As much as my objective outsider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair, the long-term support comes from a personal network of family and friends.
And so, if you’re visiting Comedy Central FriendsFest this weekend with the completely redesigned setting to celebrate the day, why not take your friends with you for a drink at the Central Perk.
Or, even better, if you see someone sitting alone in Starbucks, give him a smile and say hello.
You never know what a difference your friendship can make.
Friends is posted on Comedy Central from beginning to end - the total 236 episodes - for #FriendsFest
Di Maria meets to help PSG crush Malmö
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after his hit against Malmö.
Di Maria meets at his Champions League debut on Tuesday and helps PSG get past Malmö.
Here is the game review and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani kept track when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2-0 victory against Malmö at Prinzenpark Stadium on Tuesday.
Di Maria hit less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as a PSG player taking the French champion on the way, but after that they missed a series of opportunities before finally raising their edge when Cavani scored a headball goal in the 61st minute.
With Real Madrid and Schachtjor Donezk also in Group A, Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion as they aim not only to qualify for the K.O. rounds, but to improve on the way to the quarterfinals in each of the last three campaigns.
But while they got the points, it wasn’t a class game by Laurent Blanc’s team with Zlatan Ibrahimovic’s missed chances in front of the goal.
"It's not easy to win at home or outside in the Champions League, so winning 2:0 is a good start, causing trouble to our opponents and looking back calmly, even though there are certain things we still have to perfect over the course of the season," Blanc said.
“That is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we won, although I’m sorry we didn’t score one or two more goals.”
Ibrahimovic returned to the Paris team in one of three changes after his injury, which was able to hold a 2:2 draw on its own on the weekend against Bordeaux in the First League, but was knocked out by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine wing striker has been referred to as the man who can take PSG to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over by Manchester United last month, and he pointed out why, as he ran into Marco Verrattis Pass behind the Malmö defense before finishing well into the long corner of the net past Johan Wiland.
However, if anyone believed that PSG would win a big win, he was disappointed.
Malmö, which defeated Celtic in a play-off to reach this level, attacked Anpiff with nine national players on the field and was a tough opponent with a five-man defense and two deep in the middle.
But except for a shot by Nikola Djurdjic, who passed far to Kevin Trapp’s posts in the 34th minute, they offered little in the attack.
Instead, PSG itself sometimes gave up, with some mistakes and bad scores, not least by Ibrahimovic, who patched on no less than five attempts alone in the first half and was then given up after Cavani had hired him after the restart.
Nevertheless, he demonstrated much more skill by bringing his fellow players into play, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic that Di Maria turned into a shot that was passed by Wiland at the post in the 52nd minute ...
The second goal finally fell shortly after the hour mark thanks to Cavani. The Uruguayan thus scored his sixth season goal after Ibrahimovic had picked up a left flank of Maxwell.
That ended all thought that Malmö could come back into the game, and only an outstanding intervention by Wiland from the shortest distance to stop David Luiz could keep the final result low before replacement player Ezequiel Lavezzi was denied a goal in the end.
Malmö coach Age Hareide later admitted that PSG was playing a class above his team, and the Norwegian said: “Our last Champions League game was last December.
Since then we have only played in the Swedish league, which is not at the same level.
The qualifications are not enough.”
Hats off from Paris!
It was a great game of them!
Glencore raises $2.5 billion through stock sales
Switzerland-based mining giant Glencore, affected by falling commodity prices, raised $2.5 billion through a share sale on Wednesday as part of its huge debt relief plan.
London-based company Glencore said in a statement that it has sold new shares worth approximately £1.6 billion to pay off its own debts.
The company, which lost 57 percent of its market value this year, is struggling with falling commodity prices as China’s economic downturn pushes demand and has a devastating impact on markets.
The issue of reference rights brought Glencore’s stock price to the top of the London Stock Exchange early Wednesday morning.
The stock jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 index, which opened 0.69 percent higher.
Glencore announced the $2.5 billion share sale last week as part of a broader plan to withdraw about a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at 125 pence per share, which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday.
There were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.99 percent of the group.
Concerns about long-term growth in China have reduced iron prices by about half, while coal, copper and other commodity prices have fallen by 20 to 40 percent.
Refugees arriving in Weimar
On Tuesday afternoon, 49 people arrived in the city of Weimar after a mostly long escape.
The refugees come from Syria, Albania, Afghanistan, Macedonia and Somalia.
The youngest arrival is a six-month-old girl from Syria.
White House confirms Xi Jinping visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jinping will make a state visit to the United States at the end of the month, the White House confirmed in a statement on Tuesday.
The visit, Xi’s first official in Washington, will take place on September 25 and follows President Barack Obama’s trip to Beijing last November, the statement said.
The U.S. President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan at a state dinner this evening, after the two leaders held bilateral talks.
"President Xi's visit will provide an opportunity to expand U.S.-China cooperation on a range of global, regional and bilateral issues of common interest, but also give President Obama and President Xi the opportunity to constructively address areas of disagreement," the statement added.
Xi, whose visit was initially announced in February, is expected to meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before continuing to New York City for the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to address a number of controversial issues, including Washington’s concerns about China’s alleged cyber espionage and its growing self-confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea.
440-PS sports car rented and driven to waste
A 29-year-old man wanted to fulfill a dream and borrowed a Ford Mustang.
On the rainy highway, the evil woke up.
At a company in Gotha County, you can fulfill your dream by renting and driving a V8 U.S. sports car Ford Mustang Boss 302 with 440 hp.
This was also the case for a 29-year-old man from Gotha County.
At the A 71 near Arnstadt, the dream was over.
The 29-year-old lost control of the sports car, stumbled on a wet track and ran into the steering board.
The sports car suffered total damage, no one was injured.
The damage is estimated at 40,000 euros.
Xavi: Pep Guardiola prevented transfer to Bayern in 2008
World and European champion Xavi has been playing for al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015.
FC Bayern was obviously just ahead of the commitment of Spain’s superstar Xavi, who played for FC Barcelona at the time.
Eight times Spanish champion, three times cup winner, four times Champions League winner, two times club world champion, two times European champion, one time world champion – Xavi’s title list is breathtaking.
In the summer, the now 35-year-old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to al-Sadd Sport Club in Qatar.
But in an interview with Marca, Xavi now reveals that he was already ahead of his farewell from Barcelona before the 2008 European Championship.
“I was told that Barça wanted to sell me.
“Madrid won everything, we won nothing,” he said.
This was also by FC Bayern.
Xavi: “There was an offer from Bayern.”
“Rummenigge wanted me.”
In the summer of 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann took over FC Bayern.
Guardiola was the reason Xavi didn’t change
But the change did not happen.
And the decisive man for this is working for the German record champion: Pep Guardiola.
Xavi explained why: “Barça has signed Guardiola and I played a great EM.”
“Pep told me that I’t change, that he couldn’t imagine the team without me.”
“That’s why he got me.”
Who knows how Bayern’s 2008/2009 season with Xavi would have been.
Xavi stood for Barca in the Champions League quarterfinals against Bayern over the entire distance on the lawn, switching out the Reds (4:0, 1:1) and finally celebrating the king-class triumph.
Matt Damon plays diversity down in filmmaking
Matt Damon confronted African-American filmmaker Effie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she wasn’t needed behind the scenes.
During a Sunday Night episode of HBO’s Project Greenlight, the experienced actor Brown interrupted as this emphasized the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black protagonist in the chosen script of the project.
“If we’re talking about diversity, you’re doing it when you cast the movie, not when you’re casting the show,” Damon said.
Brown responded shocked, with insulted unbelief, shouting "Hoo! Wow. Okay" as the actor's comments from The Martian solidified.
Damon and Brown joined co-producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show finalists.
“I want to encourage people to think about – whoever will be the director – how they treat the character of Harmony,” Brown said.
The only black person, and she is a man who is beaten by her white shark.
Dear White People's producer pledged for the finalists Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio for directing rights to the film; Damon replied that their directing "may eventually give us something we don't want."
After the discussion was broadcast, social media exploded with disapproval over Damon’s comments.
Twitter user Mr. Pooni expressed his anger over the clip by writing, "Matt Damon is talking about the only black person in the room, so he can explain their diversity - that's SO WISE that it hurts."
The tweet has earned more than 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes since its publication.
Damon’s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social debate.
After teenager Michael Brown was killed by a white policeman in 2014, the Black Lives Matter movement achieved national impact and urged lawmakers and authorities to stop discriminatory practices against colored people.
In February, singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards.
“Albums still matter,” he said.
Like books and black lives, albums still have their meaning.
More recently, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement issued a statement in response to the question of Fox News personality Elisabeth Hasselbeck whether the group should be considered a hate group.
“The Black Lives Matter network is a love group,” the leaders said.
Recently, it was announced that Damon was on a list of entertainers, producers, and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West.
Whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear.
‘American Ninja Warrior’ Crowns First Champion
Professional sports climbing and operating assistant Isaac Caldiero became the first athlete to win the American Ninja Warrior on Monday evening, taking home the $1 million Grand Prix.
The competition show, which just completed its seventh season, had never seen a competitor who could complete all stages of his obstacle course.
During the season final, two men, Caldiero and cameraman Geoff Britten, managed to reach the final.
The last task included climbing a 75-foot climbing rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task within time, making him the first athlete to complete the challenging Phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior, but Caldiero completed this challenge three seconds faster, making him the winner.
Caldiero spoke to E!News after the hard-fought victory, still shocked by winning the $1 million Grand Prix.
"I mean, it's amazing to think about, I've never earned more than $10,000 or had to live," Isaac E! said about his heap of money.
As suddenly as I can’t even imagine how that is... the future is unknown.
Senior producer Kent Weed sat down with The Hollywood Reporter to discuss the final and why Britten, though he was the first to finish the course, did not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the money goes to the fastest person.
“If there’s more than one finalist, the one with the fastest time gets it,” Weed said.
How much money is a wonderful price and changes life, it receives the great gratification.
I don’t think he has any resentment about it.
He is so happy to have done what he did.
He received numerous awards from fans.
He is such a great guy and a family father.
He is a hero for his wife and children.
Geoff said to me, “If I should be beaten by someone, then I’m glad it’s Isaac.”
And I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had changed the roles.
America Ninja Warrior has been extended for an eighth season, shooting will begin in spring 2016.
Detroit Tigers overtake Minnesota Twins
MINNEAPOLIS--The second half of the season was not fun for the Detroit Tigers.
Once they were one of the best teams in baseball, today the Tigers are in the last place in the American League Central.
The Tigers are reduced to their role as spoilers, but played this part perfectly against the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday with 5-4 in Target Field.
The Twins wasted a chance to rise within a game-half of the Houston Astros for the second American League wildcard place.
For Detroit, though only for one evening, it was a return to the three-letter F word that was so hard to grasp over much of the second half of the season.
“All victories are fun, no matter how it comes,” said Tigers manager Brad Ausmus.
Tiger Pitcher Alfredo Simonined his early offensive support as Detroit scored three times in the first two innings, then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) hit 6 times in the 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was his third successful start in his last nine matches.
“I want to end this year strongly,” said Simon.
It’s hard to throw into the bullshit of every game, so I want to go into the game with full concentration.
The designated Tiger hit Victor Martinez had three hits and was in two runs, his first RBIs since mid-August.
It was Martinez's first three-hit game since he had four hits against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
“He swung the shovel well,” Ausmus said.
He looked good at (strike training), looked much better in the bullpen, and he brought it straight into the game.
With three runs in the rear at the end of the seventh innings, the twins had their best chance to get back into the game.
Center Fielder Byron Buxton finished the inning with a double on the left field line.
Right Fielder Aaron Hicks reached a bounce, and Simon brought his second baseman Brian Dozier to the strikeout before being replaced by left-handed Blaine Hardy.
Hardy surpassed Wall, the only man he was confronted with, in front of the designated rookie striker Miguel Sano, who robbed right-handed Drew Verhagen of a two-run.
With a pair of runners and the final run in the second, Verhagen brought the third baseman Trevor Plouffe to a double play.
It was the leading 27th time in the Major League this season that Plouffe hit a double play
After Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the Ninth Innings, Wall scored an RBI double against the Closer of the Tigers Bruce Rondon, scoring 5-4.
The right-hander, however, struck out Sano at three pitches for his fifth save.
Detroit benefited at the start of the game from a not yet moving Phil Hughes.
The Tigers scored three runs in the first two innings against the right-handed veteran who had been removed from the injured list before the game after missing more than a month due to back pain.
“Obviously not the start I wanted,” Hughes said, “but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt I would make some pretty good pitches there in the third inning.”
After receiving the Leadoff-Batter in the first, Hushes gave a single to Second Baseman Ian Kinsler.
A two-out walk for J.D. Martinez brought Victor Martinez into play, who managed a single "up the middle" at the first run of the game.
Victor Martinez achieved his 0-21 success series with the runners in the scoring position.
The third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single on the right, managing another run, but Victor Martinez was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third, ending the threat.
The Tigers added in the second, scoring a one-out double by Catcher James McCann and a two-out single by Center-Fielder Anthony Gose to 3-0.
“It was a big blow,” Twins manager Paul Molitor said.
He didn’t hit very well, but he got the right place.
Hughes was in a pitch count, scoring no points in the third inning before being replaced by the reliever right-handed A.J.Achter.
With Hughes, there were three runs with six hits and a walk with four strikeouts.
NOTES: Tigers RHP Anibal Sanchez resigned due to a throw shoulder injury.
He is being examined by Dr. James Andrews, who operated Sanchez’s shoulder in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August due to a shoulder distortion, is scheduled to be activated for the start on Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of play, LHP Daniel Morris is removed from the injured list to start against the Twins.
Norris scored 1-1 in four starts with the Tigers since he was acquired in exchange with LHP David Price on July 30.
He has been missing since August 20 due to a breakdown in the right hip joint.
The Tigers and the Twins will finish their three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday
Norris (2-2,4.43 ERA) will play against Minnesota RHP Ervin Santana (5-4, 4.73)
Hundreds of refugees in Wiesbaden
A train carrying hundreds of refugees is on its way to Hesse.
His arrival was expected for Wednesday night.
The people who arrived there will then be accommodated in emergency shelters in Wiesbaden, as the city of Wiesbaden announced on Tuesday evening.
They expected between 450 and 750 refugees to arrive.
Several sports halls in the Hesse state capital had been prepared for this case in recent days.
Up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily accommodated there.
They will then be distributed to other municipalities.
In the last ten days alone, according to the government office responsible for the first recording, 7500 people had arrived in Hessen.
Frankfurt and Hanau have also set up emergency accommodations in sports halls due to the large number of refugees.
Ischinger: German military intervention in Syria is an option
The head of the Munich Security Conference, Wolfgang Ischinger, sees military action with German involvement in Syria as a possibility.
"I believe that the decisive reflection on military action options should not take place without Germany," he said.
He accused the European countries of “collectively looking away.”
Four years ago, one would have been glad that the cup of military involvement in Germany has passed.
"Now the conflict crashes at our doorstep," he told Deutschlandfunk.
The former German ambassador to Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid on the ground for refugees.
Austria controls its southern and eastern borders
After Germany, Austria has reintroduced controls at its southern and eastern borders.
Austrian Interior Minister Johanna Mikl-Leitner said on Tuesday evening on the Austrian television channel ORF that no one is being sent back to Hungary.
Germany has not returned refugees to Austria.
“No, it is so agreed,” she explained.
Asked about an agreement under which Germany could accept a certain number of refugees from Austria per day, Mikl-Leitner said there had already been talks on this subject between the Director-General for Public Security and representatives of Germany.
She did not give specific figures and referred to talks in Berlin on Wednesday.
In recent days, tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so-called Balkan route from Hungary.
Their main destination is Germany.
Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and her Austrian counterpart Werner Faymann, together with several other EU heads of state and government, requested a special summit for next week.
Germany introduced temporary border controls on Sunday.
The EU countries have not yet been able to agree on a joint approach to the crisis.
The EU interior ministers will take a new step towards the mandatory distribution of another 120,000 refugees at a special meeting on Tuesday (September 22).
In view of the strong refugee trend in Germany, the federal government wants to strengthen its support to the countries in the first reception and distribution of the people.
The Bund will manage this together with the countries, Merkel announced late Tuesday evening after four-hour discussions with the prime ministers at the chancellor's office in Berlin.
Merkel stressed that those people who need protection will get this as well.
Those who do not have the prospect of staying cannot stay in Germany.
This view was strongly shared in the round.
The Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a “enormous effort”.
Thousands of refugees are stuck on the Balkan route.
On Tuesday, Hungary closed its 175 km long border with Serbia.
A few hours later, the government in Budapest announced that it would also close the border with Romania with a fence.
This neighboring country belongs to the EU unlike Serbia.
Hungary wants to prevent smugglers from seeking escape routes through Romania, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said about the planned new border fence.
The Romanian government immediately condemned the plan.
There were first arrests of people who had cut through the fence.
In Turkey, according to eyewitness reports, thousands of other migrants were on their way to the Greek border.
Cassini finds ocean on Saturn's moon Enceladus
Under the ice tank of Saturn's moon Enceladus, a global ocean swims.
This is the conclusion of researchers from the observations of the Cassini spacecraft.
Thus, the moon moves slightly in its orbit around the ring planet.
This dwarf movement is small, but still too large for a consistently fixed celestial body, the Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, said in a statement on Tuesday.
The researchers presented their analysis in the journal "Icarus".
It has long been known that there must be liquid water under the ice sheet of Enceladus.
In 2006, Cassini had already discovered ice volcanoes at the south pole of Saturn's moon, which spit water vapor and ice particles and thus feed the so-called e-ring of Saturn.
At least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea, astronomers concluded at the time.
However, the extent of the hidden ocean was not clarified.
Rama misses 1860 Munich several weeks
The 1860 Munich must give up about a month on offensive actor Valdet Rama.
An examination found an adductor injury in the 27-year-old, the association.
Ram had complained of pain earlier this week.
According to Munchner Löwen, the diagnosis means “probably four weeks of forced break.”
“It’s hard for us, Rama is a tough loss.”
"Of course we have to think now," Sport Director Necat Aygün told the "Bild" newspaper in view of the possible commitment of a single professional.
However, as a training guest, the sixties first presented a defensive man.
The 30-year-old Hrvoje Cale was last active in Belgium and had already signed a contract with VfL Wolfsburg.
The Croatian has now "the opportunity to prove his abilities".
Rubin Okotie may return to team training next week after his brain shock.
The Austrian national player will start training on Thursday.
Okotie had injured himself in the game at Fortuna Düsseldorf (0:3) in a fierce collision in the head.
Contrary to initial fears, he was not seriously injured.
No diet fruit – mangoes contain a lot of sugar
Mangoes are exotic and juicy-sweet.
But those who want to pay attention to their lean line are often discouraged by them.
Because mangoes contain a relatively high amount of sugar - especially saccharose.
However, the exotic fruits are healthy: they contain B vitamins as well as the vitamins E and C. Mainly, mangoes contain a lot of vitamin A and its precursor beta-carotene.
Those who eat the fruits thus support vision, immune system and metabolic processes in the body.
When buying, mangoes should not be too soft or too hard and smell pleasant.
The shell color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so even green mangoes can taste very delicious.
They should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days.
Then, of course, they taste pure or sweet food.
However, a mango also gives hearty dishes a special note.
It soothes the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chicoree and Radiccio.
And a mangochutney fits well with fish, poultry, lamb and wild.
UPS is recruiting up to 95,000 packages for Christmas business in the U.S.
The company has already begun recruiting seasonal workers, UPS said on Tuesday.
Especially drivers are sought.
As early as last year, UPS increased its staff by 95,000 for the holiday season.
In the face of the booming online business, UPS and its competitor FedEx have been making arrangements earlier last year to be ready for the Christmas business.
In 2013, delayed deliveries caused harsh criticism to the package services.
First a storm, then a cold front
In the valleys, the Alpine north side of the Föhn will break through the next night, as Meteoschweiz announced on Tuesday.
On Wednesday and in the night of Thursday, the foehn blows through the foehntals in part with storm strength.
After Föhnende on Thursday morning, a marked cold front crosses us, bringing strong rains, winds and a drop in temperature.
As MeteoNews writes in a statement, Switzerland is currently at the forefront of an extensive low-pressure area across the British Isles in a strong southwest stream.
On the Alpennord side, in the night to Wednesday, the foehn breaks through the valleys.
As a result, the foehn blows up to Thursday morning in the foehn valleys with boils of 60 to 100 km/h, individually and in particular in Urnerland, in part also with over 100 km/h.
The dryer can penetrate to the adjacent Middleland, and on the mountains, hurricanes of more than 120 km/h are even possible.
While in the north on Wednesday, stormy dryer causes summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees, moisture begins to sink on the southern slope of the Alps.
It rains, which lasts until Thursday night.
In total, south of the Alps in the next 48 hours with partially over 100 liters of rain per square meter, this after the recent days have already fallen large amounts of rain.
On Thursday morning, the dryer is running out of the air, as a result of which a cold front with strong, sometimes fierce rain rolls over Switzerland from west to east.
Together with the cold front, the wind refreshes strongly to stormy, and the temperatures decline significantly.
The following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees in autumn, while in the south it will be sunnier and warmer on the weekend with up to 25 degrees.
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
Nearly 500 years after the Reformation, there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome.
In the presence of city president Ignazio Marino, a previously nameless square in the park on the Oppio Hill was named in honor of the German Reformator on Wednesday.
At the Piazza Martin Lutero he is now honored as a "German theologian of the Reformation".
The park is located in the middle of ancient Rome right next to the Colosseum.
The name was requested by the Working Community of the Evangelical Churches in Rome.
Jens-Martin Kruse, pastor of the Evangelical Lutheran community in Rome, reminded on Wednesday that the Protestants in the city of the popes for centuries, as a minority, could often only live their faith in secret.
The square symbolizes the welcome of their tradition of the Christian faith in Rome.
Martin Luther (1483-1546) was a young Augustinian monk and spent several months in Rome around the turn of 1510-11.
At that time he felt the city as a sinful Babylon.
His negative impressions are believed to have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome, according to historians.
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses against the trade in expropriation.
Hammer artist invested three years in personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the (golden) thorn crown is one of the main works that Otmar Alt painted for his Bible.
Klaus Altepost wrote the introduction and updated biblical texts.
Was the Word in the beginning?
No, not at the Otmar-Alt Bible, which has now appeared with magnificent images.
At the beginning, the picture was for Otmar Alt, who in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas.
His “language” with colorful colors and imaginative shapes has been retained by the 75-year-old – which is by no means synonymous with “fun” images.
On the contrary: adapted to the respective topics, this can seem quite dark.
About three years Otmar Alt has worked on his Bible project, for which he has made a subjective-artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the "Book of All Books".
There have been cycles devoted to themes such as the crossroads, plagues, commandments or our Fathers.
With this, he has spontaneously fascinated several partners: this applies to the Luther-Verlag with its theological orientation as well as to the Kettler-Verlag with its focus on art books.
And there is above all the author Klaus Altepost, who has dealt with the respective biblical passages on the basis of the painting.
He has interpreted the Bible passages selected by Otmar Alt and thus "translated" them into today's context.
These texts are like verbal mirrors of Alts painting.
They are embedded between the original Bible quote of Martin Luther and each sentence of the artist, who here formulates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation.
The jewelry has golden letters.
Thus, the 75-year-old allows double a deep insight into his soul, his emotions.
This is a high level of intimacy.
Emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project: Otmar Alt, born in 1940 in Wernigerode and raised in Berlin, comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant Herrnhuter Order.
"There the upbringing happened once with the pipeline," recalls Otmar Alt.
“I tried to work on that, so that I might be able to reconcile myself with the Lord Father again.”
His second concern is to bring art back to greater importance in a fast-moving time: "The perception of image worlds is now marked by advertising, and it is loud.
Symbolism is removed.
Artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things.
Images always have something mysterious and are not decorative.
In that sense, I am a dinosaur.
Otmar Alt wants the viewers to "fall into" the images, let them affect themselves, discover and feel the power they have: "The picture seeks its counterpart."
Klaus Altepost confessed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Otmar-Alt Bible at the Otmar-Alt Foundation that he "has always been" a lover of Otmar Alt's art: "I like how he understands life with his pictures."
Old did not care to comprehend the Bible completely, but chose the topics that were important to him, even mysterious.
"This was not a cooperation on an equal level," says Altepost: "This is about the images, the text only explains."
For Hans Möhler of the Luther-Verlag, this work is an invitation “to deepen his life and find freedom”.
Otmar Alt’s paintings speak for Möhler both the (biblical) language of love and responsibility.
Part of the original - paper and canvas paintings - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will open on November 15 at the Otmar-Alt Foundation.
Construction of the BMX train begins
Plans were made, space was found, companies were commissioned, hills were modeled for a round course: a year later, almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BMX railroad, it was over again.
Failures in politics and administration caused distress, especially among the locals who did not want to tolerate the train.
So hills displaced, new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission.
The approval will come in October, first counselor Sabine Mosebach-Bock could now announce in the children and youth committee.
“I hope that something visible will happen this year,” she said.
It should then be started without "further memorial break" with the work at the former hall pool.
DFB increases commitment to refugees
The DFB expands its commitment to refugees until 2019, the Bundesliga puts a clear sign on the weekend.
Football is responding to the worsening situation in Germany and securing its help to the politics in dealing with the upcoming problems.
“I consider this to be the biggest challenge for our country since reunification.”
In principle, no one can say, it doesn’t matter to me, I have nothing to do with it.”
"It must be of interest to everyone to get this issue under control," said DFB chief Wolfgang Niersbach.
At his annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on September 23 in Berlin, he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively.
“I will be in the chancellor’s office next Wednesday and there I will meet with the Minister of State, Ms. Özoğuz, and the Chancellor.”
“That will play a central role,” he said.
Football can and will help.
But the decisive steps must be taken by politics.
The German Football Federation has extended its refugee initiative “1:0 for a Welcome” by four years.
“Through the Egidius-Braun Foundation, we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019,” Niersbach said on the sidelines of the UEFA meeting in St. Julian’s, Malta.
Several Bundesligists also support this program.
Already this weekend, the 36 professional clubs will make a clear sign when they will bear the inscription "We help - #refugeeswelcome" on the left armor instead of the otherwise usual sponsor logo (Hermes).
“We also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can,” said Leverkusen’s sports director Rudi Völler to the Bild newspaper (Tuesday) and described the project as “natural”.
“The refugee drama affects everyone, no one should look away.”
“We can, no, we must use our radiance, our influence and our capabilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly,” said Hertha manager Michael Preetz.
Hoffenheim’s managing director Peter Rettig spoke of a “prominent sign of the league.”
For the qualifying match against Hungary this Friday, the women’s national team will invite 100 refugees to Halle/Saale.
Niersbach described the support for refugees as "a great joint work of German football".
That all 36 licensing associations had started their own projects in their locations was great.
It is also great that small and small groups are active.
The message “1:0 for a welcome” that we have issued is being lived in football.
“That is of enormous importance,” he said.
This year and next year, the Association, together with the DFB Selection and the Federal Government, will allocate €300,000 each for the integration of refugees.
"The clubs have already raised the entire amount for 2015," Niersbach.
Report: SAP Chairman loses an eye in an accident
Bill McDermott, the chief executive of Europe’s largest software company, lost his left eye in a fall in early July.
In the accident on the stairs in his brother's house in the U.S., after midnight, he fell on a glass of water that he carried in his left hand, the "Economic Week" on Wednesday.
"He is almost bleeding, was impotent, then dragged out on the street - he told us this last week," said SAP co-founder Hasso Plattner.
McDermott can continue his work.
“We will meet in early October before the supervisory board meeting in Walldorf,” Plattner said.
The 54-year-old manager was present at the meeting and "fully working".
McDermott announced in an interview with the "Süddeutsche Zeitung" that he would return to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group.
“I’m full there for SAP, full in my job.”
"Of course, I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Hasso Plattner all the time," McDermott told "SZ".
McDermott usually travels between Germany and the United States, but since the summer he has not been in the German SAP headquarters in Walldorf.
To him it is important to go to the public with such a personal story, the manager told "SZ": "Everyone can happen to something like this."
“It’s important to get up again when you have fallen.”
McLaren replacement pilot Magnussen out of battle
Magnussen tweeted a corresponding photo, stating that he suffered the injury when he fell from the wheel.
He will therefore not be challenged at the night race in Singapore on the weekend as a reserve driver for the two regular drivers Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button, as well as a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan.
Football: BVB without giants against Krasnodar: Weedfeller in the goal
At Borussia Dortmund, all hopes for a comeback of Marco Reus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken.
The national player will also be missing the table leader of the Bundesliga football in the duel with FK Krasnodar on Thursday (19.00 PM/Sky).
“Unfortunately we can’t resort to him,” Thomas Tuchel said on Wednesday.
Whether Reus will be back in the Bundesliga top game against Leverkusen on Sunday, the BVB coach left open: "We expect a return from him to training on Friday."
Given the high load on his professionals, Tuchel will not only change his stammelf on the Giant position.
He announced a change in the position of the goalkeeper.
This is why Roman Weidenfeller takes the place of Stammkeeper Roman Bürki.
"He's training at an absolute top level," the football teacher praised the world champion.
Whether Weidenfeller will be used in all Europa League games in the future, however, Tuchel left open.
He is also likely to play the second game.
Reus’s research statement that the final draw for the BVB in the Europa League must be the goal holds midfielder Julian Weigl understandable: “It’s not that Marco is wrong.”
“I think we have a good chance to take the title.”
Robot cars: Government wants to play a pioneering role for Germany
Germany, according to the will of the federal government, should be a technological pioneer in changing the car.
On Wednesday, the Federal Cabinet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU), which, among other things, provides for investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure.
Dobrindt spoke in Frankfurt on the sidelines of the IAA on Wednesday of a “new era of mobility”.
Automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and reduce congestion, Dobrindt said.
He also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G7 countries, who will also meet with industry representatives at the IAA.
The Ministry of Transportation’s strategy paper emphasizes, among other things, the importance of the expansion of mobile broadband and a rapid transition to digital audio.
For the testing of new technology, a test track is currently being created on Highway 9 in Bavaria.
In order for the driver "not to be charged with additional liability risks", the federal government wants to review the legal framework and, where necessary, adapt to the new developments.
Germany, for example, is committed to raising the maximum speed for self-driving cars from 10 to 130 km/h.
The federal government also wants to push for a change to the Vienna Convention, which so far only provides for people as drivers.
With automated driving, the car increasingly takes the lead, the driver becomes more and more the passenger.
The technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process the data in seconds.
According to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy, highly automated driving on motorways will be technically possible by 2020.
Nevertheless, driverless vehicles on public roads are not expected until far beyond 2020.
The value added in the field of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the site in Germany is estimated by the authors of the study to be around 8.4 billion euros for 2025.
“The digital networking of the car can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic,” said Sören Bartol, the SPD’s transport politician.
However, the issue of liability in case of accidents and the safety of driver’s personal data must be clearly clarified.
However, the Germans still view self-driving cars with skepticism – much more than the French or Americans.
A survey by the Forsa Institute on behalf of the test organization Dekra, presented at the AA on Wednesday, concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous cars will prevail in the next ten years, 32 percent expect it only in 20 years, 31 percent do not believe it at all.
In France, 21 percent of respondents expect to have autonomous cars by 2025, compared to 33 percent in the U.S.
German drivers are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self-driving vehicle.
According to a survey by the digital association Bitkom, only seven percent would agree to give up control during the entire ride on all roads.
On the highway this could be imagined in the flowing traffic 15 percent, in the congestion 45 percent.
Approximately one in four would not leave control of the car under any circumstances.
Boll announces team and double start at Table Tennis EM
The Düsseldorfer will, according to the current state of affairs, fight for the title from September 25 to October 4.
The final decision should be made no later than September 22.
“This is a huge loss for our team.”
“The boys learned this in the morning.”
"But we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo," said Bundestrainer Jörg Roßkopf during the EM course in Düsseldorf.
Boll was on a flight at that time for a long-term sponsorship appointment in China.
The 34-year-old German champion is expected to return on Friday.
"Without Timo is the disadvantage, we are no longer such a clear favourite," said single European champion Dmitry Ovtcharov.
But the Hamelner, who leads the set list in Yekaterinburg, also recalled the 2013 Euro in Schwechat.
At that time, Timo also missed, and we became European champions.”
“This is what we should focus on,” said the fifth world ranking.
English national football player Luke Shaw of Manchester United suffered a serious injury to his right leg.
In the Champions League game at PSV Eindhoven, the defender was hit in a tackling by Héctor Moreno and replaced after a long treatment.
The first diagnosis indicated that the 20-year-old player of Bastian Schweinsteiger had a bone fracture.
Gaultier Feels Too Old for an Enfant Terrible
It’s a mixture of a very large fashion show and a wax-figured grocery cabinet: Designer Jean Paul Gaultier (63) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday.
The highlights: showcase dolls that look terrifyingly human thanks to video projections.
They wear the spectacular creations of the French designer, who, among other things, became the great star of the fashion scene with Madonna’s stage outfits – and by putting men in shirts.
“I can’t say I’m the enfant terrible of Haute Couture because I have white hair.”
“Before it was bleached, now it’s real,” Gaultier said.
For the visitors to the exhibition "From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk" (From The Sidewalk To The Catwalk), which is to be seen in the Art Hall of the Hypo-Cultural Foundation from September 18, it is fortunate that the fashion creator has changed his initially rejecting attitude to a show about his person.
In fact, he was against it, because, “For me, an exhibition sounded a bit after death,” he said.
When you die, you go to the museum.
The impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal, Canada and at Paris Station.
"It's about so much more than just beautiful clothes," said the director of the Kunsthalle, Roger Diederen.
It is about tolerance, acceptance and the vision of an open society.
The exhibits give an insight into the hardly yet overlooked work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed a training.
Chronologically, the show is not structured, but it is an excellently choreographed overall artwork, for which a lot of effort has been done: for example, a stylist was hired specifically to hair the dolls.
According to the curator Thierry-Maxime Loriot, 14 tons of material have been transported to Munich.
Shortly before the start of the Oktoberfest there was another special shaman: a leather pants outfit with a corset.
Heidi meets Madonna.
He has always been interested in strong women (“women are smarter than men”) and people who are a little different, Gaultier said.
Gaultier’s old Teddy is also shown in the exhibition.
It represents the designer’s first, stunning fashion attempts.
As a child (he wasn’t a good student and bad in football) he wore his Teddy bhs and clothes, Gaultier said.
To play with a doll, his parents would not have allowed him.
He later taught himself fashion design.
He stole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers, as Gaultier told in Munich.
I bought them later, of course.
For his first fashion show, he could not afford the models.
They did not get anything, but they were allowed to keep their clothes.
Jewelry instead of curtains - Plauer top as a fashion niche
Previously, it was about the long stickers in and around gossip about making meters.
The embroidered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers, who further processed them, for example, into ceilings and curtains.
This alone no longer works today, explains Andreas Reinhardt, managing director of the Fashion Spitze Plauen.
Instead, fashion is important again.
In the early days of the Pluenese peak, fashion played a larger role, was then displaced by the home textile industry – and is now rediscovered as a niche.
Reinhardt cites some examples: top in jewelry, in accessories such as bags and in regional costumes.
Overall, the so-called vintage fashion, which relies on past style epochs, has an increasing order potential.
Those who do not serve niches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market.
We already make half of our orders.
Modespitze Plauen is, along with nine other companies, a member of the Plauener Spitze und Stickereien industry association.
Only you are allowed to wear the protected label.
Over the past 15 years, about 80% of sales have been lost.
There are almost no private specialty shops and even wholesale trade.
Our products hardly reach customers in this way.
Mass goods are now manufactured in Asia much cheaper and are distributed almost exclusively via chains.
In addition, exports are weakening, currently to Russia and the United States.
There are enough reasons for new ways.
The industry association is also trying to score through environmental awareness, as Cordula Bauer of Stickperle in Falkenstein explains: "Since this year we have a quality stamp that shows that we produce ecologically and socially sustainable."
Reinhardt adds: “This also applies to the materials used.”
Ute Schmidt, a graduate designer, teaches at the Schneeberger Outdoor Department of the University of West Saxony in Zwickau – at the Faculty of Applied Arts – and specializes in brushing and spikes.
In order to compete with the competition from the Asian region, you need to find high-quality and innovative products.
It takes time and courage.
There is a field of tension between the most fresh ideas of designers and the that need to think economically above all,” says Schmidt.
Therefore, an existing design is often only slightly varied to keep a customer base.
A few years ago, textile designer Kati Reuter revived the historic snowball tip.
In some places, the machine sticks small balls.
Plauen goldsmither Bianca Hallebach-Krauße was inspired by this: "Before, I could not do anything with the traditional Plauen tip."
Now she uses the snowball tip for her jewelry.
In a complex procedure, she molds the pattern in silver.
“A lot of people in the region identify with the theme of Plauener Spitze – young and old,” says Reuter.
It also delivers to the U.S., Australia and Finland – especially to customers whose ancestors lived in and around Ploué and who want a souvenir.
In this way, I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the plauen top.
Disney is planning a new Mary Poppins movie
You shouldn’t touch legends, but Disney still dares to make a new movie of its classic “Mary Poppins”.
However, according to Entertainment Weekly, it is not a new film, but a kind of sequel that plays 20 years after the first film with the magical babysitter.
It is about Nanny’s experiences with the Banks family during the world economic crisis in England.
Who will play Poppins more than 50 years after Julie Andrews is still unclear.
The director is Rob Marshall with "Into the Woods".
Xi urges wider opening of the economy to the world
The economy needs to open more widely to the outside to boost growth, President Xi Jinping told a group commissioned to guide the reform on Tuesday.
"China should strive to attract foreign investment and know-how and improve strategies for business startups," he said in a speech at the 16th meeting of the Central Leadership Group on Deepening Comprehensive Reform.
Encouraging new foundations and pushing forward reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth, Xi said.
The Governing Group has adopted a number of guidelines, including a negative list on regulating market access, easing border control policies, promoting state-owned enterprises (SOE), incorporating private capital, and overhauling the resident notification system.
According to the statement, a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment.
The system is gradually being tested and improved through test programs.
The initiative is important because it gives the market a greater role in allocating resources, ensures a rule of law business environment and makes the market more open, the statement said.
The government will also loosen controls over the powers delegated to companies and ensure that companies decide how to conduct their business.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
As part of an offer to open government-controlled sectors, further areas will be opened for private investment.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide better services to them," the statement said.
In addition, it will make it easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the "Green Card" by optimizing the requirements and facilitating the application process.
The right to guarantee lawyers to carry out their activities and to employ professional judges and prosecutors was also discussed at a hearing.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and key leaders such as Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement released after the meeting.
EU plans to double the level of mercury in predatory fish
The European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predatory fish, thereby giving consumers a significantly higher dose of the nerve poison.
The consumer organization Foodwatch, which has a relevant EU work paper, sharply criticized the plans: “The risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are being passed on with full emphasis to pregnant women and young children,” said Matthias Wolfschmidt of Foodwatch.
According to Wolfschmidt, the limit values of the nerve poison for large fish at the end of the food chain such as sharks or swordfish are to be raised from one to two milligrams of mercury per kilogram of fish for "economic reasons".
However, large predatory fish are already so heavily loaded with mercury that on the basis of the limits still in force, about 50 percent of the catches are not allowed to be sold.
If the limit values were doubled, only 14.5 percent would remain out of sale.
In exchange for this easing, the EU plans to tighten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milligrams to 0.1 milligrams of mercury per kilogram.
Foodwatch called this a "trick" because smaller landfish, such as carp, are usually loaded so low that they meet the planned maximum levels already today.
The reduction in small fish is therefore "a perverse distraction maneuver that only helps the economy," Wolfschmidt explained.
Mercury is a highly toxic heavy metal for humans, which is heavily enriched throughout the food chain, especially in predatory fish.
The federal government therefore warns that “already small amounts, especially in unborn children, can cause damage to the nervous system.”
However, the Federal Ministry of Environment declares on its homepage that a “health hazard to the general population” is not to be expected.
Mercury enters the environment mainly through the combustion of coal.
German coal-fired power plants are emitting more than six tons of mercury a year, two-thirds of the total amount emitted in Germany, according to a written report from the Federal Ministry of Environment to the Greens-Bundestags member Annalena Baerbock.
The concentration of mercury in fish such as in the Elbe, the Rhine and the Danube was "permanently and widespreadly exceeded," the "Spiegel" quoted in the paper in March.
Last year, EU-wide warnings about mercury in fish were already among the most commonly health risks in the EU’s RASFF warning system.
