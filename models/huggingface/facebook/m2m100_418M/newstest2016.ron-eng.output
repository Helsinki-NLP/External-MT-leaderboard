UN head says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said his response to Russia’s military support for Syria is that “there is no military solution” to the conflict that has lasted almost five years and more weapons would only make the violence and suffering of millions of people worse.
The UN head again urged all parties, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban said on Wednesday at a conference that he intends to meet this month with foreign ministers from five permanently present countries in the Council – the U.S., Russia, China, England and France – on the edge of the General Assembly’s ministerial session to discuss Syria.
Ban expressed regret that divisions in the Council and between the Syrian people and the regional powers “made this situation unresolved.”
Ban called on the five permanent members to prove their solidarity and unity when they managed to conclude an agreement on Iran’s nuclear weapons, thus addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 figures from surveys that show that Donald Trump has real chances
Some have tried to label him as a “flip-flop” politician.
Some called it a joke.
And others are waiting for the implosion.
But no matter how some Republicans try to throw Donald Trump out of the top of the surveys, it didn’t work (now).
Ten of the last 11 national surveys have shown that Donald Trump leads with a two-digit percentage and some voices begin to be seriously wondering what this means for the possibilities of the real estate mould’s appointment.
Of course, it is still premature.
Nothing in all of this says that Trump will win the race for the nomination of the Republicans.
Pundits shows that, in the same period of 2011, Rick Perry's advance made Herman Cain place in surveys, but none of them won in any state in the nomination race.
And the reasons why it would be hard to fight in general elections are numerous.
But outside groups such as Jeb Bush’s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth admit Trump’s power and begin to support him with money.
Here we present you a few figures from recent surveys that suggest that real estate moves are not just something passing:
The figures that indicate Trump’s support have returned to 180 degrees.
Even before Donald Trump announces his candidacy in mid-June, a survey by the University of Monmouth showed that only two out of 10 Republicans had a positive opinion about the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, the percentage increased to 40%.
Earlier this year it was 52%.
At present, six out of 10 Republicans have a positive opinion about Donald Trump.
Approximately three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
These figures remain.
A survey conducted last week by Quinnipiac in Iowa concluded that 60% of the Republicans in the region have a favourable opinion about Trump.
Two-thirds of GOP voters would be happy if Trump won the nomination race.
In a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, 67% of Republicans said they would be “untuziasmated” or “multified” if Trump wins the nomination race.
Only two out of 10 say they would be "surprising" if Trump wins the nomination race.
Only Ben Carson generates approximately the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43% say they would be “inthusiasmatic” against 40% who say the same thing about Trump).
The closest about enthusiasm.
Marco Rubio is 21 percent.
On the other hand, 47% of Republican voters say they would be “unhappy” or “exaggerated” if favourite Jeb Bush wins the nomination race.
Most Republicans don’t see Trump’s temperament as a problem.
Although Donald Trump has been strongly criticized for his insults and his bombastic style, 52% of Republican voters at the national level believe the real estate mogul has the right temperament to be president, according to a survey conducted Monday by ABC News/Washington Post.
We find the same figures in the state of Iowa, where 52% of Republicans believe that Trump has the right personality to be a leader, according to a Quinnipiac survey last week.
However, 44% believe he has no personality needed to act effectively and almost six out of 10 independent people say his temperament has nothing to look for at the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters get used to the idea.
When they take the attitude of intellectuals, Republican voters consider Trump to be authentic.
According to a survey conducted last week by CNN/ORC, on the question who has the most chances of winning the GOP nomination race, four out of 10 said Trump.
The situation changed from the end of July, when four out of 10 would have bet on Jeb Bush.
Full information: in the past, GOP voters did not read the future very well.
In the same period of the last elections, four of the 10 Republicans chose Rick Perry in the nomination race, against just 28% for Mitt Romney.
However, these figures show that the majority of GOP voters consider Trump’s campaign plausible.
Even if the Republicans or rejected to another candidate. Trump is still in the forefront of all.
Some voices say that the divided situation will likely contribute to Trump’s victory, while the support against Trump will be divided into more than twelve candidates.
But a survey conducted in early September by the University of Monmouth shows that, in the hypothetical situation of a collaboration between Trump and the majority of the other Republican candidates, Trump will almost always benefit from the majority support.
Trump is 13 points away from Carly Fiorina, 14 points away from Marco Rubio, 15 points away from Walker, 19 points away from Jeb Bush and 33 points away from Rand Paul, John Kasich and Chris Christie.
It’s almost equal to Ted Cruz.
The only candidate to defeat him.
Ben Carson would defeat the businessman with 19 points in a hypothetical confrontation from one to one.
The majority of Donald Trump supporters say they have decided.
A new CBS/NYT survey on Tuesday shows that more than half of voters who support Trump say they don’t change their voting option.
Of course, a lot can happen in this regard and no one can say they will never change.
46% say they leave the door open to the possibility of changing their option.
However, Trump’s most important opponent is currently the neurochirurg Ben Carson, but it’s twice as likely that voters who say they’ve decided to vote with Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants “violators” in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has been the central topic in the 2016 campaign.
Some are concerned that Trump’s bombastic style will lead to a breakdown between important Spanish voters and the Republican Party and will damage rebranding efforts.
However, according to a Monday ABC/Post survey, six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on the issue of immigration.
So, it seems that as long as the issue of immigration remains in the light of the reflectors, the same will remain with Doland Trump.
The frustration of the authorities reaches new heights.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson are now supported by almost half of the Republican voters, mostly due to their status of outsiders.
According to a Monday survey by ABC/Post, six out of 10 Republicans say they prefer a political outsider in detriment of someone with experience in government.
People are also angry about the authorities in Washington.
A survey conducted two weeks ago in Iowa by Des Moines Register/Bloomberg shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are frustrated by the performance of the Republicans in COngres, 54% declaring themselves "unhappy" and 21% "nervious at the height."
Jeremy Corbyn takes his debut at Prime Minister's Questions
Since his election, Mr. Corbyn's debut at PMQs has been long awaited
The new Labour Party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, will later make his debut at Prime Minister's Questions, facing for the first time with David Cameron.
Mr. Corbyn will address the first of the six questions to which he is right shortly after lunch; his performance will probably be closely analyzed by the media and Labourist parliamentarians.
As part of the weekly performances, he called for “fewer theatre and more facts.”
He also said he could give up some participations and give them to his colleagues.
The confrontation will be Mr. Corbyn’s first parliamentary test in the leadership position, coming after he named a “phantom cabinet” and after the speech he held on Tuesday at the annual TUC congress.
Meanwhile, the decision of the leader of the Labour Party to keep silence at the rise of the national hymn in a service held on Tuesday on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of England attracted criticism from conservative parliamentarians and held the first page of the newspapers.
Mr. Corbyn's decision not to sing the national hymn has attracted attention
A spokesman for Mr. Corbyn said he “haved silence in a respectful way” and recognized “the heroism of the British Air Force in the Battle of England.”
But a member of Mr. Corbyn's ghost cabinet, Owen Smith, told the BBC's Two's Newsnight show that he would have recommended the Labourist leader to sing the national hymn "independent" of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished.
About twelve ministers in the Ghost Cabinet refused to be part of Mr. Corbyn's lead team, arguing by differences in economic, defence and foreign affairs, while less than a half of the parliamentary party supported him as a leader.
BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant said the political differences in the Labour Party "accumulate" after Mr. Corbyn's appointment regarding his position towards the European Union and the limit of benefits.
Mr. Corbyn said at the TUC conference that the Labour Party will bring changes that will completely eliminate the idea of limitation.
A few hours later, Mr. Smith, Minister of Labour and Pensions, said that the party “is very clear” in its exclusive opposition to the government’s plans to reduce the “head” level from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr. Corbyn will be the fifth Labourist leader that David Cameron has faced at the tribune in the last decade since he took the leadership of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who has promised a different approach to politics, says he has ideas “from external sources” for questions to ask Mr Cameron and that he has received more than 30,000 suggestions.
Parliamentary Islington North said that PMQs involve a too high level of confrontation and that it will abstain from replies and attacks, committing to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges faced by young people.
Mr. Corbyn said that Angela Eagle, the Minister of Finance, will hold his place at PMQs when he can’t participate – for example when Mr. Cameron travels abroad.
He also expressed the idea that he will allow other colleagues to take the word occasionally, saying he addressed the President of the House of Representatives, John Bercow, to discuss this issue.
In 2005, when he took over the leadership, Mr. Cameron said he wanted to give up the political style “Punch and Judy” often associated with PMQs but admitted a few years later that he failed in his move.
Since the first broadcast, in 1990, PMQs has been considered a key barometer of the reasoning of a leader, the way he leads the House of Deputies and his position among parliamentary colleagues, although critics claim that he has become a caricature and that he needs a deep reform.
“Face in Joburg”: Youth without shelter benefit from photography courses
It’s hard to be a person without shelter in Johannesburg.
But a group of people who lived on the streets in their childhood found a way to learn a career and earn their life.
“I was shot in Joburg” is a non-profit studio that teaches young people without shelter to take pictures of the areas in which they live and make money from it.
BBC News met with one of the first graduates of the project.
Head of JD Sports says higher wages could damage the expansion
JD Sports President Peter Cowgill said a minimum wage increase in the UK could mean “a greater purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers.”
However, it is unlikely that that purchasing power will exceed the higher costs for the workforce within the company, he says.
The costs could have an impact on JD Sports’ expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer new jobs.
Thanasi Kokkinakis supported by Tennis Australia President Steve Healy
Thanasi Kokkinakis would deserve to be praised and not criticized for his behavior.
Thanasi Kokkinakis was a side victim in the “fortune” created around his friend, Nick Kyrgios, and his behavior deserves rather words of praise and is not critical, in the opinion of Tennis Australia president, Steve Healy.
Kokkinakis, the youngest part of the talented duel often called “Special Ks,” was unpleasantly thrown in the light of the reflectors by the scandalous departure Kyrgios had against Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters tour.
In a qualifying crunch match played shortly after, in Cincinnati, the chair judge had to intervene twice to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison, after which Harrison said: “Wawrinka had to put Kyrgios on the ground, and I had to put that kid on the ground.”
Although it was last seen doing a dust missile after having muscle cramps and missed a possible US Open tour, angry Richard Gasquet, Kokkinakis was firmly defended by Healy.
The teenager is currently in Glasgow, where he fights with Sam Groth for the second place in individual, after Bernard Tomic in the Davis Cup semi-finals against England.
“One thing I feel strongly is that, in my opinion, Thanasi was attracted a little into conflict,” Healy said.
The truth is that he broke a missile when he lost because he accused cramps in the US, but he’s not the first player to break a missile from frustration over himself and know Thanasi well enough to know he’t be proud of it.
But to be serious, he mastered very well in quite challenging situations in the US with Harrison and so on and I think it’s worth a lot of confidence.
He has an extraordinary team, has a great family alongside and I think he has been treated unfairly.
He is a very mature 19-year-old boy, he works hard and integrated into the team, he has had no conflict with other players, he is very respected in clothing, he worries hard, he is in excellent shape, he is a very balanced and mature young man and I think it is worth being judged exclusively on the basis of his qualities and defects.
Healy also supported the decision not to take Kyrgios into consideration for the important remission match, which starts on Friday, and described the “common decision” as the most suitable for all, but supported the long-term return of the Canberra-born player to the team.
“First of all, we want the team to focus fully on the match and not think at all about the controversy around [Kyrgios],” Healy said.
And I think Nick climbed very quickly, as people like Federer and Murray claimed, he mature under the eyes of the public and made some terrible mistakes and is worth being criticized, but we try to support him, we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions and I think he needs a time in which he is not at the center of attention to be able to reflect, good for both the team and for him.
Elections 2016: Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Bernie Sanders decreased by half in national surveys
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still has a two-digit advantage in the democratic race for national candidacy, but Senator Bernie Sanders wins the ground.
Clinton is now supported by 47% of Democratic voters (down from 58%), while Sanders is on the second place, with 27% (up from 17%).
Vice-President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will candidate for the presidency, is supported by 15% of the Democratic voters.
At least five months before the first election, most Democratic voters say it’s too early to say they’ve decided on the candidate they’re going to support.
But Clinton’s supporters are more firm in their choice than the supporters of other candidates.
Faced with the CBS news survey last month, Clinton lost land in a number of demographic groups, while Sanders won a few percent.
Clinton retains the advantage among women and moderators, but the advantage has decreased.
Support among men has decreased considerably and Sanders is at a distance of only 5 points.
Clinton’s advantage among the Democratic voters under the age of 50 has disappeared, being now equal to Sanders.
However, Clinton is still in the advantage among the elderly voters.
Last month, Clinton was in front of Sanders, with a percentage of two figures among the liberals, but Sanders now has a slight 5-point advantage in this group.
Approximately half of national Democratic voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she was chosen to candidate on behalf of the party.
A quarter would support it somewhat reserved and another 15% would support it just because it represents the party.
6 percent would not support it.
Per unsurprisingly, the probability that Clinton’s current supporters will be enthusiastic about her choice is high.
Opinions are more mixed among those who don’t currently support Clinton – only about a quarter would support her with enthusiasm.
While 48% of Democratic voters say they would support Clinton with enthusiasm, the number of Republican voters who say the same about the first ranking, Donald Trump (35%) is lower.
When Clinton’s supporters are asked an open question about why she would like to win the race, the majority answer is that she has the right experience (16%), followed by the fact that it’s time for a woman to be president (13%) and that she’s the best candidate for this post (10%).
Clinton’s supporters also mention her association with Bill Clinton (9%).
The agreement on these matters and eligibility are also mentioned.
Given that the Vice-President is considering a possible presidential candidacy, 57% of the Democratic voters would like to see him run - although a third believes he shouldn’t be candidate.
At the question of the second option for the party’s representative, the Democratic voters call Biden a majority.
Of Clinton’s supporters, more than half say Biden would be the second option, far ahead of Sanders.
If Biden decides not to nominate in the Democratic Party race, Hillary Clinton’s advantage over Sanders increases, from 20 points with Biden running to 30 points if he does not nominate.
55% of Democratic voters consider Clinton the candidate with the highest chance of winning the general elections; however, the figures fell from 78% as last month.
Biden is on the second place, but the percentage according to which he is the most eligible has increased.
However, when asked what’s most important to a chosen candidate, Democratic voters prefer issues instead of eligibility.
Like last month, no Democratic candidate or possible candidate is considered unacceptable by these voters as a party representative in the presidential race.
Democratic candidates or potential candidates do well in terms of a few key features of their party’s primary voters.
The majority of voters consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be integrated and trustworthy and have strong leadership qualities.
Biden is seen best of all three in terms of integrity, while Clinton’s strength is leadership.
30% of Democratic voters don’t think Clinton is integrate and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say this about Sanders (15%), but 27% don’t have an opinion about him in this regard.
Democratic voters also generally believe that the three, Clinton, Sanders and Biden, have the same ideologies as they.
With regard to all these aspects, about a quarter of the Democratic voters don’t have an opinion about Sanders.
As the questions persist about the use of a personal email address and a server by Hillary Clinton as she was Secretary of State, most Democratic voters are pleased with her explanation on the subject and say it has not affected their general opinion about the candidate.
But the situation is different among the American public.
Half of Americans are now unhappy with her explanation, while only a third are satisfied.
The public opinion was divided on this topic in March, shortly after the issue came out.
Most Americans say that the email controversy did not affect their general opinion about Clinton, although 36% say they changed their opinion in a negative direction.
Mostly Republicans, more than six out of 10, say they have changed their opinion about Clinton in a negative direction.
Although Democratic voters consider Clinton integral and trustworthy, this aspect continues to raise problems among voters in general: only 32% consider her integral and trustworthy, 8% less than last month and 15% less than in May.
62% of voters don’t consider it integral and trustworthy.
At the same time, 55% of national voters don’t consider Trump integrated and trustworthy.
However, both Clinton and Trump have white balls for leadership.
Of the six candidates evaluated, Biden, Carson and Bush rank first in terms of integrity.
The number of those who consider Sanders integral is greater than those who are not of the same opinion but, as in Carson’s case, many have no opinion about him.
The error margin for the sample of 351 primary Democratic voters is 6 percent points.
Five members of the brotherhood accused of killing a student in the 1st year at the Baruch Faculty
Nearly two years after a college student lost his life during an initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania, five people were accused of murder.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi Brotherhood at the Baruch Faculty in New York brutally attacked Chun “Michael” Deng during an initiation ritual in September 2013 and delayed to take him to the hospital, which contributed to his death, according to police statements.
Official sources say the victim was bound to the eye, a 14-kg sand-filled rubber was placed behind him and was repeatedly shocked while trying to go to a target on a frozen ground.
Mr. Deng accused he of headaches after which he lost consciousness.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi brother didn’t call the emergency number after he slowed down and claimed he would have waited an hour before he was taken to the hospital, the police said.
But they found the time to change Deng’s clothes, to search for his symptoms on Google and to contact Andy Meng, the chairman of the brotherhood at the national level, to ask for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference.
“At this point, members began to hide their personal property and practically put the good of the brotherhood before the good of Michael Deng,” Wagner said.
He could not be resurrected and died the next morning.
According to an autopsy report, Deng suffered repeated trauma in the head, trunks and scratches.
“Many families have been devastated by the rituals of the brotherhood, since 1970 at least one student has lost his life every year due to the rituals,” said Douglas Fierberg, Deng’s family’s lawyer, in a statement.
The brothers and their members must be liable and this measure taken by the authorities is important.
The Grand Jury of the Monroe District recommended the first five members to be accused of third-degree crime.
Another thirty-two brothers of the brotherhood, including Mr. Meng, will also be charged with ultrasound and commitment to the murder.
“We want to take responsibility not only to the people involved but if there is an organization that has authorized the brotherhood, officially or informally, we will also take responsibility,” Wagner said on Tuesday at a press conference.
The Baruch Faculty banned the brotherhood and the national brotherhood withdrew its affiliation with the local representation.
This is what will happen when the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates
The interest rate will rise and the bull market will boost, bond profitability will increase and the economy will go into recession.
that we know.
What we don’t know is how long it will happen and how long it will last.
In economics, history provides few indications of time-range.
After the first rise would rate, the recession occurred in just 11 months and lasted 86 months.
The aggressiveness of the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates is often, although not always, a determining factor in how the economy and financial assets respond.
That’s why U.S. central bank officials have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on the moment when interest rates begin to rise, but on the trajectory of the time needed to normalize.
In fact, in the game there are multiple variables.
But at the end, players on the market could find that all the agitation associated with the rise of the interest rate was exaggerated.
“The first rise of the interest rate decided by the Fed after the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some voices as a sign of the era of ‘ cheap wages,’ said Julian Jessop, chief economist at Capital Economics, in a note addressed to customers.
On the contrary, we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to more normal but still low levels to be the seismic shock that everyone seems to be afraid of.
But it cannot be said that there will be no effects.
Here we present how some sectors of the economy could react, based on historical trends:
Given the situation the market has faced in the past few months, anticipating the rise of interest rates can volatile things for a while.
But at the time of growth, the impact is not so dramatic.
“It seems that there is a tendency that capital profitability stagnates for 12-24 months after the first growth, which may again reflect the gap in monetary policy,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study on what will happen after the Fed growth.
More specifically, over the past 35 years, the market has grown suddenly – about 14 percent – towards a rise in the interest rate, quite invariable in the after 250 days period (the average rate of 2.6 percent), after which it returns to normal after 500 days, with an average return in the last six cycles of 14.4 percent, according to a recent analysis published on Barron by the chief strategist of Nuveen Asset Management.
Deutsche said the impact on the shares tends to become more prominent later in the rise rate cycle and the profits begin to decrease.
The recession is a reality of economic life but the rise in the interest rate often contributes to it.
In this situation, the Fed is facing conditions that have not existed before and which could accelerate a recession.
More specifically, the gross domestic product will approach its historic minimum point for an increase in the Fed interest rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, of the 118 rise in interest rates after 1950, only twice the nominal GDP was less than 4.5%.
Although in the second quarter of 2015 the value was 3.6%, few expect the situation to persist, the third quarter reaching only 1.5%, according to the Atlanta Fed.
The rise in the interest rate in such a fragile economy could be risky and could raise the question “if this time it’s different,” Deutsche said.
Players on the market have been preparing all year round for a growth decision by the Fed, with all eyes closed to this week’s meeting of the Federal Open Market Commission, which ends on Thursday.
Although many strategists and economists are of the opinion that the FOMC could approve an increase in the interest rate during this meeting, deadline transactions indicate a probability of only 25%.
“In our study after 1950, all the cycles of interest growth so far were in a super cycle of profit growth, the GDP eclipsing the peak before the recession very quickly after recovery began,” the report said.
On the contrary, this was a strange slow recovery after the most serious recession in the period analyzed.
The current cycle is far from the longest expected by the Fed since the end of the last recession; the record was 35 months, and it reached 74 months and continues.
The fixed income was also volatile as the market anticipates an increase in interest rates and the pattern is somewhat similar to that of dividends.
The main difference is that the impact is faster for bonds than for shares when the Fed changes its policy.
In the case of bonds, the benefits appear to change the direction as soon as the first rise/down of the cycle occurs.
At the end of the rise cycle, the profitability of bonds falls immediately,” Deutsche said.
The strategists of Charles Schwab are of the opinion that these increases in the interest rate will lead to the approximation of profitability between short-term and long-term bonds, placing the curve.
High profitability bonds are better dealt with in such a environment, although “we are still cautious in relation to forcing profitability,” said Kathy Jones, a fixed income analyst at Schwab in an analysis.
Interestingly, Jones is of the opinion that the markets have already adapted to the expectations of the Fed policy.
“In addition to the dollar’s strength and the estimated inflation decline, there are a few signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of a more rigorous monetary policy,” Jones wrote.
The short-term interest rates have risen, the profitability curve is more straightforward, the spread of the average credit interest rate has expanded and volatility has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the Fed slows the policy.
In large lines, companies that operate majority in the U.S. will have to gain from the rise in interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
High debt multinationals will suffer because the rise of the dollar will lead to the expensive cost of their products in the global market space and their debt will be more expensive.
“History shows that ‘quality’ stocks tend to be more profitable over the next three months of initial interest rate rise,” Goldman Sachs analyst said in a customer report.
Companies with strong balance sheets exceeded those with poor balance sheets after each of the interest rates increases in 1994, 1999 and 2004, with an average of 5 percentage points.
Companies with high capital revenues and low volatility stocks also exceeded similar companies with lower quality, with an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points).
The duty will become a major issue.
Companies with a high percentage of floating debt have the most to lose, Goldman says.
Consumers will also have to gain from the rise of the dollar.
Those who save could also have to win, although experts don’t fall together about how quickly this will happen.
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM, says parliamentary Andrew Bingham
Conservative Parliamentary Deputy Andrew Bingham has criticized the radio station because it’s “pronounced”
He says that he is increasingly similar to the commercial opponent.
He also looked at the BBC Music Awards, saying they plagiated the British Awards.
Collector Damien Collins attacked The Voice, saying that the show is not original.
BBC Radio 3 is “transforming into” Classic FM, said an important parliamentary, putting pressure on the post to prove that he is doing something that commercial posts don’t do.
Conservative parliamentary Andrew Bingham also told the BBC chiefs that the public radio station is “simplified” and is more and more similar to the commercial opponent.
“I have the impression that Radio 3 ‘sweets’ – although I don’t like to use the word – but I have the impression that it turns into Classic FM,” he said.
The BBC Music Awards were released last year.
The BBC Music Awards, released last year, seems to be Brits under a different name.
So if you’re trying to do something different – these are the two examples that come to my mind that only do to copy what’s already on the market,” Bingham said.
The BBC’s chief executive denied the allegations, saying BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial opponent in terms of live music and public education.
I'm not going to know anywhere about classical music I've heard from Radio 3.
And his commitment to live music and production has no rival.
“In addition, I think it’s also important the commitment of Radio 3 to discover new music and allocate new pieces,” he said.
In the first part of this year, BBC Radio 3 editor Alan Davey said he had to make more efforts to attract the audience compared to the previous period because the British had fewer knowledge of classical music.
But Radio 3 was not the only element under the label BBC criticized during the meeting of the Committee on Culture, Media and Sport because it would go on the footsteps of its commercial rivals.
Conservative parliamentary Damien Collins attacked The Voice - the talent show purchased by BBC from Dutch producer Talpa Media for the amount of about £22 million.
Do you understand why there are often discussions related to that broadcast because it is not original and is not distinguished by anything?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC1 show – having Paloma Faith and Boy George in the jury – would be performed “in a BBC-specific way.”
He added that he wanted that corporation “to find the chicken with golden eggs in its own gardens” the next time it launches a entertainment show.
However, he refused to prohibit in the future taking new seasons from The Voice or to spend the money that goes on licenses on other entertainment formats.
Online sales recorded the lowest growth in August and the fault could be Black Friday.
In the first three months of 2015, online sales increased by 7%.
The last month was the slowest growth since 2000 to date.
Online sales started three years ago, thanks to the use of the mobile phone to make purchases.
Experts believe that Black Friday in November could lead to a disadvantage of spending.
For more than a decade, online shopping has exploded and transformed UK shopping streets into ghost cities.
However, experts say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating a 7% increase in the first three months of 2015.
The total money spent in August showed the lowest growth since 2000 to date, with a growth of only 5% in the last year.
Experts say there are signs that online sales are decreasing, the latest figures indicating a growth of just 7% in the first three months of 2015.
“If we look at the growth rate in the previous years and go back to 2000, there has always been a trend of rationalization over time,” said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index, to the Guardian.
He explained that online sales took advance three years ago, when buyers began to use their mobile phone to make purchases.
Thus, it increased the number of people who could make online shopping and could do it in various circumstances, such as on the sofa.
But now that it stagnates a little, you may notice a decline (a growth).
The Black Friday phenomenon, imported from America, is mentioned as one of the reasons for the decline in sales.
According to experts, buyers would refrain from making purchases before the event that takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times the average number of buyers hanged in front of computers to put the hand on offers, which led to the collapse of the sites of several retailers.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when buyers beat the chilliers, could cause buyers' reticence.
A study published by the British Retail Consortium determined that at least £1 per £5 is spent online.
For certain products, such as TVs and washing machines, more than one-third of the purchases are currently made through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people prefer to buy clothes and shoes online than to call fashion stores in shopping areas.
After the sanctions of the bin Laden family, Muslims buried the victims of the crash of the Macarala in Mecca
The bodies of 29 of those who lost their lives were walked on the streets by Muslims, the first funeral took place in Mecca.
Saudi Arabia has partially blamed the Saudi Binladin Group for its collapse.
The Ministry of Health said that a total of 394 people were injured in the collapse of the macarala.
During the walk ceremony, hundreds of Muslims gathered to buri the 29 victims of a crash in the great mosque in Mecca.
Clothed in white, those who plagued their deaths joined on the way to express their condolences, until the first dead arrived at the end of the final journey, to the cemetery of Al-Moaissem.
The sad memory preserved by the holy place, where just a few days ago a building square collapsed through the roof of the mosque, falling the faithful.
The bodies were released for funerals after the king of Saudi Arabia sanctioned the building group of the bin Laden family for the disaster, which also sold with 394 wounded.
During the ceremony on the street, hundreds of Muslims gathered to buri the 29 victims of a crash in the great mosque in Mecca.
Among the victims was the father of four children, Qasim Akram, from Bolton, Great Manchester, who was in his first pilgrimage when the macarava collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Sea Mosque with his parents before the beginning of the annual hajj pilgrimage.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj pilgrimage in Mecca will continue, thousands of pilgrims will continue to arrive in the city.
Today, King Salman said the Binladin Group’t have to leave the macara’s arm up when the macara was not in operation.
A Arab version of the decree, published by the Saudi Press Agency, said Binladin Group is partially guilty of the collapse.
The news agency's English service did not provide the details, but said the company's leaders were banned from leaving the country.
Earlier this week, Salman swore to reveal what caused the collapse of the macara in the Grand Mosque court, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims came before the Hajj pilgrimage that takes place later this month.
Binladin Group has not yet made any statements about the collapse of the macara and the Group’s representatives were not able to be contacted for any statements.
The royal decree blamed the group for not using updated security measures and not coordinating its activities with the meteorological authorities.
Dozens of macarals surround the Sea Mosque in Mecca as part of the massive construction effort led by the Binladin Group.
For several decades, Binladin family has a close relationship with the royal family of Saudi Arabia and has carried out major construction projects.
The last al-Qaeda leader, Osama bin Laden, was a “renegated” son, destroyed by family in the 1990s.
The collapse occurred under strong winds and rain conditions, with just a few days before the arrival of millions of people in the kingdom to participate in the pilgrimage, an essential journey at least once in the life of each Muslim apt physically.
The authorities say 158 people are still in the hospital.
The authorities have decided that the relatives of the dead will receive a million Saudi Rials (174,000 pounds) and the same amount to be paid to those with permanent wounds.
Other injured will receive half of this amount.
Advantages and Disadvantages of Credit Conversion in Swiss Francs
On the banking market there have already been two offers of loans conversion in Swiss francs, the main advantages are the exclusion of currency risk and the reduction of interest rates.
Disadvantages can come over a few years, when variable interest rates can lead to increased rates.
The Bank of Transylvania has just completed the process for the conversion of loans into francs granted by Volksbank, and Bancpost has announced the conversion offer for its own customers.
According to data collected by analysts of the financial portal FinZoom, Bancpost offers three-year fixed interest at leone, 1.5%, the lowest on the market.
On the other hand, Transylvania Bank’s conversion offer was accepted by 83% of customers with credits in francs due to two consecutive discounts: the balance with the value of the customer’s risk and management fees was reduced, then an additional 22,5% reduction was applied to the balance in lei.
Both offers reduce the interest rates of their own customers, compared to the amount they paid monthly equivalent in lei before conversion.
Thus, the Bank of Transylvania reduced the rate by 42.5%, and Bancpost by 33% in the first three years and, theoretically, by 18% in the following years.
Benefits
The main advantage of loans coverage in CHF is that the currency risk is eliminated, the consumer is protected from the future cresters of the franc, and the credit refund will be made in the currency in which his salary is paid.
Another major advantage of both conversion offers is that the property is not re-evaluated, no further guarantees and another proof of revenue are required.
Practically, there will be no new financial and legal analysis of the credit and there will be no additional costs as in the case of a refinancing.
Both banks also offer a reduction on the monthly rate, compared to the amount they paid to customers before conversion, equivalent in lei.
The risks
The problem is that the rate in the first years is made up more of the interest, and the customer refunds very little of the main.
The Bancpost offer with very low interest in the first three years seems advantageous for customers.
It is unclear how the interest rate will evolve in three years.
The margin offered to customers can be higher than 3.25%, so in total, and the cost reduction is lower.
A possible risk for all loans with variable interest rate is that the ROBOR index will increase significantly over the coming years (more than the Libor - CHF index).
For example, ROBOR for three months is now 1.44%, but in 2013 it reached the value of 6%, in 2009, over 15%, and in a few days since 2008 it exceeded 40%!
In addition, there may be other costs, not mentioned in the initial offer.
The time to decide the interest rate for the U.S. Federal Reserve
The world is looking forward to the meeting scheduled for two days, Wednesday and Thursday, when the U.S. Federal Reserve will make a crucial decision whether to raise interest rates for the first time in about a decade.
In a survey conducted by Reuters with the participation of 80 economists, a little over half who last week believed that the decision would be taken, I now think that the situation will continue for a while and that interest rates will beined in the current range of 0-0,25%.
It’s a historic event since seven years have passed since the Federal Reserve brought the rates to zero.
For the first time, we are faced with a situation in which a major central bank could give up the zero rate and initiate a process of normalization of interest rates,” said Angel Ubide, chief analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy has evolved relatively well, recovery bringing trillions of dollars in balance sheet and generating a low inflation level.
But the Federal Reserve should not ignore the global situation less pink.
He warned the markets to prepare for growth but there are signs that even they believe that such a move is unlikely.
The decision will be announced on Tuesday, 20:00 CET.
People who lost their charm.
The actor (left), along with his son Redmond (right), has gone through stressful situations in recent years.
In 2001 he fought leukemia and in 2009 he lost his life partner, Farrah Fawcett, in front of cancer.
It is also rumored that the actor had faced the problem of drug consumption and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this has a cost.
Manchester United player Luke Shaw has been on the bar for several months due to double fractures.
Luke Shaw suffered a double fracture in his right leg in Manchester United's Champions League match, ending with a defeat against PSV Eindhoven.
After the event that brought tears in the player’s eyes and that will keep him on the bar for at least six months, Louis van Gaal remains optimistic that Shaw will be able to play again this season.
The accident occurred after an untouched intervention by Héctor Moreno in the 15th minute after Shaw, 20 years old, broke the PSV defense.
He received medical care for nine minutes on the ground and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said: “He has a double fracture at his leg and is in the hospital.”
He will be transferred tomorrow or maybe tomorrow then he will be operated in Manchester.
It's terrible - a boy who came to Manchester United when he was 18 years old, faces difficulties, then plays fantastic and now something like that happens.
He had an oxygen mask in his dress.
It was crying.
I am not a doctor, but at double fractures the rest is six months and will not play in the group phase.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno seems to have been lucky and escaped from the red card and the concession of a punishment blow.
Arbitrator Nicola Rizzoli has not punished the Mexican.
Van Gaal suggested that the Italian officer was wrong.
You can judge yourself when you say that it is a fault and red cardboard.
It was a very bad action, with two legs.
A message on Shaw’s Twitter account: “Thank you all for the messages, I don’t have words to express how weak I feel, I start the way to recovery, I’ll return stronger.”
Manchester United hit by Luke Shaw in PSV defeat
The founder of the England team has an additional reason to recover to play at the European Championship in France next year in June.
Phillip Cocu, PSV coach, said: “It’s a very bad injury.”
Everyone is very sad when a player suffers such a injury.
Our players are never trying to hit a opponent.
Moreno broke his foot playing for Mexican national against the Dutch national led by Van Gaal at the 2014 World Championship.
"It's very hard for him because he didn't intend to hurt his opponent, and when you hear it's a very serious injury, it's not good," Cocu said.
I haven’t seen the phase.
I could only see the ball, which was moving in another direction, so it seemed [Moreno] touched it but I couldn't see the intervention on Luke.
In a statement to SBS6, Moreno said: “I know how it is, I know how difficult it is to pass through such a thing.
I feel so bad, I feel so bad.
PSV player Andrés Guardado also arrived at the hospital after an intervention by Chris Smalling.
Adam Lyth clearly threatened the omission of England but remains strong
The victory against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task, but after seeing England's team selected for the tournament, I don't consider a 3-0 defeat repeat in the test matches.
I would not eliminate the possibility of a victory.
Maybe Alastair Cook's team has less experience than three years ago but has good players on the spin in the batting line and the collective morality is strong; they will not be marked by the 2012 events but will have a young positive attitude.
Moeen Ali evolves as a spinner and Adil Rashid, although unknown at the test level, represents an option for attack.
Similar Topics: Adam Lyth left England team for test matches and was replaced by Alex Hales
Obviously, as his main coach at Yorkshire, it’s hard for me to analyze the decision not to select Adam Lyth in the team.
He played the seven test matches against two good attackers, in difficult conditions, and the simple but hard reality is that cricket players are judged by results.
There were no signs of question related to Joe Root, for example, until the ads were made because - and I said this earlier - the players are their own selectors.
It was fifty years and Lyth might have extended his run but his fate is in his hands.
I hope that if you do more runs for Yorkshire you will have some other opportunities.
England's chief coach, Trevor Bayliss, praised his attitude even when performance was not at the level of his capabilities and it doesn't surprise me; first of all, he's a team man.
It’s hard to answer the question how long a batsman is noticed in the test matches.
Lyth had seven runs - like Sam Robson before him - while Nick Compton had nine.
Just Compton had luck at home and on the way.
The only dissatisfaction you could have was that England preferred Jonathan Trott in the Caribbean tour - when Lyth was in the maximum form - but that missed opportunity is of the field of the past.
Alex Hales, a batsman, is a good player.
He is a cricket player who has the “Factor X” and that we noticed early at Yorkshire this season when he scored 236 against us at a Trent Bridge pitch.
He should be given at least the same opportunity as his predecessors, but this will depend on the team’s composition in the UAE.
It was launched the idea that Moeen would open to the battle alongside Cook, which would lead to extra spinner keeping at the same time four quicks, and I have nothing against.
I don't see why a thinner couldn't hit there and this left player has already demonstrated that he's given to the wicked.
Maybe Moeen didn’t bring success to his district, Worcestershire, but it was number 3 for them, so the difference is not big.
My old team colleague, Justin Langer, played his first 38 test 38 matches as a first drop before entering open in 2001.
He immediately deleted three centuries and didn’t look back.
Zafar Ansari comes into the team on the backup spinner post and, although I had a limited contact with him, I was struck by the fact that he is a very impressive young man.
People could judge his young age – with an average of 31 at the battle and 35 at the ball – and could think he’s point, but there’s not a lot of spiners and the selectors have chosen for the youth.
You will learn a lot from this tour.
England has made some changes in the coach team.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardene, a Sri Lanka batsman, as a consultant for the test matches could be a master's blow.
He is one of the best players and will bring a lot of experience, since he played in any situation and against all kinds of attacks.
Paul Collingwood comes for the white-ball leg of the tournament and will bring both energy and endless ambition.
I always thought he was born to engage in international cricket, either as a player or as a coach, and just like Mahela, he has intuition.
Sometimes new voices in the dressing room, even if they transmit messages that have been transmitted and previously, can bring fresh air to the team.
Colly Durham's counterpart, Ben Stokes is resting for one-day matches, Root has received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it.
Although not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors don’t do the program.
And you need to note, the jobs of players depend on the results they get.
Such decisions are never made easily.
Brexit camp could have a causal profit if the economy remains calm until 2017
On the day that passes, David Cameron’s renewed strategy to keep Britain in the EU gets more and more confused, even without the choice of the genius Jeremy “Yes or not?” Corbyn to lead the Labour Party or TUC brings serious criticism to Europe on Tuesday.
The strangers also have characters like Corbyn and Nigel Farages.
A European diplomat explained last days that - immersed in crises similar to that in the EU - not all are provoked internally - some Member States are powered by the UK's agenda of concessions and treaties changes, which most do not want.
In Brighton, on the occasion of the annual meeting, TUC decided that they didn’t want it either if it would erode social protection.
We could even call it Dave and George’s “selfie” agenda.
The Prime Minister and Chancellor participate in top meetings or bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take a picture in front of a famous local monument, with or without the local representative, then return home and declare that they have won allies for the reform.
It’s just about me.
My European friend, who wants a UK with outlook under the EU roof – “Don’t leave us alone with France,” says Berlin – suggests that more ministers and officials from certain capitals have reached the point where they don’t care whether they stay or leave.
Angela Merkel, the extremely cautious German chancellor, is an ally but has been on the leadership for 10 years and wants to leave the position before her situation falls down, as happened to Thatcher (11 years), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16), who have been too long.
In 2017, the President of France, François Hollande, will be re-elected or replaced.
His power is in decline.
Poland could soon have a nationalist right-wing government, Spain one left-wing.
It’s hard to believe that they’ll help the photographing English, whose energy would be better used to prevent Scotland from leaving the UK – something they don’t want either because most have similar separatist trends.
Thus, some ministers might even plan to intentionally make remarks that don’t help, in the SNP style, in the 2017 UK referendum campaign to accelerate the Brexit process, suggests my friend.
“The re-negotiation was fixed” and “The UK did not get anything of value from the re-negotiation.”
Europeans know on their skin how captivating Fleet Street can be and how skeptical are the barons in the oligarchic press who look at the EU with skepticism because they did not participate in the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Benn who ratified our 1973 entry in the 2:1 ratio.
I may remind you of Boris Johnson, the euro-oportunist, who became famous in the early 90s when he was corresponding to Brussels.
Ed Miliband knew his enemies.
They included the mixture of non-tax payers, foreigners cheating by telephone and pseudo non-domains who hold most important newspapers.
In fact, Tony Blair sees him somewhat the same, but he realized that when you’re locked in a cage alongside a nervous gorilla, you’ll have to give him the bananas to distract his attention from thinking about eating lunch and tea again.
In fact, Miliband was more Blairite than Blair in opposition to Cameron's referendum idea, given that Blair made a concession on the principle to the abandoned EU constitution, buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, which offered him a outlet card.
The press did not forgive him for that.
But Jeremy Corbyn, who touched me friends on the back Monday at Westminster - I told him not to spend his time with me anymore - seems to be in danger to adopt from the eggs Murdoch’s 80-year-old Neil Kinnock’s boycott strategy, a mistake then and now.
It may take, but it must develop a coherent strategy of cooperation with the media, not with me, but with certainty with Andrew Marr whose position at the BBC left a Sunday vacation.
Corbyn’s official position towards Europe is what I would indulgence call evolution.
He said he would like to remain in a reformed EU.
The majority of those who disagree with the “anglicism” of the Conservatives might agree with it.
That Hilary said “A Benn, but not a Bennite” Benn on radio and TV this week, when the investigator in him fought not to admit that the appointment of John McDonnell by Corbyn as a “shadow” minister on financial issues was a bad idea.
He reminded me of the 70s, when his father fought on television to be unfair to his colleagues, without going too far and without losing his office.
Hilary’s struggle was more attractive.
But the struggle to stay “in any situation” – Benn’s expression – does not match what McDonnell said, nor what JC told colleagues and parliaments during the private meeting on Monday night.
Regardless of what image Corbyn wants to transmit – remember, it made me aware of me – the discipline of messages remains important in the era of television and especially in the age of social networks, a fountain of paranoia and betrayal.
It is fair not to give Cameron a favourable ticket in Europe, allowing him to take the support of the Labourists in the referendum campaign, McDonnell said.
Simon Jenkins believes that.
But the basic sofism of McDonnell and Corbyin about the EU membership — in line with their anti-capitalist past — is no longer just an esoteric discussion among leftist dissidents for which the narcissism of small differences is a central dogma.
As in the case of his NATO sophism - Tom Watson is unthinkable about the fact that the JC will not make a resignation campaign - foreign diplomats will be forced to try to understand.
Why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital – and there are suspicious voters – for concessions to the UK when everything could be useless?
The U.S. is already quite disappointed with the poor military performance of the British in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even with a conservative government that cuts costs, as I was reminded of the launch of the British Influence Security Forum on Monday.
Specialists criticize the decision of the Department of Public Health of England on electronic cigarettes
According to researchers, the statements of a government agency that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking resulted from a meeting between 12 people, some of them with links in the tobacco industry.
Specialists from the editorial team of the British Medical Journal (BMJ) joined the Lancet publication in criticism of the evidence used by the Department of Public Health of England (PHE) in its e-cigarette report.
PHE published the “reference” report last month and described it as a “complex evidence analysis.”
However, some researchers doubted the robustness of the data and showed with the finger to the links between certain experts and the tobacco industry.
An article published last month in the medical magazine Lancet attacked the “extraordinary fragil base” on which PHE founded its main conclusion.
Two other researchers who write in BMJ have questioned the claims and their fundamentation “on solid ground or on moving sand”.
Martin McKee, European public health professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, professor of clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, said: “A fundamental principle of public health is that policies must be based on evidence of effectiveness.”
They said it is expected that PHE statements that “the current estimates show that electronic cigarettes are 95% less harmful than smoking” are based on a detailed analysis of evidence and models.
In fact, a single meeting in which 12 people participated led to the development of a multi-critical decision analysis model (MCDA) to synthesize their opinions about the negative effects associated with different nicotine-containing products; the results of this meeting were briefly presented in a research work.
McKee and Capewell or claimed that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose executive director was said to have received in the past funding from British American Tobacco for conducting an independent study.
It also validated the accreditation of BAT in public health in a sustainability report, he said.
They added that one of the 12 participants at the meeting said the funding received from an electronic cigarette manufacturer but not the funding that there are reports that he would have received from the cigarette and tobacco company, Philip Morris International.
There were no arguments on the basis of which the panel members were selected, but among them are a few known “front” in the production of electronic cigarettes, some of them even declare in the work the financing of the industry.
Other participants at the meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco control department of the PHE.
The group’s research work “mushamalizes convincingly” the lack of “solid evidence of the harmful effects that most products have according to most criteria,” said McKee and Capewell.
However, the PHE report does not mention any of these links or limitations.
McKee and Capewell said PHE’s statements that “to date there is no evidence that electronic cigarettes are a factor that encourages smoking among children or non-smokers” are premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, the head of the health department at the PHE, says he has responded in the past to the claims of the BMJ.
He said: “Electronic cigarettes are significantly less harmful than smoking.”
One in two people who have smoked all their lives loses their lives due to this viciousness.
All evidence suggests that the health risks of electronic cigarettes are lower comparatively, but we must continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about the information that is repeated and the information that is not repeated from evidence, given the high degree of public confusion regarding the relative dangers compared to tobacco.
Every year, about 80,000 people lose their lives due to a smoking-related disease and the annual costs of the national health system due to smoking reach 2 billion pounds.
Clearly expressing the current evidence – that is, that although the use of electronic cigarettes is not risk-free, they represent only a fraction of the harmful effect of smoking – we fulfill our national duty.
Unlawful torture equipment - delivered to the door!
Advertisements That Make Britain's Weapons Trade Shame
Watch the film by Amnesty International against the weapons exhibition.
A terrible murder drone.
The Beast to Destroy the Gloves.
The bomb dispersed.
And electrical bastoons that cause tremendous pain without leaving traces!
The joyful voice and the animated images leave no doubt that this advertisement for the world’s largest weapons exhibition is a blurry, made by Amnesty International to emphasize the British authorities’ desire to sell weapons to repressive regimes through Defence and Security Equipment International at ExCeL Centre in London’s Docklands.
DSEI Arms Fair: Autoritarian Regimes Arrive in London
But a separate campaign also led to displaying a large number of posters on bus stations and metro stations that need a second look.
“An important ad, you’re traveling with DLR between 15 and 18 September?” says one of the ads, using the fonts and branding of the London metro, the DLR line turning into the image of a tank.
In September of this year, a lot of weapons dealers will attack the DLR Customers are asked to contribute to the closure of the weapons store.
The 300 posters are made by artists who exhibited the works at the Cruel Designs Museum in Dismaland, Banksy.
A group called Special Patrol Group contributed to the distribution in London using “Ad Space Hack Packs”, a 6-pound Allen key pack that he says “facilitates access to approximately one-third of the advertising space of the bus stations on the planet.”
Transportation management in London is not fun with this “vandalism” in the form of wheels.
One of the parody ads produced by Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, Cruel Designs curator and lecturer at the University of Essex, artists ask more and more questions and seek to make political works accessible to the public outside the galleries.
Many artists go towards collaboration with activists in protest movements, realizing that they have to go out into the real world so that their art can have an impact on society.
Another poster against weapons trade that welcomes the navigators circulating by the metro.
The film made by Amnesty had over 100,000 views on Facebook in 24 hours and was created by the advertising agency VCCP that worked pro bono, and the graphic designer and the artist that dubbed the voice also worked for free.
VCCP’s creative director, Matt Lever, was shocked by the silence around the weapons exhibition advertising – with an empty space in the ExCel calendar – and thought, “Let’s offer them the campaign they try to avoid.”
They played with the realization of a more realistic advertising but “enriching it with animations and strong colors, it was more outstanding.”
“They did a great job helping us increase our interest in the sale of illegal torture equipment at the exhibition,” says Tom Davies on behalf of Amnesty.
Now it would be necessary that the authorities in the UK take measures and ensure that torture equipment is not illegally marketed and delivered to the door.
Per the most creative form of art on the theme of the weapons exhibition comes from the interior of ExCeL, where exhibitors offer fantastic euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed an order received from the U.S. Army on “AT4CS RS with shoulder-backed launching.”
It includes “a unique-shaped focus that provides stunning effects behind the armor, inside the target.
Whatever it means, it will not be pleasant.
Eight Golden Rules to Live in the House
11 years have passed since I moved to my home, when I was a 19-year-old man who still believed in moral relativity, but only now I remember the forced smile of those I’m angry – and the numerous complaints to others.
Most of the things I’ve learned can be summarized in the form of eight simple rules.
Moving into the house can bring states that vary from nervous fall to horror.
The temptation is tempting: tell people where you come from, if and where you have spent a year of study break, what you think about Corbyn and why, “Sirely, you’re indifferent, Marmite because, good guys, it’s nothing but HAHAHA drojdie extract, you find me in my room.”
Breathe deeply.
And help others breathe - ask questions and show interest.
They encourage the conversation and help you differentiate the people you like from those you’t talk to even if the flood came and they would be the only ones who would have boats.
Do not sweat people.
The bedrooms are often abundant with drinking parties, film series and social media meetings, but they are also the place where people dress and try their intimate clothes.

Introverts have special treatment at the university.
Your bedroom should be a shelter, but in many houses a culture of perinning through bedrooms is built, based on friendship, socialization and lifelong friends.
All of this can be terrible for someone who tries to charge their batteries.
Nothing in this culture allows you to say, “You like it and I want to stay friends but I want you to leave to recover my energy I’ve spent interacting with you.”
Try to sign up when a colleague is exhausted by social media - and try to send a SMS instead of knocking at the door.
That it comes to knocking at the door: do it.
A guy sitting in the same room with me had a policy that said that if a door was not locked, then he was invited to enter.
He saw a lot of things.
Make friends cooking.
Since you start university in the Bake-Off fever, if you knock at someone’s door to get acquainted and take a plate with black, it seems less strange, less like the situation of the 50s, “Welcome to the neighborhood, I cooked something for you, now smile and I ask personal questions.”
Goods prepared at home are a great way to make friends.
Your locators will feel compelled to talk and may get to associate your figure with a delicious surprise.
You must be a skilled chef.
Milk, sugar and fat cakes will most likely cause others to pretend to sleep when you knock at the door.
Theft of food is a common crime in student homes.
Obviously, if you throw someone’s chicken is stolen, but if you take a drop of milk to put you in the tea it’s still stolen?
Ask the owner.
It’s probably going to tell you to serve even if you’re cooking inside.
If someone steals your things, it's annoying and I understand you - you're still trying to address the problem more mature than my cousin, who painted his milk with a liquid detergent to punish those who stole.
He is now in prison.
Do not make noise that does not let others sleep or study.
This is not just because it holds a good sense, but because you go to your own on the butterflies.
A girl on the podium with me asked her neighbor to give music slowly because it was 3 a.m. and had an exam in the morning.
Their reaction was to give music stronger.
When they stopped music at a final, at 5 a.m. the girl was kind and let her sleep for two hours before giving the way to the music, closed the door and went to the three-hour exam.
Would it not be romantic if the future husband/wife would move on the same track?
On the contrary, it’t be extremely strange if you’re confusing a cousin with your future husband, you’re married, you’re separated, and you should meet each day, and maybe even see him how all the common friends catch?
Of course, you can't resist your heart - but if a sexy companion is not your future husband, try at least to be rational.
At the exciting moment when you realize that someone has left his keys in the room untouched, the line between foolishness and intimidation is thinner than it seems.
A successful farce is funny, but it can deny in a few moments.
Teach a fun and valuable safety-related lesson hiding something – but never dirty someone’s room with a toothpaste and shampoo.
Close the door and put the keys in a glass of water that you throw to the freezer - but don't stick someone's goods to the roof more than twice.
Violonist David Grimal: In Bach's time there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were working people, artists and not commercial representatives.
French violonist David Grimal is one of the great artists of our time, known not only as a solist but also as the initiator of a less usual, rightly “ciud” project, as he himself says, Les Dissonances – an orchestra composed of international solists and talented musicians, who interpret a symphonic repertoire without having a director, and that makes it at least a curiosity in the classical musical landscape.
Les Dissonances was this year at the Enescu Festival with two shows: a representation, Sunday, in which solist was David Grimal, the founder of the orchestra, and a month, when in the first place was the violoncelist Xavier Phillips, the works composed by Enescu were unlikely.
Both shows on the Athens scene showed the audience a different way of playing classical music.
Les Dissonances appeared on the music scene in 2004 and was at the time the only classical music set in which there was no director.
The director is the most important musician for the musicians.
It is true, on the one hand musicians need an education either to become solists or to become performers in an orchestra - they speak of instrumentists, not of composers.
They are formed as “specialized workers”.
They feel like they need a manager.
On the other side of the scene, for the public, all the music fetishment focuses on the director.
And so, the business, the music industry, makes its own marketing.
We are not talking about music anymore.
So, if we look at this world, we have, on the one hand, skilled workers, which is stupid, and a public who cannot listen but must look, which is stupid," said David Grimal.
The violonist tells that this change in the way it makes music came after the “musical disappointments” of his solo career.
I was like a high-level athlete who had to do the same exercise around the world with different orchestras, to make a lot of money and to bring money and the music industry.
10 years ago, when I was about 30 years old, I found this very depressing, because I no longer found human creativity and fraternity in this system.
So I didn’t find any sense to continue on this path.
So I decided to create the Dissonances.
This happened in 2004, and at that time no one did that without a director: “The music world, extremely conservative, didn’t want such projects.”
“How do I imagine you marketing with a collective of musicians where there is no more ego?” he asked.
David Grimal acknowledges that Les Dissonaces represents “a luxury,” stating that none of the musicians who are part of the orchestra depends on the success of this project to live.
In the 10 years of the band’s existence, the lack of a director did not prove to be a pedicle in the musical act: “Curiosely, the more we sing a more complex repertoire, the simpler it seems, because all the musicians are forced to be present in the opera and not just in the role,” Grimal says, adding that to the Sunday show “I was 74 directors on the stage.”
According to Grimal, the Enescu Festival is a "very brave", just because he invited Les Dissonances: "A extraordinary festival, where the world's greatest orchestras are present and sing three times a day, and in the middle of these orchestras you have invited this strange group."
In a temple of orchestral tradition, such as the Enescu Festival, there is the place and interest in something different, breaking barriers.
Speaking of Enescu's work, the violinist acknowledges that he feels the Roman music of the famous Roman composer, so he didn't need a special approach when he introduced the works of Enescu in his repertoire.
Grimal notes that Enescu's music is very instinctive, but this happens when we talk about George Enescu and Romanian music, "because there is also a George Enescu who made French music."
Grimal is struggling for changing the way classical music education is done, considering that “the musician’s ceremony, as it is organized today, has a death trace” and that “the future of music represents music itself.”
We don’t need to go around the world five times a year if it doesn’t serve anything.
At the time of Bach there were no world tours.
Beethoven, Brahms, Bartok, Enescu were people working, who were artists and not commercial representatives.
For me, organizing concerts, festivals, tours, releasing albums, all are formidable, extraordinary, but as long as they are done in the service of music.
If not, we are in a system where creativity suffers, there is no more freedom.
To illustrate this phenomenon, David Grimal gave example to Romanian products before and after joining the European Union: “In Romania, before you enter the EU, have good vegetables and meat.”
To enter the EU you had to adopt health care laws that are not good for vegetables and meat.
Production and agriculture come to the service of supermarkets, as is happening in France.
Music is the same thing, it is the same logic.
Les Dissonances makes the red may not be too beautiful, but when we cut them they are real red.
In an ideal world, this music should return to the center and that the institutions and industries that manage this system understand that music does not need to be sold, but needs to be shared, and this can be done starting with the educational policy.
“If we consider – as the Koreans, Chinese, Japanese do – that Western music is one of the most beautiful things of mankind, we will reintroduce its teaching into the school, we will reintroduce the concerts on television and through this education we will no longer need to sell musical subproducts,” Grimal believes.
Certainly, there are things in classical music education that remain very communist, that everywhere, is something very militarized.
It depends on this discipline whether we compare a musician to a soldier, or whether we form a musician who sings on an instrument, being, above all, a musician.
We talk about a completely different education, if we want to form a soldier (this education - n.red.) must be in a way, if we want to form a musician, it is completely different.
What's more dangerous, a soldier or a musician?", the French artist laughed.
Grimal shows that, for artists, the reward of another way of making music comes precisely from exceeding this status of “soldat”, exceeding what “they think are their limits”: “Musicers discover at some point that they’re not soldiers, and that’s why after the concert they get riders out.”
David Grimal talked about his musical project and his vision of music and the artist in the "Festival of Ideas", a discussion with the public organized at the George Enescu International Festival by the Aspen Institute of Romania.

Cinema City is searching for "The Little Big Voices"
Cinema City launches the strongest challenge for children: the doubling of two characters from the superproduction "The 3D Snow White"
Do you have a super-talent and spontaneous child who likes movies?
Give him the chance to become a star.
In September, as part of the latest campaign dedicated to enthusiastic and ambitious children who want to reach future stars and who are between 8 and 16 years of age, Cinema City is looking for "Micle Big Voices", offering them an extraordinary opportunity to double two characters from a famous animated film.
If in classical drawings the emphasis was placed on the approximation of the voice of the actor to the specific of the animated character, in recent period, the creation of the story is taken into account and those to interpret the voices, and they are usually very well-known actors.
Cinema City Romania, however, wants to discover new voices and that’s why we start an unpublished campaign.
We want to find the right voice and encourage parents to enroll their children in our competition.
They will have a special experience, because the characters are sympathetic and the replicas are funny.
“Children will be fun and have a real chance to be part of a team of actors,” said Ioana Ionescu, Marketing Manager of Cinema City Romania.
In the first stage of the competition, from September 11 to September 30, Cinema City organizes a preselection after which 10 children (five girls and five boys) will be selected to give a test in a recording studio along with professionals.
All parents need to do is access the micilevocimari.cinema-city.ro platform, where to enroll the child to the contest and prepare him for the voice test.
Then you have to choose one of the four films available on the platform, download the texts that the child is going to read and then the child will register by interpreting his own duplicate version.
Four movies about friendship, fairy heroes, magic and hope can choose competitors to support the proof: "Yellow Pen 3D", "Moon: The Guardian of the Moon 3D", "Blinky Bill: The Knight 3D Koala" and "Maya 3D Albination".
Finally, the most talented two children (a girl and a boy) will see their dream fulfilled and double each character in the superproduction "The Snow Queen - The Snow Queen 3D", which will have a premiere in Romania in November of this year.
FedEx profits are mixed, tax forecasts fall for 2016
FedEx announced disappointing results for the last quarter, the supply giant reducing profit estimates for the entire year due to low demand for transport services and increased costs for its land transport division.
The company also said it intends to hire about 55,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
During the same period last year, FedEx announced that it will hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday period.
The company’s shares fell about 2.5 percent in pre-market trading, 45 minutes before the opening clock sound on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. said it is expected to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 for the fiscal year that ends in May next year, 20 cents less, according to a previous estimate.
Analysts predicted the figure of $10.84, according to a survey conducted by FactSet.
The falling estimate comes despite the average price rise of 4.9% with entry into force on 4 January and the higher surplus fees for land transport of large or high-weight packages, which will apply from November.
The company said it is still expecting an increase in profits compared to the previous year due to lower costs, higher revenue and the development of online commerce.
President and CEO Fred Smith said that “the company faces a significantly weaker economic situation than expected, especially in terms of global production and trade.”
Employment plans for the holiday period were announced a day after the competitor UPS said he intended to hire 90,000-95,000 additional workers, about the same number of jobs he made last year.
In the quarter that ended on 31 August, FedEx earned $692 million, 6% more than the previous year.
The earnings per share were $2.42, below the average estimate of $2.44 per share made by 12 analysts who responded to the survey conducted by Zacks Investment Research.
Profit increased by 5%, to $12.3 billion.
Six analysts who participated in the Zacks survey estimated the amount of $12.23 billion.
FedEx has been hit in recent years by a decline in international priority transport, leading to a stagnation in revenue recorded by its Express unit.
But the explosion in online purchases has swept the results of the FedEx Ground division.
In the last quarter, the ground division’s revenue increased by 29%, but operational revenue stagnated practically due to higher costs for large packages and own insurance.
The express unit recorded an increase in revenue due to higher basic tariffs, while the revenue recorded by the freight division fell due to increasing costs.
At the pre-market trading, about an hour before the opening sound, FedEx shares fell by $3.85 or 2.5%, to $150.15.
On Tuesday at closure it fell by 11% on the annual level and by 17% against the record high on 11 June.
On the occasion of the most anticipated meetings in recent years, the Federal Reserve policy makers will spend two days this week around a 27-foot Honduran mahon table to decide whether it is time to raise a key interest rate for the first time in a decade.
On top of them, at the end of the central bank meeting hall, a wall painting of the United States will be displayed.
The map is intended to remind that Janet L. Yellen, President of the Fed, and his colleagues must put the economic interests of the nation above all.
The Central Bank has received a double task from Congress: to maximize the employment rate in the U.S. and to maintain price stability.
But since the big economic crisis, Fed leaders have confirmed that there is a third unwritten task: financial stability.
And this third task could be the factor X in a too difficult decision to anticipate, which will be announced on Tuesday, and which will determine whether the U.S. economy is ready to be depleted by the unprecedented incentive offered by the short-term interest rate almost zero in force from the end of 2008.
Although most data indicate a strongly growing economy, recent agitation on the global financial markets could scare already cautious Fed officials from adding volatility by increasing the reference rate to federal funds – even with only a quarter of a percentage point.
“Obviously, the labour market and inflation will be the first and main aspects they will follow,” said Lindsey M. Piegza, chief economist at the brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
“I think, however, if they were looking for an excuse to not raise interest rates, the growing uncertainty on the global market is enough to give them arguments to wait,” she said.
There is no consensus on the decision that the Fed will make, which in itself causes instability on the financial market.
Approximately half of economists recently questioned by Bloomberg anticipated a rise in the interest rate this week.
However, the financial markets expect the Fed to delay, a key indicator showing that the likelihood of growth is only 30%.
This would indicate a fall on the stock exchange if the Fed raises interest rates, except where the policy makers would relieve the blow promising that it would take a long time until the next rise.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16.599.85.
The wind was triggered by expectations that the Fed’s decision makers will keep the interest rate stable this week, said John Lonski, chief economist at Moody’s Capital Markets Research Group.
“It would be surprising that the Fed would raise the interest rate at this time,” Lonski said.
If the Fed decision makers would do this, “they should act deeply in their policies to avoid panic on the financial markets.”
Other experts said a rise in the interest rate would calm the financial markets as it would remove the uncertainty about when the Fed will act.
Just a month ago, the Fed seemed to be on the way to raise the rate by 0.25% this month, the first small step towards the slow aggravation of monetary conditions that would confirm the strength of U.S. recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that he was expecting a rise in the interest rate this year despite the elevated objections by liberals that it would need more economic progress.
Although the creation of jobs slowed in August, the growth of the labour market was solid this year.
The unemployment rate dropped to 5.1% last month, the lowest percentage in more than seven years and close to the level considered by the Fed as total employment.
The wages showed signs of growth.
And although inflation continued to fail to reach the central bank’s annual goal, the Fed’s decision makers claimed that a key reason was the temporary effect of the suddenly falling oil prices.
The economy “can face higher rates and needs them, given the tension on the labour market,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, global financial markets began to get into fibrillations at the end of this month, after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones industrial media dropped by 16% below the record record in May as investors feared that the slowdown of the Chinese economy would draw down global growth.
The market dropped somewhat this month, the Dow index is now approximately 10% below the top in May.
For the Fed decision makers, market agitation is added to the complex calculation of the moment of the interest rate rise.
“Without what has happened on the financial markets and the news about the weakening of the Chinese economy in the past weeks, it would be more firm during the meeting,” said Stephen D. Oliner, an experienced researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and former official Fed.
Now, he predicts that they will wait at least a month to better manage the effects.
“There’s a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy and there’s almost no data to rely on later on the events in China,” Oliner said.
The well-being of the global economy is not one of the main interests of the Fed, so practically it should not be taken into consideration when making decisions.
However, in reality, the Fed has become the global monetary authority.
In recent years, the influence of the central bank has been enormous.
The only aluse of the then president, Ben S. Bernanke, in 2013, that the Fed could “hurt” its monetary expansion has triggered earthquake in global markets.
In a world where markets and economies are more and more mixed, it is expected that Fed officials not only monitor progress in other regions, but also consult with other central banks and experts to better interpret the world economy.
His decision-making process is “more art than science,” said Zachary Karabell, head of the global strategy department at the Envestnet welfare management company Inc.
Jeffrey Lacker, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in Richmond, Va., said this month that “Fed has a history of overdimensional reaction to changes in the financial markets that seem to have nothing to do with the economic bases.”
Lacker, a voting member of the Federal Commission for the Open Market, a decision-making body that supported the rise in the interest rate, presented the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
A financial crisis that affected Asia led the Fed to lower the reference rate by 0.75% in three meetings, “in spite of the implications with limited identification for U.S. development,” Lacker said.
A year later, the Fed officials returned on those declines.
The Fed should put the issue of financial stability in the first place only in the event of a major crisis, such as the 2008 market earthquake, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the interest rate committee at the Bank of England.
The last agitated period does not rise even far to that level, he said.
“We don’t want to get into the situation of being afraid of a rise in interest rates due to the turmoil of the markets,” said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still holds the double mandate and does not mention financial stability and until something changes in this regard, I don’t think it should take premature measures.

Seven's Sunrise dominates the surveys, despite the attempts of the Nine channel to broadcast in Today Show about the change of party leadership
The urgent shift of Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson to Canberra to transmit on the subject the consequences of the changes from the leadership of the liberal party did not bring a significant increase in the audience for Today.
The morning channel Nine broadcast from the capital after Tony Abbott's defeat against Malcolm Turnbull.
The competitive Sunrise, moderated by David Koch and Samantha Armytage, was captured in London as part of a series of broadcasts conducted over a few weeks, including Dubai, New York, Niagara Cascada and Cancun.
This “cruise” of distance didn’t seem to matter too much for Aussie TV viewers, Sunrise having a audience of 397,000 viewers in the five capital cities, compared to Today with 339,000.
Today a slight increase compared to Monday (317,000) and Tuesday (283,000) but the figures were lower than Thursday (343,000).
Today has reduced the difference with Sunrise in the last few months.
In August, Today had an average audience of 318,000 and Sunrise of 330,000.
At the beginning of the year, the difference ranges between 40,000 and 50,000.
Currently, in September, Sunrise has an average audience of 349,000 telespectators and Today 314,000.
This is the most interesting thing that happened throughout the morning.
This morning, not only the Parliament is affected by the current of change!
Karl and Lisa are okay, thank you for the question!

The main news was the stunning debut of the 800 Words series having as protagonist the former star of Packed to the Rafters, Erik Thomson.
The new drama, having the subject of a recent widow father, who decides to move along with his two children to the coast of New Zealand, had a very impressive average audience of 1.219 million viewers.
The critics wondered if Thomson is able to face a show alone without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The results of the audience for last night answered “Yes.”
The X Factor show by Seven remained on position, with 1.136 million viewers, easily taking the face of the shows The Block (838.000) and TBL Families (726.000).
Seven recorded elevations and downs in the second evening in which he broadcast The Chase Australia.
The first half hour (17:00 to 17:30) of the new moderate general culture show by Andrew O'Keefe had an average of 446,000 viewers.
The second half hour (17:30 to 18:00) climbed to 623,000 spectators - enough for a small victory in front of Eddie McGuire's show, Hot Seat (613,000).
On Monday evening, the first half-hour of the show The Chase Australia had an average audience of 520,000 telespectators and the second half recorded a huge figure of 720,000.
Hot Seat had an average audience of 620,000.
The fall of the audience recorded by Chase Australia on the second evening will give the Nine's quiet confidence that Hot Seat will ultimately triumph at 17:30.
The Chase Australia replaces Million Dollar Minute, a show that failed to win McGuire's show.

Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin meet to discuss homosexual rights
In 2003, Mikhail Hodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat with a gun at a Siberian airport.
Because he openly provoked President Vladimir Putin, Hodorkovsky was convicted, his oil company, Yukos, was confiscated and his pro-democratic efforts were diminished.
Four people killed after police shot gums in protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a four-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot with rubber bullets in the crowd demonstrating against the country's new proposed constitution, a official said on Wednesday.
Violence occurred on Tuesday night in the district of Rupandehi, about 280 km west of the capital Kathmandu.
According to Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the head of the district police, more than 1,000 protesters gathered in front of a police department, and some of them threw with stones and molotov cocktails.
Mr. Dhakal said that police used tear gas and then shot fire in the air before using rubber bullets.
According to the report, twenty police officers and five civilians were injured.
It was not immediately clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill but are usually used as a less lethal alternative, have caused so many deaths.
The shock was the last event after weeks of violent protests in the southern region of Nepal, where members of the Madhesi ethnic group claim that the new provinces established under the new constitution would dilute their political influence.
Protests have also occurred in the west of Nepal, where the ethnic group Tharus wants its own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, were killed in the violent strikes launched on 10 August.
When four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces – a major step towards a new constitution but an extremely controversial issue in Nepal, a country ruled at the central level for hundreds of years.
Procedure for drawing up a new constitution was launched in 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April.
This week, in Kathmandu, lawmakers voted the clauses of the draft constitution and officials said the new Charter could be adopted on Sunday.
We will not use firewalls, dogs, police and weapons.
The Prime Minister continues to exchange responses with the Hungarian authorities.
At the opening of the government meeting on Wednesday, Ponta reiterated Romania’s firm position over the refugee crisis.
We do every effort to manage the refugee crisis, all institutions have a coordinated opinion.
Romania does not agree and will not apply anti-democratic measures, guard dogs, roof gardens or police with weapons.
"It's a shame for the 21st century Europe to apply the methods of the 30s," Victor Ponta said.
“The prime minister said that all the data and details of the refugee crisis will be discussed and established at the CSAT meeting on Thursday,” he concluded.
NHC announces 60% chance of cyclone south of Cape Verde Islands
A wide low-pressure front at approximately 560 km south of the southernmost point of the Cape Verde Islands shows a 60% chance of turning into a tropical cyclone in the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Tuesday.
Another well-defined low-pressure front approximately half the distance between Cape Verde and Lesser Antilles also shows a 60% chance of a tropical cyclone formation in the next two days, the meteorologist added.
Weight Loss Surgery Could Be Useful in Diabetics with Light Obesity
The benefits of weight loss surgery in people with mild obesity, with type 2 diabetes, could beined for at least five years, according to a new study.
It is still premature to tell if diabetics with mild obesity live longer after weight loss surgery than those who follow non-chirurgical treatments.
“It takes a long time to centralize mortality data,” said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an obesity surgery specialist, as she wrote an article about the new study in JAMA Surgery.
Operations for weight loss, also called bariatric surgery, use various methods to reduce the stomach.
They reduce the feeling of hunger and limit the body’s ability to absorb food.
Over the years, bariatric surgery has been effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but most studies have been conducted on people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) 35 or higher.
IMC, a unit of weight measurement in relation to height, is considered normal in the interval of 18.5-24.9.
A BMI of at least 25 indicates that one person is overweight and people with BMI above 30 are considered obese.
You can calculate your IMC by accessing: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at the Min-Sheng General Hospital in Taiwan used aggregated data after 2007 in a trial in which two types of bariatric surgery - stomach bypass and manchon gastrectomy - are compared in the medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The average BMI in people who suffered surgery decreased from 31 to 24,5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
Meanwhile, the IMC in people who received non-chirurgical treatments against diabetes remained almost at the same level, i.e. 29.
Among those who suffered surgery, diabetes healed completely at 36% and partially at 28%.
In the group treated by medical methods, by comparison, diabetes was completely healed at only 1% and partially at only 2% of subjects.
In addition, blood pressure control, triglycerides and “bad” LDL cholesterol “were generally better in the surgical group,” the authors concluded.
The researchers also monitored the blood level of hemoglobin A1c, which reflects the level of glucose over time.
Researchers write that the optimal level of hemoglobin A1c is below 7%.
After surgery, the average level of hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
But in the group treated by medical methods, it remained around 8%.
But this improved “glycemic control” – reflected by the improved levels of hemoglobin A1c – did not reduce the mortality rate to five years, according to the chief researcher Dr. Chih-Cheng Hsu and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average results associated with the two types of surgery.
In the fifth year, compared to the group with manchon gastrectomy, the group with bypass surgery lost more weight (18.7 against 14.2 kg), observed more considerable decrease in IMC (7.4 against 5.1) and hemoglobin A1c (3.1% against 2.1%) and presented a higher likelihood of complete remission of diabetes (46.9% against 16.7%).
Although the new study does not indicate a benefit in survival or surgery after five years, there are evidence from a study conducted on high-weight people in Sweden that surgery extends life, says Blackstone, from the University of Arizona, Faculty of Medicine - Phoenix.
In the Swedish study, obese people who suffered bariatric surgery showed an approximately 29% lower chance of dying after 15 years, compared to a group that tried more conventional methods.
Although the new study did not indicate a survival benefit in patients who suffered surgery, Blackstone said it was an optimistic look for people with IMC under 35 interested in the procedure.
“This is the point where this work is critical because it affirms that this surgery is safe in the group with lower BMI,” without increasing the risk of death or kidney disease, she says.
Blackstone added that patients and their doctors should start taking the weight seriously when the patient's IMC reaches 27-30.
“I think we’re waiting too long until we invite people to take this point seriously,” she said.
I think once they accumulated these genetic changes that shortened their bodies predisposed to obesity and diabetes, it’s extremely difficult to get back to normal.
"It's impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT news
Europe could not receive all the refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current situation of the refugee crisis is in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader has issued a call to end violence in the mother countries of refugees.
Dalai Lama spoke about the current issue of the refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Compassion in Oxford, dedicated to ethical studies, at the beginning of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He affirmed that, in the present situation, the interests of humanity should prevail over the interests of each nation and even of each continent.
He also stressed that, although admirable, the response of western European countries to the refugee crisis is inadequate to the situation.
“It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe,” he said in his speech.
Although Dalai Lama praised the efforts of Germany and Austria to cope with the crisis, he emphasized that it is just a temporary solution.
“It’s great to take care of a few thousand refugees, but we have to think at the same time about long-term solutions to bring peace and sincere development, especially through education, to the Muslim countries,” he said.
In the background, we need to think about ways to reduce crime in their countries.
We need to reduce the use of force.
The force has never solved these problems,” he added.
As to the issue of violence, Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush’s actions after the September 11 terror attacks, claiming that the U.S.’s violent response generated a chain of uncontrollable events.
After the events of September 11, I sent my condolences in a letter to President Bush and told him to solve this problem without calling for violence.
I know that his reasons were strong, but he used the force and generated unexpected consequences,” Dalai Lama said.
A four-fold increase in the number of children who have ingested the hand detergent over the past 4 years
According to the Georgian Anti-Smake Center, anti-Smake centers in the U.S. have an increase of about 400% since 2010 in the number of children under the age of 12 who have swallowed the hand detergent with a high alcohol content.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, the director of the Anti-Smake Center in Georgia, cases of hand detergent in children under the age of 12 to anti-Smake centers rose from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
“Children have more frequent access to these products and unfortunately a percentage of them reach the emergency room,” Lopez told CNN.
Lopez said some children intentionally drink detergent and others do so to impress their friends or to respond to challenges on social networks.
You can watch videos on YouTube that show adolescents how to drink detergents to create cheap drinks.
It seems that adolescents mixed the detergent with mouth water with alcohol to get a stronger drink.
Smaller children can be attracted by the attractive smell of the detergent.
“A child doesn’t think he’s hurt him,” Lopez says.
Many of the most attractive types (hand detergent) are the smelled.
Hand detergents with the smell of grapes, grapes, orange are the most attractive for children.
The hand detergent contains approximately 45-95% alcohol.
Especially in small children, only a few swelling can cause alcohol poisoning.
“It’s very concentrated alcohol,” said Dr. Stephen Thornton, the medical director of the anti-inflammatory center at the University Hospital in Kansas, to the Fox 4 channel in Kansas City.
Thus, we avoid leaving a glass of whiskey on the table, but people leave these handwashers in accessible places and if the little ones reach them, this is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Nhaijah Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently ingested at school the equivalent of four hands spraying with the smell of pepper, arrived at the emergency room to receive treatment.
She had alcoholemia179, twice the threshold to which an adult is considered by law under the influence of alcohol, according to Dr. Chris Ritchey, a doctor at the emergency room who treated her at the Gwinnett Medical Center outside Atlanta.
Nhaijah swallowed and couldn't go when he arrived at the emergency room.
Doctors monitored her overnight in a separate child hospital to identify signs of brain injury as the girl fell and hit her head due to alcohol, Ritchey said.
“It was terrible,” said Ortoria Scott, Nhaijah’s mother, to CNN.
It could have been fatal.
Lopez recommended that parents and teachers use no-alcohol-free wet products or servers and no longer leave the hand detergent to their children.
In addition to alcohol poisoning, some detergents were associated with deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after they swallowed a hand detergent containing a toxic, undeclared ingredient.
The health authorities assumed that the product contained methanol, a lethal substance, and not ethyl alcohol, specified as an active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-class students in northern New York conspired to poison their "bad" professor by "posing antibacterial products in the class", according to a police report.
The teacher is very allergic to the hand detergent and banned him in his classroom.
The police said the plan was “not meaningful” and submitted the disciplinary issue to the school inspectorate.

The absence of Scots in the title race is boring the Dutch - by Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Dutch international player Ronald de Boer said Dutch football fans lost their interest in Celtic - because they don't fight for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, currently Ajax ambassador, said: “In the Netherlands we no longer transmit the summary of the Celtic matches; why?”
There are no Rangers there.
This is not just the return of the Rangers.
We are talking about the old firm.
We are talking about both teams together and there is the interest.
The tension is great in the Old Firm matches and not only the Scots want to see these matches.
I’m going to change the situation, Deila promises.
RONNY Deila accepted that Celtic is fighting for responsibilities but the Norwegian leader promised to change the situation.
The defeat with Malmo and the subsequent elimination from the Champions League were followed by the defeat against Aberdeen who played in 10 people, now in the top of the ranking with a five-point advance.
But Deila said, “Celtic had periods before and will return.”
We want to get out of this situation as soon as possible.
I know it’s very frustrating and many people are extremely angry or sad about what’s happening.
We feel the same, but we have to go further.
We need the support of the Celtic because the players are getting better.
It is very important to be united now.
Warburton's prudence on January transfers
Despite recent comments of just a few weeks that suggested that he would have identified some targets for the January transfer, Rangers' head, Mark Warburton is cautious when it comes to transfer, insisting that he doesn't want to affect the Ibrox team's unit.
The former head of Brentford said: “The January transfer period is very different from the summer.”
In the case of players transferred summer, there is a period before the season in which they can be integrated, which you could have noticed this season in our group.
The team is doing very well.
Sometimes you do more harm if you bring players that are not needed.

Unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while UK rises
The unemployment rate in Scotland remains unchanged, being 164,000 between May and July, while the total number of unemployed in the UK increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million in the same period.
The unemployment rate of 5.9% in Scotland was higher than in the UK, of 5.5%, according to figures presented by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
Meanwhile, the employment rate in Scotland decreased by 12,000 over the three-month period, with the number of employees currently being 2,612,000.
The employment rate in Scotland decreased in the respective quarter to 74,0% - a figure above the average of 73.5 in the UK.
Scottish Secretary of State David Mundell, commenting on the latest figures, said: “The authorities’ long-term plan has set the foundation for a stronger economy.”
It has been almost fixed a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
In these 12 months, we have observed improvements in the labour market in Scotland, the employment rate increasing and the unemployment rate decreasing.
Why I'm a witness to an execution in Oklahoma
Today, except for a late legal intervention, I will see how a man is sentenced to death.
If it happens, and I hope it doesn’t happen, I’ll sit in a room for observers in the execution room of the Oklahoma State Prison and see how Richard Glossip is executed by administering the lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death.
The invitation came first in January, through his best friend, and, although I was shocked, I accepted.
As the day approaches the cause, I am scared of the idea.
So why do I do it?
I agreed because I thought it was a good way to tell the whole story of the death penalty.
It gives you a unique perspective.
It’s true, journalists can be witnesses to execution in America and, because the requests usually exceed the number of places available, a macabre lottery takes place to decide who will be chosen.
Oklahoma has reduced the number of seats reserved for press representatives from 12 to five.
Those elected will look at the execution with impartiality.
I cannot do that.
I would sit next to Richard Glossip's closest friends, in addition, I developed my own connection with him throughout the months of telephone conversations and a visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like the guy.
We often laugh when we talk.
The prison authorities say I can’t be a witness and a journalist, so I won’t be allowed to have a carrot and a pix to note what I see.
I will have to try to remember all the details.
A Oklahoma journalist accused me on Twitter of compromitting my impartiality.
Here is the lesson.
Tell the story of the held as he wants, get access.
I cried to her.
He acknowledged that “he could have formulated better,” but he still believes I’m wrong.
Richard Glossip did not agree with some of the things I said and wrote.
He doesn't tell me what to write and I won't do it even if he asks me.
I told him he could remove me from the list of witnesses at any time.
But he wants to be present with an international report to write about the subject.
He believes that if he dies, advertising will help the movement against the death penalty.
Kim Bellware, a Huffington Post reporter, will be with me.
If you want to learn more about the case, listen to the series of multimedia files that we have made.
I will not return here on all the details.
I can’t say with certainty that Richard Glossip is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry Van Treese make him guilty of complicity.
But it is very likely that he will not be guilty of the crime.
I am sure that there was not enough evidence to justify the death penalty.
I think his execution is wrong.
And I will look at him dying from this perspective.
I can’t say I’m totally objective.
For this, you can read the articles written by other reporters.
From me you’ll find out what it’s like to look at a man he likes dying uselessly.
Peter Moody claims that the stewards have tried to spy him and threatens to withdraw from the races
Peter Moody claimed that the Racing Victoria stewards or tried to infiltrate a spy into his grids last year and threatened to immediately withdraw from the races.
He launched an attack against the stewards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria, claiming that they are conducting a personal campaign against him, the drop that filled the glass was the removal of Lady Tatai from the race due to a treatment administered on the day of the race.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he has always tried to do what’s best for the field of courses and that he’s put into a difficult situation when it comes to the positive result of Lidari’s cobalt test, for which he has no explanation.
For 18 months, he swallowed his words about spy statements and didn’t want to look like “the wolf that doesn’t get to grapes.”
“I didn’t intend to say anything about that and I’ve been silent for a long time but sometimes you get to a level of frustration so high that everything turns out suddenly,” Moody said.
It is known that it continued.
Sometimes you react and you have to suffer the consequences, and I will have to live with what I said.
On Monday I will go home and sleep calmly.
I want to go up with my head and I want the owners with whom I work to see that I strive to give them the best.
From the moment they begin to think that it doesn’t happen, I have to give up the trainer’s profession.
At that moment I’ll have to think about what I’ll do with my certification.
Previously, Moody threw the bomb in an interview to racing.com in which he said the privacy department had tried to spy his grids.
“Twelve months ago, Terry Bailey, Dayle Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart stood in a room alongside a man whose name I’ll tell if I’m asked – and they offered to hire him to my gardens to provide information about the work there,” Moody told Racing.com.
I think he considers me a trick.
If so, then I should give all their resignation because they were incompetent in trying to catch me.
Robert Roulston, former RVL president, David Moodie, current RVL president and Bernard Saundry, current RVL CEO, knew at that time and I know it today.
Should I think that’s something personal?
Is it necessary that the RVL starts to have the spine and can bring people outside the trainer to responsibility for what’s happening in the industry?
Do I have a bad influence on the industry?
How bad is my influence on the industry?
Maybe that’s what others see.
Maybe he’ll have to take my license and give me off and I have no doubt that the statements I make now could lead him to think about this variant.
I’ve come to a point where I don’t care, and that’s sad for me.
I am very sad.
I will put pressure on them and make them make a decision.
My family supports me and I can leave.
The trainer's frustration increased with the long investigation of the cobalt test in which he was involved and the removal led him to claim that he could "to put his license on the table".
Moody, whose name is most often associated with the training of the unbeated champion Black Caviar, labeled the course day treatment rule as “ridical” after a cataplasm with pine or argilla was applied on the feet of the horses, which violates the rules.
It violates the rules of the race.
I have to take all my responsibility for this,” he says.
One of my employees mistakenly put him on his foot.
It could have happened last night.
It could have happened yesterday, what happened.
This happened on the day of the race.
Moody could be disqualified for three months for treatment from the day of the race consisting in the application of cataplasma, for which the stewards opened an investigation.
It is a joke.
People who do these rules don’t know anything about horses.
“We all understand that rules are needed, but it’s gone too far,” Moody said.
The driver who hit and fled from the accident site in Cobram was arrested.
Police arrested a man after a collision with a bicyclist produced in Cobram on the end of the week and followed by a flight from the place of the accident.
The cyclist was transported with a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital and was seriously injured after he was hit on Saturday morning by a car on the Murray Valley highway.
Police officials say the driver did not stop to help the wounded cyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old man gave himself to the police in Shepparton.
He appears to be accused of escaping from the place of the accident, failure to provide first aid and other road crimes.
The cyclist, a 40-year-old man from Cobram, remains interned, in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy responds to the opponents in the allegations of wrestling.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the critics brought to the play tactics used by his team as “destroyed subjects” brought to discussion by the main two favourites in the NRL.
The Sydney Roosters coach, Trent Robinson, said that the judges allowed Storm’s players to “take up” the team in the nervously winning match by Storm in the qualification final played Friday evening in Sydney.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a slight reference to Storm after his team's victory in the qualifying match with North Queensland Cowboys, played on Saturday evening, when he called the match a "demonstration" of the rugby league and said the two teams in Queensland don't know much about wrestling.
Bellamy jumped in defense of the play tactics addressed by his team and said the players were simply focusing on “contact” when they were pleased.
Bellamy says he gained confidence after two important coaches criticized his team, which means they were worried that Storm would defeat them.
"And things don't stop here - we didn't hear Trent Robinson complaining about wrestling when they beat us with the score of 24-2," Bellamy said on Wednesday.
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything throughout the year in our defence systems or techniques, so only that in the last six weeks we have really put the emphasis on contact in pleasure and so we have changed the situation.
Trent has been in this position for three years and obviously has a wonderful team so it’s probably not used to lose and it’s been a shock for him.
We wear what is always happening in this period of the year.
Bellamy opposed Bennett’s idea of “animating football,” reminding his mentor St George-Illawarra Dragons of Bennett won the championship in 2010 playing “little” football.
Wayne talks about exciting football.
He argued his opinion by comparing his Saturday evening game with our Friday evening game and talked about how exciting the game was,” Bellamy said.
I remember that in 2010, St George received a lot of criticism because he was a boring team and Wayne said he was not interested even as black under the nail.
But now he has a team that can play what we consider to be an exciting football, especially thanks to the fast young midfielder.
This kind of game you want to do when you have such players.
He brought this argument in 2010, now he wants everyone to adopt his style of play - not every team has two intermediaries like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt to be able to play like that.
It gives me more confidence because they claim these things because they are somewhat worried about the match with us.
Six weeks ago they probably didn’t think about us when they thought about the important matches.
Bellamy also highlighted that the match between Storm and Roosters was a sharper score-related break compared to the match between Broncos and Cowboys.
The Broncos match was probably a good match, I haven’t seen it yet, how much was the score? 16-12?
Our match ended 20-18, in our game there were two trials, that’s an exciting game?
Or palpitant means taking a break and not marching?
There are plans for me.
If they talk about us, it means that at some point we could meet them.
Storm is free this weekend because they won the right to play at home either with North Queensland Cowboys or with Cronulla Sharks, in the final of the next Saturday preliminaries at AAMI Park, the tickets being sold starting Tuesday morning.
Stevan Hogg used the girl’s phone to encourage pedophiles to send pictures
A pedophile used the phone of a 11-year-old girl to ask for images of abused children.
Stevan Hogg took the girl’s phone when she was sleeping and then logged in to an online messaging service where another user sent her a series of indirect images with copies as the subject.
The girl then woke up and noticed the disappearance of the phone, which she found in Hogg's hand while he was sleeping.
She looked at the phone and found the annoying messages after which she immediately warned her mother.
After arrival, the police saw the five photographs and then analyzed the computers found at that address and found “threatening” searches on the Internet using terms to find indecent images with subjects copies.
Hogg claimed he did it to “track pedophiles” on the Internet before “to claim he’s a police officer to scare them.”
Prosecutor Eilidh Robertson said to the Dundee court: “He said it’s a dependence – that it’s dependent to scare people.
He acknowledged he had done the searches on the computer but said he did it because he wanted to give himself as a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was asked about the conversations with the unknown person who sent his pictures and the fact that he asked the person to send him other pictures.
He said he did it to admire.
He said he no longer clearly thinks when he drinks and he wants to see images with rape and crimes.
Mr. Robertson added: “When the girl found the messages on the phone, she called her mother and trembled and cried.
The girl saw the images on the phone and the accused was faced.
The girl was interviewed and told that the accused used the computer and Playstation to talk to girls that seemed much younger than him.
Last year, on 14 June, Hogg, 23 years old, resident in Ward Road, Dundee, claimed guilty of allegations that he made or made images indecent with subjects of children, and violated the conditions of conditional release on 25 January this year and did not present himself before the court at appearance on 24 March this year.
Defence lawyer Gregor Sim asked Hogg not to be registered in the register of sexual offenders because it can be claimed that the crime “not involved a significant sexual appearance”.
Judge Alistair Carmichael delayed the sentence to October due to social reports.
Hogg was released on caution in this case but remained in custody before appearances for other cases.
It was passed into the register of sexual offenders before the sentence was given.
Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Says Wrong Speech in Parliament
At the beginning of the year, Mr. Mugabe, the oldest African leader, fell on the stairs of a podium.
It was not wounded but the filming of the fall became viral on social networks.
The opening of the parliamentary session was also disturbed by opposition representatives who claimed that they would have received anonymous death threats, threatening to no way hide Mr. Mugabe during his speech.
Last month he was evacuated during his speech in Parliament - a speech he repeated on Tuesday.
Innocent Gonese, the head of the Parliamentary Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), said seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones, being warned not to disturb Mugabe's speech.
“The message was sent by a hidden number but is called ‘death,’ he told reporters after Mr. Mugabe’s speech.
It warns the parliamentarians concerned that immunity is applicable only in the Parliament and once they leave the Parliament, parliamentary immunity is no longer worthwhile.
The head of the parliamentary group said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, is “threatened” about the threats transmitted to politicians.
Hewlett-Packard will make 30,000 available
Hewlett-Packard is expected to make between 25,000 and 30,000 availability as part of the company’s efforts to restructuring and reduce costs in the service sector.
This year, HP will be divided on stock into two companies, separating the computer and printer division from corporate hardware and increasing services operations.
The expected availability will cost approximately $2.7 billion starting in the fourth quarter, HP said.
“These restructuring will bring the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise a more competitive and cost-sustainable structure,” said Meg Whitman, president and CEO of HP, who will lead the unit after the breakdown.
“Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more concentrated than HP today and will have a wide portfolio of that will contribute to the transition of companies to the new business style,” Whitman said.
Working as a separate company, we are positioned better than ever to meet the growing demands of our global customers.
According to a company statement, Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenues of more than $50 billion and will “focus on providing integrated solutions without rival” addressed to companies.
A company founded in 1930 by Stanford University graduates, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, the subject of the production of electrical equipment and whose garage in Palo Alto was called the “Silicon Valley Legion.”
HP has undergone a massive reorganization to adapt to the transition from traditional computers to mobile devices.
The measure taken by HP, the world’s second-largest computer manufacturer and one of the largest technology companies in the U.S., is the latest in the field, based on the idea that companies that focus their attention better on one direction have better performance.
FriendsFest: the comedy series that taught us important lessons about friendship between men
The absence of similar characters in the series is obvious, given that the need for men to open is now more desperate than ever, the suicide rates among young men reaching the peak in the last 15 years.
In 2013, suicide was the main cause of death in men aged 20-45 in the UK, and remains three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the problem, the Campaign Against Living Miserably (CALM)) has designated 2015 as the Man's Year, wanting to question the culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of the struggle towards the success of this challenge.
A recent study conducted on more than 2,000 high school students who presented symptoms of depression concluded that if the patient is surrounded by enough friends “with a healthy mood”, his chances of recovery double.
In the same way, for people who are not depressed, a circle of mentally healthy friends reduces the likelihood of mental disorders to half.
Of course, in order for friendship to be effective, it must first be accessible.
In this era of communication dominated by social networks, where the emphasis is placed on style and not on substance, the immediate character of the response often has priority before contact with meaning.
Our digital lives have doubled the need to create the appearance of a strong personality, open to fun and success, even if in reality isolation is the one that dominates.
This superficial success is dominated by what psychologists call extrinsic values; money, image, social status, all at the cost of intrinsic values – our inner desire for personal development and friendship – which deeperly affects our mental health.
The billionaire inventor of a video game has recently explained that money does not even buy happiness.
The beauty of the Friends series was that it turned the attention to this idea.
The characters were not defined by the workplace but by their own personality, which they showed by interacting as friends.
The humor of Joey and Chandler's frequent embraces, the moments when he looks at football in the comfortable chairs and Ross's passion for Rachel came from the fact that it is known that men can associate themselves with this situation, even if they often find themselves to fully explore their feelings.
As one social worker explained to me: “My role in listening to people with a tendency to suicide and depression has shown how even the smallest interactions with friends can make the difference.”
Often, people who call us feel unable to talk to friends.
The old saying to deal with yourself is strong, just as the feeling of being perceived as a weak person if you speak openly about problems.
Friends is one of the series that comes to my mind when I try to offer more mechanisms of long-term psychological adaptation.
The series highlighted the little moments of friendship between men.
As much as objective, external intervention, through the phone, people come in moments of despair, long-term support comes from the family and close friends.
So, if you participate in this weekend at the FriendsFest organized by Comedy Central, with the full play of the filming plates to celebrate the event, why not invite your friends to a coffee in Central Perk.
Or, better, if you see someone alone in Starbucks, smile and greet.
You never know what the difference your friendship could make.
Friends is broadcast by Comedy Central from the beginning to the end - all 236 episodes - on #FriendsFest
Di Maria marks and helps PSG to give Malmo away
Angel Di Maria celebrates with Blaise Matuidi and Edinson Cavani after playing against Malmo.
Angel Di Maria scored on Tuesday in his debut match in the Champions League and helped PSG impose itself in front of the Swedish team Malmo.
We present you the chronicle of the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel Di Maria and Edinson Cavani made their duty, Paris Saint-Germain starting the group matches of the Champions League, with a calm 2-0 victory against Malmo in the match played on Tuesday at Parc des Princes.
Di Maria scored in less than four minutes from the start of his debut match in the Champions League in the PSG team, bringing the champions of France in advantage although they missed a number of occasions before ensuring their advantage with the goal scored by Cavani in the 61st minute.
Arriving in Group A alongside Real Madrid and Shahtior Donețk, Paris needed a strong start against the Swedish champions because the goal of the French team is not only to qualify in optimum but also to improve the path to the quarters of the final in each of the last three tournaments.
However, despite taking the points, Laurent Blanc’s students were far from a perfect picture, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic wasting the goal opportunity after which he was replaced by the team in his hometown and the club in which he began his brilliant career in 1999.
“It’s not easy to win at home or in the Champions League, so 2-0 victory creates trouble to our opponents and makes a comfortable difference from the next class, even if there are still aspects that we have to improve throughout the season,” Blanc said.
It is a good sign.
We wanted to win and we did it, although I’m sorry we didn’t get one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned after the injury at one of the three changes in the team in Paris, with a 2-2 remission achieved at home by Bordeaux in League 1 this weekend, but Di Maria took the light of the reflectors in the fourth minute.
Last month when he was transferred from Manchester United, the Argentine offensive middle was named the man who will lead the PSG to the next level in Europe and demonstrated this when he tightened at Marco Verratti's pas behind Malmo's defense before shooting incredibly over Johan Wiland, in the long corner on the right door.
But if someone was expecting the PSG to win by throwing the fingers, they were disappointed.
Malmo, who defeated Celtic in the play-off to reach this stage and entered the ground with nine holders in national teams, with a defense of five men and two mid-defense, was a strong opponent.
But their attack was not impressive, except by making the shut of Nikola Djurdjic who passed Kevin Trapp's post in the 34th minute.
Instead, PSG players slowed the rhythm several times, giving a few unnecessary passes and unfinishing the interventions, even Ibrahimovic who missed not less than five attempts only in the first match and was then replaced by Cavani even after the game was restarted.
Ibrahimovic, however, proved much more skillful in supporting his colleagues, with his passion being the one that Di Maria sent in a shut away from Wiland over the gate in the 52nd minute.
The second goal was recorded in a final after an hour of match passed, thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan who recorded the seventh goal of the season after Ibrahimovic passed away from Maxwell's center.
This goal eliminated the hopes of the Malmo to re-balance the score and only a great stop of Wiland from the distance for rejection David Luizined the final score before the new entrance Ezequiel Lavezzi cancelled a goal in prolongations.
The Norwegian Malmo team coach, Age Hareide, later stated that PSG had a class over and that “the last match I played in the Champions League was in December last year.”
Since then, we have only played in the league in Sweden, which does not rise to the same level.
Qualifications are not enough.
The shirt for PSG.
They made an excellent game.
Glencore raises $2.5 billion from stock sales
The Swiss mining giant Glencore, hit by the drop in stock prices on the goods stock exchange, harvested $2.5 billion from the sale of shares as part of a massive debt reduction plan.
The company Glencore, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange, said it has sold new shares worth £1.6 billion to pay the debt.
After losing 57% of its market value this year, the company gets to the falling prices on the commodity exchange, because the decline of China’s economic activity affects demand and causes disaster in the markets.
The preferential right of subscription raised the price of the Glencore shares on the London Stock Exchange in the Wednesday morning transactions.
The shares rose 2.77% to 131.60 shilling at the FTSE 100 index, which opened to a 0.69% higher value.
Glencore has revealed its $2.5 billion stock sales as part of wider plans to cover almost a third of its $30 billion debt.
The company sold the new shares at the price of 125 shiling per share, 2.4% lower than the Tuesday closing price.
It took 1.3 billion shares out of the company, representing 9.99% of the group.
The worries about the growth of China’s long-stagnant economy led to a substantial rise in iron mining prices, about half, and coal, copper and other goods dropped by 20-40%.
Xi insists on wider expansion of the global economy
On Tuesday, President Xi Jinping told a reform group that the economy needs to open to the outside world to feed growth.
“China must commit to attract foreign investments and expertise and to improve its opening policies,” Xi said at the 16th Meeting of the Central Leading Group for Deepening Overall Reform.
Promoting openness and encouraging reforms will bring a new boost and vitality and will lead to economic growth, Xi said.
The management group adopted a series of guidelines, including a negative list of regulatory access to the market, relaxing customs control policies, encouraging state enterprises to absorb private capital and reorganizing the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a negative list will be drawn up to identify the sectors and areas of activity in which investment is not permitted.
The system will be tested gradually and improved through test programs.
According to the statement, the measure is important because it will give the market a more important role in allocating resources, ensuring a legislative business environment and providing a broader market opening.
State authorities will also weaken controls on the powers they delegate to companies, ensuring that these companies decide how to run their business.
China will also allow border regions to explore new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth.
In an attempt to open state-controlled sectors, several sectors will be open to private investments.
“The state authorities will not change their foreign investment policy and will protect the legitimate interests of companies established from foreign investment and provide them with better services,” the statement said.
Furthermore, it will be easier for foreign citizens to apply for permanent residence permits or so-called “green books” by optimizing requirements and fluidizing the application process.
The meeting also discussed the guarantee of the law enforcement of lawyers and the education of judges and prosecutors.
The meeting was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and leaders Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli, according to a statement made after the meeting.
Education syndicates are unhappy with government proposal to increase wages by 10%
Negotiations between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and the leaders of the Education trade unions have not reached any outcome, the government proposed a 10% wage increase from 1 December, with pay from 1 January 2016, and the trade unions wanted a 15% increase from November, or a 20% increase from December.
The discussions took place at the Victoria Palace on Tuesday evening, with the Prime Minister accompanied by the Minister of Education, Sorin Cimpeanu, the Minister of Finance, Eugen Teodorovici and the Minister of Labour, Rovana Plumb.
The proposal of today's government did not satisfy us, otherwise we't have come into the situation to call the leaders of our federations.
The 10 percent promised to us today represents less than we expect.
“In fact, these 10 percent are the money we have stipulated in our agreement with the government last year for 2016,” said President Anton Hadar, Alma Mater, at the end of the talks.
In the future, health and education will be the areas in which we will invest all the money we have.
According to him, a meeting of the FSLI will take place on Thursday, where the representatives of the government will also participate to present the proposal for salary increase to the representatives of the confederations in the country, after which the trade unions will decide whether to accept the offer of the Executive.
The prime minister also told the trade unions that the government is trying to send the wage law to Parliament as soon as possible, so that it can enter into force on 1 December.
The regulatory act provides for a salary increase in the educational system by 25% of the total increase of 70%, the increase provided for in the document to be exhausted, over the next four years.
Victor Ponta also promised to the trade unions the full payment of court sentences in 2016.
Immigration crisis: tragedy in the Egean Sea
At least 22 immigrants entered the territory of Turkey on Tuesday after the ship they were in crashed.
Among the victims are 11 women and 5 children, according to Yahoo News.
The boat is in the Egean Sea and goes to the Greek island of Kos.
The Turkish coastal guard said it managed to rescue 249 people on the ship, but their nationality is not yet known.
On Monday, two other people died while trying to cross the Egean Sea.
In the weekend, 34 immigrants, including 4 babies and 11 children, injected themselves along the Greek island of Farmakonisi, located 15 kilometers from the Turkish coast.
The situation was similar: the boat carried more people than its capacity, so it crashed.
The route has become a popular in recent times for immigrants who want to escape the war and hard life from countries such as Syria or Iraq.
More than 100 stewardesses released because they were too fat
The airline Air India has dismissed approximately 130 stewards and stewards because they are overweight, the airline announced at the end of last week.
The state company announced that the decision was taken for security reasons and recent government regulations, but critics say the measure is "ridicola" and "socant of sexist," the Washington Post writes.
Mass release is the latest of a ten-year struggle between the company and the more filled stewardes.
The weight limit for them dates from the 1980s, when Air India began to use graphics with the ideal weight and height.
In 2006, Air India released the new stewardese considered “exceptionally overweight,” as this fact “may have an effect on reflexes and may prevent the agility necessary to carry out emergency measures.”
The Stewardes brought the company to trial, won and were repaid, but the company resigned them again in 2009.
“All efforts to make them weaken have failed,” said a spokesman for the company.

One thing they have to do is to play football as well as possible.
Technical details should not be their care.
They need to value their talent.
This is what Paul Papp’s Football Academy wants to do.
“I look forward to the mayor Costan Morar at the first selection of the children, to show them he’s next to them,” footballer Papp told the dejean.ro.

The whole party wants government.
The interim president of the PSD, Liviu Dragnea, said on Tuesday that the whole party wants to remain in government, and if the prime minister wants, this decision will be formalized at the PSD Congress.
I understood that Mr. Ponta is waiting for this decision from the PSD Congress, everyone wants to govern, the whole party.
If we want to formalize by a Congress decision, we will do that too.
There will be no emotion about it.
"There were no elements, voices in the party, opinions in the party that would give someone uncertainty to the government or that would give someone the impression that someone in the party doesn't want the PSD to remain in the government, in the current government, with the current Prime Minister," Dragnea said at the end of the session of the National Permanent Office of the PSD.
The PSD has announced when it will make Congress - what will be decided then
Prime Minister Victor Ponta said on Tuesday that it is important that, in the PSD Congress, beyond the election of the leadership, a clear message be given whether it wants to continue the government or whether the party decides to move to the opposition.
Dragnea: I will announce Monday if I am a candidate for a post in Congress
On the other hand, Liviu Dragnea will announce next month whether he will be a candidate for a leadership position in the future Congress.
I will sing on Monday after the Executive Committee, if the date of the congress is determined.
"I will announce if I will be a candidate for a position in the party's leadership," Dragnea said at the end of Tuesday's session of the National Permanent Office of the PSD.
Asked if the hesitation regarding the announcement of the candidacy has to do with his file, Dragnea said he had no problem.
I don’t have the problem you are referring to, but it seems fair and honest to all my colleagues in the party to announce me a candidacy when the date of the Congress is formally determined.
“It’s the only motivation,” Dragnea said.
The vast majority of social-democratic subsidiaries have proposed an extraordinary PSD Congress on October 11, and the exact date of the Congress will be decided on Monday by the party’s Executive Committee.

It was not normal, I was not respected.
Victor Piturca revealed how he separated from Romania's national team last autumn.
The former selectioner testified he did not agree with the FRF president, Razvan Burleanu, after he took the place of Mircea Sandu, and thus made the decision to leave the national.
Finally, he proposed to the head of the Federation to substantially increase his salary to stay, but he was refused.
I am not sorry that I have left the country.
I was sorry, I left a job behind.
So I then thought it was good for me and I think it was good for me.
What happened to me when I was selectioner was not normal, I was not respected, my work was not respected.
I worked well with those before the Federation, but when Burleanu came to the Federation he came with a preconceived idea, he didn’t know me, found different opinions from the press about me.
It didn’t change me because it was very hard at that time, with the results I had, plus that it was the financial situation in the middle.
I continued my work, everything went very well and probably he had changed his ideas.
But I wanted to leave.
If they wanted to stay, I proposed an increase in the contract.
We have around 400 and some thousand euros per year, then we have around 600 thousand euros.
I didn’t talk with Burleanu, but with his right hand.
"It agreed, but only if we ended the first place in the group," Victor Piturca told Dolce Sport.
Victor Piturca resigned from Romania in the autumn of last year, although the team had good results in the Euro 2016 preliminaries.
The technician accepted the proposal to train in Saudi Arabia, he immediately took over the Al Ittihad group.

The rare disease that a man suffers
The American Nick Hess was noted by his family that he was alcoholic, his wife even filmed him when he was amethed, he could hardly stand on his feet and his words were hard to understand.
Although the 35-year-old said he didn’t drink alcohol, it was apparent that he was drunk.
When he accused me for the first time that I was drunk, without being drunk, I thought he was crazy.
"But friends and family believed 'maybe drinking alone, it's a secret alcoholic,' he tells, according to Mirror.
When he saw his wife's films with him, the man from Columbus, Ohio, simply didn't recognize himself: "I looked in my eyes and I wasn't there."
“It was terrible, I didn’t remember anything.”
Furthermore, his wife, who, even though he’s hunted for a while, eventually went with him to countless doctors, reminds himself that Nick’s breath also smelled alcohol.
The moment that made Nick worse to think was when, after a minor accident, when he was hit by another car, it was discovered that he had an alcoholic three times the legal limit, although one night before he had only one beer.
After years and countless investigations, it was found that Nick suffered from an extremely rare disease, “Auto-brewery syndrome”.
Practically, the body makes all the carbohydrates consumed to ferment, turning into alcohol.
The one who claimed that this could be Nick's disease was his wife.
The disease has not yet a cure, but since he gave up carbohydrates, Nick has not had such episodes.
He destroyed a Mercedes with a golf cross.
A man in South Korea destroyed his car, a Mercedes S63, in a sign of protest against the services he had received from his dealer.
The man "attacked" his car with a golf cross, causing enough damage to get the car out of use, BT reports.
The whole scene was filmed, and the video reached the internet, to the fun of those who watched it.
The man claimed that the car had defects that threatened his life and his family.
His anger appeared when the dealer from which he bought the car did not solve his problem, as he agreed.
The government on Wednesday approved the "National Immigration Strategy for the period 2015-2018" and the "Active Plan for the current year", documents considered to be "an further stage that Romania passes in the framework of efforts to modernize the immigration management process on the national territory", according to a press release.
The source indicates that the strategy aims to effectively manage the immigration phenomenon, including general strategic objectives, specific objectives and action directions that reflect the policies established at European level, adapted to national realities.
Given the problems faced by the states in the immediate neighborhood of Romania, measures are considered for the unified and coherent management of the situations determined by the possible occurrence of an influx of illegal immigrants on the territory of Romania, generated by situations of crisis of a political, social, economic or military nature.
“The Romanian authorities will contribute to the creation of a flexible admission system, but at the same time they will pay special attention to citizens from countries with potential migration or that may compromise national security,” the source added.
The strategy identifies a number of factors that can affect immigration and asylum, including the maintenance of the conflict situation in Syria, the reactivation of the conflict in Iraq, the maintenance of an instable situation in the neighboring areas of Romania (Ukraine, Transnistria), the perpetuation and increasing intensity of the Israeli-Palestinian armed conflict.
On the other hand, the document also sets out a number of general strategic objectives related to immigration, such as: promoting legal migration, stricter controls of the legality of residence of third-country nationals on the territory of Romania and the proper application of removal and restrictive measures, and improving the national asylum system.
The national strategy shall also include specific objectives relevant to the transposition and implementation of the general strategic objectives.
These include: facilitation of access to the territory of Romania for third-party citizens who meet the needs of employment, facilitation of access to third-party citizens to higher education institutions in Romania for areas and professions identified as deficiency.
As regards the 2015 Action Plan, the Government considers that it represents “a means by which concrete activities are established that will lead to the creation of a flexible system to stop the growing migration phenomenon.”
Romania in a European top on the labour market
Latvia, Romania and Bulgaria saw the highest increase in the total cost of labour among the Member States of the European Union in the second quarter of the year, compared to the similar period of 2014, according to data published on Wednesday by the European Bureau of Statistics (Eurostat).
The index refers to the expenses with the employer’s staff.
Thus, between April and June 2015, the total cost of labour increased by 1.9% in the European Union and by 1.6% in the euro area.
Romania ranked third in the EU for increased labour costs
The highest growth was in Latvia (7.9 percent), Romania (7.7 percent), Bulgaria (6.8 percent), Estonia (5,5 percent) and Lithuania (4.3 percent).
The only EU countries where the hourly labour cost dropped in the second quarter of this year were Greece (minus 2.9%), Cyprus (minus 1.2%) and Italy (minus 0.4%).
The advance of labour costs in Romania in the period April-June 2015 is mainly due to the increased hourly labour costs in industry and services, with 7.9% and, respectively, 7.6%.
In the construction sector, Romania has recorded an advance of 5.8% of the hourly cost of labour.
The activity report of the TVR leadership, rejected in the committees: Stelian Tanase risks resignation
The cultural committees of the Parliament on Wednesday rejected the work report of the Board of Directors of the Romanian Television Society for 2014.
The report was rejected by 17 parliamentarians, one against the rejection (Senator Varujan Vosganian) and one abstained.
The text of the report will be submitted to the meeting permanent offices.
They will decide, probably next week.
The next meeting will be discussed.
“I think this situation will be done relatively quickly,” Senate Culture Commission President Georgica Severin said.
He added that it was "good" that the TVR leadership should be present at this meeting, under the conditions that no representative of the TVR leadership was present at the meeting of the Culture Committees.
It was a good feeling to be present to the TVR leadership because no one here was subjected to personal attacks or something like that.
The invitation was made to members of the CA yesterday, with an hour approximately that we didn’t know any new time, but today, after the meeting of the meetings, I personally sent a fax to the TVR headquarters inviting her.
I believe that at the time you are called, you are a budgetary employee, paid from public taxes, and you are called to a meeting of the committees gathered even if you don’t like live.
"Because it is your duty of service, you are in an institution under Parliament," Severin said after the meeting of the Parliament's cultural committees.
He added that the financial aspects of the institution were discussed on the basis of the negative opinion of the budget committees.
The debts we saw and we saw how they continued, came with the idea that this year would have been up to date, but they did not pay from the historic.
“I remind you that not by my fault or by any of these committees that agreement with the banks and the tax has been lost, there are clear management issues,” Severin said.
He added that after the work report will be rejected by the plenary meeting will follow elections for a new Board of Directors, and that will elect the Director-General of the institution.
I don't know who will be proposed for this job.
Wonders will not be done.
It is important to make political decisions to ensure that this institution works.
I am not a man to lie to you, to tell you that a genius will appear who will sit on the coat here and beating.
I hope that those who decide, the plenary of the Parliament, by their vote will choose with great ration the people who will lead the TVR.
There must be people who know what’s going on there, have experience and have a lot of fairness and respect for the institution and tradition.
I don't know who he'll be, if you ask me what qualities he should have - I feel good in his attitude to the employees because he's a malder of petitions that come from employees, complaints, dismissals.
“When you receive such references 50, 60, 70, something is dirty and we are talking about the financial situation that is a disaster,” the President of the Senate’s Culture Commission concluded.
Although he did not present himself to the Parliament, TVR’s chairman-general, Stelian Tanase, sent a letter to the House of Representatives, Valeriu Zgonea, in which he asked the Parliament to consider a number of measures that could lead to the preservation and guarantee of the economic and political independence of public television, including the indexation of TV taxes.
In the letter, Stelian Tanase requested, in addition to the indexation of the TV tax, the modification and supplementation of HG 978/2003 on the tax for public television service, in order to update the provisions at the level of technological changes at present, as well as for the regulation of the control procedure in the field of the payment of the TV tax and the detection of infringements and the application of sanctions and penalties.
He also wants to issue a provision that provides for an extension of the obligation for all electricity suppliers to become SRTv’s mandates for the collection of TV taxes, by involving ANRE in regulating this activity.
In his opinion, it is necessary to establish a maximum threshold of 5% of the commission on incasions.
Stelian Tanase calls for the reduction of the VAT share for the activities specific to the public television station and the contribution for CNC from 15% to 3% as well as the amendment of Law 41/1994, in the sense of the possibility of receiving budgetary/financial allocations for the acquisition of licenses for major cultural and sports events - World Football Championship, Golden Circle, Eurovision.
He argues that the SRTv will go into insolvency in the coming months given that the labour law obliges the employer to execute the judgments, even if they are not definitive, and the wages are honoured with priority over any other obligation.
The TVR administration has constantly made efforts to reduce spending on staff and TV production.
“There were shifts and other cost-generating activities reduced, a number of trade contracts were renegotiated, and at the end of July TVR News post was closed,” TVR President’s letter said.
Tanase considers that the disastrous financial situation cannot be removed only by his own efforts.
“Without the support of the institutions of the state – Government, Parliament, Presidency – the Romanian Television will be, sooner or later, in the impossibility to fulfill its public mission,” the letter said.
The House of Representatives decided to send the letter to the Culture Committee.
Gines of Vasile Blaga sent to trial
Vasile Blaga's Jeans, Ionut Andrei Rudeanu, was sent to trial on Wednesday by the Prosecutors of the Prosecutor's Office next to the Bucharest Court of Appeal.
He is accused of tax evasion, in a case with damages of approximately 600,000 euros, falling under judicial control.
Andrei Rudeanu was arrested on May 22.
He founded the Axis Corporate Security SRL guard company with his mother in April 2009, a year after he married Vasile Blaga’s daughter, Agathe.
The investigations reiterated that, in order to withdraw from the payment of taxes and taxes to the state budget, representatives of a company specialized in the provision of guard services would have created a criminal circuit, consisting of several commercial companies, through which fictitious transactions would have been evidenced.
“In fact, in the company’s accounting would have been recorded fictitious purchases of services, which, in reality, were not provided, the state budget was thus damaged by about 600,000 euros,” the Romana Police said in a press release.
The Seychelles determined Sanmartean’s fate.
The Al-Ittihad team has determined the fate of Lucian Sanmartean.
Although the Arab media announces that the separation of Sanmartean from Ittihad is imminent, the printer of Ladislau Boloni, Arcadie Zaporojanu, says that this will not happen anymore.
Boloni is very pleased with Sanmartean.
Lucian plays the title match and does it well.
The Seychelles also realized that he was the best and that it would be wrong if they gave up him.
It would have been the option to bring another player, much better, but nothing came out.
"There were more discussions, such as that with Mbark Boussoufa, but nothing was made," Zaporojanu told Digi Sport.
Lucian Sanmartean arrived at Al-Ittihad earlier this year.
Ilie Sarbu was elected vice president of the Court of Auditors
The Plenum voted on Wednesday the appointment of the PSD senator Ilie Sarbu, socker of Prime Minister Victor Ponta, as Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors.
According to Mediafax, 290 votes were recorded for and 108 against.
The vote was secret, with newsletters.
The PNL representatives were the only ones who voted against this proposal, reports Digi24.
On the other hand, the liberals criticized the appointment of Sarbu in this position and announced that they will challenge her at the CCR, under the conditions that he has a file to the DNA, but has no necessary preparation and experience.
Ilie Sarbu has 30 days, according to the law, to resign from the Senate, because the new post at the Court of Auditors does not allow him to make politics anymore.
The PSD senator will occupy the post of Vice-President of the Audit Authority of the Court of Auditors, remaining free after Ioan Anton was revoked, as a result of a decision of the Constitutional Court in September 2014, which found that he was named unconstitutional.
The surprise of one of the most sexy actors: I grew up in the kitchen
As Bradley Cooper is going to play the role of a cook in the film "Burnt", the actor made a revelation that his fans didn't expect.
In a recent interview, he said he grew more in the kitchen: "I worked much of my life as a cook."
He revealed that he worked in the kitchen since 15 years, when he worked for a Greek restaurant, so that he then, at the faculty, went on the same path.
The actor explained that his mother was of Italian origin, so the whole childhood cooked with the Italian grandmother, reports ContactMusic.
Asked what future plans he had during that period, Bradley Cooper said he was never the type of man to make plans for five years, "not even for two."
“It’s not motivating me to have a map,” he said.
“I have dreams, things you would like if I told you,” he said, saying that what he wanted from childhood was fulfilled.
At the age of 40, however, the actor acknowledged that he saw himself in the near future directing, taking the model of Clint Eastwood, who took the lead at this age.
Ponta, accused of uncontrolled misconduct and irrational claims
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto hardly condemned Wednesday morning the Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's statements that Hungarian political decision makers are "no better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which refugees flee".
“Yesterday, Victor Ponta lost its self-control and, through his irastic statements, insults the whole Hungary,” the Hungarian Foreign Minister said in a statement.
Civilized European politicians do not say such uncontrolled calomnies.
“His remains have only one explanation: he has completely lost his support in the internal policy of Romania,” the head of the Hungarian diplomacy added.
In a Facebook post on Tuesday evening, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said he wanted to attract attention and punish the behavior of high-level Hungarian government officials, which, in his opinion, “is a shame for the culture and values of the European Union.”
I do not want to respond to the challenges brought by Hungarian government representatives.
“These are a shame for the culture and values of the European Union; both in the anti-Semitic attitudes, and in the treatment of minorities of all kinds, and now during the refugee crisis!”
The Romanian Prime Minister added that he is the supporter of rational and sustainable solutions for the refugee crisis, appreciating that brutality and aggressive laws will not solve the problem.
The gumped sarma, aggressive laws, prisons and brutality will surely not solve the problem – they will only show that in Hungary, in the heart of Europe, there are political decision makers with nothing better than those in Syria, Libya or other countries from which those refugees flee!
“I believe in solidarity, in rational and sustainable solutions and especially in the superiority of European values – what we see in recent days in Hungary is in total contradiction with these goals and values!”
Earlier Tuesday, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto described as "simple lies" Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta's remarks on Hungary's management of the refugee crisis, considering that those statements are inappropriate for a 21st-century leader, according to MTI.
The head of the Hungarian diplomacy also mentioned on Tuesday that the "extremist and liar remarks" of the Romanian Prime Minister are about the internal political crisis in Romania and said that Budapest expects apologies from the Romanian side.
Szijjarto referred to a statement made Monday by Prime Minister Victor Ponta.
What I’ve always said and said is that I’m against the xenophobic speech the idea of closing the borders, that all those who come are terrorists, they’re fools of the Middle Ages, and I totally oppose this approach.
If we can get more, we will get, the problem is our logistical ability to treat those people as some people, not how our Hungarian neighbors treat them, with the bite and the inseriate.
“I do not agree with that,” the Romanian chief executive said at a press conference in Targu-Jiu.
On Tuesday, Peter Szijjarto announced that the government of Budapest decided to start preparations on the ground for the expansion at the border with Romania of the gardens it builds at the border with Serbia, in order to tackle a possible change in the route used by migrants.
Later, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said that Hungary’s decision to raise a border ceiling does not solve anything in the refugee problem and “scoates Hungary from Europe.”
What is the link between Osama bin Laden and the collapse of the Macarala in Mecca?
Saudi authorities have announced that the Saudi giant Binladin Group, belonging to the family of Osama bin Laden, is "partially responsible" for the collapse of a macarate on Friday on the Sea Mosque in Mecca, an accident resulting in which 107 people died.
According to an investigation committee, the company has not “respected the security rules,” the Saudi news agency (SPA).
The company’s managers were forbidden to leave the country until the investigation was completed.
The company will also be excluded from new public contracts.
The construction company is owned by the family of former leader of the Al-Qaeda terror network, Osama bin Laden.
The company was founded by Osama bin Laden's father 80 years ago and is currently led by former terrorist leader's brother Bakr.
Binladen Group has been working for 4 years to expand the Great Mosque to host more pilgrims.
The accident occurred on Friday night, during a storm, when a cave, probably imbalanced by the strong wind rafts, collapsed on the east side of the Great Mosque cover in Mecca.
In the accident, 107 people were killed and 400 were injured.
How Hagi closed the mouth of the contestants
Considered by many worlds the greatest Roman footballer in history, Gica Hagi was labeled, after his withdrawal from activity, as a weak coach, who could not be able to performance even in the new posture.
After unhappy experiences with the national team, Starua or Galatasaray, Hagi took over, a year ago, the role of coach at the Future Constanta, the team he patrons.
After a fixed year after taking the team, the King demonstrated that he was able to transform a team flying for rescue from retrograde into one of the top.
So, after a year, the Future recorded, with Hagi coach, 16 victories, 11 remises and 11 defeats.
The balance sheet is one of a top team, struggling to the European cups.
The things took a better turn for the Future this season, as the team reached the second place in League 1, with 19 points, one less than leader Astra Giurgiu.
The future also has the best attack in League 1, with 20 goals (equal to Astra), more than double than the Star.
On the other hand, even though it brought to the team several experienced players, Hagi continued the policy of promoting young people, and in recent period in the start team appeared names such as Ianis Hagi or Hodorogea.
The club's policy made the Future a team to follow for the teams abroad, so Hagi sold this summer for 1.5 million euros - Ianis Hagi (Fiorentina - 1 million euros) and Alexandru Mitrita (Bari - 500 thousand euros).
Along with the Star, the Future is the only profitable team in League 1, according to data from the Trade Registry.
In the refugee crisis, Romania has played as a small country so far.
It is a legitimate strategy, but then you can’t ask to be treated as the seventh country in the EU.
The big countries come with solutions for the whole EU, says Cristian Ginea, a member of the director's college of the Roman Centre for European Policy.
In an interview with Ziare.com, Cristian Ghinea showed that Europe cannot be transformed into a fortress, and the purely political means will not work in this crisis: "We may have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come."
But there are masses that have begun and we cannot return history.
Migration is a reality to which we must adapt as well as adapt them to ourselves.
According to Cristian Ginea, we are in an extremely emotional moment when politicians feel the need to show their muscles.
After it passes, Europeans will not be willing to give up the free movement, but the rules in the Schengen space must be changed: "Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the current situation."
Where are we in the refugee crisis after this JAI council that, in fact, has not solved anything?
It is clear that the President of the European Commission in agreement with Donald Tusk did not want to force a vote in the Council.
All the forecasts said he would have the necessary votes.
Before the Lisbon Treaty, the principle of unanimousness is applied in the JAI and any state can block any decision.
Therefore, things have been very little integrated in the field of justice and internal affairs.
After Lisbon, the normal procedure, in which the Commission has an initiative, is applied, and the Council approves it with the vote of 55% of the states, i.e., 16, which will represent 65% of the EU population.
The calculations said the votes existed.
But they didn’t want to go ahead.
Because it’s a sensitive matter, rejection reactions have occurred in Germany against Merkel’s opening policy and they didn’t want it to appear in many countries as a reaction like “EU sends migrants on our head.”
They have so delayed, but the problem remains because, obviously, this wave creates a huge problem for the Schengen governor and we will probably see great changes there in the next period.
So the compulsory quotas were not really eliminated, but the subject was just left to cool?
Yes, on the other hand, we are talking about a greater participation of Frontex in the management of external borders, which means a change from the individual responsibility of the members who are at the external border of Schengen to the responsibility of Community agents.
The border of Greece with Turkey is also the border of Germany with Turkey, de facto, and this wave of migrants has given the boundaries of the old Schengen system.
It may renounce the Dublin principle, according to which migrants are the responsibility of the state to which they enter for the first time, because it is not sustainable.
If Greece captures, you can’t say to the end that it’s Greece’s job.
The problem is common.
Just because the problem is common, is a solution possible without a precise, even mandatory mechanism of sharing the effort of receipt?
No one knows exactly how the obligatory quotas will work if they get to them.
What do you do with a man who doesn’t want to come to Romania or Portugal, but to Sweden or Germany?
I don’t think the European countries will take the migrants up: you go to the country X or to the country Y.
It is likely to reach some unique filtering centers, in Greece or Turkey, where asylum applications will be processed.
We are working on such solutions.
But the problem does not have a simple solution.
There are countries that have dozens of years of experience trying to integrate migrants, they are strong without any experience, like Romania, where the issue of migrants will increase the xenophobic current.
Of course, we’re talking about millions of people who are in Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, who are in precarious camps and who are just starting to go to Europe.
One estimate says that only 10% have managed to leave, the winter is hard to pass the Mediterranean, but we expect the next year to a wave may even greater.
What do we do with these people?
My prediction is that we will get used to this problem, we will no longer see it as catastrophic from the media point of view.
Talk about countries with less or greater experience.
Do you think there is any place where it really managed to integrate large groups from an extra-European culture?
I look at the Maghrebs in France, the Turks in Germany, they are still enclaved.
I would not go to radical statements.
Of course, their integration is harder than with other waves of migration, but that doesn’t mean they don’t integrate at all.
It has remained an unintegrated part that creates major social problems in France, Germany, and the UK.
But purely political means will not work.
Creating a strong Europe is illusory.
It is necessary to move towards the mechanisms of integration in European societies.
There were some errors here.
We must be more demanding.
To ask these people to learn the language, to try to take the values, not to stay with one foot in Europe and one foot in their country of origin, bringing the rest of their family including through convenience marriages.
But the imminent problem of these people must be separated from the long-term problem of their integration.
If others have failed to integrate in the long-term does not mean that we have to look at them as they fail in the Mediterranean.
We may have doubts about the quality of the values with which these people come.
And if there is an intervention in Syria, what I don’t think does not mean that the country will be restored overnight and you can take it back.
Until the solution comes, we see fortresses within Europe.
The borders were closed, the walls were lifted, the border controls were reintroduced in the Schengen area.
Is the European Union in danger?
The European project as such no, the Schengen space as it was built, yes.
It was built quite minimal and arranging the rules so that the pressure was too high on the countries in which these migrants put the foot for the first time.
We are free, but each has its own problems.
In the face of such a wave it cannot be, because some countries do not face it.
When there are such waves of emotions, politicians want to show they’re doing something, but in the long run it doesn’t change much.
After the attacks in France, we do not have a much more draconic anti-terrorist legislation in the EU than we had last year.
It is a wave of public emotion that settles in both directions.
And it’s so unstable from week to week that you can’t make decisions based on it.
We have a lot of speech, a lot of belicous statements from politicians at home under the pressure of being viril.
And then you have the dramatic case of the injected child in Turkey and the public opinion is excited.
After the public emotion passes, we will return to the reasons why we have created this space, that freedom of movement that is not only for people, but also for goods.
This is the unique European market.
And I do not believe that Europeans will give up this principle of freedom of movement.
If there are other rules, it is different.
Schengen is now like an animal created in another era and that was not adapted to the current situation.
How did Russia play in this crisis?
Like a small country, who believes that if he throws the hat on his eyes and throws his ears, the theme disappears.
In the face of the reality of the waves of migrants, you can choose to be part of the solution or say it’s not your small country’s problem.
We did that, it’s a legitimate strategy, but then you can’t ask to be treated as the seventh country in the EU.
You don’t, you don’t play at the country level.
Big countries come with solutions for the whole EU, good or bad, we don’t discuss their quality now.
As Poland did.
On the other hand, the effect of this crisis is that the Romans’ appetite for Schengen will decrease considerably.
President Iohannis says it’s good that I’m not yet in.
So we move from desperate entrance to a more pragmatic position, but the goal remains.
Of course there is a risk if Romania and Bulgaria enter Schengen as migrants see us as an alternative route.
This does not mean that there is a reason not to enter Schengen anymore, but to be more pragmatic.
Romania will be part of Schengen, and Schengen will exist, but transformed into the direction in which the external borders will become a common responsibility, there will be unified rules for the acceptance of migrants, unified rules for the deportation for those who do not receive asylum, unified rules for the countries considered safe.
The Ukrainian president said that after Russia moved its attention on Syria to Ukraine, no one died.
Is there a connection between the two shootings, a game of Russia?
Russia has a frustrated power behavior.
She believes that being a great power means incurring Americans and Europeans.
From this point of view, yes, there is a connection.
Without the military and financial efforts of the Putin regime, the Assad regime would probably have collapsed for a long time.
And it was good to break down before its main opponent was the Islamic State.
It was a two-year struggle between the Assad regime and moderate laic and Muslim militias, supported by the Gulf and Western countries.
Then the Islamic State rose and now we don’t know if we want the Assad regime to fall.
Russia could complicate the situation, but cannot participate in the solution.
It creates foundation of instability and chaos that it cannot close.
But you are great only if you have solutions.
Off-side game is just a strategy to make time.
Per Putin is waiting for him to be offered, to press the buttons to resolve the situation.
The offers do not come because the world is not convinced that he can solve the problems created by him in one way or another.
But I do not agree with the theories that say that these people are handed by an invisible hand.
Let us not see Putin stronger than he is.
What button will appear soon?
Millions of Facebook users have used to the "Like" button, and now social media representatives are preparing another opposite, the "Dislike".
Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg, co-founder and CEO of the company, announced on his account that this button will be available soon, reports the New York Times on the blog.
Zuckerberg said the "Dislike" button will show a shade of what a user feels rather than a simple option.
However, his announcement raised the problem that Facebook could become a less friendly place.
Zuckerberg said he wanted to avoid moments when someone posted on his account or an important event in his life, and someone else would give "Dislike".
Users of the network, which has reached 1.5 billion active accounts, have long asked to have the opportunity to express their negative emotions or empathy with something sad.
Mark Zuckerberg said it is not very comfortable that people give "Like" to current events, such as the refugee crisis, or in case of a family member's death.
“You may not feel comfortable giving Like to that post,” the Facebook representative said.
The version of a new button on Facebook was not well-accepted by everyone.
“There’s already enough hatred on Facebook and social media,” said Atiq Haneef from Afghanistan on the Facebook page of the New York Times, where the article was posted on the topic.
“I’ll give ‘Dislike’ to the ‘Dislike’ button,” he said.
Roger Anderson, a microbiologist from Atlanta, said there is nothing wrong with this button, encouraging people to have different opinions on Facebook.
Debra Aho Williamson, a social media analyst at eMarketer, said it’s hard to imagine that a single button can transmit a complex range of negative emotions.
Moreover, she says, the election campaign is approaching in America, and the "Dislike" button would create a total disaster.
Only 70 refugees entered Hungary in 24 hours
Hungary accepted only 70 migrants on Tuesday, one hand of thousands coming to the table at its southern border with Serbia, government adviser Gyorgy Bakondi said.
Hungary declared emergency during the day in two hills along the border with Serbia due to the flow of refugees, closing a major border crossing point and announcing that it will build a gardens at its border with Romania.
The measure attracted a sudden reaction from Serbia.
They said they would seal the border for those who want to pass, but not for those who want asylum.
“As you can see, this is completely different,” said Serbian refugee minister Aleksandar Vulin.
Before the new immigration legislation was imposed, a record number of 5,809 migrants entered Hungary on Sunday, the police announced on Monday.
More than 170,000 migrants from the Middle East and Africa entered Hungary from Serbia in 2015.
Many avoid being registered and try to get to the West, especially in Germany.
The "new" headquarters of the council is standing to peak.
Two builders in insolvency
The massive investments made here in recent years, with the aim of moving the institution, continue to collapse because they have been stopped several times.
Two major builders who worked here entered insolvency during the works.
The headquarters of the council in Vasile Alecsandri Street will be destroyed by itself.
A year and a half after the construction and refinancing of the building had to be completed, the work did not reach half.
A last stage in the building epic took place last days when the National Council for Dispute Resolution (CNSC) rejected a complaint from the company that wanted to take the contract for the technical project for the work remaining to be carried out.
The original project was prepared by Impex Romcatel SA.
After the insolvency of the manufacturer and the interruption of the works, negotiation procedures were started without the publication of an announcement of participation with Impex Romcatel, the company was to update the technical project, and then to be organized a new auction for the works.
“Negotiations were not concluded by a contract, CJ assessing that the proposed form would have been disadvantaged to the institution,” said Răzvan Timofciuc, representative of public relations at CJ.
The decision of CJ to interrupt the direct negotiations was appealed in court by Impex Romcatel.
The outgoing court sent the complaint to the CNSC, which rejected it, as late.
However, this does not mean that CJ can start looking for another designer.
Impex Romcatel has the possibility to appeal the CNSC decision to the Court of Appeal, only after a final judgment of it and can be taken into account finding another designer.
Thus, the construction work could be restored as early as next year.
Our intention is to restart the work as soon as possible.
In principle, the restoration of the technical project should not take a long time, but we have to get to the conclusion of a contract.
"We're waiting to see if the CNSC decision will be attacked or not," Timofciuc said.
The construction of the former police headquarters began in 2011.
A first work contract was terminated in April 2012, after 4,5 million lei works were carried out.
The tender was renewed, the contract was awarded by Moldoconstruct SA.
The company went into insolvency, and this contract was terminated, after payments of 1.5 million lei were made.
The work has been done at approximately 50%.
Initially, the work of consolidation, refinancing and mansarding of the building was estimated at 7.7 million lei.
"Gate, I say everything!" - the statement that could offend the former head of the Cadastru
One of the employees involved in the case scandal at the Cadastru Office signed an agreement to recognize the facts, against delayed imprisonment.
Most likely, his statements will punish the other accused, in front of former chief Narciza Nedelcu.
A counselor at the Office of Cadastre and Real Estate Advertising (OCPI) Iasi accused by DNA in a corruption file recognized his facts.
The agreement on the recognition of the facts signed by Dumitru Dascălu was registered yesterday at the Iasi Tribunal, the judges decided to give a resolution in this case on 29 September.
Dumitru Daniel Dascălu was accused of false intellectual in continued form and agreed to execute two years of imprisonment with delay, as well as work for the benefit of the community.
As regards the facts imputed to Dascălu, the prosecutors stated that he, as a counselor of the Cadastru Office, together with other colleagues, “has made in false several verbal acceptance procedures, with regard to the services contracts previously concluded by O.C.P.I. Iasi with the administrators of the companies SC Gauss SRL, SC Group Cinci SRL, SC Topo Euro Cad SRL, SC Agencia de Cadastru and Topografia SRL and PFA Lipşa Stefan, who witnessed, in irreally, that the contractual services were completed, under the conditions in which they were not performed and were not submitted to O.C.I.I. etc.”
Last days, the former head of the Office, Narciza Nedelcu, as well as other former or current employees of the OCPI were sent to trial in this file, accusations being the discounting of some services to the aforementioned companies, although the work was not done.
The judgment exceeds 300,000 lei.
Adventures in the Stone Age
According to FRH President Alexandru Dedu, Romania can host a major handball competition only in 2024, and preparing the national female handball to qualify for the Olympic Games costs a wealth.
The President of the Romanian Handball Federation, Alexandru Dedu, said on a press meeting that it is a great pride that our country has three teams in the Champions League groups.
As for the national women's handball team of Romania, "the main goal is to qualify for the Rio Olympics, but for that it has to pass through two stages of caudine furts, first the World Championship and second the pre-qualification tournament," Dedu said.
We want to qualify for the Olympic Games.
There are some fantastic requirements from the technical staff led by Tomas Ryde.
The staff will be composed of seven or eight people.
He wants a second coach, a doctor, two masors, a carrier coach, a physical preparer, a chief of the delegation.
They asked us for the qualification some things, more precisely material for physical training, that we have never heard of.
All this to get to the Olympics. and I will do everything I need to have them.
We’re talking about a massive investment, there’s a lot, a lot of money.
But this is the way to make performance.
Because now we are in the stone age with preparation.
"The teams with which we fight have these materials and have them for some time," said Dedu, who said they are trying to get the amounts needed to purchase these products from MTS and COSR.
The President of FRH also referred to the infrastructure in Romania and the possibility that our country hosts a major handball competition.
There is no room in Bucharest.
It’s an infrastructure problem and it’s shameful to be questioned by a European Gymnastics Championship.
Let’s not forget that in other corners of the world Olympic neighborhoods have been built entirely within a two-year interval.
Before 1992, in the current Olympic area of Barcelona was a hole of waste, and now it has become a hole of beauty.
The same happened in London, where the 2012 Olympics was an investment success.
"In my vision, in 2024 we can host a major competition," Dedu said.
He added that international handball bodies are willing to grant Romania the organization of a major competition.
For me it is a priority to bring major handball competitions to Romania.
Mr. Gațu went civilized with a project, people agreed in principle, but very quickly it became clear that the room will never be built.
And I had talks with EHF, I told them we want, that we are able to organize and they said they agree and invite them to the first match in the new hall in Bucharest and then we discuss concrete.
"So we have all the opening, both at EHF and IHF, but we don't have infrastructure," the FRH official explained.
The former big handballist avoided evaluating the chances of the female teams CSM Bucharest and HCM Baia Mare to reach the Final Four: "I asked all the coaches to be reserved in forecasts that if they do not meet they will return against them."
Good way to the World Cup
Romanian Rugby starts on September 23 against France
The captain of the national rugby team, Mihai Macovei, said on Tuesday at a press conference that all the components of the lot of Romania are ready for the matches of the World Cup in England, where they hope to obtain two victories: "We are ready."
Both me and my colleagues are with the engines at the maximum turn.

I want not to disappoint anyone in the rugby family and come home with beautiful results.
“We want you to be proud that some players, a small family like rugby in Romania, are proud to represent the tricolor,” Macovei said.
The selector of the national team of Romania, Lynn Howells, who is on his first experience as a coach at the World Cup, hopes to make the Romanians proud of the rugby team: "It is a great honor for us to participate in this World Cup."
I am sure that the players are ready to participate in the tournament.
It is an extraordinary experience for me.
For me it is very important that in every match the Romanians are proud of the national team.
The President of the Romanian Rugby Federation, Haralambie Dumitraş, is confident that the Romanian players can confirm the progress made in the last few years in the rugby.
We have a very difficult group and we want to confirm the progress made in the national team.
I wish them success to the athletes and I am convinced that we will be at the knowledge of the event.
“These boys started playing in the teams of Romania at the age of 18-19 years, so there is cohesion, it’s a band of friends, who fixed to realize a dream,” Dumitraş said.
At the World Rugby Cup in England, Romania will evolve into Group D, having scheduled the following matches: with France on September 23 in London; with Ireland on September 27 in London; with Canada on October 6 in Leicester; with Italy on October 11 in Exeter.

14 million rupees to the St. Spiridon Hospital in Iasi for budget rectification
What will be purchased with this significant amount of money?
The Hospital "Saint Spiridon" received from the Ministry of Health, after the budget correction, approximately 14 million lei.
The money the medical unit received to use by the end of the year will be invested in the modernization and arrangement of clinics, but also in medical equipment and equipment for which the hospital has already started the public procurement procedure.
Thus, the sanitary unit will be equipped with a new tomograph computer, with a new radiological apparatus, with six truses used for surgical interventions, six properly equipped ATI beds, eye microscope and other devices necessary for the conduct of the medical act.
On the other hand, 5 million lei from the money received from the hospital will be directed to the construction and arrangement of the "Great Ars".
From the money from the budget rectification, UPU will receive 500,000 lei for the completion of the modernization work in the main throne.
"In addition, the next days we will make the reception of the work from the pastry that connects UPU to the clinics of cardiology, hepatology and gastroenterology to ensure the decent transport of the patient from UPU to neighboring clinics," the manager of the medical unit explained.
The hospital will soon have in the courts and the Dermatology Clinic in Tătărași, which will be organized in the ambulatory, in the same form that it is currently operating.
The clinic will operate in the area where the allergy, hematology and endocrinology are located in the ambulatory and will have about 30 beds.
The IAS, made by the laugh of the RATP controllers and a stick.
The Path of a Tourist
A family of tourists from Cluj came to Iasi to visit him, but the trip ended with a bitter promise.
After the experience, neither me nor my wife would ever want to go to your city again.
Without wanting, they were hit by the wrong information in the plants, the misunderstanding of the RAPT controllers and, bonus, a fine "as the law says".
The spouses arrived in Iasi a few days ago, stayed in a hotel in the Centre and asked for tourist flies.
They also received a plank in which the RATP routes were passed.
"Armed" with these maps, the spouses visited the Iash.
But two days ago, in Copou, they wanted to get to Palas Mall.
Because there was no ticket tune at the station near Copou Park, they relied on the information printed on the plank: that they can get the ticket by SMS.
No one told them that this service no longer exists.
Trusted in the clay, they climbed into a bus and tried to send SMS after the instructions on the clay.
Unfortunately for them, they made their appearance a team of RATP controllers.
They said that the service was no longer there for two years and that it was announced in the press that it was cancelled.
Where do I know what was written in the local press, I come with a night before visiting the city?
I talked to the controller, I explained the situation, they said they didn’t care, it’s not their job.
The attitude was very challenging.
They said that all I can do is to give us one penalty instead of two (my and my wife).
"I paid, I didn't want to ruin my visit day stand at the gendarmery and giving statements there!", Ovidiu tells.
In conclusion, the family was sentenced due to the wrong information on the stick and the controller who "applicated the law to blood".
It’s not correct, and I made an application to RATP Iasi to recover my money.
It’s not about money, I’m not exaggerated by many, but the idea is that I felt misleading.
Hate for the violators.
They had an accident and remained in prison.
The trial of the seven rapeers of Vaslui moved to the Iasi Court yesterday.
The outgoing judges judged the first term of trial in an unpublished trial in which the seven young people accused of shocking a 18-year-old girl asked to be released.
Before the very beginning of the trial, one of the outgoing judges to whom the case was distributed, Viorel Munteanu, made a request for withdrawal, which was admitted by his colleagues from the court.
The judge activated until this summer at the Tribunal Vaslui, where he was the chairman of the Penal Section, he who, on 9 April, admitted a complaint made by four of the accused, disposing to put them in house arrest.
Currently, the case is being judged by a complete of which are part of the judges Maricica Mititelu and Geta Sandu.
In the case, Judge Dan Anton also formed an abstinence on the grounds that his daughter is in a concubination relationship with one of the lawyers of the rapers.
The two judges decided that the violators of Vaslui would continue to be in pre-arrest.
The teenagers will remain in jail for at least another 30 days, when the judges will resume the possibility of their release.
The next term of trial will be held at the Iasi Court on 6 October.
Before arriving at the Iasi Court, the door with which the violators were transported from Vaslui was involved in an accident produced in the Păcurari neighborhood, the car entering Iasi on the belt.
The Iveco car with which the seven rapers were transported hit a Volkswagen car that came out of the Canta Street, and the driver tried to turn to the left.
Duba runs from the end.
The car entered Iasi here because the employees of the Penitentiary Administration preferred the route from Vaslui to Iasi on Grajduri, then on the belt road.
They shortened the road by a few kilometers.
Immediately after the impact, the escort of the detainees called another transport to take the prisoners.
In short, a car from the Iasi Maximum Security Prison was sent to the place of the accident, which took the seven prisoners and brought them to the Court of Appeal.
As a result of the accident, no one of the detainees was injured.
To transfer them to the other dupe, the guards surrounded the back of the cars, and the detainees went out at a speed, two by two.
“The incident has not been to the police, because the drivers of the two vehicles have understood themselves friendly with regard to the damages to be paid,” said Chief Commissioner Mădălin Ţăranu, from the IPJ.
The Great Migration
Romania is not and will not be prepared for what will happen.
What about Europe?
I say it from the beginning, clearly and clearly: the 7,000 refugees that Romania should and must naturalize are, in itself, an insignificant but enormous number compared to the capacity of the Romanian state to manage such a project.
For Romania, even the voluntary quota proposed by Bucharest, in the amount of about 1,500 souls, is far beyond the good intentions of solidarity with the European Union expressed in the past months.
Certainly, if those migrants will even agree to settle in our towns, the chances of quickly integrating them into the Romanian society are extremely small.
I am convinced that they will be the first to lose patience.
Parasitated by interlopes and paralyzed by a venal political class, the Romanian state is impotent in all areas.
The incapacity to integrate the cigans is just a banal example.
In addition, governments of any colour were unable to absorb European funds, to build modern roads, gardens or schools, to provide decent health care, to gather misery on the streets, to create honorably paid jobs, or to keep their own young generation home.
Why would refugees be settled in another country from which they flee?
But what produces a lot of wonder is especially the hypocrisy with which such a crisis is treated.
We are first hit by the belicous feathering of the strong EU countries, which demonstrate maximum generousity when it comes to sharing the trouble with the smaller countries.
Then comes the fearful hypocrisy of the Romanians who, although they have millions of relatives spread around the world, do not yet accept the other – another language, another religion, another blood.
He is afraid that no one will steal his nation.
Finally, there is a hypocrisy of many migrants, who, although only invoke the horrors of the war as the reason for their departure, do not accept any other destination of the exodus than Germany or the northern countries.
But not all refugees are Syrians, and there is no war in Pakistan.
Also, the simplistic way in which the crisis is analyzed can only be overlooked.
Causes must be eliminated, some support and, strictly placing on the Book of Political Correctness, call for peace and investment for the countries of origin of migrants.
But in Romania there is peace and even more, from time to time, some foreign capital enters the national economy – but this does not prevent tens of thousands of Romanians from leaving their country every year.
Why they leave?
In this crisis, the European Union has revealed itself to us as an anchilated, divided, and overcome by the situation.
I complained that Romania is unable to invent a country project, but here the EU does not have any future plans.
And improvisations and threats do not help anything.
So what will the EU do if the only advantage that the Romanians – the right to free movement – could be discussed because of the waves of refugees that cross the borders like by cheese?
At some point, the war in Syria will end.
Not the migration crisis.
Over the coming decades, overpopulation, poverty, climate change, resource exhaust, etc. will push millions of disappeared migrants, from Asia and especially from Africa, to a better life.
With such politicians, Romania is not and will never be prepared for what will come.

Two brethren of Tomeşti swallowed sleeps.
They were taken to the hospital.
Two 9-year-old children, respectively 11-year-old from Tomești, brothers, ingested several Diazepam pills.
They found the pills in the house and took them from curiosity.
Their mother was treated and the drugs were not hidden.
The children were taken to the "Saint Mary" hospital in Iasi.
They are in a stable state, as doctors say.
Exclusive: A meeting that breaks your heart.
At the age of 20 he received a courageous gift: biological parents
Lost in the hospital in unclear conditions, in the 1990s, when she had only two months of life, little, sick and unhelpful, and then adopted by an elderly family from Italy, in the same years when the adoption was vague regulated, a young outdoors, now a blonde and beautiful girl, met again in Iasi with biological parents from a countryside village, after almost two decades in which no one knew anything about the others.
Crina will meet these days 20 years, and her adoptive parents in Palermo thought to give their beloved daughter a wonderful and courageous gift: a visit to Romania, to Iasi, to know her unclear past.
"The Iasi Day", which watched the efforts to search for the family of origin after a few extremely vague clues, was a witness to these meetings that practically broke your heart.
Reporting reporters, the emotions of the moments, the statements of those involved, their reactions are rightly moving and overwhelming.
The story of Crina begins 20 years ago in the outer town of Ruginoasa, when she was only two months old.
Then, due to a health problem, the girl had to be hospitalized in the city.
At home there began to be disagreements between parents, and the mother was forced to leave the house.
He decided to keep the girl and send me home.
It stopped the girl, and since then I didn’t know anything.
“When I learned that she was in the hospital, it was too late,” reminds Alina, the girl’s biological mother.
Crina was interned with her grandmother at the municipal hospital in Pascani, and even then the daughter's father, Costica Balcan, went to work in the city of Alexandria, Teleorman county.
Their lives had to be separated definitively.
No more found at the hospital.
After internship, the father of Crine went to work in another place, and returned after six months.
Meanwhile, the girl was transferred to the Iasi hospital, and the father, when she returned, did not find her anymore.
It was almost nine months since she was in the hospital.
“I thought she was abandoned,” a grandson of the family tells me.
Due to financial problems, the grandmother couldn’t come with Crina to Iasi, and the girl stayed in the care of the doctors.
Because no one was interested in the child's fate all this time, it was taken over by the Iasi General Directorate of Social Assistance and Child Protection, which then gave it to the care of the Bucium Placement Center.
There were years when abandonment and adoption were slightly regulated than today in Romania.
At the Bucium Center he was found by the Italian Salvadore and his wife, a couple from Palermo who wanted to have their child but failed.
They fell in love with the blonde Crina, and after a while she had to move with them to Italy.
The child was almost two years old, as long as the adoption formalities lasted.
When I saw Crina, I felt it was our daughter.
"As if my wife had given her life," Salvadore, the adoptive father, says to us with a smile, while he catches in his palm the girl's steep hand.
In the country, the parents of Crina, Alina and Costica, continued their searches separately, each where they could.
The father asked the authorities in Ruginoasa, but he did not receive any answer where his child could be.
The police then told her that she might be dead, but at Iasi the parents learned what really happened to their daughter.
When I was looking for her here, they told me at the Tribunal that she was going to Italy, in Palermo.
I had no conditions to look for it anymore.
We prayed to God to be good.
I thought of it all the years that passed, but there was no possibility to walk, to find it.
“It’s hard,” the biological mother of Crina tells us with tears in the eyes.
But even though the years have passed, the parents of Ruginoasa have not been forgotten.
In Italy, Salvadore and his wife explained to the girl where she came from and that her past connects her to Romania.
I was small when I learned.
I thought I was five or six years old.
I was a child, and I was curious.
“I wanted to know my parents in Romania,” Crina said.
And her dream would become a reality.
In March of this year, Romica Chief Commissioner Ichim, Director of the Regional Center for Drug Prevention, Evaluation and Advisory Iasi, was contacted by an Italian acquaintance who explained Salvadore's desire to find the biological family of Crimea.
The search started with only one name.
After the request we had from our partners in Italy, we started the first steps.
We take only one name, the Balkans, then the town, Ruginoasa.
Soon I had an activity with the municipality there, and I could ask if there is through the local name received.
Then they gave me some indications, just that the person found was not the one that was sought.
“It lasted about a month to find the girl’s biological father,” Romica Chief Commissioner Ichim explains.
In total, it took the authorities more than three months to find Costica and Alina, especially because each had a home in another place.
We started the operations somewhere in March, and in June-July we finished the identification of biological parents and discussions.
"Then I decided that a first meeting will take place in September," Romica Ichim added.
In the last weekend, Alina and Costica saw for the first time their lost girl on the halls of the Iasi hospital, 20 years ago.
The father, excited, was hardly able to master his tears, and his hands trembled constantly.
I just changed a few words with those around me.
A week before the meeting he could not even sleep.
He was excited, trembling.
“To see your child after so many years, it’s something,” says a granddaughter, who also came with Costica from Ruginoasa.
Meeting with mother and biological brother
In talks with his daughter, who is going to study at a well-called university in Italy, Costa Balcan told him, among other things, that if he wants to come back to him, in the village, he can come quietly: he can give him something, sheep, to find a boyfriend in the village and raise a household.
Her mother is also excited, crying, and hardly believing that something like that could happen to her.
I am very excited.
I didn’t think that could happen.
I’ve seen such cases on television, I’ve been thinking over these years, I’ve hoped, but I didn’t think I could be like that.
They are great emotions.
If he could forgive me.
I hope to visit in the future.
“I hope we can keep a bond,” Alina, the mother of Crina, tells us with great tears, while holding a servette in his hand.
In him she’s still hiding her tears of happiness, because she’ll soon see her face after so much bitter time.
On the other hand, Crina, who will meet in just a few days, this month, 20 years old, tries to calm as an emotional child.
She doesn't know what to expect, but she's scattered a vague idea of her biological parents.
He thinks they’re young, but now before meeting he tries to gather his thoughts, because he has a lot to say, but nothing to reprove.
My parents are two moms and two fathers.
My parents were the ones who raised me.
It will be a wonderful meeting, a wonderful experience.
"I hope I have a beautiful memory with them, because now there are so many things to say," Crina tells us.
The First Family Meeting in Iasi
On the Unity Square, under the sky of the early autumn, the Ruginoasa family again unites their fate with their daughter in Palermo.
Crina is 20 years ago, ending high school, according to the Italian school model, but can start a new chapter with Alina and Costica, her biological parents.
It no longer separates its boundaries or countries, but only a barrier: the language.
Over which, with the help of a translator, an Italian local owner in the center of Iasi, passed easily.
Those who have managed to make this meeting possible say that it is the first event of this kind done, and that in the future, if there is another opportunity, they will do it again.
It’s the first event of this kind organized, such an emotional burden, and I’m glad to be a success.
We at the Center have different activities, and most often we are associated as an institution that only deals with consumers, people drug addicts.
But we are trying to bring the societies something good back.
“If I’ll be requested for such an event, I’ll do it with great pleasure,” says Romica Ichim, director of the Regional Center for Prevention, Evaluation and Drug Advisory Iasi.
Behind him, the Balcan family, with Crina in the middle, distances telling.
They have a lot to say to each other.
Armed weapons on the foot, yesterday at the PSD.
Everyone is shooting his soul.
The camps in the outer subsidiary of the PSD concluded an armistice with a gun at foot.
After successive rounds of discussions, held from Friday to Sunday, the first being the most tensioned, the PSD leaders agreed to temporarily suspend the hostilities.
Pressed by the party’s executive president, Liviu Dragnea, to present a united position, the outgoing Social Democrats will send him a full list of potential candidates for the party’s positions.
Until it has ended, the party’s internal war seems to have only taken a break to allow the fighters to pull their soul.
Dragnea did not give an ultimatum.
He launched a very simple and very current message in the current conditions: try to find a solution to not put the party in danger.
We have elections in the party on October 3.
All functions will be made available to those who want them.
“From then, we remain in the existing structure,” said interim mayor Mihai Chirica.
The two days of weekend discussions only led to the conclusion that nothing clear was established.
At the elections in October, a sharp competition is expected for the post of president of the county subsidiary of the PSD.
On the short list of possible candidates for the main position in the party’s outgoing branch are the state secretary Maricel Popa, senator Florin Constantinescu, senator Sorin Lazăr, county counselor Vasile Câtea and the interim chairman of the county council, Victorel Lupu.
In addition, the mayor of the municipality of Schitu Duca, Mihai Mihalache, could be added.
A variant taken into consideration is also the candidacy of the leader of the county councils of the PSD, Cristian Stanciu, if Lupu will no longer be enrolled in the course, sources within the party claiming that he is not interested in the function.
The only name that has not been mentioned by any of the participants in the negotiations of the last days is that of the former leader of the branch, mayor Gheorghe Nichita.
The list of candidates is open.
According to the statute, including on the day of the elections may be submitted candidates, and would not wonder anyone if it would happen.
“It is important that we remain united, and we will remain after October 3, when we will have a new Executive Office, a new Permanent Court Office and all new leadership structures,” Câtea said.
Until the internal elections are held, the leadership of the county subsidiary of the PSD will be assured by Victorel Lupu, a neighbor of Nichita and Stanciu.
Lupu, however, is in vacation until September 29, the preparation for the elections is practically understood by the executive secretary of the branch, county counselor Mihail Popescu, who is in cold relations with the Nichita camp.
Contacted by telephone, Cristian Stanciu appreciated the talks of the last days as leading to "parcial consensus".
There is a wide availability to maintain balance and unity in the party.
It has reached a partial consensus, with the aim of supporting a united team to deal with the county.
"But on the other hand, there are several variations regarding the intentions related to the candidacy for the PSD Iasi presidency, the list remains open," Stanciu commented.
A foreign judge rejected the case of the rape in Vaslui on the grounds of concubination
The seven young people from the Vaslui county sentenced for rape arrives today at the Iasi Court of Appeal.
Those who were sentenced to five years to eight months and eight years and four months will present today their arguments on their release, after the main court, Judgment Vaslui, determined their imprisonment immediately after the judgment was sentenced.
The case was recorded at the Court of Appeal last week, the judge Dan Anton submitting a request for withdrawal, accepted by his colleagues.
Anton invoked the fact that one of the defendants, the lawyer Bogdan Luca, is the concubin of his daughter, the lawyer Dana Anton.
Luca defends Silviu Ovidiu Burda, who received the greatest punishment in this case.
The judges motivated the judgment.
Last week, the judge of the Vaslui Court, who condemned the seven young people, motivated the sentence.
In motivation, the judge speaks of the challenging reaction of the accused, but also of those who supported him, stressing that such attitudes create a strong feeling of indignation among the public opinion.
“The court finds that after the time of placing the preventive measure of judicial control, a restrictive measure of freedom but not deprivative of freedom, under the impact of the attitude of the accused, their families and local supporters, a strong feeling of indignation has been felt at the local and national level regarding the fact that persons accused of serious acts are judged under a less restrictive measure,” the judgment of the Vaslui Court states.
The judges also dismantled the main defense of the seven accused who during the trial invoked the fact that the girl they raped would not be "the church wipes".
“The court emphasizes that the moral quality of the injured person is irrelevant, the aspect that the accused wanted to highlight through the defences they formulated, as a person’s physical and sexual freedom cannot be infringed under any pretext,” the motivation said.
Corbyn, Brexit and the Future of Europe
Because of economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have in the last decades can no longer continue the same in the coming years.
Until Saturday, few people in Romania knew who Jeremy Corbyn was.
Even today, after he became the new leader of the UK Labour Party, many wonder how much the choice of a politician that, after all, is not in a decision-making position can affect us.
Jeremy Corbyn is the most radical leftist leader of the post-war Labourists.
Marxist declared, anti-monarchist (willed at a given time to Tony Blair, then Prime Minister, to remove the royal family from Buckingham Palace), a fierce anti-American and a sympathetic of Vladimir Putin (he was also regularly invited to comment on political events by the television channel "Russia Today"), and the terrorist movements of Hezbollah and Hamas, he wants Britain to give up its nuclear weapons and leave NATO and the EU.
For Corbyn, who at that time considered the assassination of Osama bin Laden a real tragedy, ISIS is close to preferred to the United States.
According to the model of all the populist demagogues, Corbyn has, of course, miraculous anti-austerity solutions.
Things like those he said and promised and Tsipras in Greece until he gave breasts with the real world and economic legitimacy.
The economic program of the new Labourist leader provides, among other things, for massive nationalizations and printing of money as a solution for financing development projects and covering very generous social benefits.
Certainly, some might wonder why the money printing solution is not unanimously adopted worldwide, we will then have a global prosperity!, but who to prevent such details.
Of course, we can give blood to the bankers, become a kind of service enemy of the left, but of what has been seen so many times in the past, not only in the former communist states or in Ecuador or Venezuela, but also in France, at the beginning of Mitterand and Hollande's mandates.
Additional amounts are quickly ingested by generous, uncovered promises made by popular demagogues.
As Margaret Thatcher well attracted attention, “the problem of socialism is that at some point the money of others ends.”
Few people give Jeremy Corbyn real chances of becoming a prime minister.
In the early 1980s another radical left-wing leader, Michael Foot, who was not as extreme in convictions as the fresh party leader, failed sadly in the elections.
And then there is still in the UK a working class, in the classical sense of the word, relatively consistent and structured.
And the trade unions were sensibly more influential than they are now.
Under the conditions of the new industrial landscape, in which services are dominant in the entire labour force, and extensive automation have made the industry a massive need for highly qualified labour, Corbyn's rhetoric has a limited appeal.
But even from the opposition, he can influence important developments that can directly affect us.
In his latest issue, the Financial Times believes that Corbyn’s election increases the chances of Brexit, the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
The new Labourist leader was a consistent opponent of the country’s membership in the Union.
In the eyes of the radical left, Brussels is the agent of international capitalism and a promoter of globalization that imposed the austerity of the poor.
When you combine this kind of ideas with those expressed by the radical right, with anti-immigration rhetoric and look at the refugee crisis that stumbles from the EU foundations you get to an explosive mixage.
Not just for the UK.
But if the British decide after the referendum, which is expected to take place by 2017, to leave the Union the symbolic loss of capital for the entire European project and the deep waves created within it by the Euro crisis and now therefore the refugees, between the north and the south, between the east and the west, leave room for the most worrying scenarios.
More than for a whole series of member states, London was a counterponder to the French-German axis (in which anyway Berlin becomes increasingly the dominant actor).
It is true, the British business environment, City, are strong lawyers of the country’s stay in the EU.
But today’s Europe is no longer the one of the past.
There are many regrets, which increase in intensity even in these weeks.
The problem is that Brussels, which we have even recently had a sample in Jean Clude Junker's speech, tends more and more to make major decisions over the head of the majority of Member States consulting with only a few European powers, mainly with Germany.
And this happens under the conditions where the electoral support for anti-system, anti-immigration formations that are at the same time and eurosceptic increases spectacularly throughout the continent.
In other words, the emotional climate with negative load has reached higher rates than ever in the past.
What is the conclusion that the Financial Times draws when evaluating the chances of Brexit?
The pro-EU option is based on a cold calculation that leads from the national interest.
If the voters make the brain decision, then the UK will remain in the EU.
But Corbyn's victory reminds us of the power of emotion in current politics.
However, Eastern Europe can be significantly affected by such major developments.
Especially if, as expected, we will assist to a stronger integration of the Eurozone, which will push most of the countries in the region and to the periphery of interest and to that of the decision-making process in Europe.
Corbyn, Tsipras and Syriza in Greece, Podemos in Spain, even Bernie Sanders in the United States feed their populist rhetoric from the frustrations accumulated in the western societies.
Because of economic and demographic reasons, the prosperity they have in the last decades, the generous social benefits, can no longer continue the same in the coming years.
Under the explosive pressure of the dual crisis, the Euro-immigration zone, both provoked by untouched decisions that have only taken into account the political ambitions of integration, not the capacity and willingness of the peoples and governments in Europe to respond to such challenges, the turbulence on the continent, the internal tensions in the EU will increase in intensity and may greatly affect the situation of Romania.
And it’s hard to exclude something from the point of view of possible scenarios.
The question is whether our main political leaders are able to cope with such complicated situations.
Constantine Brâncuși, the god of the farmer.
Rockefeller: “How can I help you?”
He said, “Take the workshop!”
The great sculptor had a great dream: to be someone, to become famous, to hear about him all over the world.
But behind his fame is something almost forgotten today, when millions of success stories are delivered to us, recipes for success in life.
It also has a name.
It is called “work”.
What to write about Constantin Brâncuși?
What else to say, in fact?
His figure appeared on the banknotes.
And, recently, a well-known bank in Romania has employed an actor to play him in a advertising clip.
Cheeseburger has produced and delivered money for almost 60 years since he is no longer among us.
In Romania, there are hundreds of streets and bulevards that carry their name.
Otherwise, even the author of this text lives on one of these streets.
And when he comes out with the grocery, he hears the following instructions: "We go to the park, to Brâncuși."
The land is covered by its statues.
There are few Romanian personalities whose works are known to so many people, from children to elderly.
The infiltration capacity of Brâncuși is enormous.
Neither the communists managed to remove him from the memory and culture of Romania.
His quotes today divide the internet, receiving hundreds of thousands of likes and shares.
And then, again, what else would be to say, to write about this man?
Looking out of the crowd of books and articles trying to reconstruct his fate, Brâncuși's life seems almost fantastic, totally unlikely.
You know, there are those people who tell you that if you didn’t have the luck to be born in a big city and in a family as old, your chances of success in life are almost zero.
The life of Brâncuşi is the perfect counterexample.
Maybe there is a key.
This is where the following text should begin.
With a sentence, no matter how disgusting they are.
Look at the crete success stories, which are delivered to you daily in the newspapers and on TV.
Look carefully at the figure of this man.
Do you want to know how to succeed in life, how, today, he has heard of a whole mapamond?
It is simple.
He worked all his life to be someone.
That he did.
Constantin Brâncuși was born on February 19, 1876, in Hobița, a small village in the municipality of Peștișani, the county of Gorj, at the foot of the Carpathians.
He is the fifth child of Maria and Radu Nicolae Brâncuși.
Although it came from a family of outdated peasants, Brâncuși lives a modest life, but one of which he had to pick up his reefs that will guide his late artistic vision.
Reminding of his childhood and the places in which he grew up, the artist had to testify, at a meeting with Peter Tsuta, from Paris, in 1933: "At that time, life was beautiful and harmonious."
For thousands of years, people lived, happy, a patriarchal life.
Everything passed quietly from one season to another.
Do you know why things have changed?
The civilization of the great city has reached us.
But his childhood was far from an idyllic.
One of the moments spent in these early years of life is extremely suggestive for the combination of purity and violence that characterized the future sculptor the years spent in the native town.
The moment is reproduced in the work "Brâncuși. A biography", written by Alexandru Buican.
In 1879, Constantin Brâncuși was 3 years old.
In the autumn of that year, when the tube was made "to the box", watching those who taste the liquid to see if the process is running properly, Brâncuși catches a moment of general negligence.
He fills his palm boil with tube and drinks on unhealthy.
He falls in sleep almost instantly.
The first people notice only after a few minutes.
The mother is in panic, then in hysteria, believing that her son is dead.
In the evening, when the father, Radu, returns from life accompanied by praise, he sees from a distance the desperate signs of those who are waiting for him with his soul to his mouth.
The party immediately turns into jealousy.
My father is thinking about burial.
However, someone finds that it is good to call Baba Brandoşa, the doctora and servant of the Brandoffs.
The brunch checks the baby's breath, then puts him under the nose a horse ball, gathered from the surrounding area.
The child strikes strongly.
The world appludes.
While the boy is left to sleep further the drink, the joy, the celebration of praises continues with even more strength.
The next day, father and son meet through the livade.
Radu Brâncuși puts Constantin to gather some nuts and bring them to him.
The father sits his child with his head down and, with the kid's nails, beat him to keep in mind.
And, while he feels the sharpness of the strikes, the little Corn has the revelation that the world can be seen from another perspective and that things around can appear reversed.
Especially the position of the sun, different from the well-known, makes him wonder, as he should recognize at old age, if not somehow the star himself participates in his disorder.
The sun would have been as troubled as his father by what had happened to him.
Currently, the city does not work.
A parliamentary calls on politicians to remember those who voted for them.
Independent deputy Viorel Blăjuț called on the PSD and PNL to stop internal struggles and reorient their agenda towards the electorate.
What we see now on our political scene is a big breakdown and so on.
I have not seen any of the USL projects from 2012 to continue.
Neither the highway nor the Regional Emergency Hospital, you just see how politicians disput their possible locations according to real estate interests.
Let us leave a little away from politics, get together and talk.
At this time, the city does not work.
“If you’re busy with the internal war, you don’t have time for those who chose you,” Blăjuţ said.
He estimated that the current political class disappointed the outgoing electorate, resulting in a very reduced presence in the upcoming local elections, around the figure of 30%, representing practically the faithful electorate of the parties.
The deputy also believes that the voters will all be oriented towards traditional parties, expressing their reservation to new political initiatives, as is the “For Iasi” party that will be launched today.
Local parties have very little chances and will only break out of the right electorate, not of the PSD.
Such parties are based on civically active people, who are usually right-wing.
“The right is getting more dirty, which is not good for no one, nor for the PSD,” Blăjuţ said.
He said he was not interested in a candidacy for the upcoming local elections, denying the rumors about his intention to join the competition for the Municipality.
I said I don’t want to be a candidate for any local office.
I am still thinking if I will continue to be a member in the next term.
I tried to call for unity for Iasi and in the talks on the halls, with other parliamentarians, and I was accused of wanting to make a picture of me.
I don’t want, but I can’t continue so anymore.
"If people have voted for us, it doesn't mean they're foolish to vote for us if they don't see anything," Blăjuț said, who appreciated that the main reason why the electorate is no longer interested in politics is the hypocrisy of the elected.
A friend said he didn’t get the money and he had to go by bus.
Let us not be hypocrites.
There are not little money.
Sometimes I’m ashamed to get the money out of the box.
At the end of my term, I will report on everything I spent, except the salaries of the staff and the maintenance of the office.
It happened to rise in a month and 30,000 lei, with all the transport, accommodation and the rest.
“To tell a parliamentary person that he doesn’t get his money is pure hypocrisy,” Blăjuţ concluded.
