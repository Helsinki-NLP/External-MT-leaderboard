This not only confirms the fact that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot, such as their colors and three-dimensional arrangements.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was brown-brown on top with a pale underside or carotenoid color.
The discovery also provides a first-hand look at the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers do not have a highly developed structure, called rachis, but instead have other feather traits - barbels and barbels - researchers have deduced that rachis was probably an evolutionary development later than these other traits.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but for temperature regulation or visualization. The researchers suggested that, although it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the scapulon shows an adult plumage and not a chick.
Researchers have suggested that, although it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the scapulone shows adult plumage and no feathers of chickens.
A car bomb exploded at police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey early on Monday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than 20 others.
The governor's office stated that nineteen of the injured persons were police officers.
Police said they suspected an alleged Daesh militant of being responsible for the attack.
They found that the Sun functioned according to the same basic principles as the other stars: It was discovered that the activity of all the stars in the system was conditioned by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing more.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine a star's Rossby number, which is related to the plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to magnetic inversions.

The work was essentially theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal force between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way also exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around a galaxy in a kind of corona, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered the highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have contracted the virus at the hospital, Dr. Moll thinks, and at least two of them were healthcare workers at the hospital.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a sheet of pre-printed paper indicating the candidate they have chosen in an envelope.
After verification by the officials of the voter's identity, the voter drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the list of electors.
French electoral law codifies rather strict procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelope was present at the start of the voting and that no envelope was added without those of the duly numbered and authorized electors.
Candidates may send representatives to witness the proceedings. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy supervision, following specific procedures.

Four female skiers failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
Madhya Pradesh police recovered the stolen mobile phone and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya stated, "We have arrested five persons who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop".
The accused are designated under the names Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car struck it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged at Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of his son.
She is detained pending her indictment and trial, but any evidence of eyewitness testimony can be vitiated by the fact that her image has been widely published.
It is a common practice elsewhere in the United Kingdom but the Scottish justice system operates differently and courts have seen the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee remarks "journalists really seem to be walking a dangerous line if they post photos etc of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is generally concerned with actions in court, has advised the journalists that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the newspaper, will address the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on those before the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that would have been discussed included the future status of Jerusalem as sacred to both nations and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years unless an agreement is signed while the PA agrees to leave such a presence only for five years.
The shooters of the supplemental test for control of the nesting populations were to be closely monitored by the guards, provided that the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
As part of a partnership between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers have been recruited for the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of conservation and park heritage with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP) yesterday.
It is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures that will lead the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread demonstrations against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent demonstrations were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some due as early as 2011.
About 60 cases of overheating from malfunctioning iPods were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had been notified of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (9:19 p.m. GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Bureau stated that no damage had been reported in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to go to the Commons. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital Liggins began to study premature labor in his spare time.
His research showed that if a hormone was administered it would accelerate the fetal lung of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black box' recorders from a flight on Wednesday.
The wrestling colleagues also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said "Luna was the first queen of Extreme. My first nanny. Luna crossed the night of the two moons. She's truly unique just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Moon was as troubled as I am... perhaps more so... I love him and will miss him... I hope he is in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people polled before the 2010 federal election, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic have increased by 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard has recalled during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those polled share this view, wanting Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the end of the poll, 29 percent of respondents believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent of them believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim in the 100 and 200 m freestyle and triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to her flaws, her fitness has been called into question.
He has been unable to take the medication needed to relieve his pain since it was banned by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri has discovered the largest prime number to date, the genius number 25.
The discovery was verified by several people using computer hardware and software since early February and was announced Tuesday.
Comets may have been the source of the water supply to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly how the Earth formed, since comets have collided with the Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "political blah blah blah and stupidity".
He speculates that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow airplanes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older technology based on ground-based radars to allow air traffic controllers to determine the position of an aircraft with greater accuracy and to give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is provided and surface trains will not stop at Wembley and parking and relay parking facilities are unavailable on the ground.
The fear of a shortage of transportation raised the possibility that he would be forced to play the game at closed doors without the support of the team's fans.
A study published today in the journal Science reports the formation of a new species of bird on the equatorial islands of the Galapagos.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that this process took longer, due to the breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
You can work gold into all sorts of shapes. You can roll it into tiny little shapes.
It can be pulled to become a fine wire, which can be twisted and cut. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and embedded in another metal. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate illustrations hand painted in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
It's called chemical pH. You can make an indicator using red clover juice.
The juice of the beets changes color depending on the degree of acidity or base (alkaline) of the chemical product.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical product tested.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their protons taken from them (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix both dry powders together and then, with clean and damp hands, knead them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will make you feel strange and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had common water mains in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated roof system.
Remains of roof systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also communes in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, the common was sometimes a part of public bath houses where men and women were gathered in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back to Earth, almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere shapes some of our light and vision.
It uses a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to lift a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel has done for us is to give us a much easier and faster means of transportation.
We have taken the train, the car, and many other means of transportation.
Below them are smaller cats that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including domestic stray cats) that eat the most numerous small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success is the concept of the caplet, a special job that each cat has and avoids entering into competition with the others.
Lions are the most social of the felines, living in large, tight-knit groups.
Lion herds are composed of one to three adult males of the same family, together with as many as thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds act like wolf packs or cubs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other felines) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-trained athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances and do a traction five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the lion's loud roar, but more like a phrase of unspoken and unspoken words.
Ocelots prefer to eat small animals, and they can, and will, eat monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Most of the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals to eat (trap) by their scent, narrating where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and also move very furtively. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they came (such as by crossing a mountain range or a river, or by moving to a new island in such a way that they cannot easily return) they often find themselves in a different environment than they were before.
This new environment has different resources and rivals, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than they needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, and still requires the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after billions or even millions of years, both populations will appear so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Specialization is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants draw their nutrients from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our homes from plants and we make our clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is from plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
The mosasaur was the most important predator of its time, and so was not afraid of anything except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an extra jawbone in the roof of its mouth, meaning it had no escape from anything that crossed its path.
It is not known with certainty, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other rodents, and it may have been a cannibal.
It also attacked everything in the water; even a giant dinosaur like T. rex was not made to weigh against it.
And while most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual celebration elements, which included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called a miser.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate their food while seated on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they were spread out on the side while eating their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not have been made up of foods that would have been brought to Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a meal.
The Babylonians built for each of their gods a main temple that was considered to be the home of the god.
People would bring sacrifices to the gods and priests would try to provide for the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramidal towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the host was not so important.
Most of the Jewish family's life was spent outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; shops were only open planks that faced the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
There were no major forests in the land of Canaan, and so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was colonized only briefly. It is told in the Norse sagas that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, when he traveled further west, found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But beyond its discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you probably know that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, it is not true, and even if there is some writing on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776". The text appears at the bottom of the document, on the reverse.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in his life, this large document and parchment (measuring 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for safekeeping.
Thus, it is likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings, and the subsequent battles, had liberated the north of France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the French of "Vichy". They were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and were working with the invaders rather than fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was named "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, American forces and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, a relative of the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also defines in some ways the dimension of society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilizational culture involves the passing of knowledge over several generations, a persistent cultural weight, and an equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving important historical evidence and are not recognized as civilizations in their own right.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time - with Congress as its only constituent body - in violation of the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and, as it had no national executive or judicial power, it relied on state authorities, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its decisions.
There was also no authority to override tax laws and tariffs between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all the states before they could be amended and the states took over the central government so easily that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team, along with the Germany national football team, is the second most successful national football team in the world and were the 2006 FIFA World Cup champions.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world.
Because of the number of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called, from a geographical point of view, an "archipelago"
The origins of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when passing European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Polished Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in native grain production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Chamber of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the sides of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of still image photography in the entire world is 35mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its aspect ratio has been inherited by the image-capture formats of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually, somewhat surprisingly, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (by multiplying by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is wildly abused and often ridiculed, is a simple guide that creates dynamism while preserving a measure of order in an image.
He states that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, was subject to intense scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion had bound the European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone from the king to the villain.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are specifically for this purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money had led many to question whether this principle was being respected.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain launched a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified by various international agreements over the last two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent all vessels from penetrating entire sections of the ocean, causing further danger to neutral vessels.
Although there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his patron in his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods of time; each stage of China or each ruling family represented a distinct dynasty.
There was also a period of unstable divided provinces between each dynasty, the most notable of which was the Three Kingdoms period that lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods a fierce war was fought between many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, as thousands of people died fighting for the highest seat in the great palace at Xian.
There were many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belonged to the people and not to a single ruler.
Even after the Revolution, the professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and brilliant to succeed.
It is the same for the military because instead of having army ranks based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people from the repressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Maomet was deeply interested in matters beyond this mundane life. He used to attend a ball that became known as "Hira" on the Mountain of "Noor" (the light) for contemplation.
The poem itself, which has survived the test of time, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Perched on top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find, and even if one knew it existed, once inside the pond, it is a total isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful round sky and the many surrounding mountains. Not much of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that is still standing today.
Constructed by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramidal structures built to honor the late pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Dead contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu and many of the pyramids, tombs and smaller temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "high arquet" mark looks like a V and the "low arquet" mark looks like a graph or a square that lacks a background.
Up means you should start punching and throwing the bow, and down means you should start lifting (where your hand holds the bow) and pulling the bow.
A high arch usually produces a softer sound, while a low arch is louder and more assertive.
You should feel free to make your own mark with a fretboard, but remember that the markings are there for a musical reason, so they should be generally respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, 11 and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, on 6 October 1789 were sent back from Versailles to Paris by a crowd of market women.
They returned to Paris in a coach surrounded by a horde of people who shouted and shouted threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to have the backs of their chariots completely open.
In an instant a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in the face of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were obligated to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to pay back a large portion of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Certainly, the superprofits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Philippines would constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The period during which these events took place is commonly known as the High Middle Ages the period of European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from the technological imperative or technological imperative to a strict sense that the fate of man is driven by a logic of underpinning associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two broad ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes well beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be argued that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a network of national routes is not economically viable for just a handful of cars, and so new methods of production are developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new sleep techniques to repair bodily injuries.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture related to that geography emerged, and these, being in harmony with the place of society, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
In the same way that Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was perceived as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that the crusaders were returning with gifts such as silk and spices that were of more value than what the Byzantine merchants offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris was made.
Gothic literature was at its peak during the period from the 10th to the 14th centuries.
Early dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication channels, styles in the west could resonate within 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of this era was the use of buttons to secure clothing as a result of the crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is based on the production of sufficient food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological, system using stored seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically many peasants were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinct because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership through a distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which may include fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most frequently used methods to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw inspiration from the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, maltreatment or deliberate abuse, were not socialized by adults during the time they were growing up.
Children are thus called "wild" or "wild". Some wild children have been confined by persons (usually the parents themselves); in some cases, this abandonment of children was due to the parents' rejection of a child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
It is possible that the wild children had suffered violence or severe trauma during their childhood before being abandoned or escaped.
Some others are believed to have been abducted by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild alone.
When fully subjugated by nonhuman animals, the feral child manifests behaviors (within its physical limits) almost completely similar to those of the particular animal adopting the animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to be the easiest and most interesting way to learn, the challenge goes a step further.
Empont is not a learning method but rather an aid that provides support to individuals experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Slides can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of a slide but this is also the case for the trombone man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual environments are internalized within the logical and have the function of questioning, prompting, and explaining processes that may have been too complex for the student to manipulate alone.
Children are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons ranging from neglect, abuse, and extortion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but they do.
We see the foster care system as a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, caring staff, a stable education, and reliable health care.
Host families are supposed to provide all the necessities that were missing in the home from which they were taken previously.
The Internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of Internat lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and benefits.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continued relationships have also been identified as new aspects of motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when studying audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can detect a person's lying by interpreting his microexpressions correctly.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, showed how people who were unable to understand speech because of brain damage were nevertheless able to accurately estimate sincerity.
It also suggests that some of the capacities of interpreting human behavior may be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reservoir of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination combine the two-way variation between both reservoirs at each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans to meet its needs for amino acids from the resources available in plants.
In addition, failure to do so has serious consequences: stunting of growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the accessible proteins in leaves and vegetables, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ant, rats, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in some measure in the same way that chimpanzees do in the savannah today.
Sleep interruption is the process of deliberately waking up during your normal sleep period and falling asleep a little later (10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively discreet wake-up call to bring you to consciousness without waking you completely.
If you find yourself rebooting the alarm while you sleep, it may be placed on the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed to shut it off.
Other options based on the biorhythm involve drinking a lot of fluids (particularly water or tea, a known diuretic) before sleep, which requires getting up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that a person has is in correlation in a way opposite to the amount of tension of the body and the spirit.
Where the tension is low, where the life force is positive, all people have the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing standing in the way of achieving enlightenment is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they were spread by the Mahayana path of love and by the technical forces of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It consists of kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of universal love.
With kundalini yoga the kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The focus of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity. Through visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleared, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. Since the end of the war, the confrontation of systems, processes and culture has led to a break between these countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It was to last for the next 40 years and would be fought in depth, with proxy armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts following the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport products is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and products across the oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains its ability to move its people and its goods, and at the same time interfere with your enemy's ability to move its people and its goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which the Americans attempted to move men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which used mostly U-boats, was trying to stop this movement.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it had done with the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated for the first time around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for easy access to milk, furs, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goats, often children or adolescents, similar to the more commonly known shepherds. These pastoral methods are still employed today.
Hypomobil railways were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the hypomobile railways consisted simply of parallel wooden posts, they allowed the pulling horses to reach higher speeds and to pull larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
The tracks were introduced at an early stage to keep the rails in place, but it was realised that the tracks would be more effective if there was a railway over them.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railways were introduced.
The earliest known means of transportation was walking, humans began walking in an upright position two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (meaning "Erect Man").
In their ancestry, australopithecines did not walk upright as they usually do.
Two-legged specialization is found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living more respectfully for the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can stop being activists in order to reduce future suffering to some degree.
It is not only a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we are only looking for a temporary solution, then we should find the root of the problems, and we should deactivate them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed greatly because of the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and the problems have become bigger because of the overpopulation and extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After its adoption by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing office.
During the night between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Leaves".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of these was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July, and a copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and are alive today.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many causes of birds that go back to the dinosaurs.
They have flat feet with hooves and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Virtually all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have no more than one of two values, such as 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits - or bits, in computer jargon.
It is possible that internal poisoning is not immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of an internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medications or toxic chemicals in the house.
You should check the label for specific first aid instructions for this specific poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term derives from an ancient familiarity with centipedes, which are insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
The male and female killer whales are both nest-dwellers, adapted to live in a nest or the housing of their host.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the dominant neurological disease in younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the nervous system, which is composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interests, or in the best interests of their child, to have a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their infant.
In an adoption, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can become parents to the child.
The primary goal of science is to discover the way the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
However, there is more to experimentation, and an experiment is a test that is used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, ask questions, and make observations. Experimentation also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on the classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented by most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a period of cycling in free-running and even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments marking either the DNA in the phage with a radioactive phosphorus or the protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the amount of genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ line cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of taking advantage of the landscape, including its flora and fauna.
Examples of field activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph, and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small rural villages in cars to go to their workplace and are passed by others whose work destination is the place from which they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle everyone is somehow connected with, and supports, a transport system based on private cars.
Science indicates that this massive carbon economy has stripped the biosphere of one of the stable states that has sustained human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about the quality of water or flooded bridges.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they not function properly on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental wrong?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual conductors and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, the study of traffic flow is difficult since the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with a hundred percent certainty.
For example, conductors tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; whereas circulation currents tend to have a certain consistency and can be represented mathematically in an approximate manner.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of the road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape their enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small dimples to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and moths.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right but many people believed otherwise; that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and the other stars).
That seems odd, because it doesn't seem like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the first largest river on Earth. It carries more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, at some six kilometres (3.7 mi) wide.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and technical excellence of construction.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were much older than a thousand years.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people, making it the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language of everyday life for most of those working in the state while Latin is often employed in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, as they are all found in nature in their native forms and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. They were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, and it was also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered to be metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
There may also be alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly tiny that trillions of them could fit in the punch at the end of this sentence.
And so, the gredon was a good friend to many people when it appeared.
Sadly, with the advent of new writing methods, the gredon has been relegated to a lesser status and employment.
People now write messages on computers or computer screens, without ever having to worry about a thief.
One can only ask for the keyboard when someone new arrives.
The fission bomb works on the principle that it takes energy to knock together a nucleus and strong protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like rolling a heavy truck up a hill, and then breaking the core again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they tend to separate with a small jump or even less.
The Moon's surface is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the opposite side.
It is thinner under the sea and thicker in the highlands.
There may be more mares on the near side because the crust is thinner, and it is easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what people choose or what is of interest to them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized from the time they mature into adulthood.
These theories examine what is it about certain people that makes them envy the things they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Hertzberg's two factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when managers start bringing in their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is to try to remain "one of the guys" (or the girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, exercising disciplinary actions, performance reviews, assigning responsibilities and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, another becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he or she must change everything the team has done and take ownership of it.
Ultimately, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of his team.
This behavior often results in friction between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of a virtual team often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members since their teams can meet in varying time zones that may not be covered by their local administration.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization want to go through the laborious process of building a learning organization? Innovation is one of the goals when implementing organizational learning concepts.
When all available resources are effectively used across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a novel innovative process to serve the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and both shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuity approach as a method that is employed to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, thus limiting the scope of research and making it more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior validates the research of scientists.
It has long been known that different types of brain injury, trauma, injury, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a wealth of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves building machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and face recognition.
Such issues have developed into separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to the real problems of everyday life.
The AI system is now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, having been built into various computer applications and home video games.
Field trips are an important part of all classes. Often a teacher would like to take his students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual tours, where students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire fine art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a field trip virtually is also an excellent way to plan an outing and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capitol, and each year the website is remodeled, but older versions are kept online for album purposes.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often begin their blogging experience with a poorly-understood grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger begins to make a good effort to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
Blogging "compels students to become more aware of the world around them".[24] The need to nurture public interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Using a blog is a tool that inspires collaboration, and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs "can stimulate students to become more analytical and critical; through active responses to Internet material, students can define their own positions in the context of other's writings as well as to enhance their own perspectives on particular topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's vibrant bilingual capital and has a good array of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls is found much further south and the north is the region of unexplored natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more have put Ontario on a high note in what is considered to be the quintessential Canadian forests.
The larger expanses further north are rather sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness regions.
To make a population comparison that involves many people: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent alone in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the territories, and it was established to a large extent in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began during the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Europe's route to India.
The region is bounded to the north by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
For women: It is recommended that all female travelers state that they are married, regardless of actual marital status.
It is also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive.
Females should realize that cultural differences can result in what they may consider harassment and it is not unusual to be followed, held by the arm, etc.
You have to be firm when you reject men, and don't be afraid to defend the territory (cultural differences or not, that's not normal!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen during the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Meronids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1775.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and Spanish merchants who had established trading bases there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina it is easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tajinas, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of dachas, but it is all for the tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east coast of Rwanda.
In 2002 Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano which buried most of the city streets, particularly the city centre.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside Goma should be studied to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in the province of North Kivu.
The town is also the base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano along with some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracks in Africa.
A boda-boda (a motorcycle taxi) can be used to make the Goma round trip. The normal (local) fare is ~500 CFA for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timboctó" has come to be employed as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a small town, although its reputation as a tourist attraction is not as well established, as an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sand dunes.
It was one of the main stages during Henry Louis Gates's Wonder of the African World special broadcast on PBS.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has a more Arabic than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers 19,500 km2 (11,650 sq mi) and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all national parks in South Africa, there are daily conservation and entry fees for the park.
It can also be advantageous for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides entry to either selections of parks in South Africa or all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider as its main attraction.
The parade of buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline has been likened to a glittering bar chart made apparent by the presence of Victoria Harbour's tides.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront in the opposite direction.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is densely packed on reclaimed land along the north shore.
This is the spot that the British colonists took as their own and so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest belt of coastal mangrove in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) into the Bangladeshi and Indian backwaters from the coast.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest inside Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not only mangrove swamps but also comprise some of the last remaining parcels of the mighty forests that once covered the Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water or swamps.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer herds in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) during the day, although most, particularly those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese Coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and convenient means of travel to nearby places, such as Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two 3.50 metres wide aisles.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft). The bridge was completed in August 2011, but not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017 when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups such as the Guaycuros and Payaguas, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
During the 16th century Paraguay, which was formerly called "the giant Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of the Spanish conquerors with the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best teams and players in the entire world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To get updates on the tournaments and to know where to buy tickets for the polo matches, visit Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Maldives is the Malvinas Pound (FKP) which is equal in value to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the islands' only bank which is located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands and inside Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also widely accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards will probably not be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted; check with the owners in advance to determine what is an acceptable method of payment.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
As Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; during the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are common.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity combine to make you feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the fauna is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or domesticated.
According to park officials, you should stay at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they appear, bison, walruses, oryx, bears, and almost any other large animal can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep an adequate distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Also, be aware that the odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking unhealthy foods and keep a clean field.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of an infamous naval confrontation in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city resulted in the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland is located between two harbours. The most popular are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch as far north as Long Bay and as far south as Devonport.
Most are sandy beaches where it is safe to swim, and most have sun shade provided by the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are family beaches sometimes very busy with a good range of shops lined up on the coast.
The main local beer is 'Number One', it is not a complex beer, but it is pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines to choose from, but the wines from New Zealand and Australia may travel better.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water is a good thing to have if you have any beliefs.
For Australians, the concept of flat white coffee is foreign. A short black coffee is an espresso, the cappuccino comes well creamed (no foam), and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the falls are made throughout the year, and accidents due to these causes on the falls are rare.
However, you should take the advice of the authorities, respect all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and near river estuaries from October to April to the north of 1770.
Lemmas exist in the wild, but rarely attack humans. Most lemmas are afraid of humans and would flee by swimming.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat being in the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that they will have a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other forms of accommodation, such as camping grounds, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to and from the airport or several packages that combine flights with the hotel.
You can also keep the reservation if you need time to think about the proposal or to get other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any such changes or requests should be notified through the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of festival-goers choose to camp on site, and most festival-goers consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action you will have to get up early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even if the music on the main stages may have ended, there may be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you are crossing the North Baltic in winter, you should check the location of the cabin, as crossing the ice causes a terrible noise for the most affected people.
Cruise ships in St. Petersburg include time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check conditions).
Casinos typically make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be hard to find.
Annually they have special meals and drinks and entertainment propositions, to keep the guests in good spirits, and to keep them in their place.
Some establishments serve alcoholic beverages instead. However, the drunkenness alters the judgment and all good players know that it is important to stay sober.
Those who are able to drive in high latitudes or on mountain slopes should consider the possibility of encountering snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is weak and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, enough snow to immobilize you can fall in a very short time.
Visibility may also be restricted by falling or wind-borne snow, condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and are the stronghold for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to trips by land to observe the magnificent African wildlife, particularly the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to move closer to cars and standard equipment will allow for close observation.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and are best seen with twins.
A walking safari (also called a " bushwalk", "excursion safari", or "footing") consists of walking, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021, with some events taking place in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you have booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the report, you may have a problem.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation policies do not expire until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets for the competitions will cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Many hotels have a laundry and washing stations available for borrowing, even if there are no presents in the room.
If a sanding iron is not available or you have little desire to wear sanded pipes, then you may try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Care should be taken not to allow the fabric to become too hot (which can cause deformation, or in extreme cases, burning of the fabric).
There are different ways of purifying water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some places boiling water for a minute is sufficient, in others several minutes are required.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have one, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter some unfamiliar animals in their home regions.
Noxious animals can spoil food, cause irritation or, in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread venom or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people forcibly, do not fall into the category of noxious causes.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy duty-free products and special taxes in certain areas.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, particularly on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The expanse between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, frequently passing through isolated patches of pine forest.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep a calm mind: steep ski slopes, narrow roads and sharp turns predominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections  frequently 35 to 40 miles per hour (56 to 64 km/h)  and strict adherence to them is even more important than otherwise.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than in many other portions of the route, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cuisine is very good, and in Bavaria, it is very rich and varied, similar to that of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruits in the pastry are plentiful, with apples being cooked in pans all year, and cherries and plums making their appearance during the summer.
Many German-produced baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are especially well-harmonized with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but rich pastries, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on aromatic herbs and spices, accompanied by either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the proportion of liquid.
In the interior regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, it is coconut milk that is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian gastronomy is a catch-all term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found across the nation.
However, when used without qualification, the term tends to mean the food that is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine is a variety of plainly seasoned dishes, the predominant flavors favored by Javanese are cocoa, peppers, sugar (particularly coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang from either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability to the rider but can create safety concerns because of the potential for the rider's feet to get caught.
If a rider escapes from a horse but has one foot caught in the stirrups, he may be shot if the horse runs away. To minimize this risk, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a soft, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly the English saddles, have safety bars that allow a cowhide to fall off the saddle if he is pulled back by a falling rider.
La Val de Cochamó - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and caverns.
The peaks offer impressive views from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world continually establish new routes between its infinite potential walls.
Downhill snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding down snow on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski vagabonds", who plan whole ski-centered vacations in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old  cave paintings depicting skiers date back as far as 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and, in 1861, the first ski club for recreational skiing was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called skiing, skiing, or skiing.
It is related but usually not included are alpine-style skiing excursions or alpinism, the latter being done on rough terrain and requiring more rigid skis and boots.
You have to think of the skiing route as a similar excursion route.
In good conditions you can cover relatively greater distances than walking but very rarely will you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy bag on damaged tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport controls many times.
The Schengen area, however, functions to a certain extent like a country in this case.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control again.
Similarly, when you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member countries separately, and thus save time, money and administrative formalities.
There is no universal definition of what manufactured objects are antiques, and some tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
This definition is subject to geographical variations, as the age limit may be lower in places such as North America than in Europe.
Craft products may be defined as antiques, even though they are more recent than similar mass-produced products.
Reindeer husbandry is an important source of resources for the Sami and the culture surrounding trade is important to many other professions as well.
More traditionally, not all Sami participated in the large-scale reindeer herding, but they lived off of fishing, hunting and the like, keeping reindeer primarily as game.
Today many Sami people work in modern trades. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sami country.
Although commonly used, particularly among non-Roma, the word "gypsy" is often considered offensive due to its associations with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel advice, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You may also want to consult the advice of governments that are not your own, but whose advice is designed for citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with situations different from those of Europeans or Arabs.
Travel advice is simply a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and oversimplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Inclement weather is the generic term for any weather phenomenon that has the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Inclement weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different forms, which may depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are all forms and effects of inclement weather, as are tornadoes, hurricanes, tornadoes, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal severe weather events include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of all the risks of severe weather that may affect their area as it may affect all their travel plans.
Those planning to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should follow professional training.
An Internet search for 'hostile environment course' will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course must normally address all of the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with some practical experience.
A course will normally last between 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing, many elements of first sounds and sometimes a weapons drill.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are common, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.
Travellers planning to undergo sex reassignment surgery abroad should ensure they carry valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with the gender not indicated (X) or updated documents to correspond to a desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is simply variable everywhere.
The breaches at security checkpoints have also become much more intrusive after September 11, 2001.
Preoperative transgender people should not expect to pass through the screens with their privacy and dignity intact.
The headwaters are the reflux of the tides that rise from the beach, often at a shore or nearby.
Because of the undersea topology the return flow is concentrated in a few deep sections, and a fast current towards the deep waters can be formed.
Most deaths occur as a result of fatigue from attempting to swim to shore against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, getting back in the water is no more difficult than it normally would be.
Try to head somewhere where you won't be caught again or, depending on your abilities and if you've been spotted, you may want to wait for rescue.
Back shock occurs earlier than culture shock (and is less than a honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had an easy time adjusting to their new culture sometimes have particularly difficult times adjusting back to their culture of origin.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and have lost some of the habits of your culture of origin.
When you first went to a foreign country, people were likely to be patient and understanding, knowing that travellers in a new country need to adapt.
It is possible that people do not anticipate that patience and understanding are also required for travelers returning to their homes.
The sound and light show is one of the area's most interesting things for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
Usually you hear the sound of tourists and vendors for a long time. The history of sounds and lights is just like a book of stories.
The Sphinx serves as both a backdrop and narrator to a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km (75 mi) north of the mainland, the largest of which is King George Island with the village of Villa Las Estrellas.
Others include Livingston Island, and Deception, whose flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region to the south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula melt into the plateau, then re-emerge to form the Ellsworth Mountains, cut in half by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part or Sentinel Range is the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which culminates at 4,892 m (18,030 ft) from Mount Vinson.
In remote areas, without mobile coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you must be outside with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require data and voice.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to take a gap year is to travel to learn.
It is particularly popular with school leavers, as it allows them to take a sabbatical year before university, without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling for a sabbatical year in studies abroad can actually improve your chances of entering higher education once you return to your home country.
There are generally tuition fees to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" has thousands of islands as well, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
In the archipelagos and lakes you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are effectively too large for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is the case in Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but it is otherwise quite unique (for example in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic Cruises include a long stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a couple of full days and sleep on the boat again at night.
If you go ashore only as part of the ship's excursions you will not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not even close to the sea and a tour of the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and all conditions, particularly if they have not flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and aversions of other things that most people have.
For some, understanding something about how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or being unable to control anything.
Courier companies are highly paid to deliver things quickly. Often, time is of the essence for business papers, merchandise or spare parts for an emergency repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and smaller companies there is a problem.
If goods are sent by air freight, on some routes, it may take days to go through the unloading stages and customs.
The only way to make it go faster was to send it as baggage in the suitcase. Airline regulations will not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger, which is where it's bound.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a fair amount of money for this privilege (or, even better, to have your company do it for you).
However, it is not a good market: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal price in economy class for business class and eleven times for first class!
In general, there is no point in seeking reductions for business class or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain core group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of dollars for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and are billed accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member states.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two Moldovan parties despite the failure of political negotiations.
The dominant religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city with a population of about 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a major transportation hub.
Formerly the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed and busy center of commercial operations, set around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-faced buildings and modern shopping centres are studded with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market and the old mosques and churches, but the city has a more Mediterranean European atmosphere than traditional Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Eysturoy and an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery, there are interesting sculptures of marble doves on some of the graves.
It's worth a half-hour walk through this strange village.
To the north and easily accessible is the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra which was made famous by outsiders after a lavish account of its splendor documented by Lord Byron.
Scotturb Bus 403 travels regularly to Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north also you should visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (holy place), a place of world famous Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are visiting primarily a site of mass graves and also a site that holds almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or who worked there to death, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves. Don't make any jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not degrade the site by writing or graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, a vast majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the panels are only indicated in Catalan because it is established by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disturbances are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
Although it is often only an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get laid in Paris is still to prove your best behavior, by acting like someone who is "bien élevé". This will make it considerably easier for you to get laid.
The abrupt exteriors of Parisians will quickly evaporate if you make a few basic courtesies.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily forested, mainly with beech, pike and oak trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkably wide variety of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils and varying levels of altitude.
The forest is also home to an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, badger, lynx, iron cat and wild peacock can be found here, as well as many other common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are asked to wear gowns that cover the knees and to have their shoulders covered as well.
Most monasteries provide women with shawls that are not made for them, but if you bring your own, particularly one with bright colors, you will receive a sign from the monk or nun at the entrance.
In the same fashion, men were required to wear trousers that covered their knees.
This can also be taken from the pantry at the entrance but this dress is not washed after each use and therefore you may not feel comfortable wearing these shorts. One size fits all men!
The Malhorquina cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean spandis, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (generally pork), and uses olive oil from everywhere.
A simple popular dinner, especially during the summer, is bread with oil: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any kind of available accompaniment such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, together with the word Sie for you, always begin with a capital letter, and usually in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way of distinguishing between some verbs and objects.
It certainly makes reading easier, and although the writing is a bit complicated by the need to find out if a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters to be considered are c and g, although their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means car, while carro means car.
They speak it with a relatively easy and generally regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Needless to say, if you know a Romance language, it will be easier for you to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know some Spanish can quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Early modern observatories are usually obsolete today and remain as museums, or educational sites.
Since light pollution in their heyday was not the type of problem that it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, easier to reach than those that were built during the modern era.
Most modern research telescopes are large installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were hosted by the emperor himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, so you must resist the temptation to take just "one" specimen.
If you are visiting a formal garden, picking up a few "specimens" will also get you banned, no question.
Singapore is generally a very safe place to go and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything you want to get there.
But because it is located in the "upper tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator you will have to manage both the heat (always) and the strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, rarely).
There are also a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
You need to verify that the bus you are planning to take is going to Hebron and not just to the neighboring Jewish colony of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good base theme for vacations.
Examples include visiting the castles of the Leire valley, the Rhine valley or cruising to interesting sites on the Danube or sailing on the Erie Canal.
They also set up routes for popular walking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the festival have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of spending the Easter night awake in some exposed spot to watch the sun rise.
There are certainly Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may have been a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Most traditional churches often celebrate a Easter vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, with congregations often beginning the celebration at the first stroke of midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that first arrived on the islands arrived either by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to make the journey, making the giant tortoise the main feeder animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of humans to the Galápagos, many mammals have been introduced including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will be more or less continuously dark.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you will also be able to take advantage of the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
The costumes are standard work clothes and the colleagues are called by their surnames or by their job titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with an emphasis on teamwork rather than praising individual performance.
Workers must often obtain the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without question.
