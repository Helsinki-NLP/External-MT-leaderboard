The social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
The amendments preserve the public transport passenger allowance.
From September 24, the procedure for organizing the preferential travel of citizens using the social card of a resident of the Ivanovo region changes.
According to the press service of the Russian government for the Ivanovo region, the changes provide for the preservation of the public passenger transportation privilege and bring the scheme of mutual payments on the social card in accordance with the requirements of Federal Law No. 161 of the Federal Law "On the National Payment System".
At the same time, the social card of the inhabitant of the Ivanovo region is recognized as an electronic means of payment.
And the conditions of its use change accordingly.
So, the limit of replenishment is now set not in trips, as before, but in the amount of money, with the preservation of winter and summer periods - in winter not more than 400 rubles, in the summer period - not more than 800 rubles for the current month.
Now, social card holders will need to keep track of their balance on transport receipts, not the number of remaining trips.
The cost of the preferential travel for citizens will be 1/2 of the carrier's fare.
The rest of the fare is paid by the regional budget.
The replenishment schedule remains the same - from the 24th of the previous month to the 23rd of the current month.
The new social card system will have a number of advantages.
It is possible to keep detailed accounts of the expenditure of money on the social card with pinpoint accuracy.
In addition, it is possible to recover accrued but unspent funds.
We should also add that the scheme of mutual settlements with carriers becomes transparent, since now half of the cost of travel is paid by the citizen, and exactly the same amount is reimbursed to the carrier by the budget.
There is no charge for depositing funds on the card.
In turn, Vasily Silkin, Deputy Head of the Department of Road and Transport of Ivanovo Region, reported that in 2014 more than 33 million trips were made in the region using social cards, in 2015 - almost 25 million trips.
The regional budget provides for more than 470 million rubles for providing citizens with a preferential travel with the use of a social card.
As of September 1, the amount of compensation for these purposes amounted to more than 312 million rubles.
During a 911 call, a teacher confesses to killing her friend.
During a 911 call, a college professor named Shannon Lamb told police that he had shot his girlfriend and needed staff to come to his home.
Lamb emphasized that there is a "dog" in the house that is alive but probably upset, and said that the contacts of the family members of the deceased can be found in her phone.
Inside the home, police found Amy Prentice's body and a note, carelessly handwritten on a white piece of linoleum paper: "I am very sorry, I wish I could take it all back, I loved Amy, and she is the only woman who ever loved me", the note, according to the authorities, signed by Lamb, reads.
There was no indication that Lamb, who was teaching two online courses at Delta State University in Cleveland, Mississippi, had by then driven 300 miles to the university campus, where police believe he shot the highly respected history professor Ethan Schmidt on the doorstep of his office.
Delta State University Police Chief Lynn Baford said that the shooting was reported to the university at 10:18 a.m.
He said that Lamb made that truthful 911 call shortly after that.
By the end of the day, the casualties will be one more: Lamb killed himself as soon as the police surrounded him.
The day after the school shooting forced students and faculty to hide behind locked doors, law enforcement officials were still trying to piece together Lamb's motives.
Information shared by investigators across the state, as well as students and staff who knew him, helped to create a portrait of a talented but possibly troubled teacher.
Students said they looked forward to his classes.
Police in Gauthier, where Prentice died, said he had no violent record or criminal record.
Schmidt included Lamb in a book he wrote, in which he expressed appreciation for the "wonderful people" he had met in his teaching life.
Both taught at the Faculty of Social Sciences and History, which has 17 faculty members, and many students attended both lectures.
At the same time, there were some indications of problems.
One student who spoke highly of Lamb, Brandon Beavers, reported that he also seemed anxious and nervous, "as if something was wrong with him".
Another student, Michael Sykes, reported that Lamb told him about his struggles with stress at the end of the 2014-15 school year.
Earlier, Lamb had asked Delta State University to give him a sick leave, saying he had some health issues.
He only taught two online courses this year.
A recent change in the university's hiring rules meant that the doctorate Lamb had worked so hard to obtain would not guarantee him automatic tenure.
University President William LaForge said he knew nothing of the conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "it was obvious Mr. Lamb had something on his mind".
These are questions Lamb can no longer answer.
Police raided Lambe's trail after he fled campus on his way back to Mississippi from Arkansas.
Before he could be arrested, Lamb shot himself with a loaded .38-caliber handgun in the backyard of his home, one mile south of his parents' home in the suburb of Greenville, Mississippi, the Washington County coroner, Metel Johnson, said.
His car, with its engine running, was still in the driveway.
It was unclear why Lamb had come to the house, though Johnson said she believed he knew the people who lived there.
Lamb grew up in those parts.
Lamb began working at the university, which has 3,500 students in a city of about 12,000, in 2009 and taught geography and pedagogy.
He received his doctorate in pedagogy in the spring of the same year.
One of Lamb's old friends described him as smart, charismatic and fun.
Carla Hairston said she was 15 and Lambu was 20 when they met through mutual friends.
She and her friends were in high school, and he was this cool guy older than her, who had been trying to teach her how to play guitar for years.
He was a hit with women back then.
All the girls melted when he was around", says Hairston, now 40 and living in Jackson, a suburb of Brandon.
Lamb and Prentiss had apparently been dating for some time.
During the 911 call, Lamb said, "I killed my wife", but there's no record of their marriage.
The couple had a dog named Lightning, who lived with them in Goutte in a brick house, the back of which overlooks the canal.
The police say the dog is fine.
Prentiss' ex-husband, Sean O'Steen, said they divorced 15 years ago but remained friends and that they have a daughter, who is now 19.
"She's totally depressed", O'Steen said of his daughter.
She and her mother were good friends.
O'Steen said he had never met Lamb, but heard from his daughter Abigail that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues.
Lamb met Prentiss when he and Abigail both performed at the same summer festival three years ago.
Then they played together from time to time at concerts.
O'Steen said his daughter writes music and sings.
Prentiss was a nurse and she worked online for different companies.
Mike Shaffer, a bartender and co-coordinator of entertainment programs at the dimly lit The Julep Room bar in suburban Gauthier, said he last saw Lamb and Prentice on the evening of September 5, when Lamb had finished playing guitar and harmonica to a small audience.
Nothing suspicious was observed.
"Just a happy couple", he said.
We had fun and made fun of each other.
I mean, they were both very witty.
Schmidt, the deceased teacher, conducted seminars for first-year students and specialized in the history of Native Americans and colonial America, said Don Allan Mitchell, an English teacher at the same school.
He was married and had three young children.
He attended Kansas State University in Emporia and was president of the student fraternity and student government.
On the campus of Delta State University in Cleveland on Tuesday night, about 900 people, including faculty, staff, students and community members, participated in a memorial candlelight ceremony.
Schmidt's wife Liz and brother Jeff Schmidt also attended the ceremony, during which the university choir sang Bright Morning Star and Amazing Grace.
Classes will resume on Wednesday.
"We are trying to get our students back", Laforge said.
The crisis is over.
Today is recovery day.
Amy and Rogelio Solis reporting from Cleveland, Mississippi.
The story was helped by Associated Press writers Emily Wagster Pettus in Greenville, Mississippi, and Rebecca Santana in New Orleans.
The story was edited because of police claims that Lamb's 911 call came after Schmidt's murder, and because although Lamb referred to Prentiss as his wife when he called 911, the information that they were married was not confirmed.
Toys R Us plans to hire fewer employees for the holiday season
Toys R Us announced that it will not be hiring as many employees for the holiday season as last year, with the toy and children's retailer saying it will allow full-time and temporary staff to work longer hours.
The company says it plans to hire 40,000 people to work in stores and wholesale bases across the country, down from the 45,000 it hired for the 2014 holiday season.
Most jobs will be part-time.
The company said it would start interviewing applicants this month and would increase staffing from October to December.
While the holiday season is still months away, companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to keep enough staff in stores and to sell, ship and deliver goods.
Michael J. Fox jokes about his "date" with Princess Diana.
The premiere of Back to the Future was a huge event for Michael J. Fox.
She was also remarkable for personal reasons.
"We were sitting in the cinema waiting for the royal family to arrive, and I noticed that the seat next to me was free, and I thought, 'Princess Diana is going to be sitting next to me,'" he said in the trailer for the upcoming documentary, "Back in Time".
The movie starts, and I'm literally one arm's length away from a date with the Princess of Wales.
Back to the Future, a documentary about Back to the Future, includes interviews with Fox, Leia Thompson, and Christopher Lloyd, as well as director Robert Zemeckis and executive producer Steven Spielberg.
Back to the Future premiered 30 years ago.
"To me", says Spielberg, "this is without a doubt the greatest time travel movie ever made".
"Back in Time" will be available on VOD, DVD and in select theaters in October.
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon says in response to Russia's military support for Syria that there is "no military solution" to the nearly five-year conflict, and that the surge in weapons will only exacerbate the violence and suffering of millions of people.
The UN chief again called on all actors, including the divided UN Security Council, to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution.
Ban Ki-moon said at a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet with the foreign ministers of the five permanent members of the council - the United States, Russia, China, Britain and France - during the General Assembly's ministerial session this month to discuss Syria.
He regretted that the disagreements within the council, as well as between Syrians and local authorities, "made the situation intractable".
Ban Ki-moon called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity that they have shown in dealing with the Iranian nuclear program and in addressing the Syrian crisis.
8 polling results that show Donald Trump is not joking
Some tried to label him a provocateur.
Others dismissed it as a joke.
And some of them require a scandal.
But as much as some Republicans try to shake up Donald Trump's high position in the polls, they haven't (yet).
Ten of the last 11 national polls have shown Donald Trump's advantage in double digits, and some are beginning to seriously question what that means for the real estate mogul in terms of his chances of getting nominated.
Of course, this is just the beginning of the election cycle.
None of this means that Trump has a chance to win the Republican nomination.
Experts point out that at this time in 2011, Rick Perry was second to the rising popularity of Herman Cain, neither of whom had won a single state in the nominating process.
And there are plenty of reasons why he would be running for the general election.
But outside groups like Jeb Bush's Political Action Supercommittee and the economic conservative group the Club for Growth recognize Trump's unwavering power and are beginning to pull their dollars to topple him.
Here are some survey numbers that suggest that the real estate mogul is not just a phase-in:
The Trump approval ratings have gone up 180 degrees.
Just before Donald Trump announced his candidacy in mid-June, a Monmouth University poll showed that only two in 10 Republicans had a positive view of the real estate mogul.
By mid-July, it was 40 percent.
At the beginning of August, it was 52 percent.
Now six out of 10 Republicans are positive about Donald Trump.
About three out of 10 say they have a negative opinion.
And all of these things are prevalent in the early stages.
A Quinnipiac poll in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Republicans there favor Trump.
Two-thirds of the GOP voters would have Trump as their candidate.
In a CNN/ORC poll conducted last week, 67 percent of Republicans said they would either "enjoy" or "satisfy" Trump's candidacy.
Only two in 10 say they would be "disappointed" if he ran.
Ben Carson alone generates about the same level of enthusiasm as Trump (43 percent say they would be "thrilled" versus 40 percent who say the same about Trump).
Next in line for admiration?
Marco Rubio, who only has 21%.
On the other hand, 47 percent of Republicans say they would be "displeased" or "disappointed" if the establishment's favorite Jeb Bush becomes the nominee.
Most Republicans don't see Trump's temper as a problem.
While Trump has been widely criticized for his bragging and insults, 52 percent of Republican-leaning voters nationwide think the tycoon has the right temperament to be president, an ABC News/Washington post poll showed Monday.
The same figure is coming out of the nation's first closed-door rally in Iowa, where the same 52 percent of Republicans think he's the man who could be commander-in-chief, according to Quinnipiac last week.
Still, 44 percent think he's not the man to be effective in office, and nearly six in 10 independent voters say his temperament is not right for the White House, according to ABC/Post.
Republican voters are getting used to the idea.
When they put on their smart hats, Republican voters think Trump is serious.
When asked who was the most likely to win the GOP nomination, four in 10 said Trump was the favorite, according to a CNN/ORC poll last week.
That's not the case anymore, with four of the 10 being put on Jeb Bush at the end of July.
Full disclosure: GOP voters never had the right magic crystal before.
At the same time, in the last cycle, four out of 10 Republicans picked Rick Perry as the most likely candidate, while only 28 percent backed Mitt Romney as a possible candidate.
Still, it shows that many GOP voters find Trump's campaign convincing.
Even if the Republicans were to rally around another candidate, Trump is still ahead of the game.
Some pundits suggest that this dispersion is likely to be to Trump's advantage, with those who don't support Trump evenly distributed among those who support more than a dozen other candidates.
But a Monmouth University poll conducted in early September shows that in a hypothetical one-on-one contest between Trump and most other Republican candidates, Trump almost always wins the majority.
He is 13 points ahead of Carly Fiorina, 14 points ahead of Marco Rubio, 15 points ahead of Walker, 19 points ahead of Jeb Bush and finally 33 points ahead of Rand Paul, Jon Kasich and Chris Christie.
He's got a tie with Ted Cruz.
The only candidate who's bypassing him?
Ben Carson has outscored a businessman by a full 19 points in a hypothetical one-on-one contest.
A little more than half of Donald Trump's supporters say they've changed their mind.
A new CBS/NYT poll conducted on Tuesday shows that only more than half of Trump voters say they are confident in their vote.
Obviously, a lot of things can happen that change the situation, and no one can really say that they're never going to change their mind.
46 percent say they leave the door open for other candidates.
Still, Trump's toughest competition so far is with fellow outsider neurosurgeon Ben Carson, but voters who say they've changed their minds are more likely to vote for Trump.
Six out of 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
Since Donald Trump called Mexican immigrants "rapists" in his campaign opening speech two months ago, immigration has become the most talked about topic in 2016.
Some worry that Trump's posturing will alienate key Latino voters from the Republican Party and hinder the rebranding.
But according to an ABC/Post poll conducted on Monday, six in 10 Republicans say they agree with Trump on immigration.
So as long as immigration is the focus of attention, it looks like Donald Trump will remain in that position.
Disillusionment with government is gaining momentum.
Donald Trump and Ben Carson now count on the support of about half of the Republican electorate, largely because of their status as outsiders.
Six out of 10 Republicans in a new ABC/Post poll Monday say they'd rather have a political outsider than someone with government experience.
And they're also angry with Washington.
A Des Moines Register/Bloomberg poll in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Republicans in Iowa are disappointed with the Republicans' performance in Congress, with 54 percent "disappointed" and 21 percent "outraged".
The government will decide the fate of the pension indexation in October.
Deputy Prime Minister Olga Golodets said that the government is currently looking for options to implement the law on indexation of pensions in 2016 to the real level of inflation, reports RG.
She noted that a decision should be reached by October 8, when the draft budget for the next year is submitted to the government.
In addition, the cabinet is discussing the option of prolonging the decision to freeze the accumulated pension of Russians.
Golodets noted that the amount of pension savings is equal to 350 billion rubles.
That's about as much as it'll cost to index your full pension next year.
According to the Deputy Prime Minister, there is no final decision yet on who should pay contributions for non-working citizens.
Galodez believes that if a person does not work on his own initiative and does not belong to socially vulnerable categories of citizens, it is not quite fair that society pays for him.
Earlier, the media reported that the Cabinet is considering two options for balancing the state budget.
Why do they often get irritated and red eyebrows?
The answer is the ophthalmologist, Dr. Tatyana Levashova:
Our eyelids are screens that protect the eyeball from the many tiny particles that settle on them.
By neglecting to clean the eyelids regularly, we often contribute to the development of blepharitis.
The solution is simple:
Do not rub your eyes with dirty hands, but bring a special wet wipes for eyelids.
At least once or twice a day, clean the edges of the eyelids from the harmful substances that have accumulated in them during the day.
The cleansing procedures should be supplemented by warm compresses with decoctions of medicinal herbs (shalfea, chamomile), liquefying the thick secretion of the salivary glands, and then eyelids, which should be carried out by circular movements of the finger pads;
Do not use alcohol-based products when washing your makeup.
They dry and dehydrate the skin and contribute to further thickening of the sebaceous glands.
Pyongyang claims that the Korean nuclear scientists have created a nuclear warhead.
North Korean officials have reported that the country's main nuclear reactor - the Yongbyon nuclear complex - is operating at "full power".
The announcement was made on the website of the Central Telegraph Agency.
It is noted that the DPRK is ready at any time to respond to "the aggression and nuclear threat of the United States", and that the country has improved its nuclear weapons "both in quantity and quality".
The last nuclear test the North Korean government conducted was in 2013.
Plans to restart the reactor have not been announced since.
Pyongyang claims to have created a nuclear warhead.
North Korea has also tested short- and medium-range missiles, polit.ru reports.
Zhirinovsky demanded that the mention of brotherly nations be removed from the Russian anthem.
The leader of the LDPR Vladimir Zhirinovsky believes that the mention of the brotherhood of peoples should be removed from the national anthem.
He said this during a State Duma meeting, according to the Russian News Service.
Who are these people now?
Fascists and murderers!
"A very long anthem, the longest in the world, even athletes can't stand", said Zhirinovsky.
The MP thinks that all four-line sentences containing this line should be deleted:
In the summer of 2014, Zhirinovsky said that the current anthem should be changed to "God Save the Tsar", and the Russian tricolor should be replaced with the imperial flag, polit.ru writes.
Assad called for all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Syrian President Bashar Assad called on all forces to unite in the fight against terrorism.
Assad believes that if Europe wants to deal with the refugee problem, they must stop supporting terrorists in the Middle East.
The question is not whether Europe accepts or rejects refugees, but whether we must address the root causes of the problem.
If Europeans care about the fate of refugees, they should stop supporting terrorists.
That's our opinion on the matter.
"That's the essence of the refugee issue", he said in an interview with RT.
We must continue to talk in the name of consensus.
However, if we want real success, it is impossible as long as people are dying, as long as the bloodshed continues and as long as people do not feel completely safe.
"In this way, we can reach consensus, but we cannot achieve anything until we defeat terrorism in Syria", Assad stressed.
Let us remind you that in the EU countries this year, about 500,000 migrants arrived, including from Syria.
The European Commission has said that the current migration crisis in the world is the largest since World War II.
It is possible that thousands of Islamic State militants may be among the migrants arriving in Europe.
Members of a terrorist organisation banned in Russia could use the situation to set up their own cells in the EU to carry out terrorist activities.
The residents of a German town hosted a party for the refugees.
Germany has been leading the way in terms of taking in refugees over the last month, though it has recently tightened border controls to keep the influx in check.
Authorities estimate that some 800,000 migrants will arrive in Germany by the end of this year, although some experts put the number considerably higher.
Since the beginning of September, more than 90,000 refugees have arrived in the country.
The BBC's Jenny Hill visited Darmstadt, a city that has a warm welcome for migrants.
Jeremy Corbyn makes his debut in the Prime Ministers ' Questions session .
After Mr. Corbyn 's election , his debut at the Prime Minister 's Question Session is eagerly awaited .
New Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will soon be making his first appearance at the Prime Minister's Question Time, taking on David Cameron for the first time.
Mr Corbyn will deliver the first of six scheduled questions in the afternoon, and his speech is likely to be closely watched by the press and by Labour MPs.
He called for "less theatre and more facts" in a weekly demonstration speech.
He also stated that he might miss some of the meetings, leaving them to his colleagues.
The meeting will be Mr Corbyn's first parliamentary test as leader; it will follow his appointment of a shadow cabinet and his speech at the annual Trade Union Congress on Tuesday.
Meanwhile, the Labour leader's decision to stand silent during the playing of the national anthem at the service on Tuesday, during the celebration of the 75th anniversary of the Battle of Britain, has drawn criticism from a number of conservative members of Parliament and been the subject of several leading newspaper articles.
Mr. Corbin's decision not to sing the national anthem has drawn attention.
Mr Corbyn's spokesman said he had "stood in aweful silence" and acknowledged "the heroism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain".
However, Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet member Owen Smith told Newsnight on BBC 2 that he would advise the Labour leader to sing the national anthem "independently" of his belief in the need to abolish the monarchy.
Nearly a dozen shadow ministers refused to play for Mr Corbyn, voicing disagreement over the economy, defence and international politics, while fewer than a sixth of the MPs backed him as leader.
The BBC's political correspondent Robin Brant says that political divisions are also "piling up" in the Labour Party following Mr Corbyn's appointment to a post in the European Union and the government's limitation of compensation payments.
Mr Corbyn told a conference of trade unions that the Labour Party had tabled amendments to remove the whole idea of restrictions.
Hours later, Mr Smith, the shadow minister for work and pensions, said there was "full clarity" within the party that it was only opposed to the government's plans to cut the top limit from £26,000 to £23,000.
Mr Corbyn will be the fifth Labour leader that David Cameron has met at a courier box in the last ten years since he became leader of the Conservative Party.
The Labour leader, who promised a different approach to politics, says he has "drawn collective resources" to gather ideas for questions for Mr Cameron and has received more than 30,000 proposals.
The MP for the constituency of Islington North said that the questions to the Prime Minister were unnecessarily confrontational and that he would refrain from witty answers and exchanges of quips, instead promising to focus on serious issues such as poverty, inequality and the challenges facing young people.
Mr. Corbyn has stated that Angela Eagle, the shadow economy minister, will be filling in for the prime minister when he is away - for example, when Mr. Cameron is abroad.
He also voiced the idea of allowing other colleagues to speak when they could, saying he had approached House of Commons Speaker John Bercow to discuss the matter.
When he became leader in 2005, Mr Cameron said he wanted to move away from the "fairground talk" style of politics often associated with the question-and-answer procedure of prime ministers, but admitted a few years later that he had failed to do so.
Since its first broadcast in 1990, questions to the Prime Minister have become a key indicator of the leader's views, their ability to run the House of Commons and the reputation of other members of Parliament, although critics claim that it has become a caricature and requires far-reaching reforms.

Pound sterling rises as UK wages rise
The pound rose on the back of rising wages in the UK, with the FTSE 100 index rising due to a bid to buy SABMiller.
From May to June, UK wages, excluding bonuses, rose 2.9% compared to the same period last year.
The rate of growth was the highest since 2009, and was seen as an earlier postponement of the forecast for possible growth in quotations.
The pound sterling rose by more than 1% against the dollar to $1,5505, and by 0.84% against the euro to €1,3730.
The FTSE 100 index rose to 6229.21 by 1.49%.
The stock of SABMiller stood out, rising 20% thanks to a takeover bid from rival AB InBev.
The deal would bring together the world's two largest brewers, bringing together brands such as Budweiser, Stella Artois, Peroni and Grolsch.
Burberry shares rose 0.9% on encouraging news from rival luxury goods group Richemont.
Richemont's latest sales figures have exceeded expectations and show that sales in China - Burberry's key market - have started to grow again.
Glencore shares rose 5% after the mining giant said it had raised $2.5 billion in a stock offering as part of a debt-reduction strategy.
Shares of paper and packaging group Mondi led the index in declines - 4.3 percent - after Goldman Sachs downgraded the group to sell-out.
JD Sports shares rose after the sportswear supplier reported an 83% rise in pre-tax profit in the first half of the year to £46.6m.
JD Sports boss says higher salaries may hinder expansion
JD Sports chief executive Peter Cowgill says that raising the minimum wage for British workers means "more purchasing power in the pockets of potential consumers".
But it is unlikely that this purchasing power will outweigh the rising cost of labor, he says.
The cost could affect JD Sports' expansion plans, he added, which could mean fewer additional vacancies.
Metcash launches bottom-up campaign to counter Aldi's onslaught
Metcash is trying to protect its IGA stores from Aldi's onslaught in South Australia and Western Australia.
The wholesale food supplier has launched a grassroots campaign to protect the market share of IGA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in light of the upcoming $700 million infusion by Aldi.
As Aldi prepares to open two wholesale warehouses and the first of 120 stores in South and Western Australia early next year, Metcash and IGA supermarkets are strengthening relationships with local food suppliers and promoting the IGA brand through marketing in the mainstream media and social media and at events such as the Adelaide Show.
The campaign is being joined by IGA retailers and suppliers, such as the ice cream maker Simmo's in Dunsborough, which offers tasting in IGA stores, and shop owners who sell tickets to regular customers at a discount for South Australian Football League matches.
Metcash is expected to reveal more details of its protection strategy on September 29, the day the food, beverage and consumer goods wholesale supplier holds its annual investor strategy day.
There is a lot of competition, as in South Australia and Western Australia, IGA-branded stores make up almost 30% of all Metcash stores and show higher profitability than the Metcash IGA network in the eastern states.
Shoppers in South and Western Australia are known to be more committed to their usual routes, so the market here is more favorable to IGA retailers than in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in the South Australian and 24 percent in the WA compared to approximately 14 percent in the eastern states.
However, analysts such as Morgan Stanley believe that Aldi will capture 5 percent of the grocery market in these two states within 12 months of opening its first stores, taking sales from all the players present, but mainly from independent retailers.
In a report published this week, Tom Kirat, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, estimates that IGA retailers could lose $360 million in sales for the year, and Metcash $250 million by the end of 2016.
The forecast is based on the assumption that Aldi will open 25 stores in South Africa and 30 in WA next year, achieving sales of $500 million and $600 million in those markets respectively.
The loss of revenue and food sales volumes at Metcash's high fixed costs could cost the company about $13 million in earnings before interest and taxes, Mr. Kirat believes.
Meanwhile, Metcash is losing market share in the eastern states, mostly to Aldi and Coles, and that's despite a recent Morgan Survey finding that IGA has the most loyal customers.
Morgan Stanley estimates that Metcash grocery sales will fall 3.8 percent in 2016, 4.1 percent in 2017, and 2.1 percent in 2018, reducing the company's market share from 14 percent in 2015 to 10.3 percent by 2020.
Last week, leading fund manager Hamish Douglas, founder of Magellan Financial Group, remarked to attendees at a business lunch in Melbourne that Metcash "could very likely disappear within a decade.
Metcash declined to comment publicly on Mr. Douglas' comments.
But it's believed a member of the Metcash board contacted Mr. Douglas last week.
IGA's market share has decreased from 18 to 14 percent since 2010, and Metcash's food business revenues, which it supplies to some 1,200 IGA retailers, have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 due to operational deleveraging and pressure on sales and profitability.
However, the company is not giving up, spending over $150 million annually to match retail prices at Coles and Woolworths for a thousand items weekly and helping IGA retailers to re-design their stores, as well as offering a rapidly expanding range of fresh produce and a wider selection of branded food products.
Metcash CEO Iain Morris says that the price-leveling and redevelopment of the retail space is gaining momentum, and he hopes the company will achieve a net profit increase in 2017, for the first time in four years.
Tennis Australia president Steve Healy has endorsed Kokkinakis.
Thanasi Kokkinakis deserves credit for his behavior, not criticism.
Tanasi Kokkinakis was indirectly affected by the recent scandal surrounding his friend Nick Kyrgios and deserves more credit than criticism for his behaviour, according to Tennis Australia president Steve Healey.
Kokkinakis, the younger of the talented duo and often called "Special Ks", inadvertently found himself in the spotlight due to Kyrios's embarrassing altercation with Stan Wawrinka at the Montreal Masters.
Shortly after, during a hot qualifying match in Cincinnati, the referee on the tower had to separate Kokkinakis and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice, with Harrison stating, "The referee should have put on the shoulders of Kyrgios, and I should have put on the shoulders of this guy".
Since Kokkinakis was last seen breaking a racquet after a concussion in his leg saved Rishar Gaske from possible defeat at the US Open, Healy has been a staunch defender of Kokkinakis.
The youngster is currently in Glasgow, competing with Sam Grot for the right to be second behind Bernard Tomic in the singles division in the Davis Cup semi-final against Great Britain.
"I am deeply concerned about one thing, and that is that Tanasi has been dragged into the conflict", said Healy.
He did break a racket when he got his foot in the U.S. Open, but he's not the first player to break a racket when hopes were dashed, and I know Thanasis well enough to be sure he wouldn't be proud of that.
But he's actually been very good in pretty provocative situations in the US, with Harrison and so forth, and I'm sure he's trustworthy.
He's surrounded by a great team, he has a great family, and I just think he's been treated a little unfairly.
He's a very mature 19-year-old man, he works hard, he fits in perfectly with the team, he's never had any problems with other players, he's respected off the court, he's training hard, he's in great shape, he's a very determined and developed young man, and I think he should be given credit for that.
Healey also supported the decision to pardon Kyrios for the important match starting on Friday, believing "mutual consent" was the right outcome for everyone, but counting on the Canberra boy to return to the team as a long-term player.
"First of all, we want the team to be fully focused on the match and not on the controversy around [Kyryos]", Healy said.
And I think that Nick has gained strength very quickly, as people like Federer and Marray have shown, he's growing in the public eye, he's made some serious mistakes and he deserves all the criticism that he gets, but we're trying to help him understand the consequences of his actions, and I think it's necessary to take him out of the spotlight for a while so that he can reflect on them, and that's best for the team and best for him.
Europe's migration crisis: Hungary declares a state of emergency, closes its border, and detain migrants
Hungary declared a state of emergency on Tuesday, closing its southern border with Serbia and detaining those trying to enter the country illegally to stem the flow of migrants.
There were riots at the border - hundreds of migrants gathered on the border area, which was strongly reacted negatively by the Serbian authorities.
Stuck for an indefinite period of time on the road between the checkpoints of the two countries, people fleeing armed violence in their homeland have set up tents and settled in the area.
But the discontent grew.
As the police helicopter circled above them, the migrants shouted "Open the border!" and shouted insults at the Hungarian special police.
Some were denied food and water in protest.
Serbia's foreign minister has declared "unacceptable" the expulsion of migrants back from Hungary, when more and more of them are arriving from Macedonia and Greece.
Serbia wants to be part of the solution, not the collateral damage.
It is necessary to hold talks with Brussels and other countries in the coming days", said Ivica Dacic in Prague.
The unrest on the Hungarian-Serbian border began the day after the 28-nation bloc failed to develop a common immigration policy at a joint meeting in Brussels.
The ministers agreed to share responsibility for the 40,000 asylum seekers in overcrowded Italy and Greece, and expressed hope that an agreement could be reached in the future (either next month or by the end of the year) to allow EU member states to take in an additional 120,000 refugees, including refugees from Hungary.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria on Tuesday demanded an emergency EU summit next week to discuss the immigration crisis that has engulfed the continent.
Hungary, however, does not expect any quick action from Brussels or its neighbors.
A state of emergency declared in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities more powers to act on the crisis, allowing them to block roads and speed up asylum cases.
Meanwhile, Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto said his country also plans to erect a barbed wire fence along the border with Romania to stem the flow of migrants through the country, now that it has finished the fence along the Serbian border.
CBS News correspondent Charlie Dagata reported that even prisoners were being hooked up to the urgent work of completing the barbed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia.
In recent months, Hungary has become a major "bottleneck" and border crossing point for migrants, many of whom are refugees - victims of wars in Syria and the Middle East.
However, Prime Minister Viktor Orban insists that most of the people arriving in the country are economic migrants seeking a better life, not refugees - victims of war who have the right to protection, a view that is sharply at odds with those in other EU countries, including Germany.
New laws that took effect in Hungary at midnight now make it a crime to cross or damage the 4 meter (13 foot) barbed wire fence built by the government along the southern border with Serbia, and include longer prison sentences for those accused of trafficking.
"Due to the situation caused by mass migration, the Hungarian government is declaring a state of emergency", government spokesman Zoltán Kovacs told journalists in the southern city of Szeged.
We're making it very clear that illegal border crossing is a crime.
The formal parliament is still to approve the deployment, which is expected next week, but Associated Press reporters who are on the border have been observing the presence of heavily armed troops with vehicles and dogs for days.
Djerde Bacondi, Orban's national security adviser, reported that 45 people were apprehended by authorities trying to cross the border, and 15 more inside the country.
They crossed the border, broke the fence, are currently in police custody and are charged with committing administrative offenses under the new laws.
The authorities are quickly rebuilding the fence.
Hungarian authorities also closed two of the seven border crossings with Serbia on Tuesday morning, bringing in a railway carriage wrapped in barbed wire to block one of the crossings.
Riots broke out at the main border crossing near the city of Røske, Hungary, as Hungarians put a service room inside a metal container for people to pass through, and crowds of people pushed each other to break in.
About 20 people managed to get inside, while thousands of people were left outside.
Another group of migrants blocked the main highway from Serbia to Hungary and announced a food and water boycott until they could be allowed into Hungary.
Election 2016: Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders has been cut in half in the national poll.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton continues to hold a two-digit lead in the Democratic race for the nationwide nomination, but Senator Bernie Sanders is catching up.
Clinton now has 47 percent support among Democratic primary voters (down from 58 percent), and Sanders is second with 27 percent (up from 17 percent).
Vice President Joe Biden, who has not yet announced whether he will run for president, is receiving 15 percent of the Democratic primary vote.
With more than five months to go before the primary race, most Democratic voters say it's too early to say they've made up their minds about which candidate they'll support.
Clinton supporters are more confident in their choice than those who support other candidates.
Since the CBS News poll last month, Clinton has lost some demographic support, and Sanders has won some bonuses.
Clinton has a big lead among women and moderates, but that lead has been shrinking.
Her male approval rating has dropped significantly, and Sanders is only five points behind her.
The preference given to Clinton by the Democratic voters under 50 is gone, and he and Sanders are now on equal footing.
However, Clinton still has a large advantage among older voters.
Last month, Clinton outnumbered Sanders by two figures among the Liberals, but Sanders now has a five-point lead in that group.
Nearly half of Democratic primary voters nationwide say they would enthusiastically support Clinton if she were the party's nominee.
A quarter would support her with some reservations, and another 15 percent would support her just because she's a candidate.
Six percent would not support it.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, Clinton's current supporters are likely to be more enthusiastic about her.
Among those who currently do not support Clinton, the views are more contradictory - only about a quarter would enthusiastically support her.
While 48 percent of Democratic primary voters say they would enthusiastically support Clinton, a smaller number of Republican voters say the same about their leader, Donald Trump (35 percent).
When Clinton supporters are asked openly why they want her to run, the most popular answer is that she has the experience (16 percent), then that it's time for a woman president (13 percent), and that she's the best candidate for the job (10 percent).
Clinton supporters also say she has an association with Bill Clinton (9 percent).
Also known as the odds on the questions and the odds on the election.
As the vice president contemplates a potential run, 57 percent of Democratic primary voters would like him to join the race - although a third believe he shouldn't.
When asked who they would like to see runner-up among the party's candidates, Democratic primary voters most often cite Biden.
Among Clinton supporters, more than half say they would have picked Biden second, more than Sanders.
If Biden decides not to run for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton's lead over Sanders would increase from 20 points with Biden in the race to 30 points without him.
Fifty-five percent of Democratic voters see Clinton as the candidate with the best chance of winning the general election; however, this figure has decreased from 78 percent last month.
Biden is a distant second, but the percentage of those who see him as the most likely candidate has increased.
Yet, when asked what is most important about a candidate, Democratic voters choose other options besides the odds of being elected.
As was the case last month, none of the Democratic candidates or potential candidates are unacceptable candidates for these primary voters.
Democratic candidates, or potential candidates, have performed well on some key criteria among their party's primary voters.
Most people think of Clinton, Sanders and Biden as honest and trustworthy people with good leadership qualities.
Biden leads all three in honesty, and Clinton's strength is in her leadership.
Thirty percent of Democratic primary voters do not think Clinton is honest and trustworthy, twice as many as those who say the same of Sanders (15 percent), but 27 percent have no definite opinion of him on the matter.
Democratic primary voters also generally consider Clinton, Sanders and Biden to be ideologically similar.
By all of these measures, about a quarter of Democratic voters have no opinion of Sanders at all.
Although questions remain about Hillary Clinton's personal email and server records as Secretary of State, most Democratic primary voters are satisfied with her explanation and believe it has not negatively affected their overall opinion of her.
But it's a different story for the American public at large.
Half of Americans today are dissatisfied with her explanation, and only about a third are satisfied.
Public opinion was divided in March, shortly after the story went public.
Most Americans say the email controversy has had no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton, although 36 percent say their opinion of her has deteriorated.
It's mostly Republicans, more than six in 10 who say their opinion of Clinton has deteriorated.
Even though Clinton is considered honest and trustworthy by voters in her party, this continues to be a problem for her among registered voters overall: only 32 percent consider her honest and trustworthy, eight points lower than last month, and 15 points lower than last month.
Sixty-two percent of registered voters do not consider it honest or trustworthy.
At the same time, 55 registered voters across the country do not consider Trump to be honest or trustworthy.
Clinton and Trump, however, both score high on leadership.
Of the six candidates tested, Biden, Carson and Bush have the best honesty scores.
Most people see Sanders as more of an honest man than not, but like Carson, many people don't have an opinion about him.
The margin of error for a sample of 351 Democratic primary voters is 6 percentage points.
Ben Carson is closing in on Donald Trump in a national poll .
Ben Carson is closing in on Donald Trump in the latest CBS/New York Times poll.
These two candidates have won half the votes in the new poll, leaving everyone else to find their footing.
Republican voters across the country continue to support Trump in droves, with his approval rating rising from 23% in a recent CBS poll conducted on the eve of the Fox News debate last month to 27% in a poll conducted on Tuesday.
But Carson has gone from 6% to 23% in the same period.
The poll also found that Carson enjoys support across demographic groups, outranking Trump among college-educated Republican voters.
The remaining candidates, with the exception of Carly Fiorina and Ohio Governor John Kasich, have rolled back along with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, whose support has fallen from 10% last month to 2% now.
Former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee and Florida Senator Marco Rubio are tied for third with 6%.
The margin of error for a sample of 376 Republican voters in this latest poll is plus or minus 6%, the poll was conducted in September.
A recent CNN/ORC poll released last week showed Carson's rise in the polls, showing 19% support among Republicans, versus Trump's 32% support.
The latest ABC News/Washington Post poll also showed Trump significantly ahead of Carson.
With Carson's support rising last week, Trump made several critical attacks on the former neurosurgeon, even as Carson apologized for questioning Trump's faith.
"We need energy", Trump said last Saturday during a campaign shutdown in Iowa.
Five fraternity members are charged in the death of a freshman at Baruch College.
About two years after a college student was killed during a fraternity initiation ritual in the Pocono Mountains of Pennsylvania, murder charges were filed against five men.
"Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity from Baruch College in New York brutally attacked Chan "Michael" Deng during a dedication ceremony in September 2013 and failed to get him to the hospital in time, resulting in his death", police said.
Officials say the blindfolded student, with a 30-pound backpack with sand behind him, was pushed several times as he tried to reach his target by walking on a slippery surface.
Mr. Deng finally complained of a headache and then fell unconscious.
Members of the Pi Delta Psi fraternity failed to call 911 when Deng lost consciousness, and waited for an estimated hour before taking him to the hospital, police said.
They did, however, take the time to change Deng's clothes, Google his symptoms, and contact Andy Meng, the national president of the fraternity, for advice, police chief Chris Wagner said at the press conference.
"At this point, the fraternity members began to hide their personal assets, essentially putting the welfare of the fraternity above the health of Michael Deng", Chief Wagner said.
He couldn't be saved, and he died the next morning.
According to the autopsy report, Deng suffered multiple blunt force trauma to his head, torso, and hips.
"Too many families have been affected by the initiation rites of the fraternity, as at least one student has died during them every year since 1970", Douglas Feuerberg, the lawyer representing the Deng family, said in a statement.
The fraternity and its members must be held accountable, and this step by the authorities is very important.
The Monroe County jury has favored the third-degree murder charge for the first five members.
Thirty-two other members, including Mr. Meng, will be charged with assaulting a rookie and conspiracy.
"We want to hold accountable not just individual participants, but if there is an organization that has authorized this officially or unofficially, it should be her", Wagner said at a news conference on Tuesday.
Baruch College banned the fraternity, and the national fraternity eliminated the local chapter.
What happens when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates
If rates go up, the bull market will crash, bond yields will rise, and the economy will fall into recession.
We know that.
What we don't know is how long it'll take to attack, and how long it'll last.
For economics specifically, history explains little about time.
The recession came just 11 months after the first rate hike, and for 86 months.
The Federal Reserve's toughness in raising rates often, though not always, determines the response of the economy and financial assets.
That's why the Fed is so insistent that investors should focus not on when he's going to raise rates, but how long it will take to adjust.
In fact, there are many variables at play.
Eventually, however, market participants may find that all the fuss about raising rates is exaggerated.
"The first rate hike by the Federal Reserve with the onset of the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as signaling the end of the 'cheap money' era", Julian Jessop, chief international economist at Capital Economics, said in a client comment.
Conversely, we do not expect that a gradual return of US interest rates to more normal but still low levels will be the seismic momentum that many fear.
That doesn't mean there won't be consequences, though.
Here's a look at how some sectors of the economy might have responded to historical trends:
As the market has seen over the last month or so, expecting a rate hike can lead to volatility for a while.
When the stakes are raised, however, the consequences are usually not so dramatic.
"It is unlikely that equity earnings will slow for 12 to 24 months after the first jump, which again likely reflects a delay in monetary policy", Deutsche Bank analysts said in a recent study of the Federal Reserve's rate hike.
More specifically, if the market has been more volatile over the last 35 years or so - about 14 percent - in the direction of higher rates, it stays fairly flat for 250 days after that (an average increase of 2.6 percent), then, after 500 days, it returns to normal with an average return of 14.4 percent over the last six cycles, according to a recent analysis conducted by Bob Doll, chief equity trading strategist at Nuveen Asset Management, published in Barron's.
Deutsche says that the result for securities tends not to become more pronounced at the rate hike stage, and earnings from shares begin to decline.
Recessions are a fact of economic life, but rising rates often play a role in contributing to them.
In this case, the Federal Reserve is being put in a situation that has never existed before and could accelerate a recession.
Basically, gross domestic product will be at almost its lowest point in the entire existence of the higher rate.
According to Deutsche Bank, in 118 cases of rate hikes since 1950, only twice the nominal annual GDP was below 4.5 percent.
Even though it was 3.6 percent in the second quarter of 2015, few believe it will last, with only 1.5 percent in the third quarter, according to the Atlanta Fed.
Raising rates in such a volatile economic environment could be risky and raises the question "will it be different this time", Deutsche reported.
Market participants have been preparing for the Federal Reserve's rate hike all year, with their eyes glued to the Federal Open Market Committee meeting that ends Thursday.
While many strategists and economists believe that the FOMC could have approved a rate hike at this meeting, futures trading only suggests a 25% probability.
"In our study, all the rate hikes from 1950 to the present day have been in a GDP-enhancing financial leverage supercycle, closing the peaks that preceded the recession very quickly after the recovery began", the report said.
By contrast, it was an extremely slow recovery from the worst recession in the selected period.
The current cycle is the longest the Federal Reserve has waited since the end of the last recession; a record 35 months, and it's been 74 months in total and it's not over yet.
Fixed income has also become volatile as the market expects interest rates to rise, and this scenario is somewhat similar to what is happening for stocks.
The fundamental difference is that bonds will be affected more quickly than stocks when the Federal Reserve changes its strategic course.
In the case of bonds, it seems that the yield vector changes immediately after the first rate hike/decrease in the cycle.
At the end of the rate hike cycle, bond yields immediately fall", reports Deutsche.
Strategists at Charles Schwab believe that higher rates will bring the yields of long-term and short-term bonds closer together, making the curve flatter.
High-yield bonds often do better in such a climate, though "we still fear yield fluctuations", says the study's author, Kathy Jones, a fixed-income analyst at Schwab.
Interestingly, Jones believes that markets have already adapted to the expected outcomes of the Federal system's policies.
"In addition to the strengthening of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations, there are signs that the market has adjusted to the prospect of tighter monetary policy", she wrote.
Interest rates on short-term loans have risen, yield curves are flatter, credit spreads have expanded, volatility has increased - all characteristics of a market under the Federal System's tightening policy.
In general, companies with their main business in the US will benefit from higher interest rates and local products will become more attractive.
International companies with a lot of debt will be worse off, as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive in the global marketplace, and their debt more expensive in the financial marketplace.
"History shows that 'quality' stocks perform above market for three months after the initial rate hike", Goldman Sachs analysts said in a report for clients.
The companies with stable financial condition outperformed the companies with unstable financial condition by the results of each rate increase in 1994, 1999 and 2004 by an average of 5 percentage points.
High-return companies and low-volatility stocks also performed better than low-quality stocks, by an average of 4 (percentage points) and 3 (percentage points) respectively.
The debt will become a big issue.
High-interest companies with floating-rate debt will lose the most, according to Goldman.
Beyond pure stock exchange transactions, consumers will benefit from a rising dollar.
Investors could also see a return through higher returns, although experts disagree on how quickly this will happen.
"BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM", claims Conservative MP Andrew Bingham
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham has criticised the station for "lowering standards"
It proves that it's becoming less distinct from its commercial competitor.
He also took aim at the BBC Music Awards, saying the award was simply stolen from Brits.
My colleague Damien Collins, who has come out to The Voice with the same criticism, was not original.
"BBC Radio 3 is turning into Classic FM", said the leader of the MPs, urging the broadcaster to prove that it is doing something that commercial companies are not doing.
Conservative MP Andrew Bingham also told the BBC that it appeared the public service station was "going dumb" and becoming less distinct from its commercial rival.
"Radio 3 seems - I don't like to use the word 'simplification' - but it seems to be turning into Classic FM", he said.
He also targeted the BBC Music Awards, launched last December.
The BBC Music Awards, which started last year, looks like The Brits under a different name.
So if you're trying to do something different, here are the first two examples that came to mind, where you're really just copying what's already on the market", Mr. Bingham said.
The BBC's chief executive denied the allegations, claiming that BBC Radio 3 was way ahead of its commercial rivals when it came to live music and audience education.
What I learn from Radio 3, I don't learn about classical music anywhere else.
And his dedication to live performance and to making music is truly unmatched.
"It's also really very important, I think, that Radio 3 is interested in finding new music and promoting new works", he said.
Earlier this year, BBC Radio 3's manager Alan Davey argued that radio stations are having to work much harder to attract audiences than in the past because the British are less educated in classical music.
Radio 3 was not the only BBC outfit to come under fire for stepping on the heels of commercial competitors during the Special Committee on Culture, Media and Sport hearings.
Tory MP Damien Collins has attacked The Voice, a music talent show that the BBC bought from Dutch company Talpa Media for a reported £22 million.
You see why this program is often discussed in connection with the lack of originality and distinctiveness?
Lord Hall claims that the BBC 1 show, which features Paloma Faith and Boy George as judges, was made in a "typical BBC style".
He added that he wants the Corporation to "find a hit in their own home stable" the next time they launch an entertainment project.
However, he does not see the need to prevent the future ordering of new seasons of The Voice or the use of the money of those who pay the license fee for other entertainment formats.
Online sales growth slowed to its lowest point in August, and Black Friday may be to blame
Online sales up seven percent in first three months of 2015
Last month saw the slowest growth since records began in 2000.
Online sales surged three years ago with mobile shopping.
Experts believe that November's Black Friday could have helped to curb the trade.
For nearly a decade, the virtual shopping boom has transformed many of Britain's main streets into ghost towns.
But experts say there are now signs of a leveling off in online sales after the latest data showed only a seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
Total online shopping spending in August showed the smallest increase since records began in 2000, rising by just five percent.
Experts say there are signs of a leveling off in online sales after the latest data showed a mere seven percent increase in the first three months of 2015.
"If you look at the growth rates in previous years and go back to 2000, they always had a reasonable explanation", said Andy Mulcahy, editor of the IMRG sales index.
He explained that online sales started to take off three years ago when shoppers started using their mobile phones to make purchases.
What that meant was that more people were able to shop online, and they could do it in any environment, like sitting on the couch.
But now it's coming to a plateau, and you can see a decline.
The Black Friday phenomenon, which came from America, is cited as one of the reasons for the slowdown in sales.
Experts believe that shoppers may have been reluctant to buy ahead of the event, which takes place on the last Friday of November.
Last year, five times as many shoppers rushed to their computers to get their hands on a bargain, crashing a number of websites.
Experts believe that Black Friday, when shoppers engage in a real battle for a bargain, could have caused people to abstain from shopping
According to a study published by the British Retail Consortium, just over 1 pound sterling out of every 5 is spent online.
And for items like TVs and washing machines, more than a third of them are sold through online stores.
At the same time, more than a quarter of people are more likely to buy clothes and shoes online than in high-end stores on the main streets.
Muslims bury those killed in the crane collapse in Mecca, and sanctions are imposed on bin Laden's family.
Muslims carry the bodies of 29 dead through the streets as the first funeral begins in Mecca.
At the same time, Saudi Arabia has blamed the accident partially on construction giant Saudi Binladin Group.
The Ministry of Health reported that a total of 394 people were also injured after the crane collapsed.
Hundreds of Muslims from all over the world took to the streets to bury 29 of the victims of the crane collapse at the Grand Mosque of Mecca.
Dressed mostly in white, the mourners packed the sidewalk to pay their respects to the first of the dead who made their final journey to the Al-Moaissem cemetery.
A mourning procession passed by the shrine where just a few days earlier a construction crane had broken through the mosque's ceiling and fallen on the congregation.
The bodies were given away for burial, and at the same time, the Saudi king fined a construction company owned by the Bin Laden family for the accident, which also injured 394 people.
The bodies of 29 worshippers who died in the crane collapse at the Main Mosque were carried through the streets
Among the dead was father of four children Kasim Akram from Bolton, Greater Manchester, who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collapsed.
Mr. Akram was in the Grand Mosque with his parents before the annual Hajj.
Saudi authorities have already promised that the Hajj to Mecca will continue as thousands of people continue to arrive in the city.
Today King Salman said that Binladin Group should not have left the crane arrow raised when the crane was down.
The Arabic version of the decree, published by the state-run Saudi Press Agency, said that the Binladin Group was partly to blame for the collapse.
The English news agency did not provide details, but said that the company's leaders were forbidden from traveling outside the country.
Earlier this week, Salman promised to find out why a crane had fallen in the courtyard of the Grand Mosque, where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had gathered to perform the Hajj this month.
The Binladin Group has not commented on the crane collapse, and its representatives were unavailable for comment.
The royal decree also accused the company of not using modern safety measures and of not properly coordinating with the meteorological service.
Dozens of cranes surround the Grand Mosque of Mecca, as part of the extensive construction work being carried out by the Binladin Group.
The bin Laden family has been a close ally of the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and has managed major construction projects.
The late leader of al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden, was a son-in-law that his family disowned in the 1990s.
The accident occurred in the midst of heavy winds and rain just days before millions of people arrived in the kingdom for the pilgrimage, which is obligatory at least once in a lifetime for every able-bodied Muslim.
Officials say there are 158 people still in the hospital.
Officials have ordered a one million rial (about £174,000) payment to the relatives of the dead, and a similar amount to the irreversibly injured.
The other victims will get half of that amount.
The head of B&Q says the trend is due to the presence of low-paid Eastern European craftsmen.
According to Veronique Laury, the British are increasingly hiring repair specialists
The number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe is growing
The result is more than 200 new Screwfix stores for professionals .
Simultaneously, Kingfisher is closing 60 B&Q stores across the country.
The author is Rupert Steiner, chief city correspondent for the Daily Mail.
They say the British are putting away their hammers and paintbrushes and instead are hiring skilled Eastern Europeans to do the housework.
If you can handle a hammer or paint a wall, it seems like you're in the minority these days.
Because, according to the company that owns B&Q, Britons are increasingly hiring handyman workers to do simple household chores.
Veronique Lory, the new CEO of Kingfisher, which owns a chain of home improvement services, said that behind this trend is a significant influx of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe offering services at minimal prices.
As a result, Kingfisher plans to open another 200 Screwfix stores specializing in crafts goods, and close 60 B&Q storefronts at the same time.
Ms. Lojari said she would like to see more women on the B&Q staff, as eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women.
Currently, the majority of the staff are men.
She said recent demographic trends, which have seen a rise in single-woman households, are also being noticed, with more single women building their own homes than in the past.
Mrs. Laurie said: "Our stores are still predominantly male-run.
Steps must be taken to achieve balance.
Overall, half of our customers are women, and 80 percent of our purchasing decisions are made by women.
Women play a big role in the decision-making process.
Ms. Laurie, one of five women at the helm of the UK's top companies whose shares are included in the FTSE100, has also changed the composition of the top management team, with an equal number of men and women among the directors.
Kingfisher is the only company in the world where exactly 50 percent of the board is female, including the CEO and the CFO.
Mrs. Laurie said, "It was a conscious decision, diversification is an important issue for us.
Finding the right women for the board was not difficult.
After the group took on the cost of closing stores, Kingfisher reported a six-month decline in profits and sales.
As a result of this trend, Kingfisher, which owns the Screwfix and B&Q brands, is opening 200 new stores.
The time of the decision on the US Federal Reserve interest rate
The world is watching the Federal Reserve Bank hold a two-day meeting to discuss the most important decision in the history of the Federal Reserve, whether or not to raise interest rates for the first time in a decade.
A Reuters poll of 80 economists found that just over half of those who thought the Federal Reserve would do so last week now believe it will delay and keep rates in the current range of 0 to 0.25 percent.
This is a historic event, as it has been seven years since the Federal Reserve cut interest rates to zero.
For the first time, we are approaching the point where the central bank can move from zero to normalize interest rates", said Angel Ubiede, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.
The U.S. economy is doing well, the economic boom is adding trillions of dollars to the balance sheet, and inflation is very low.
But the Federal Reserve cannot ignore how this decision will affect the global economy.
He warned the markets to prepare for the change, but all of this says is that they are confident that the odds are against it.
The decision will be announced at 20.00 CET on Thursday.
The new Balkan route: refugees are coming to the EU via Croatia.
"Open!" shout hundreds of refugees at the Horghos checkpoint on the Serbian-Hungarian border.
Budapest has closed its border to migrants since Tuesday.
Asylum seekers are already starting to explore alternative routes to the EU.
One of them bypasses the closed border with Serbia through Romania.
The other one is through Croatia and Slovenia to Austria.
According to some reports, buses that had been carrying refugees from Serbia to Hungary are now heading to the town of Šid on the Croatian border.
Drivers have been instructed by authorities to follow without stopping.
Serbia's Minister of Interior, Nebojša Stepanović, assures that his country is doing everything in its power to help the refugees, but that its capabilities are limited:
Our job is to make Serbia as safe as possible.
On the other hand, we must also help these people, and ensure that they are treated humanely.
But this is a European problem.
It's not easy to solve, no country in Europe can do it alone, let alone a small country like Serbia.
Belgrade is asking Budapest to open the border for refugees who don't want to stay in Serbia.
But Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban is adamant:
If someone is considered a refugee, he or she must complete the necessary documents in Serbia.
And if he doesn't, he won't be allowed into our country either, because Serbia is perfectly safe.
Hungary has already built a 175-kilometer fence on the border with Serbia.
But Orban is not going to stop there: he plans to build a similar fence on the border with Romania.
Bucharest has already said that this is incompatible with European principles.
Vangelis Meimarakis: "Europe is here to help us".
Vangelis Meimarakis was for years a member of the centre-right governments that leftists believe led the country to financial crisis.
Now, as the interim leader of the New Democracy party, he is challenging Tsipras.
A few days before the election, he met with a journalist from Evronws.
Mr. Maimarakis, welcome to the Euronews!
Vangelis Meimarakis: Thank you for inviting me to your party.
Euronews: Nine months ago, your party suffered a crushing defeat, losing to the Syriza coalition, but now, according to polls, New Democracy is on a par with it in popularity.
What has changed over time?
Vangelis Meimarakis: Greece has changed, and so have we.
Mr. Tsipras lied a lot in January of last year.
Nine months ago, Greece had a budget surplus and prospects for economic growth.
Now the country is back to a deficit and high unemployment.
The investors left because Mr. Tsipras kicked them out.
In the last nine months, the Greeks have had the opportunity to assess the situation the country was in in January and the false promises of Mr. Tsipras.
And now they can easily compare what was promised with what actually happened.
Daily life has become noticeably worse compared to January, when the situation was improving, and this affected most Greek citizens.
Evreunews: But you say that if you win the elections, you will seek alliances with other parties, including SYRIZA.
VANGELIS MAIMARAKIS: The thing is, as we've learned in the last few years, Greece cannot move forward without understanding and cooperation.
It is no coincidence that in all the other countries where rescue programmes have been or are still in operation, political forces and all the ruling parties have come together to implement the programme on which they have agreed, without renouncing their political or ideological autonomy.
That's why I firmly believe that at this stage, only the cooperation of political forces and institutions will allow the country to move forward.
Euronews: Your party voted in favour of an agreement between Mr. Tsipras and the country's creditors.
If you become the new Prime Minister on Monday, will you keep this agreement or will you try to change it, at least in part?
VANGELIS MAIMARAKIS: We actually voted to move Greece along the European path because we have a good idea of the disastrous consequences that leaving the EU would have.
Europe is helping us by subsidizing our farmers for their produce, we have solidarity funds, the Juncker package and assistance in the banking sector.
All of this would have been lost if there hadn't been a treaty with Europe.
But the current austerity measures are the result of how Mr. Tsipras negotiated.
I know Europe has no desire to destroy us.
Europe wants to help us.
So if Europe sees that the new Greek government, in its first year in power, wants to bring order, acts rationally and shows that the country has a strong political will to implement the rescue program, then I am sure that all the commitments that cannot be fulfilled because they lead to a recession can be renegotiated, but only after a certain time.
It would be a mistake to think that we can go back to negotiating with our creditors within the first year of the new agreement, because they expect full implementation of the agreement.
If we want to regain their trust, we must continue the privatisation, reforms and structural changes that have been agreed, while continuing to benefit from EU funding and the great investment opportunities that we must open up for better understanding and cooperation with Europe.
Unfortunately, during the negotiations, the Tsipras government failed to make any serious arguments on many key political issues, as we have learned from discussions with our European counterparts.
I can give you an example of farmers' incomes.
We have explained to our European partners that this is not a fixed monthly income and therefore cannot be fully taxed in advance.
We were told that Tsipras' ministers never mentioned it.
That is, the Greek ministers were unprepared and ill-informed, and therefore failed to negotiate and to conclude a failed agreement.
Evro: If you win the elections, you will soon be sitting at the same table with Mr. Juncker, Mr. Hollande, Mrs. Merkel and other European leaders.
Will what you tell them be different from what your predecessor, Antonis Samaras, told them?
VANGELIS MAYMARAKIS: First of all, I would explain to them that until the end of 2014, we were trying to do our best to implement the 2012 agreement, bypassing the sharp corners that were in it.
We pushed for reform.
Of course, we lacked the necessary determination and speed, but we acted in an emergency.
The market had fallen, and there were no potential buyers willing to pay the price set by the Greek government.
I was the Speaker of Parliament at the time, and I managed to get the three parliamentary groups, which then constituted the government majority, to agree on a common position.
Despite their deep ideological differences on key bills, we had a functioning parliament, and this in the presence of populists and extremists, and mass demonstrations outside.
And we managed to bring the country back to a normal situation, which would have continued to improve if the process had not been interrupted by the snap general election that resulted in the December presidential election.
Evronyuz: In recent weeks, a massive influx of refugees has been moving through Greece.
What do you think about this situation, and the reaction of the European countries that these people are aiming for?
Vangelis Meimarakis: The refugee crisis is a time bomb that we will have to deal with after winning the election.
And the reason is that the Syriza government has not acted in this situation as it should have.
You have to be on the front-line in these matters, because if the problem catches up with you, then all you have is emergency measures.
And that's exactly where we are now.
Even the interim government that replaced SYRIZA did more in just seven days than Mr. Tsipras did in seven months.
I am sure that these actions of the provisional government, which is being assisted by the President of the Republic, who has called for the EU summit, will help to find a solution.
We need to see how many refugees can leave the country, and note that refugees are not illegal immigrants.
They're victims of the war in Syria, victims of some extraordinary event that happened to them.
There is a deep humanitarian aspect to this issue and we will be adhering to the position that European politicians must take in this new situation.
The EU summit should take a decision on this, and the United Nations should be involved.
We also need better coordination, more effective border controls and refugee reception centers.
We also need to make good use of the economic aid we receive from the EU in order to be able to deal with this pressing problem.
Euronews: Mr. Maimarakis, thank you for this interview.
VANGELIS MEIMARAKIS: Thank you very much for your time.
In the peaceful city of Druzhkovka, Donetsk region, during the day, the criminal investigation officers of the Main Police Department of the region, together with military counterintelligence, identified and detained the suspect, a 34-year-old Ukrainian serviceman from the city of Krivoy Rog (Dnepropetrovsk region), who the previous evening during a joint consumption of alcoholic beverages and the conflict in the village of Verkhnetoreetsk, Yassinovatskiy district of Donetsk, fired from an automatic weapon at his opponent.
The report of a 22-year-old man's injuries came from the hospital where he was admitted with a gunshot wound to his leg.
According to Artem Vasitskiy, deputy head of the Criminal Investigation Department of the regional police headquarters, during the operational actions, law enforcement officers proved the involvement of the suspect in another serious criminal offence - the murder of a 41-year-old resident of the same village.
Operatives determined that the same day, the suspect and another local resident had a dispute, resulting in a fatal gunshot wound to the head.
The investigative department of the Druzhkovskaya district opened criminal proceedings under the articles "Killings" and "intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm" of the Criminal Code of Ukraine.
The prisoner faces up to 15 years in prison.
The suspect was detained and placed in a temporary detention facility, the press service of the Donetsk region police reported.
Two residents of Novosibirsk, who painted several Soviet monuments in the colors of the Ukrainian flag, including two monuments to Vladimir Lenin, were sentenced by a Russian court to prison.
Two other residents of the city were sentenced to restricted liberty.
The inmates who received prison terms were sentenced to 2.5 years and 2 years of imprisonment.
Two other convicts were given 14- and 18-month prison sentences.
The Lenin court of Novosibirsk found four citizens guilty of vandalism against the monuments to Lenin, which were located on the territory of the CPRF district committee and on the street of Trikotaj, as well as the memorial complex "Monuement of Glory".
In the latter case, the "Katyuša" missile system and the T-34 tank were painted.
We will remind, on the night of December 12 in the Russian Novosibirsk unknowns painted in the colors of the Ukrainian flag military equipment on the Monument of Glory.
The civil spouse of popular Russian actor Yevgeny Tsiganov Irina Leonova has given birth to her seventh child.
The girl was born in one of the Moscow clinics.
The newborn and her mother are doing well.
Let's remind you that recently, the gypsies and Leonova broke up.
Yevgeny refuses to comment.
Irina blames her husband and his ambition for everything.
Evgeny Tsiganov is 36 years old.
He is an actor of the Moscow theater "Workshop of Peter Fomenko".
He is known for the films "Progalka", "Kosmos as a premonition", "Brest fortress", the series "Ottepel" and "Farts".
On September 8, Yevgeny Tsyganov was recognized as "Actor of the Year" and "Man of the Year" by the Russian version of the popular magazine GQ.
The man who opened fire at Delta State University left a note apologizing
After shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later that day - Shannon Lamb wrote a note saying he "regrets" the first murder and would like to "make it all right again", authorities said Tuesday.
Police in Gottier, Mississippi, report that a geography and social studies professor at Delta State University called 911 at about 10 a.m.
Monday and reported that he shot someone.
Lamb told the dispatcher that the police needed to send people to his house.
He reported, "I killed my wife last night", and also mentioned that there was a "dog" in the house that "would not hurt anyone", but was probably upset.
The police asked the caller's name, but he didn't say.
Lamb didn't explain why he opened fire.
When police arrived at the scene, they found the body of Amy Prentiss, 41, and a handwritten note from Lamb, 45, that said, "I'm sorry. I'd like to get everything back.
I loved Amy and she's the only one who ever loved me.
After writing the note, Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University, where he killed Ethan Schmidt, a history teacher, and then on Monday night, when surrounded by police, he killed himself.
University president William LaForge reported that he was unaware of any conflict between Lamb and Schmidt, but "Mr. Lamb was clearly up to something".
Despite reports on Monday that Lamb was suggesting a romance between Prentiss and Schmidt, officials on Tuesday reported "no information or evidence" of a "love triangle".
O'Prentiss described her as a "good person" to Sean O'Steen, who reportedly had been married to her for about seven years.
They got divorced 15 years ago, but they're still friends.
O'Steen said he and Prentice had a daughter who was 19 and "uncomfortable".
He added that Prentice and her daughter were "best friends".
According to Lindsay Knowles, whom the Sun Herald calls Prentice's close friend, Prentice worked from home via the Internet.
Knowles said that Prentice had a hunting dog named Lightning, and that she had been dating Lamb for about three years.
Knowles said, "She always wanted to help people".
Police say Lamb called his family at some point on Monday to say he "wasn't going to jail".
Later that night, when police caught up with him on Route 1 near Greenville, Lamb stopped the car, jumped out, ran into the woods, and shot himself.
According to a resume posted on the university's website, Lamb earned a doctorate in education from Delta State University in the spring of 2015.
Stars that lost their fortune
The actor (left), pictured with his son Redmond (right), has had a difficult few years.
In 2001, he battled leukemia, and in 2009, he lost his longtime partner, Farrah Fawcett, to cancer.
The actor also reportedly suffered from drug addiction, and in 2008 he was arrested for drug possession.
All of this certainly played a part.
Luke Shaw has been ruled out for a couple of months by Manchester United with a double fracture.
Luke Shaw broke his right leg in two places during a Champions League match in which Manchester United lost to PSV in Eindhoven.
While the defender is worried about this, which will keep him off the pitch for at least six months, Louis van Gaal is hopeful that Shaw can play again this season.
The injury occurred during Hector Moreno's reckless 15-minute drive when 20-year-old Shaw stormed the PSV penalty area.
He was treated in the field for nine minutes and given oxygen before being taken to the hospital.
Van Gaal said, "He has a double fracture and is in the hospital".
He'll be transferred to Manchester tomorrow or the day after, and then operated on.
It's terrible, a young man comes to Manchester United at the age of 18, overcomes great difficulties and starts playing fantastically, and this is what happens.
He had an oxygen mask in the locker room.
He was crying.
I'm not a doctor, but if you have a double hernia, it's for six months, and the kid can't play in the group stage.
I hope he can play again this season.
Moreno was lucky he didn't get a red card and a penalty.
The referee Nicola Rizzoli did not punish the Mexican.
Van Gaal thinks the Italian referee made a mistake.
Judge for yourself when I say it's worth a penalty and a red card.
That was a very bad two-legged slide.
In a tweet, Shaw wrote: "Thanks for all your messages, words cannot describe how devastated I am, my road to recovery is just beginning, I will be back even stronger than I was".
Also on the topic: Manchester United suffered a Luke Shaw mishap in their PSV loss
The English defender will have an extra boost to prepare for the European Championship in France next June.
Philippe Cocqou, the PSV coach, said: "It is a very serious injury".
When any player goes down with an injury like that, everybody's very upset about it.
It was never the intent of our players to injure the opponent.
Moreno suffered a broken leg while playing for Mexico against Van Gaal's Netherlands in the 2014 World Cup.
"It's very difficult for him now because he didn't have the intention of hurting the opponent, and when you hear that it's a very bad injury, you feel bad", Koko said.
I didn't get a chance to see the moment.
All I could see was the ball that was flying in the other direction, so it looked like he (Moreno) touched it, but I didn't see a pod under Luca.
Speaking to SBS6, Moreno said: "I know what it is, I know how hard it is to bear.
It's very hard for me, and I'm very sorry.
Andres Guardado of PSV was also taken to hospital after a clash with Chris Smolling.
Does David Cameron know anything else about the Lorax?
One thing every parent learns very quickly is that if your child likes a book, it will take a while for you to know it almost by heart.
I guess, unless you are David Cameron.
When asked by a company that provides holiday packages for children about his favourite children's book, the Prime Minister chose The Lorax, an environmentally-oriented story written by Dr. Seuss in 1971.
It was a difficult choice, Cameron wrote in a comment posted on the SuperCamps website, and continues: "This funny, moving, unusual story with a strong message I love to read to my children, because there is always some image or message that we are missing".
And all would be well except for the last paragraph, where Cameron is supposed to retell the book's content, but actually tells the plot of the 2012 film of the same name, with new characters and details added to diversify the rather short original narrative.
"In the walled city of Allnutville, where there was no greenery and even the air was sold for money, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams, by fulfilling her wish to see a real tree", the text reads, describing the love story of the unknown Dr. Seuss (real name Theodore Seuss Geisel), who died in 1991.
If that doesn't sound suspicious enough, Cameron's text reads almost like a synopsis of the plot of "The Lorax" posted on the Internet Movie Database: "In the high-walled city of All-Nuskyville, where everything was artificial and even air was for sale, a boy named Ted hopes to win the heart of Audrey, the girl of his dreams".
It seems unlikely that Cameron, a self-confessed active parent, is so unfamiliar with the content of a book in which an unnamed boy learns about the environmental destruction of greedy tree-cutter and "all-purpose" knitter Nakhodkins, despite protests from Lorax (whose name is in the book's title) - a funny creature with a mustache who "speaks for the trees".
It's likely that such a simple PR task was given to a performer who had never read a child a book about the Lorax 20 times in a row.
A Downing Street spokeswoman said the text was allegedly obtained from Cameron's office in the constituency.
SuperCamps confirmed that the text was obtained from Cameron's headquarters, but no further comment was forthcoming.
For Adam Leith, there was clearly a risk of not making the England squad, but it's still a difficult question.
To beat Pakistan in the UAE is a difficult task, but if you look at the team that England have selected for this tour, a repeat of the 3-0 loss in the Test series that happened last time, doesn't seem to me to be possible.
I wouldn't rule out winning on my own court either.
Alistair Cook's team may be less experienced than it was three years ago, but it has players who are skilled at handling curveballs and have strong team spirit among the defenders; they will not bring scars from 2012, but only youthful positivity.
With the ball, Moeen Ali is a bowler who delivers twisted balls, and Adil Rashid, even if he is an unknown figure for the test level, represents an attacking option.
Adam Leet has been dropped from the England Test team and replaced by Alex Hales.
The decision to expel Adam Leith from the Yorkshire club is difficult for me to analyse.
His seven Test matches have seen him take two good attacks in difficult conditions, and the obvious but cruel reality is that cricketers are judged by the results of the match.
There were no questions about John Ruth, for example, which led to this ad, because (and I've said this before) players are best choosing themselves.
A couple of hundred, and Lita could have had a longer career, but he was in control of his own destiny.
Hopefully, if he's got more hits for Yorkshire, there's another chance.
The England coach, Trevor Bayliss, has been very positive about him, even when he hasn't shown what he's capable of, and that doesn't surprise me; he's a team player first, and then everything else.
How long it takes for a Test cricketer to make an impression is a difficult question.
Leath played in seven games, as did Sam Robson before him, and Nick Compton in nine.
Only Compton gets to play on his own and somebody else's court.
The only thing you could complain about is that England picked Jonathan Trott for the Caribbean Premier League when Leith was in top form, but that missed opportunity is in the past.
Alex Hales comes in, and he's a batsman I hold in high esteem.
He's the unpredictable cricketer we saw at Yorkshire earlier this season when he hit 236 against us at Trent Bridge, which was a bit of a stretch.
He should at least be given the same opportunity as those who came before him, but that will, of course, depend on the composition of the UAE team.
The idea of putting Moen next to Cook as the opening batsman, which would allow for an extra spinner, while keeping four fast bowlers, is being considered, and I'm not opposed to it at all.
I don't see any reason why a batsman can't bowl there, and this left-hander has already shown he's a hell of a cricketer.
Moen may not be quite what you need for your Worcestershire, but he's number three for them, and there's not much difference.
My old teammate Justin Langer played his first 38 Test matches as a third-striker before making his debut in 2001.
He won the three hundred and never looked back.
Anfarsari comes into the squad as a reserve spinner, and in my brief interaction with him, he seemed to me a very promising young man.
People might look at his average -- 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball -- and think it's a risky bet, but among the spinners voting for, there's not many, and the selectors chose youth.
He'll learn a lot on this tour.
Aside from the national team, England are planning to make a couple of practical additions to the coaching staff.
The appointment of Mahela Jayawardena, the Sri Lankan batsman, as a consultant for the Test matches could be a masterful move.
He's one of the best guys in the game, who will bring in the richest experience, gained in all possible conditions and in any attack.
Paul Collingwood is going to be included in those games where the white ball is used, and he'll provide both energy and relentless pace in the set.
I always felt he was born to be involved in international cricket, whether as a player or a coach, and like Mahela, he has a considerable intellect.
Sometimes new voices in the locker room, even if they say what's already been said, can give a new boost to the team.
Collie's teammate Ben Stokes is on a one-day leave, Ruth has a similar break for Australia, and I, for one, have no problem with that.
While not everyone agrees, coaches and selectors do not determine the schedule.
And you must remember, as players, their position depends on the results.
These decisions are never made lightly.
The Brexit camp could win if the economy is in a depression by 2017
David Cameron's ill-conceived policy of resuming talks on keeping Britain in the EU is getting more and more difficult every day, even without looking back at the election of the brilliant Jeremy - "Is it a yes or no?" - Corbyn as Labour leader or TUC's outrage over Europe on Tuesday.
Foreigners have their Corbins and Nigel Farage.
A friendly European diplomat explained the other day that with the EU now in a state of crisis of many kinds - not all of which it has created - some member states are fed up with Britain's self-serving agenda, which is sowing discord and undermining agreements that they largely do not want.
Gathering in Brighton for the annual meeting, the TUC decided it didn't want them anyway, if they were destroying social security.
We could even call it the "Dave and George Selfie Program".
The Prime Minister and the Finance Minister ride through summits and bilateral sessions in foreign capitals, take pictures of themselves against the backdrop of a famous local monument, with or without a local celebrity, then come home and say they're bringing in allies for reform.
It's all about me.
My European friend, who wants a British interest in maintaining external contacts under the guise of the European Union - "Don't leave us with France", says Berlin - suggests that the foreign ministers and officials in some capitals should come to an understanding when they feel it is all the same whether we stay or go.
Angela Merkel, the very cautious German chancellor, is an ally, but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the cabinet before the situation gets worse for her, as it has for the sitting Thatcher (11 years old), Mitterrand (14) and Kohl (16).
French President Francois Hollande faces re-election or replacement in 2017.
He's losing his power too.
Poland may soon have a right-wing nationalist government, Spain a left-wing one.
It's hard to see them going out of their way to help the "selfie-Brit" whose energy could be spent on preventing Scotland from leaving the UK - which they don't want either, because most of them have similar separatist tendencies.
So some of these ministers may even be planning to issue deliberately useless SNP-style remarks during the UK referendum campaign in 2017 to spur the process of the UK leaving the EU, my friend suggests.
"The review was a fixation" and "Britain got nothing of value from the resumed negotiations".
Europeans know for a fact what a predator Fleet Street can be and how skeptical media moguls are of the EU, unlike at the time of Tony Benn's 1975 referendum, which backed our joining in 1973 by a 2:1 ratio.
They may vaguely remember Boris Johnson, the hard-line Euro-opportunist who made his name as a Brussels correspondent's "straight bananas" in the early 1990s.
For all his stupidity, Ed Miliband knew who his enemies were.
They included a motley crew of tax-shy crooks, phone-hacking outsiders and pseudo-non-residents who own most of our major newspapers.
Tony Blair actually thought the same thing, but he realized that when you're in a cage with a ferocious gorilla, you should give it a banana to distract it from eating you for lunch and tea.
In fact, Milliband was a bigger supporter of Blair than Blair was of Cameron's referendum idea, as Blair had made a principled compromise in favour of the repealed EU constitution, which was buried by French and Dutch voters in 2005, who gave him the winning ticket.
The press didn't forgive him for any of it.
But the nice Jeremy Corbyn who patted me on the back in Westminster on Monday - I told him he had no more time to waste on me - seems to be risking a repeat of Neil Kinnock's '80s boycott of Murdoch strategy, a mistake both then and now.
It may take time, but he needs to develop a consistent strategy for dealing with the press -- not with me, but with Andrew Marr, whose couch he sat on at the BBC on Sunday.
Corbyn's official position on Europe is what I delicately call evolution.
He says he would like us to stay in a reformed EU.
Indeed, most people outside the traditionalist Ukip tendency and the wider "Little England" Tory circle can probably say "yes" to this.
That's the same thing Hillary "Benn, but not Bennit" said on radio and TV this week, with his inner boy scout struggling to admit that Corbyn's appointment of the obnoxious John McDonnell as the Shadow Chancellor was a bad idea.
It reminded me of the 1970s, when his old father was fighting his way through the TV for disloyalty to his Labour cabinet colleagues, without going too far and losing his cabinet post.
The battle of Hilary was more appealing.
But the fight to stay "in any circumstances" - the phrase Bennet used - is not what McDonnell said, and not what J.K. said to the parliamentarians and members of parliament in a private meeting on Monday night, in the common opinion.
Whatever the Democrat and "his boy" Corbyn might be trying to communicate -- and remember, he even touched me -- the discipline of the message remains important in an age of 24-hour TV, seven days a week, and especially in the turmoil of social media, a hotbed of paranoia and betrayal.
It's smart to keep Cameron from getting away with it, allowing him to take Labour's support for the referendum campaign for granted, as McDonnell put it.
Simon Jenkins certainly seems to think so.
But McDonnell and Corbyn's basic misconception about EU membership - in the context of a "Bennist" economy of a besieged fortress - is no longer a matter of esoteric debate among left-wing dissidents, for whom narcissism born of insignificant difference is a central tenet in dogmatic disputes.
As for his misconceptions about NATO - Tom Watson is adamant that J.K. will not campaign for an exit - foreign diplomats will be obliged to try to convey this to their leaders at home.
Why would Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspicious voters - on concessions to Britain when it could all be pointless?
The US is already very disappointed with the weak British military action in Iraq, Libya and Syria, even as the Tory government in power is cutting costs, as I was reminded on Monday at lunch at a forum called British Influence Security.
Experts criticise the review of e-cigarettes by Public Health England
The claims by the government-funded agency that e-cigarettes are 95 percent less harmful than smoking were made by 12 people at the meeting, some of whom are associated with the tobacco industry, the researchers said.
Experts published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) along with the Lancet have criticised the evidence used by Public Health England (PHE) in its report on e-cigarettes.
PHE released a landmark report last month, calling it a "comprehensive review of the evidence".
But some researchers have questioned the accuracy of the data and pointed to the association of some experts with the tobacco industry.
An editorial in the medical journal Lancet last month criticized the "extremely shaky argument" on which PHE based its main conclusion.
In the BMJ article, two other researchers questioned whether these claims had "strong or shaky grounds".
Martin McKee, a lecturer in European health organization at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and Simon Capewell, a lecturer in clinical epidemiology at the University of Liverpool, reported: "The fundamental principle of health policy is that it should be based on evidence of effectiveness".
They said the public would expect PHE's assertion that "the current best estimate shows e-cigarettes to be about 95% less harmful than tobacco smoking" to be based on a detailed examination of the evidence and modelling.
In fact, this is from a single meeting of 12 people who came together to develop a model of a multi-criteria decision analysis to summarize their views on the harms associated with various nicotine-containing products; the results of the meeting are summarized in a scientific publication.
McKee and Capewell reported that one of the sponsors of the meeting was a company called EuroSwiss Health, whose CEO was reported to have previously received funding from British American Tobacco for independent research.
It also confirmed BAT certifications in the health sector in a sustainability report.
One of the 12 people at the meeting announced funding from the e-cigarette manufacturer, without mentioning the funding he had previously reportedly received from the Philip Morris tobacco company.
No reasonable explanation for the selection of the council members was provided, but there are several prominent e-cigarette advocates among them, some of whom also claimed industry funding in the publication.
It's not clear if the other participants in the meeting have any management experience in the tobacco business.
The meeting was also attended by the head of the tobacco department at PHE.
The scientific paper published by the group "strongly agrees" that there is a lack of "serious evidence of harmful effects of most products on most criteria", McKee and Capewell wrote.
However, none of these connections and limitations were addressed in the PHE report.
McKee and Capwell said that PHE's claim that "there is no evidence at this time that e-cigarettes are a route that leads children or non-smokers to smoke" is premature.
Professor Kevin Fenton, head of health and wellbeing at PHE, said the BMJ had responded to the statements earlier.
He said: "E-cigarettes are far less harmful than tobacco smoking".
One of the two lifelong smokers died from his addiction.
All the evidence suggests that the health risks from e-cigarettes are relatively small, but we need to continue to study the long-term effects.
PHE has a clear duty to inform the public about what this evidence does and does not prove, especially where the public has had doubts about the relative hazards compared to tobacco.
About 80,000 people a year die from smoking-related illnesses, and smoking costs the NHS £2 billion a year.
By clearly stating the obvious - that while e-cigarettes are not safe, they cause only a fraction of the harm that smoking does - we are fulfilling our mission to the nation.
The former head of Channel 4 believes the BBC should end EastEnders
Former Channel 4 chief executive Luke Johnson believes the BBC should stop producing programmes like EastEnders and The Voice, noting that their business rivals would give a lot for such successful shows as the soap opera about "Albert Square".
Johnson remarked that the licence fees should only be used to produce programmes that were not produced by other British broadcasters.
He criticised the BBC for putting public service programmes, which are probably only watched by a small percentage of the audience, on prime time when rivals have top rated shows, and on channels such as BBC4.
After BBC chief executive Tony Hall said the corporation would like to work more with other organisations, Johnson noted that he had tried unsuccessfully to work with the BBC for six years during his time at Channel 4.
"I cannot help but think that the BBC is preparing to launch and broadcast programmes that could be shown by competing companies that are not receiving subsidies", Johnson told members of the House of Lords Communications Committee as part of a probe into the future of the BBC.
If you keep the licence fee, which I don't think is a good solution in the medium to long term, then the companies should keep only those programs on the air that are not produced and are not going to be produced by other companies.
The Voice is going to be on prime time because the creators want to get as much support as possible for the future.
The idea that no one else would show it is ridiculous and obviously absurd.
Johnson: "I don't understand why regressive taxes should go to fund shows that could be sponsored without subsidies.
The Voice is one example, EastEnders is another; it's well known that they're self-produced.
Other channels would certainly give a lot for it.
I don't understand how this is a public broadcast.
I don't think it would have brought down the BBC in any way.
Serial entrepreneur Johnson, who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010, accused the BBC of chasing ratings "because of the ambition of staff and because of their belief that this is the best way to get long-term support".
His comments on the BBC's most popular shows echo those of Sky's chief executive Tony Ball, who in his 2003 McTaggart memorial lecture in Edinburgh suggested the BBC sell off series such as EastEnders.
Johnson noted that the more niche BBC public service broadcasts "continue to run on BBC4 where you can't often gauge the audience but the company's function is fulfilled, and this can be put forward as an argument in the fancy sermons justifying the £4bn licence fee revenue: 'well yes, of course we do all these incomprehensible programmes that nobody watches'.
They put them in a slot where no one will ever look at them.
Regarding the license fee, Johnson told the committee: "I urge you to find a more regressive system as to who gets the most out of it.
Of course, you all think, we all think that £150 a year is a huge amount of money, but for people who think £150 is a lot of money, I wonder if they think that because they don't watch or listen to the BBC very much.
Former Sky and Channel 5 chief executive David Elstein, who also appeared before the committee on Tuesday, said the BBC should reconsider its Rite mission in favour of "inform, educate and entertain".
He noted that only a tiny fraction of the BBC's output is formally classified as educational - he said that's 1% of television content and 0.1% of radio - and that the company should embrace the "inform, educate and entertain" initiative of the Australian and Canadian broadcasters.
On partnerships, Elstein said the BBC should make more efforts in areas such as "Promenade concerts" (only a part of which, he says, is shown on TV), and also enter into alliances with commercial broadcasters to make them available for viewing online.
Sonogenetics allows you to control brain cells with sound waves
In this video, you can see how the nematodes change direction when they are exposed to sound.
Scientists have produced worms with a genetically modified nervous system that can be controlled using pulses of sound waves.
Tiny nematodes change direction when they are hit by sound pulses that are too loud for the human ear to hear.
The impulses exert their effects by activating neurons genetically engineered to use membrane channels that respond to ultrasound waves.
Also in this issue: Researchers control brain activity with light
The scientists said the worms are demonstrating a new technique called sonogenetics, which involves using ultrasound to stimulate specific cells in the brain, heart and muscles, with the ultrasound source located outside the body.
Shrikant Chalsani, a research fellow at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, California, told the Guardian that the technique could one day replace deep brain stimulation, an invasive procedure that sends electrical impulses to the brain and is used to treat Parkinson's disease.
The nematode worms normally don't respond to ultrasound, but Chalasani found that they started to respond when they were placed in a liquid containing microscopic bubbles.
He found that the bubbles amplified the ultrasonic waves, which then penetrated the worms' bodies.
The enhanced ultrasound waves act on structures called "TRP-4 ion channels", found in the membranes of some worm cells.
The ultrasonic waves cause these ion channels to open and excite the cells that are connected to them, reports a report in Nature Communications.
To create nematodes that could be manipulated by ultrasound, Chalasani genetically modified worms so that their motor neurons used TRP-4 ion channels.
When ultrasound was used to target the modified organisms, the sound waves were amplified by microscopic bubbles and introduced into the worm organism, activating the modified motor neurons.
This technique is similar to that used in optogenetics, a new field that allows scientists to turn neurons on and off with light pulses.
Chalasani argues that sonogenetics may have some advantages over this technique.
Unlike light, which is delivered to the right part of the brain by optical fiber, low-frequency ultrasound waves travel freely through body tissues, so they don't need to go inside the skull to be delivered.
"We believe that the use of gene therapy and therapeutic viruses to treat certain neurological diseases in clinical settings could temporarily make human neurons sensitive to ultrasound", said Chalasani.
He added that the technique could also be applied to muscle and insulin-producing cells.

Advertisements mock the British arms trade
Watch the video of Amnesty International protesting the arms exhibition.
The most amazing killer drones!
The iron chains that destroy the legs!
The cluster bombs!
Electric light-noise batons that cause excruciating pain but leave no trace!
The cheerful voice and animated animation leave no doubt that this ad for the world's largest international arms exhibition is a sickening parody prepared by Amnesty International to draw attention to the British government's intention to "push" arms to repressive regimes by taking advantage of the ExCeL defense technology and security exhibition in Docklands.
More on the subject: DSEI arms exhibition: authoritarian regimes are coming to London
But the special campaign also results in the sudden appearance of many posters at bus stops and in subway trains that demand to be looked at again.
"Important announcement coming on the DLR line from September 15 to 18?" - written on one of them in the fonts of the London Underground with the image of the DLR line turning into a silhouette of a tank.
This September, a mob of arms dealers will storm the DLR line, asking passengers to help stop the arms show.
300 posters by artists who exhibited their work at the Museum of Cruel Design in Banksy's Dismaland Park.
A collective called the Special Patrol Group helped distribute them around London using "the ad space hacking kit", a 6-pound set of wrenches that is claimed to "access about a third of the planet's advertising space at bus stops".
London's transport industry is not happy with this kind of vandalism in the form of unauthorised posters.
One of the parody ads put out by the Special Patrol Group.
According to Gavin Grindon, curator of Cruel Designs and a lecturer at the University of Essex, artists are becoming more demanding and seeking to bring political art to audiences beyond the galleries.
Many artists start working with activists of protest movements because they understand that they have to go out into the real world for their art if they want to have an impact on society.
Another poster against the arms exhibition, greeting passengers on the subway.
The video from Amnesty has been viewed over 100,000 times in 24 hours on Facebook and was created by VCCP, a pro bono agency that employs a graphic designer and voice artist who also work for free.
Matt Lever, creative director of VCCP, was struck by the publicity silence around the arms exhibition - with a gap in the ExCel calendar - and thought, "Let's give them the campaign they're trying to avoid".
They thought they would create a more realistic and clever corporate advertisement, but "it turned out to be a more exciting activity to fill the house with bright colors and animation".
"They have been incredibly helpful in bringing the sale of illegal torture equipment to the attention of the trade show", said Tom Davies of Amnesty.
Now we need the UK government to take action and ensure that this torture equipment is not illegally sold right on our doorstep.
Perhaps the most creative art on the arms exhibition comes from inside ExCeL, where participants trade in fantastically euphemistic products.
In a press release, Saab revealed that the US Army had ordered the "AT4CS RS for shoulder firing".
It includes "an unparalleled cumulative warhead that delivers unmatched in-target close-in action".
Whatever he's doing, it's not going to be pleasant.
The eight golden rules of living in student housing
It's been 11 years since I moved into a dorm room as a normal 19-year-old, still believing in the Berets and moral relativism, but only now do I remember the elongated smiles of those I've annoyed - and the numerous, long complaints about others.
Most of what I've learned can be broken down into eight simple rules.
Moving into a dorm can range from mildly nerve-wracking to downright frightening.
He encourages you to talk, to tell people where you're from, whether you took a sabbatical and where you spent it, whether you support Corbin and why you "honestly don't love or hate Marmite, because seriously, guys, it's just yeast extract, I'll be fine".
Take a breath. You know what?
And help others to rest too - ask questions and show interest.
It keeps the conversation going and helps you find people you like, not people you wouldn't talk to if your wrists were on fire and they were handing out fire extinguishers.
Give the people some space.
People's bedrooms often become drinking establishments, midnight movie theaters and social clubs, but they are also places where people dress and mend their underwear.
And on a related note, don't even think about going to college while you're in a relationship.
Introverts are treated unfairly in universities.
Your room should be a place of refuge, but many dormitories create a culture of moving from one room to another, which fosters friendships, relationships, and leads to long-term relationships.
It can be hell for someone trying to regain their strength.
There's nothing in the culture that allows you to say, "I like you, and I want to be friends with you, but I need you to go away so I can recoup the energy I've spent talking to you".
Try to sense when a classmate is tired of communication - and not knock on him, but send a text.
Speaking of knocking, do that.
There was a guy in my dorm who had a policy that if the door was unlocked, he was invited in.
He saw something.
Make friends with a bakery.
Because you're starting college at the height of the Bake-Off, knocking on people's doors to introduce yourself and hand them a plate of chocolate biscuits is not so strange anymore, not so reminiscent of the 1950s with their "Welcome, we're neighbors, I've baked you something, now smile, and I'll ask you personal questions".
Offering homemade treats is a great way to make friends.
Your neighbors will feel obliged to chat with you, and eventually, your face will likely be associated with a pleasant surprise.
Of course, that depends on how good a baker you are.
Poorly glued flour, sugar and fat will make people pretend to be asleep when you knock on their door.
Stealing food is a common crime in student dormitories.
Sure, it's stealing to steal someone else's chicken, but is it stealing to take a little milk for tea?
You can take it from the milk man.
He'll probably offer you the benefit of the doubt, even if you're burning with rage.
If someone steals your stuff, it's annoying, and I sympathize with you, but try to treat this adult like my neighbor who poured dishwashing fluid into her milk to get back at those who took it without asking.
She's in prison now.
You must not make any noise that will disturb people's sleep or study.
Not just to be a decent person, but because you're the same people that are in the glass house saying.
The girl in my hallway asked my neighbor to turn down the drum and bass, because it was 3:00 in the morning and she had an exam in the morning.
The neighbor raised the volume in response.
When he finally stopped at 5 a.m., she graciously let him sleep for two hours, then handed him her music and locked the door behind her, heading for a three-hour exam.
Wouldn't it be romantic if your future husband and wife were living in the same dorm room as you?
On the contrary, wouldn't it be extremely, elbow-biting, awkward if you had mistaken your neighbor for your future spouse, fallen for him, broken off the relationship and had to see him every day, and perhaps watch him pull all your mutual friends to his side?
Of course, you can't touch the heart - but if the hot neighbor is definitely not your future husband, try to cool your own fire a little.
In that exciting moment when you realize someone left the keys inside their locked room, the line between a prank and a bully is thinner than it looks.
A good prank is fun, but it turns into its opposite in a matter of seconds.
Teach a valuable and interesting safety lesson by hiding something - but never dirty someone's room with toothpaste and shampoo.
Lock someone's door and put the keys in a glass of water that you'll put in the freezer later - but don't stick someone else's stuff with Blu-Tack to the ceiling more than twice.
iOS 9: How to install the new operating system on iPhone after Apple releases an update
You can request a new operating system by going to the Settings app, selecting General, and then Software Update.
If it's ready, the phone will let you download and install it.
Some users have encountered problems after installation when an error message appears telling them that "Application update failed".
To avoid this, users are advised to either wait until the animation subsides or try to update via iTunes.
The phone tips will help you get through the process.
The process can involve deleting apps to increase free space - but Apple has minimized the likelihood of this action by reducing the size of the update, and also simplified the execution with a special utility that offers to delete apps and re-install them after the process is complete.
Make sure your phone is charged or near a charger when you update to prevent battery drain.
If the charge is too low, Apple will stop the update, as the phone's discharge in the process may cause the update to fail.

Washington responded to Russia's military activity with a phone call.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov to discuss the situation in Syria.
In his opinion, Moscow's military support for President Assad is only exacerbating the conflict.
At the same time, the head of the White House is not going to talk about it with his Russian counterpart, PJ Media writes.
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov to discuss Russia's military activity in Syria.
This is reported by PJ Media.
"Secretary Kerry has made it clear that Russia's continued support for President Assad risks exacerbating and prolonging the conflict, and undermines our shared goal of countering extremism, if we do not also continue to focus on finding a solution to the Syrian conflict through a direct transfer of power", the State Department said.
They also noted that Kerry reiterated the US commitment to fight the Islamic State as part of a coalition of more than 60 countries.
He also noted that President Assad could never be a member.
In addition, the US "will welcome Russia's constructive role in its efforts to counter IS".
White House officials said Friday they don't know exactly what Russian troops are doing in Syria, but that Washington is going to discuss it with Moscow.
However, White House press secretary Josh Earnest noted that the time for a phone call between US President Barack Obama and Russian leader Vladimir Putin has not yet come: "When the president decides that a phone call with President Putin is in our best interests, he will pick up the phone and try to make the call".
Barack Obama himself considers Russia's decision to increase support for the Assad regime a "loser bet".
I remember my conversation with Mr. Putin four or five years ago, when I told him that this was a mistake, that further support for Assad would only make the situation worse.
"But he ignored my warnings - and the situation has worsened", the president said.
The yachts that are being imported will be exempt from paying customs duty.
The Ministry of Economic Development intends to temporarily exempt imported yachts and other floating recreational and sports vessels from customs duties and taxes.
The corresponding changes to the list of preferential goods for temporary duty-free import were prepared by the ministry on behalf of the Russian government.
This was reported to Izvestia by Helene Lashkina, assistant to the Minister of Economic Development.
In June 2015, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, following his visit to Crimea, instructed a number of agencies - the Ministry of Economic Development, the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Emergency Situations, the Federal Transport Service, the Federal Transport Service, the Federal Tourism Agency - to prepare proposals for creating favorable conditions for yachting in the coastal zones of the country.
In turn, experts note that the main problem is the complete lack of infrastructure for the storage, maintenance and maintenance of yachts.
Owners prefer to store their vessels abroad - about €200 million annually goes to the European state treasury for the maintenance, repair and maintenance of yachts.
The Ministry of Economic Development of Russia has prepared a draft decision of the Council of the Eurasian Economic Commission "On Amending the List of Goods Temporarily Imported with Full Conditional Exemption from Customs Duties and Taxes", providing for full conditional exemption from customs duties and taxes in respect of imported yachts and other floating means for recreation and sport.
According to the Ministry, this will certainly contribute to the creation of favorable conditions for the development of yachting in the coastal zones of the country, - said Lashkina.
This issue was brought to the attention of the subcommittee on customs-tariff, non-tariff regulation, protective measures in foreign trade of the Government Commission on Economic Development and Integration, whose meeting was held in September, and was also approved by the departments as a result of the discussion.
As the representative of the Ministry of Economic Development noted, the proposed measure of full conditional release upon importation is essentially a benefit.
Therefore, after the approval of the minutes of the meeting of the subcommission in the government of the Russian Federation, the Ministry of Economic Development will make a proposal to the Eurasian Economic Commission for discussion with the member states of the EAEU, Lashkina explained.
The list of imported goods that are fully exempt from payment of customs duties, taxes, includes goods necessary for the promotion of foreign economic activities and international cooperation, for use in the field of science, culture, cinematography, sports and tourism, for the provision of international assistance, etc. Among them - service equipment (personal computers, typewriters), control and measurement instruments, drilling equipment, stage costumes and decorations, mobile laboratories and workshops, water skies, gonocars, motorcycles, sports flying machines, books, newspapers, magazines, musical instruments and items for religious rites.
The press service of the Ministry of Transport of the Russian Federation told "Izvestia" that they have prepared mandatory regulations for the seaports of Kerch, Sevastopol, Yalta, Feodosia and Epatoria, which provide for a simplified procedure for the registration of entry and exit of small-sized, sports sailing and pleasure boats in the sea port.
The Ministry of Transport has instructed the captains of the sea ports of Crimea to ensure the application of a simplified order of entry of small-sized, sports sailing and pleasure vessels into the sea port and the exit of the listed vessels from the sea port.
The Ministry of Transport has also prepared draft orders of the Russian government on the approval of the borders of the waters of the sea ports of the Crimea.
The orders have already been adopted for Yalta and Feodosia, the rest are in the process of being agreed, - said in the press service of the department.
According to the Ministry of Transport, the state supervision, classification and certification, state registration in respect of small-sized vessels used for non-commercial purposes should be carried out by the Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol.
The problem is that Russia is extremely difficult with yachting precisely because of the poorly developed infrastructure.
If you look at the south of Italy and France, there's a whole industry that's constantly evolving, and it's a lot of people.
In Russia, everything is practically in place.
Our coast is of little interest, the only piece where you can operate yachts all year round is the Black Sea in the area of Sochi, Gelendzhik, Novorossiysk, Anapa.
But the big problem is that the border authorities are very strict in this area: in order to go out on a yacht, you need to get a lot of permits.
Besides, inside Russia, there's nowhere to refuel a yacht.
"It can run on its own fuel for two days, and then there's the problem of where to get it", says Nordmarine sales director Denis Novikov.
As for places for storing yachts, there are now special hangars for yachts up to 30 m in Moscow and St. Petersburg. The yachts are also sent to Turkey, Finland, Sweden and Germany for storage.
Novikov noted that buyers of yachts are rich people, but with the onset of the crisis, the demand for yachts has decreased.
The World Bank has given Ukraine a $500 million loan.
The World Bank has approved a new loan project for Ukraine in the amount of $500 million for the development of the financial sector.
The press service of the international organization reported this.
"The new financing will support a number of priority measures to implement reforms in the banking sector in response to the financial crisis in Ukraine", the report said.
The World Bank's Director for Belarus, Moldova and Ukraine, Tsimyo Fan, said that banking sector reforms would help revive lending in the real economy and stimulate economic growth.
He also noted that the Ukrainian authorities have taken impressive steps to reform the economy and the World Bank is seeing the first signs of stabilization.
But because of the seriousness of the problems, Fann is calling on the Ukrainian government to speed up reforms.
Earlier, the Polish government approved a loan of €100 million to Ukraine, RIA Novosti reports.
Prisons are asking for separate transgender units.
The Public Council of the Federal Penal Exercise Service (FESIN) on the protection of the rights of convicted persons in October 2015 will discuss, among other issues, the possibility of creating separate blocks for transgender and transvestite in the colonies.
This was reported by the member of the board Vladislav Grib.
According to him, depending on the total number of convicted persons in Russia who are not defined by gender, it is possible to provide separate cells, blocks or even (if there are many such criminals) in the future to create a special colony for transsexuals.
However, Vladislav Grib emphasizes that the sentencing of citizens to such isolated places is possible only after the convicted have passed the appropriate medical examinations, which prove that the offender is indeed a person who identifies as a representative of the opposite sex.
Grib believes that isolating transgender prisoners from other inmates will ensure the safety of those serving their sentences.
According to him, the proposed practice has been successful abroad: in the detention centers (where the accused are held until the court's decision), there are separate cells for transgender people, and in correctional institutions - special blocks.
It's the only way to deal with criminals like that today.
They definitely need to be isolated, as the presence of transvestites and transgender people in the regular cells is dangerous for them, it is suffering for their families and a lot of problems for the FSIN staff.
The humiliation of the trances by the fellow prisoners is guaranteed, - says Vladislav Grib.
Depending on how big the city is, how many gender-diverse offenders there are, you have to calculate where to put them.
There's no need for a separate cell. Just cells, cells in prisons.
Yes, a separate colony is possible if there are many transgender people.
As Grib explained, the unit can hold 50 or 100 people, and if a specialized unit is created in Russia alone, prisoners from any region can be admitted to serve their sentences.
Citizens are held in the detention center at the place of the crime, so the arrival of transvestites or transgender people from other subjects during the investigation and trial is unrealistic, but to introduce such a practice for those already convicted in a separate colony - yes, "Grib believes.
Recall that the day before, law enforcement officers could not decide in which detention center - male or female - to identify the 24-year-old transsexual Dmitry Kozhukov (known as Alina Davis), who was detained for drug possession, which is why the man with a girl's appearance was not arrested.
He was released on a non-disclosure.
This news was widely discussed on social networks and in the media, as the mechanism of detention of transgender people in SIZO and colonies in Russia is not yet really there.
Russian human rights defender and activist of the LGBT movement (LGBT - lesbians, gays, bisexuals, transsexuals) Nikolai Alekseev supported the idea of creating special places for transgender people to serve their sentences, noting that it is also possible to define people in colonies - male or female - depending on their own desires.
Given the atmosphere in Russian prisons, the sentence is correct.
Yes, it's a very small percentage, but the problem exists, as does the issue of providing security in prisons for homosexuals", Alexeev says.
Prisons should be safe, so separate blocks could be made in the name of that and for homosexuals, especially since there are more of them in prisons than transgender people.
However, Alekseev doubts that there are many citizens in Russia who are willing to pass themselves off as transsexuals in order to get into a different colony.
Of course, you can have a medical examination before you put people in transgender detention, but it's not always clear-cut.
For example, in the United States, one of the prisoners, Chelsea Manning, looked like a man, and already in prison said that he wanted to change his gender, "Alexeyev said.
A man can feel anything he wants.
But until there are separate places for trans people to serve their sentences, I doubt that the prison staff will be serious about the safety of these people and delve into the subtleties of their orientation or gender identity.
At the same time, international expert on reproductive health in the Russian Federation, Boris Lordkapianidze, noted that the introduction of a new system for the distribution of transsexuals in the colony could greatly delay the start of the sentence for convicted criminals.
A commission is formed, it's a question of sexology, psychiatrists conduct long-term observations, it's not one test on which to base a highly accurate conclusion.
The facilities of psychiatry today allow it.
That's why potential patients are always examined before they change their gender - they show whether sex change with surgery is a necessary measure, says Lordipanidze.
But I'm having a hard time seeing how this system can be implemented in relation to the prisoners, because the average time it takes to do this is a month.
The doctor, despite generally supporting the idea of creating separate blocks for transsexuals, also doubts that in the current economic conditions it would be advisable to allocate funds for the construction of new premises, medical examinations, - transgender people in Russia units.
It is difficult to calculate, there are no official statistics, but if we consider that homosexuals in Russia are about 5%, then we can say that transgender people are even fewer, and those who have such a deviation and also commit crimes are quite insignificant, - said Lordicpanidze.
Now, by petitioning the colony administration, gays, transgender people can get separate conditions.
Mikhail Antipov won the world junior chess championship.
The world chess championship for juniors under 20 years of age was concluded in Khanty-Mansiysk.
The end of the championship was more than intriguing.
The winner was determined only in the last round, and it was the Russian Mikhail Antipov, who managed to catch up with the Pole Jan-Kszistof Duda, who seemed to be confidently going for the title.
The girls' chess champion was the Ukrainian Natalia Buxs.
The World Chess Championship, held since the beginning of September in Khanty-Mansiysk, already by the middle of the tournament distance, seemed to have lost almost all intrigue, since the representative of Poland, Jan-Kshistof Duda, who gave a series of four victories (competitions are held according to the Swiss system in 13 rounds), confidently took the lead.
Given that Duda was the ranking favorite of the championship, and is generally considered one of the most promising young chess players, the probability that he would miss the gap was very small.
And even when Duda slowed down and allowed Russian Mikhail Antipov to cut the gap to just 0.5 points, he remained the clear favorite in the title fight.
The Witch of Antipos had to win the 13th round to catch the leader.
But even that wouldn't have helped, win your Duda party.
Plus, this inevitable victory could, of course, have an impact on the Russian chess player's game and lead to unnecessary mistakes.
Fortunately, Mikhail Antipov managed to avoid them.
He was able to defeat Francesco Rambaldi, but had to wait for Duda, who had met Benjamin Bock, to finish his match.
Fortunately for Antipov, the Polish chess player was able to draw against the Dutchman.
Thus, Antipov and Duda scored an equal number of points - 10 out of 13 possible, but Antipov had better extra points.
That is why the leadership of the Khanty-Mansi Autonomous Okrug, whose governor Natalia Komarov traditionally pays great attention to the development of chess in the region, presented the main prize.
But the girls' competition didn't have the intriguing ending.
The leader of the tournament - Natalia Buxe (Ukraine) - to win the title was enough not to lose in the last round, which she did successfully.
Thus, the victory of the Russian Alina Bivol did not allow her to catch up to the Bucs.
The Russian athlete remained second with a 0.5 point gap to the champion.
The outburst is changing the regional structure.
The company combines the Volga and Urals regions into one enlarged Volga-Ural region, Siberia and the Far East - into the region of the East.
The project will be completed by November 1.
As noted by the CEO of Vympelkom, Mikhail Slobodin, the changes are being made to "remain a strong player in the market", to develop the company "in new, not always favorable external conditions".
In an interview with the TV channel "Russia 24", Mr. Slobodin said that they intend to reduce in Russia "tens of percent" of personnel.
The Federal Trade Commission has checked 78 Burger Kings in Moscow and issued 367 warrants.
As a result, the restaurant on Volokolamskoye highway was fined 50 thousand rubles, and the establishment on the Big Tula street was closed for 90 days, but resumed work after eliminating all violations.
43 take-out restaurants violated the building code.
Among other violations, unsatisfactory sanitary and hygienic maintenance of premises, non-compliance with the requirements for ventilation devices, in some establishments, intestinal staphylococcus group bacteria were found.
The franchise for the Burger King brand is owned by Burger Rus LLC, the owner of the "Chocolate" network, Alexander Kolobov, 293 snack shops operate in Russia.
Igor Artemyev, head of the FAS, said that the agency was against the 10% indexation of freight tariffs and the provision of state subsidies, as requested by OJSC Russian Railways.
"First they wanted 17 percent, now they want 10 percent, and then they want multi-billion dollar subsidies", he says.
We say, "This is wrong, this is too much, cut your spending, learn to save, give up expensive mansions, football teams, your own TV, stop spending money left and right".
He added that the FAS has its own "much more stringent" proposals that are currently being discussed in the government.
Polymetal is considering a possible net settlement with Sumeru Gold B.V. instead of executing a $300 million stock option, the gold mining company said.
In this case, Polymetal will have to pay Sumeru up to $80 million (the difference between the share issue price in Sumeru's favor and the market quotes), which can be taken from the free cash flow.
Sumeru has until October 3 to exercise his option or demand a premium.
Polymetal is not disclosing the details of the negotiations.
The option was concluded as part of Polymetal's purchase of the Kyzyl project in Kazakhstan.
Nikita Stasishin, director of the Department of Housing Policy of the Ministry of Construction, said that the ministry is working with the Central Bank to develop a procedure for the rehabilitation of developers.
"We understand that there is no way out of this, so we are developing a mechanism", the official said.
The first draft of the screenplay for Citizen Kane is going up for auction.
The auction house Profiles in History has announced plans to put up for auction the draft version of Citizen Kane, considered one of the best works by director, screenwriter and actor Orson Welles.
The auction will begin in Calabasas on September 29, with three draft versions of the script, each estimated to cost between $20-30,000, according to AP.
The first draft, written in 1940 by Herman Mankiewicz, is the earliest surviving screenplay in private collections and is titled "The American" - the working title of the film.
The second draft is the more complete version of the script, the third is the final plan of the film.
The Ministry of Industry and Trade: the targeted food aid will not become the analogue of the cards in the USSR.
Russia's Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Viktor Evtukhov said that the program of targeted food aid will not be an analogue of the card system of food distribution that existed in the USSR.
We are talking about modern targeted food aid to the population and support for an effective domestic producer.
I'm asking you not to speculate on the phrase "food stamp".
I would like to stress that the proposed food cards should not be confused with the echoes of past times of total shortages, with a distribution card system in which the quantity of food received is normalized.
We have proposed the concept so far, if it is approved, we will propose changes to the legislation", TASS quotes Mr. Yevtukhov.

A source familiar with the situation told RAPSI that the president of the insurance company "Rosgosstrakh" Daniil Khachaturov has appealed to the Moscow court with a claim for the annulment of the marriage with designer Ulyana Sergienko.
The trial of the claim will begin on September 16th.
Danil Khachaturov asks to dissolve his marriage and divide the jointly acquired property.

President of the Russian Railways Alexander Bobreshev leaves his post.
Russian Railways' corporate security vice president Alexander Bobreshev is leaving the company, Interfax reports, citing a source.
The Vice Prime Minister of Russia, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Russian Railways Arkady Dvorkovich stated that the question of leaving the Russian Railways of Alexander Bobreshev was initiated by the new head of the company Oleg Belozerov.
According to the vice-premier, the personnel reshuffle in the management of the Russian Railways is not related to the change of the head of the company.
Earlier, "Kommersant" reported that instead of Vladimir Yakunin, OAO RZD was headed by the first deputy minister of transport, Oleg Belozerov, a Petersburg resident who was in charge of the financial block.
The new head of the company first announced about the reforms in the monopoly: in a year and a half, a new system of freight tariffs will be created.

This year, the Russian Managers Association's "Top-1000 Russian Managers" survey is published for the 16th time.
As a tool for assessing the professional reputation of Russia's top managers, the study sums up the work of Russian managers over the year, identifying leaders in industries and functional areas.
The initial pool of candidates is made up of last year's winners.
Last year's winners are invited to confirm their participation as candidates for this year's ranking and to nominate members of their management team.
In addition, each of the initial list of candidates is asked to nominate up to ten new managers from other companies who would be appropriate to add to the overall pool of candidates.
The following functional leadership positions may be offered: CFO, CCO, Marketing Director, HR Director, IT Director, Public and Corporate Relations Director, Government Relations Director, Corporate Governance Director.
Each manager nominated by the experts is invited to participate in the rating and is given the opportunity to nominate his management team and up to ten new executives from other companies.
The nomination of candidates by sector is carried out on the basis of the sector classifier of the Association of Managers: information technology, commercial banks, forestry and wood processing industry, machine building, media business, metallurgy, multi-profile holdings, professional services, communication and telecommunications, service and production of consumer goods, insurance, construction, trade, transport, financial sector, pharmaceutics, chemical industry, energy and fuel complex.
Each participant is given a login and password to access the website www.top1000.amr.ru, where they can see information about other participants and can place their ratings according to the criteria proposed for each functional direction.
The methodology of the rating is based on the principle "The best choose the best": top managers evaluate top managers, functional managers evaluate functional managers.
This principle allows for the most authentic assessment of the professional reputation of colleagues.
The final results of the rating are approved at the meetings of the expert commissions.
All candidates of the current year's rating and multiple candidates of the previous years' rating are invited to attend the meetings of the expert commissions.
The commissions are organized by functional character: the commission on the approval of the list of senior leaders and eight commissions on the approval of the heads of functional areas.
At the meetings of the expert commissions, it is proposed to approve the submitted lists in alphabetical order (places are kept strictly according to the internet-evaluation and are closed information until the publication of the rating) or make updating adjustments to them according to the attached list of reserve candidates.
The names of the companies are given in accordance with the rules of the Russian language and the "Ъ" norms.
At the time of publication, changes in the status of managers and companies are possible.
The comfortable rate for investment credit is 10-13%.
Experts estimate that the market for small and medium-sized businesses in January-April this year lost 40%.
What do you estimate the situation is today?
After the panic of late 2014 and early 2015, lending to SMEs declined significantly.
The reason is obvious: sharply rising interest rates.
Lending at 25-30% per annum was not profitable for anyone.
If the bank could have previously put all its future problems, from delays to non-reimbursement, into the higher rate, it cannot do so now: the rates are already sky-high.
For businesses, the current SME loan rate is uncomfortable.
For a significant portion of investment projects, the current level is unacceptable in terms of their return.
A rate of 10-13% would allow businesses to invest in a wide range of projects and generate attractive returns.
How well do you think the demand for business loans is being met?
After the Fed cut interest rates, things got a little better.
Credit has become more available.
However, we've seen that customers are turning to credit much less often.
First of all, the business doesn't understand its future growth and future revenue.
Today, businesses have one solution: they must learn to work in the context of the current economic situation in the country and the region.
We need to monitor our performance more closely, monitor our cash flow.
At the same time, if the financial resources are available, it is worthwhile to use new technologies that allow for upgrading equipment, reducing production costs and energy supply.
All of this ultimately allows companies to make their products more competitive and to stay in business even in a volatile economy.
What are the main trends in the SME lending market that will strengthen and influence its development by the end of 2015?
Will the interest rate change?
The forecast for the average rate reduction will depend largely on the policy of the Central Bank, and now the regulator is demonstrating consistency in the issue of lowering the key rate.
However, the price of SME loans should not fall dramatically.
In the current situation, the problem is, first of all, inflation, which makes it necessary to raise the interest rate to obtain a real income.
Moreover, the value of money in Russia will remain high even with the decline in the Central Bank's rates.
On the level of default, traditionally small and medium-sized enterprises, limited both in their ability to replenish funds and in their options for adjusting their economic behaviour, will certainly pose a greater risk to creditors.
I wouldn't expect a significant reduction in the bad credit ratio.
The main reason is the international sanctions and their negative impact on the country's economy.
The new Mazda CX-5 and street fashion.
That's how the word Mazda is written in Japanese.
It's beautiful, concise and at the same time quite difficult for those who are used to Cyrillic or Latin.
The new CX-5 crossover is like any other model of the brand: without extravagance, it is attractive on the outside, technically perfect on the inside.
Japanese, simply because of its "Japanese" character, can bring the attachment to the products of the Land of the Rising Sun to a state of total exhilaration.
You can make all sorts of arguments in favor of cars from other countries, and one will even agree with these arguments in principle, but the whole conversation will be interrupted by the final phrase: "But this is a Japanese car!
There's no point in arguing!
Such people should probably love not only technology but everything Japanese.
To quote Basse's moves, to cook Wasabi, to collect katana and to dress your girlfriend -- no, not in kimono, of course, but in the canons of street fashion in Japan: cute, creative and very unexpected.
Japanese school uniforms are the only uniforms that girls are happy to wear after school.
It has amazing properties: it's sensual and strict at the same time.
And the older the girl, the shorter the skirt.
The main change in the appearance of the CX-5 is the radiator grille with five horizontal lines.
But what changes the car's appearance even more is the new design of the headlights and taillights, which instantly make the car recognizable in the traffic.
As before, the Mazda CX-5 looks very tempting.
The silhouette is harmonious, the forms sensual, but the appearance has a touch of rigor.
You don't have to call the police.
Driving the CX-5, one of the safest cars in the world, you can only experience stoic Japanese calm.
The 2.2 litre diesel engine provides high torque in a wide range of speeds.
The engine's fuel consumption is 175 litres of power, which is 5.9 litres. The power unit is equipped with an automatic transmission and full-drive.
The black shoes, the black coat, the black bag...
To add a little black humor to this image, you can choose leggings with a print from the police tape Not Cross.
But Mazda has done its best to ensure that you don't get in your own accident while driving the CX-5.
To further increase comfort while maintaining excellent handling, the suspension has been redesigned with front and rear shock absorbers, as well as optimised the shape of the front lower levers.
The all-wheel drive system is adapted to Russian conditions.
The road and engine noise levels are reduced by 13% at high speeds.
A flower bath or a striped one is as boring as a budget sedan.
It's different when a girl is showing off in a bathing suit with an original design.
Like a computer game in the action genre.
It'll get as much attention as the new CX-5!
The new CX-5 has an improved design for both the front and rear seats, which provides optimum space for both broad shoulders and long legs - whoever has what.
The more long-legged will appreciate that the frontal portions of the central tunnel are now soft and don't hit the ankles in the turns.
The most extensive set of Mazda active safety systems is offered on the CX-5.
To detect potential threats, they use radar, lasers, and cameras.
It has adaptive lighting, it has lane departure warning, it has dead-zone monitoring, and it has safe braking.
The Mazda CX-5 has one of the best boot in its class.
Comfortable, with minimal protrusions, it can accommodate 561 litres of cargo. The rear seats fold in a 4:2:4 ratio - each section is fitted with a separate carrying lever - and increase the luggage compartment to 1560 litres.
The costume of the cartoon hero is called "kigurumi" in Japan.
The kighurumi pajamas are particularly bad-looking.
It's all about the money!
Of course you can.
But also entertaining little children.
Or just walking around with a beast like that...
It's so great to have the choice of cool clothes, a cool attitude or a car.
Thank you for your help with the Kawaicat store.
Kiev has dismantled the nuclear union.
Kiev has formally formalised Ukraine's refusal to cooperate with Russia on the completion of the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant.
The Verkhovna Rada on Wednesday voted to terminate the agreement with Moscow.
Agreements on the completion of the third and fourth blocks were signed in 2010-2012, but it was not possible to start implementing the project.
On Wednesday, the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine adopted a law that terminates the agreement with Russia on the construction of the third and fourth units at the Khmelnytskyi nuclear power plant, which was concluded in 2010-2012.
The bill introduced by the government was passed only after the second vote, the first time it was supported by 210 deputies with the necessary minimum of 226, but then when the bill was voted for by 234 members of parliament.
The Khmelnitsky NPP, built during the USSR, was originally planned to have four 1 GW power units with VVER reactors, but only two were built.
Negotiations with Moscow on the completion of the project led to the conclusion of an intergovernmental agreement in 2010, and in 2011-2012 the Rada adopted the relevant laws.
Since there were no funds in the budget of Ukraine, it was assumed that the construction of the blocks would have to be on the credit of the Russian side, but the funds were never allocated.
After the coup in Kiev in February 2014 and the subsequent cooling of relations between the two countries, Kiev began to curtail relations with Moscow in the atomic industry, announcing its refusal to cooperate on the Khmelnytsky NPP and the project to build a nuclear fuel plant in Ukraine.
The only area where relations remained, was the purchase of fuel in the Russian Federation for the operating Ukrainian NPPs (which provided about half of the electricity production in the country), since so far the Ukrainian NAEC "Energoatom" could not replace the Russian supplies.
Plans to complete the construction of the Khmelnytsky NPP with another contractor in Ukraine have not yet been definitively abandoned: back in 2014, Kiev announced talks with the Czech Skoda JS.
The UN Secretary General is against the use of military force in the Syrian conflict.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said at a press conference that the situation in Syria cannot be resolved by military means.
"There is no military solution", he said in response to a question about Russia's military support for Syria.
Ban also said he would hold a meeting with foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council on the situation in Syria.
I'll be meeting with the foreign ministers of the permanent members of the UN Security Council later this month.
"The meeting will be on Syria", he said.
Earlier today, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, Nikolay Bogdanovsky, said that the General Staff does not rule out the possibility of creating an Air Force base in Syria in the future.
No plans for now.
"But anything can happen", said Mr. Bogdanovsky.
Earlier, "Kommersant" reported that the United States does not trust Russian President Vladimir Putin, who said that military assistance to the official Damascus is necessary to fight the terrorist group "Islamic State", which is banned in Russia.

The OSCE PA reports on the possible meeting of parliamentarians of Ukraine and Russia.
Head of the Ukrainian delegation to the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly (PA) Artur Gerasimov announced the possibility of a bilateral meeting this year with Russian parliamentary colleagues to discuss the situation in southeastern Ukraine.
"What I know: a certain meeting is planned this year, possibly between the Ukrainian and Russian parliamentary delegations", - TASS quotes Mr. Gerasimov.
He also called for the implementation of the Minsk agreements and "a return to normal life in our countries".
Asked whether, in his opinion, dialogue between Ukraine and Russia is possible at the parliamentary level - in the "Normandy format" or in the format of the contact group at the OSCE PA - Mr. Gerasimov noted that the dialogue was held, there are Minsk agreements.
At the same time, according to the politician, in Kiev support any kind of dialogue.
Earlier, the representative of Ukraine at the talks, the country's ex-president Leonid Kuchma, said that the self-proclaimed Donetsk and Lugansk republics have not yet fundamentally changed their positions at the trilateral talks, but the tone of the dialogue has become more positive.
The parties were given mandates.
Yesterday, the Nizhny Novgorod electoral commission summed up the results of the elections to the city Duma for the municipal district, distributing 12 parliamentary seats, drawn up according to party lists.
Traditionally, many complaints about violations during the elections were voiced by representatives of the KPRF, who accused the election committee of "covering up for falsifications".
The opposition's comments were not accepted.
The electoral commission denied the party "Communists of Russia" in the organization of the referendum, concerning the abolition of the payment for the capital repair of apartment buildings.
The city election commission officially presented the results of the elections in the Nizhny Novgorod city hall for the municipal electoral district.
In total, 1.03 million people were included in the lists of voters in Nizhny Novgorod, 746.7 thousand ballots were issued to the precinct commissions, and 268 thousand voters voted in the elections.
More than 11,700 ballots were declared invalid, and 24 were lost.
Yesterday, 12 seats were allocated to the political parties according to the votes they received.
According to the lists of "United Russia", six deputy seats in the city Duma are allocated to Dmitry Svatkovsky, Dmitry Krasnov, Vasily Shupranov, Yelizaveta Solonchenko, Vyacheslav Rasteryaev and Igor Nagorny.
The only LDPR mandate was given to the party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
The two mandates of the KPRF are distributed between Vladimir Bulanov and State Duma deputy Alexander Tarnaev.
The three mandates of "Fair Russia" are given to Alexander Razumovsky, Igor Bogdanov and Mikhail Shalugin.
Now, within five days, these candidates must decide whether they will work as deputies in the city Duma: in case of refusal of the mandate, he goes to the next candidate on the party list.
Chairman of the city election commission Alexander Makkeyev informed the members of the commission that he was introducing a duty to "send telegrams to Zhirinovsky and others" to refuse the mandates.
When the protocol on the results of the elections was approved, representatives of the KPRF stated that there were multiple violations.
The member of the city election commission with the right of consultative vote from the KPRF Leonid Krasnokutsky proposed not to recognize the results of voting in four districts No. 21-24, reminding that by order of the head of the administration of the Sormovsky district, the entrance to the administration building, where four district commissions were located, was closed.
For a long time, neither the deputies of the State Duma, nor the candidates themselves, nor the observers could enter, and the resonant scandal with the storming of the doors of the district administration was shown on television.
All observers and members of the commissions with the right to vote were able to attend the meetings of the district commissions.
The head of the polling station only cut off access to them after the voting was over and the polling stations had not yet arrived to hand in their ballots.
This was done to prevent any provocation.
"Then the chapter was corrected, and all interested persons could attend the meetings", - said Natalia Andryushina, a member of the city election committee.
The Communists objected that the deputies of the regional parliament, Lyudmila Aristova, were illegally detained in the blocked administration building for more than four hours, and a statement was sent to the Investigation Committee.
The opposition was also outraged that in a number of polling stations on the day of elections they began to seal the urns at 6-7 am, laying out ballots for early voting.
The members of the committees with the right to vote and the observers were not notified, so they came at 8 am to the start of the elections.
The Communists are sure that in the morning hours before the opening of the polling stations, ballots could have been uncontrolled into the ballot boxes.
However, the city election commission, which has already considered more than 124 complaints on various occasions, according to Alexander Makeyev, did not find any violations with the submission of unregistered ballots.
The members of the commission also did not support the proposal of their colleague from "Fair Russia" Maria Popova to come out with amendments to the regional legislation through the federal election commission to clearly establish the time of opening envelopes with early voting ballots, which then fall into the ballot box.
"In the course of your own initiative, please contact the CEC", - advised Mrs. Popova Alexander Makeyev.
Towards the end of the meeting, the chairman was accused by a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, Sergei Samokhin, who shouted that the electoral commission ignored dozens of complaints and covered up the election fraud.
"You're not at a rally, be careful what you say!" the chairman of the electoral commission said.
The result was that the protocol was approved almost unanimously.
By September 27, the election committee must approve the general results of the elections, after which the first meeting of the Nizhny Novgorod City Duma of the sixth convocation will be appointed within three weeks.
In addition to determining the results of the elections, the city election commission refused to register the political party "Communists of Russia" as an initiative group for the local referendum.
Judging by the documents, the party was going to put two questions to the discussion of Nizhny Novgorod residents: whether they agree that the fees for the capital repairs of multi-apartment buildings should be "immediately canceled", and the tariffs for housing and communal services "freeze until 2020".
However, the Duma's lawyer Irina Maslova explained that the appeal of the "Communists of Russia" contradicts the legislation.
FedEx's revenue is mixed, down from its 2016 forecast.
FedEx reported a disappointing final quarter, and the delivery giant has lowered its annual profit forecast due to a drop in demand for freight services and rising costs in its ground handling division.
The company also said it plans to hire approximately 55,000 seasonal workers for the holidays.
This time last year, FedEx announced that they were going to hire 50,000 temporary workers for the holidays.
Its shares fell about 2.5 percent in preliminary trading 45 minutes before the market opened on Wednesday.
FedEx Corp. has said it expects to earn between $10.40 and $10.90 in the fiscal year ending next May, which is 20 cents less than the previous forecast.
Analysts were forecasting $10.84 based on the FactSet review.
The forecast decline comes despite a 4.9 percent average rate hike that will take effect on January 4 and a hike in heavy or bulky overland freight charges that begins in November.
The company said it still expects revenue growth over the past year due to reduced costs, higher gross income and growth in online sales.
Chairman and CEO Fred Smith stated that the company "operated steadily in light of weak, compared to forecast, economic conditions, especially in manufacturing and global trade".
The holiday hiring plans were announced the day after rival UPS announced that they planned to hire an additional 95,000 employees, about the same number as they hired last year.
For the quarter ended August 31, FedEx earned $692 million, up 6 percent from a year earlier.
Earnings per share were $2.42, close to the average of $2.44 per share predicted by Zacks Investment Research's poll of 12 analysts.
Revenue increased 5% to $12.3 billion.
The six analysts Zacks interviewed were guessing $12.23 billion.
FedEx has suffered in recent years from a downturn in the international express sector, which has resulted in no growth in gross revenue in its express division.
However, the boom in online shopping has dramatically improved FedEx Ground's results.
In the last quarter, ground handling revenues grew by 29%, but operating revenues remained broadly unchanged due to higher costs for large shipments and self-insurance.
The express division had higher revenue due to higher base rates, while the freight division had lower revenue due to higher labor costs.
In a preliminary trading session about an hour before the stock market opened, FedEx shares fell $3.85, or 2.5 percent, to $150.15.
They closed Tuesday, down 11 percent year-to-date and 17 percent below the June 11 record.
In the most anticipated meeting in years, the Fed heads will spend two days this week at a 27-foot table of Honduran redwood, deciding whether it's time to raise the key interest rate for the first time in nearly a decade.
At one end of the richly decorated two-story-high conference room, a mural of the United States will hang above them.
This map is a reminder that Federal Reserve Chair Janet L. Yellen and her colleagues must put the economic interests of the country above all others.
The central bank has a dual mandate from Congress: to maximize employment in the United States and to keep prices stable.
But since the Great Recession, the heads of the Federal Reserve have recognized that there is a third, unwritten mandate: financial stability.
And this third mandate may prove to be the unknown factor in the almost predictable decision to be announced on Thursday as to whether the US economy is ready to shake off the unprecedented stimulus provided by the near-zero short-term interest rate since late 2008.
Even though most of the data is showing solid economic growth, the recent turmoil in global financial markets may be deterring already cautious Federal Reserve officials from adding to the volatility by raising the federal funds rate by as little as a quarter of a percentage point.
"It is clear that the labour market and inflation will be the first and most important subject of consideration", said Lindsey M. Peigza, chief economist at brokerage firm Stifel Nicolaus & Co.
"However, I think if they were looking for a reason not to raise rates, the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough to give them an excuse to wait further", she noted.
There is no consensus on what to do in the Federal Reserve, which in itself causes financial market fluctuations.
About half the economists recently polled by Bloomberg predicted that interest rates would rise this week.
Financial markets, however, expect the Federal Reserve to hold off on this, with the key indicator showing only a roughly 30% chance of a quick recovery.
It could cause a stock market crash if the Federal Reserve raises the rate, provided that those who make the decisions don't soften the blow by promising that the next rate increase will be soon.
On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 228.89 points, or 1.4%, to 16,599.85.
The surge was triggered by expectations that the Federal Reserve's policy makers would quit this week, said John Lonsky, chief economist at Moody's Capital Markets Research Group.
"It would be a surprise if the Federal system were to raise rates at this point in time", he remarked.
If the Fed does this, "they will have to go a long way in their strategy of keeping the financial markets in check so that they don't panic".
Other experts argued that raising the rate would calm financial markets, as it would remove uncertainty about how the Federal Reserve System would operate.
Just a month ago, the Federal Reserve seemed to be leaning towards raising rates by 0.25% this month, making the first small step in a slow tightening of financial conditions that could confirm the strength of the US recovery.
Yellen said in the spring and early summer that she expected a rate hike this year, despite complaints from the Liberals that more economic progress was needed.
Although job creation slowed in August, labour market growth was steady this year.
Unemployment fell to 5.1% last month, the lowest in more than seven years, and near what the Federal system considers full employment.
Wage growth is showing signs of accelerating.
And while inflation remains below the central bank's target of 2 percent per year, the Fed's leadership has said that the key cause is the temporary effect of the sharp drop in oil prices.
The economy "can handle higher rates, and needs them, given the shrinking labor market", noted Ian Shephardson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
However, financial markets around the world began to rattle late last month after China devalued its currency.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell as much as 16% from a record high in May as investors feared that a slowdown in the Chinese economy could dampen global growth.
The market has partially recovered this month, and the Dow Jones is now about 10% below its May high.
For the Fed, market turmoil complicates the complex calculations of the timeline for the interest rate hike.
"In the absence of information about what happened in the financial markets and news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks, they would have been screwing up at this meeting", said Stephen D. Oliner, a senior researcher at the UCLA Ziman Center for Real Estate and a former Federal Reserve official.
Now, he predicts they'll wait at least a month to get more control of the fallout.
"There is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact might be on the US economy, and they have very little reliable data after the recent events in China", said Oliner.
The health of the world economy is not a primary concern of the Federal System, and technically it should not be a factor in making those decisions.
But essentially the Federal Reserve has become the world's financial power.
The influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous.
A single hint from then-Chairman Ben S. Bernanke in 2013 that the Federal Reserve could "muffle" its monetary expansion caused a worldwide market upheaval.
In a world where markets and economic systems are increasingly intertwined, one would expect that Fed officials would not only monitor developments everywhere, but also consult with representatives of other central banks and experts to better understand the global economy.
Their decision-making process is "more of an art than a science", said Zachary Karabell, CEO of Envestnet Inc., a company that deals with global wealth management strategies.
Jeffrey Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Virginia, noted this month that "there have been cases in the history of the Federal Reserve of overreacting to financial market movements that do not seem to be related to economic principles".
Lacker, a voting member of the influential Federal Open Market Committee, insisted on a rate increase, citing the 1998-99 decisions as an example.
The Asian financial crisis led the Fed to lower its base rate by 0.75% in three sessions, "despite limited identifiable effects on U.S. growth", Lacker said.
A year later, the Federal System heads reversed those cuts.
The Federal Reserve should only prioritize stability during major crises, such as the 2008 market crash", said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the Bank of England's interest rate committee.
The latest panic was nowhere near that level, he said.
"You don't want to be in a situation where you're afraid of rising rates because markets are in a state of shock", said Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for Global Economics.
The Federal Reserve Act still has a dual mandate and no mention of financial stability, and until that changes, I don't think they should be ahead of the curve.
You need a great Thai market?
Try the LAX-C in Chinatown.
Yes, Chinatown
The market/warehouse opened in 1997 and is owned by LAX-C Inc.
Often referred to as Thailand's Costco, LAX-C is a wholesale Thai market that also trades for the public.
Yes, he's in Chinatown, not Tai Town.
A market/warehouse is a store where you can buy everything at once, offering a dizzying selection of fresh, frozen and dried foods, popular Thai and Asian snacks, kitchen utensils, furniture, religious and holiday decorations.
There's even a car service if you need to buy some engine oil.
The store is huge, and it'll take more than an hour to sweep all the rows.
If shopping makes you hungry, grab a bite to eat at LAX-C BBQ Express.
The kitchen section of the store (good and inexpensive) is located near the cash register and offers various options for take-out.
What do you suggest, you want something - anything - Thai?
LAX-C probably has it.
Prices are reasonable, and many items are sold in bulk.
Fresh produce includes delicious Asian and local Thai herbs, fruits and more.
The meat counter is as diverse as the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and separate the fish, and even fry it for you if you wish.
A good part of the store is devoted to the impressive freezer section, where you can find frozen curry leaves, bitter gourd and galangal, whole duck, fish, beef blood and bile, pork chops, caviar, local sausage, semi-finished products and much more.
Who's buying: Restaurant owners and chefs, as well as families and individual shoppers.
In the wide passage, there are both shopping carts and fork loaders.
Fresh durian montong near the exit.

Parking: LAX-C has its own parking lot that it shares with other shops and restaurants.
Although the store may be crowded, parking is usually not difficult to find.
State Duma Speaker Sergei Naryshkin admits that the US is deliberately destabilizing the situation in the Middle East so that waves of refugees can pour into Europe.
As Interfax reports, he made the comments to journalists in Ulan Bator during the autumn session of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
"I am not a conspiracy theorist, but the question is whether Europe is the ultimate target of those who have been so maniacal in their efforts to destabilize the countries of North Africa and the Middle East in recent years", he asked.
"Someone must have known that the flood of refugees, those poor and destitute people who are fleeing death, will head to the prosperous EU countries", he added.
Naryshkin asked: "How many of Europe's political leaders have spoken openly about the causes of this crisis, this wave of refugees that is now literally swallowing their countries?"
"No, the old Europe, with few exceptions, prefers to remain silent", he said.
According to Naryskin, NATO violates many European values and norms of international law.
"Europe, unfortunately, has long and impartially watched and watches how the military boot, sewn according to NATO standards, tramples on both moral ideals and basic fundamental principles and norms of international law", the speaker stressed.
Government troops and loyalist paramilitary groups are opposed by rebels, mostly Islamists.
Later, the terrorist group "Islamic State", which is banned in Russia, joined the opponents of the Syrian government.
The U.S. is supporting the rebels who are opposed to both Assad and ISIS.
Official Damascus considers such rebels to be terrorists.
The Syrian president has given the reason for the West's hostility towards Russia.
The West's claim to countries like Syria, Russia and Iran is that they are sovereign states.
This is the opinion of Syrian President Bashar Assad in an interview with RT, the First Channel, "Russia 24", NTV, "Russia Today", TASS, "Interfax" and "Russian newspaper".
According to Assad, the West does not perceive partners and sovereign states.
In these countries, he would like to remove one person and put another in his place, who would act in the interests of Western countries, not in the interests of his homeland, he said.
Assad drew attention to the Western media's sharp turnaround with the beginning of the coup in Ukraine.
According to him, for them, Russian President Vladimir Putin "has turned from a friend of the West into an enemy, a tsar, a dictator who suppresses the Russian opposition, who came to power in an undemocratic way, despite the fact that he was elected in a democratic election recognized by the West".
Putin called on the international community to join forces with Assad to fight the Islamic State.
Commenting on the West's constant statements that Assad himself should go, he noted that the president comes to power with the consent of the people, through elections, and if he leaves, it is at the request of the people, not by the decision of the US, the UN Security Council, the Geneva conference or the Geneva communique.
"If the people want him to stay, the president stays, otherwise he should leave immediately", he stressed.
Assad called Russia and Iran friendly countries and reminded that they are cooperating with them.
Syria is also fighting terrorism along with neighboring Iraq.
Speaking about the military support from Iran, the Syrian leader noted that this country supports the Syrian state in politics, in the economy and in the military sphere.
He denied that Iranian military units are being sent to Syria.
Tehran is supplying us with military hardware.
"Of course, there is an exchange of military experts between Syria and Iran, but this exchange has always been carried out", he explained.
As for the other states, we are open to cooperation with any of them if there is a serious desire to fight terrorism.
"We don't see this in the case of the so-called anti-terrorist and anti-Hegeli coalition led by the US", Assad pointed out.
The number of dead exceeded 230 thousand people, the number of refugees - 11,5 million.
Part of the territory was seized by the terrorist group "Islamic State", which is banned in Russia.
The international coalition led by the United States is launching airstrikes on ISIS positions.

Lavrov and Kerry discussed the situation in Syria: Politics: The world: Lenta.ru
U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has spoken by phone with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.
This is according to State Department spokesman John Kirby.
The subject of the conversation was the conflict in Syria.
Kirby, however, gave no further details.
He said the US has the tools to "further isolate Russia" if it supports Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, RIA Novosti reports.
According to the Russian Foreign Ministry, Lavrov spoke with Kerry and again stressed the need to create a united front against the terrorist groups operating in the country.
The ways of settling the Ukrainian crisis, possible steps to reduce tension on the Korean Peninsula were also discussed.
In addition, some bilateral issues were raised.
Earlier, US officials said Russia was increasing its military presence in Syria and expressed concern about Moscow's increased support for Assad.
Washington has said that if Russia continues to support Assad, it will be further isolated from the international community.
In response, Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the country would not be isolated internationally.
The rebels are calling for the overthrow of the Assad regime.
Part of the territory was taken over by the terrorist organization "Islamic State".
The international coalition led by the US is exposing the positions of the ISIL to air strikes.
Borodoi called the information of the American newspaper slander against Strelkov.
Alexander Boroday, former chairman of the government of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic, denied the information published in the American newspaper The Washington Post.
He said this in a telephone interview with the correspondent of "Lenti.ru".
The great thing about the Washington Post is that it's completely twisted.
The former Minister of Defense of the DPR Igor Strelkov, naturally, no one was bound and "he left" the territory of the Donbass republics in a very upbeat mood, without ropes, without three fur coins, which are attributed to him by different characters", he noted.
According to Borodaya, the word about Strelkov in a conversation with a reporter of an American newspaper was indeed going on.
"Yes, I said that Strelkov urgently needed to be removed from the territory of the Donetsk People's Republic", - said the former head of the government of the DPR.
Boroday stressed that he did not know why the correspondent of the American edition decided to write that Strelkov was taken to the territory of Russia "connected".
I suspect this is a provocation.
If this is not a provocation, then it is a surprisingly misunderstood words, because I emphasized that Strelkov left himself", - said Borodoi.
"This is slander against me and Strelkov", he concluded.
Earlier, The Washington Post published an article citing Borodya's claim that he had forcibly removed Strelkov to Russian territory.
According to the publication, Boroday noted that he was forced to tie his colleague.
Polish authorities have begun searching for the Nazi gold train.
Polish lumberjacks have begun cutting down trees above an underground tunnel, where, according to some reports, a train carrying the gold of the Third Reich is located.
The work began on Tuesday, September 15, according to Reuters.
According to military experts, clearing the forest is necessary to verify the rumors about the treasure train.
Inside the train may be weapons and valuable minerals.
On August 31, the governor of the Polish Lower Silesian Voivodeship, Tomasz Smolarz, suggested that the new evidence for the gold train was no more convincing than the previous one.
However, the authorities have decided to seal off the search area.
Three days earlier, Poland's deputy culture minister, Peter Zuchovsky, had said that local treasure hunters had found the legendary gold train of the Third Reich with "99 percent probability".
Zhukovsky noted that if the assumptions are confirmed and the jewels are found, they will become the property of the state treasury, while the treasures will not be transferred to Russia.
In mid-August, two clients of the law firm approached the authorities in the Polish city of Walbice, reporting that they had found a train in a brick-and-mortar tunnel 70 meters below the ground.
The chief narcologist of the Russian Federation proposed to ban the sale of tobacco to persons under 21 years of age.
Russia's chief narcologist has proposed banning the sale of tobacco to under-21s.
Eugene Bruun noted that "any psychoactive substance - tobacco, alcohol, drugs - is particularly harmful" before this age.
He said this on the live broadcast of the radio station "Moscow Speaks", commenting on the information that the speaker of the Federation Council Valentina Matvienko supported the idea of banning the sale of alcohol to citizens under 21 years of age.
The human matures unevenly.
You can join the army at 18, you're physically ready for it.
He's mentally prepared for a full-fledged life in society since he was 21.
"It is known from scientific data that the brain, its biochemistry, is not fully mature until the age of 21", said Brunn.
Earlier, a member of the Public Chamber and the head of the "Serious Russia" project, Sultan Hamzaev, told Izvestiya that Matviyenko supported the initiative to raise the age limit for alcohol sales and "agreed to raise this issue again with the Public Chamber on the floor of the upper house of parliament".
According to the activist, a working group will soon be set up in the Federation Council to develop the bill under the leadership of Matvienko.
Bible was asked to check for compliance with the Children's Information Protection Act
A resident of Novosibirsk has asked the regional prosecutor's office to check the Bible for compliance with the federal law "On the protection of children from information that harms their health and development", a statement read by Sib.fm correspondent on September 16.
The author of the appeal stated that on August 26, 2015, he purchased a Bible published in 2013 by the Russian Bible Society in the shop "Read-city" on the Red Avenue.
He found passages in the book that he believed violated the Federal Law "On the Protection of Children from Information Harmful to Their Health and Development".
On September 16, the application was accepted for consideration by the Novosibirsk City Prosecutor's Office.
The response to the application of a resident of Novosibirsk will be received within 30 days.
The point is not to ban a book.
It is much more interesting to show the absurdity of the law itself, - the applicant commented to the correspondent of Sib.fm.
And it's a very serious problem that will upset the public.
It will then read the Bible again, something it has not done before.
Brazilian Pediatricians' Union Rio Grande promotes healthy eating for breastfeeding
The Brazilian pediatric organization SPRS has come up with a controversial method to convince women of the need for proper nutrition during breastfeeding: the method involves showing images of babies sucking on a breast painted with images of harmful food.
Breast milk contains various proteins, fats, vitamins, and carbohydrates, from which babies get all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system.
Because of the high energy requirements, pregnant women and those who have just given birth are encouraged to increase their daily intake by about 500 calories a day.
But recent research shows that a single calorie increase is not the only dietary change mothers should make.
A recent study conducted by Robert Waterland, a professor at Baylor College of Medicine in Texas, found that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects gene expression in their children and prevents them from developing tumors.
Unfortunately, it has been shown that unhealthy eating has a negative effect on the child's immune system.
A school bus was hit by a train under Hamburg.
Near Hamburg, a train collided with a school bus that was stuck on the railway track.
A 23-year-old female driver, realizing she couldn't move from the rails, ordered 60 students to get out of the vehicle.
And a minute after that, they had a collision in front of them.
It was caught on video by one of the students.
The emergency situation has caused panic among the students.
Some of the children started crying and running along the sidewalk.
The route is still blocked.
Police say that miraculously, no one was hurt, except for one passenger who suffered minor injuries.
The damage from the accident was estimated at 300 thousand euros.
The doctors are calling for a ban on boxing.
The leadership of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) called for a ban on boxing in the country after the death of local athlete David Brown Jr.
On Monday, Brown, 28, died of injuries sustained in a fight with Filipino Carlos Magali.
The fight for one of the regional titles in the International Boxing Federation (IBF) version in the under-57.15 kg weight category, held on Friday, ended with a knockout victory for Magalie in the 12th round.
Brown was hospitalized with a traumatic brain injury.
His condition was deemed critical and he was placed on life support.
In the professional ring, Brown won 22 fights, lost only two, and lost one match.
He has two children left.
This is the second death in the last six months among Australian boxers.
In March, 23-year-old student Braydon Smith died from injuries sustained in the ring.
The AMA now recommends that the sport be banned altogether.
"I understand that this is not intentional", said the organization's vice president, Stephen Parniss.
But in the form that boxing is now, there will always be situations where an athlete suffers a hemorrhage or brain injury that results in either death or serious injury.
For this reason, the AMA believes that we cannot continue to live with this.
The Australian Medical Association is an independent professional body that brings together practising doctors and medical students.
Sergei Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA to cancel sanctions against Russian parliamentarians.
The Speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation Sergey Naryshkin called the imposition of sanctions against parliamentarians inadmissible.
He said this while speaking at the OSCE PA session in Ulaanbaatar.
We consider this an unacceptable action, an attack on the values of parliamentary diplomacy.
"This should not happen again, because it is a manifestation of political shamelessness and ignoring the principles of open international dialogue", the politician said.
In addition, Naryshkin called on the OSCE PA participants to restore the partnership between Russia and the EU.
Let's get morality back into politics.
Let's bring back dialogue and law into the practice of international communication.
Let's bring the humanist ideals back into the democratic world order.
"The violence never ended well", he said.
Speaking from the Parliamentary Assembly's tribune, the speaker of the Russian State Duma called on parliamentarians to convene an inter-parliamentary contact group on Ukraine.
I urge the members of the assembly to focus on the following specific security challenges.
"First, to resolve the Ukrainian crisis through negotiations and the immediate convening of our inter-parliamentary group", said Naryshkin.
He also noted that the OSCE should be commended.
"This is almost the only common platform where they are still discussing how to normalize the situation in Ukraine", the politician stressed.
The autumn session of the Parliamentary Assembly opened on Tuesday, September 15, in Ulaanbaatar and will continue until September 18.
Enjoyed the victory for a couple of days.
The world champion in athletics is Sergei Shubenkov.
This season can be called a triumph for 24-year-old athlete from Barnaul Sergei SHUBENKOV.
He managed to win the team championship of Europe in his crowning distance of 110 meters with barriers, set several records, and most importantly - become the world champion, and the first in the history of the domestic barrier sprint.
In addition, recently, the athlete won the final stage of the "Diamond League", taking third place in the overall standings.
"Novye Izvestiye" asked Shubenkov to share his impressions from the outgoing season.
Sergei, is the season not over for you?
Yeah, I'm gonna be performing at the World Military Games in Korea in October, and then I'm gonna be thinking about rest.
I'll be home in Barnaul preparing, but being home is a different state.
It's easier than being on the road every week.
You once said that autumn was your favorite season.
Late August, early September is a wonderful time.
The passion after the season opener is boiling away, the burden of responsibility is not overwhelming.
You can compete for fun, for "relaxation".
Plus, you know, the holidays are coming up...
Are you tired?
It's a special season, a lot of positive emotions...
The fatigue always builds up by the end of the season.
And it doesn't matter if you've done more, won or lost.
Every competition is stressful.
The constant flying, the constant moving - all this does not pass without a trace for the organism.
You're physically and emotionally exhausted.
But I'm feeling a little emotional right now.
I'm so happy, you know?
The moment you finished the world championship in Beijing, do you go back often?
It happens.
And you journalists keep me from forgetting that.
But I think that the bad athlete is the one who lives by the old victories, repeating his successful races again and again.
Enjoy the victory for a couple of days, then move on.
Was the preparation for this wonderful season much different from your usual?
I can't say there was anything special about it.
We started preparing in December, but I missed the winter competition season.
I trained at home in Barnaul, then at the meetings, then back home.
It's the usual.
But the coach and I were challenged to try to reach a new level that I hadn't been yet.
They spent most of the winter laying the foundation.
We ran a bunch of treadmills, did some physical training that included push-ups, squats, and back-ups.
Then we started barrier training, doing a lot of technique.
Did you watch the other competitors?
I always try to do that, because in the Internet age, there's no problem with that.
I saw the European Winter Championships, and in the barrier sprint the French took the entire podium!
I've been thinking, we need to do something to dilute this company.
With every start this season, you've added and added to the score.
Did it give you confidence?
I've had all the seasons in my life in the same pattern.
There's no way I'm running 13.20 and then 13.50.
I always develop my form gradually.
The main thing I wanted to do was to escape from 13 seconds.
All the work was directed primarily to this result.
But the paradox is that you feel like you're ready to do something, and you don't always show up to the competition.
How was it, like, at the London Olympics?
I tried to forget about the semi-final race.
Gotham was really good, could really run out of 13 seconds.
Even if he could replicate his best performance at that time, he would be the bronze medalist of the Games.
But not luck.
Remember your first world championship?
What's the matter?
It was in the tag.
I really wanted to get to the final, it was such a high-end program.
And he fell right off the mat in the preliminary.
And then I realized that to tear and to carry with you is to run nowhere at all.
Two years later, at the world championships in Moscow, he had already reached the final with the best time.
I remember well how I felt before the decisive race: I wanted very much to win the gold!
How do you get to a decent speed without losing your head, without going off-course?
And that's the hard part.
You have to be very careful, very focused on the technique, so you don't break down barriers.
I've noticed that when you focus on the process, not the outcome, it's much easier.
And the best part is when you feel like you're running and everything's happening!
Honestly, it's worth it.
Many of our athletes from the countryside, after their first major success, are eager to move closer to the capital.
You never had that thought?
Home is still better.
I don't know where I'd be without my coach, who needs me?
Maybe it would be nice to have better conditions, but I try to be happy with what I have.
How long have you been with Klevtsov?
Since I was 12 years old, since I started athletics.
I trained with his wife, who worked with children, and then she handed me over.
I started with the sprint, then I jumped long, triple.
Kids used to play tag, they used to throw the ball, jump from the seat...
I tried barrier running at 14, and I loved it.
From the first race, I was able to meet the standards of the second adult class.
And he stayed that way.
You never had a fear of barriers?
I got them to agree to something.
But the technique has always been a lot of work.
I've been through a lot over one race!
But there's no getting away from this routine.
You have to keep your technique sharpened so that you can wake me up at night, and I'd get up and run through the barriers.
Everyone who saw you run in Beijing said it was a beautiful race.
Thank you. - Thank you.
I liked it myself.
I don't usually re-evaluate my runs, but I couldn't help myself.
But efficiency is something we have to work on, there's no limit to perfection.
Are you not now afraid that the victory a year before the Olympic Games will be a heavy burden?
As they say in these cases, I'll try to live up to expectations.
If you're going down this road, you're going to have to go all the way.
My coach likes to say, if you're not weak, you shouldn't feel any extra burden.
And I'm with him on that one.
Otar of the Kushna-shvili
Well, I'm not so naive as to be surprised by the reaction to the interview that happened in Ukraine.
The people are angry, I understand, don't feed them bread, give them a chance.
And even though I didn't flag it, and I've said it a million times, and I've never called anyone a bastard, I was hurt by something else.
All my fake friends just disappeared in a heartbeat.
The pressure I'm under is so strong that even I, who've seen the look of the boys, think the people are white.
You were walking, walking, and you were attacked by a mob and you had to use your sticks.
But you should know me, I'm not a chamber eagle, I'm a fist, I'm a howitzer, I'm old, you guys, be afraid.
The other thing is no support.
I had no illusions, and now...
The best part of me has always been self-sufficiency, so here's a bite.
And only jerks like Fred Durst or Monson can give out passports.
I'd rather be a journalist than a publicist.
A week ago in Kiev, Otar Kushanashvili described the events in Crimea in a sharp manner:
What they did to the Crimean peninsula is a crime.
That's what they call annexation.
I think that the reference to how the drunk Khrushchev tried to sign something doesn't fit in the general picture of human society.
It's like going to your neighbor's house and taking his land...
The war from the Kremlin is over, and it will end only there.
I'm pretty sure, like the summer of 2008, it started with a phone call from some Kremlin bastard.
I have a hunch about who it might be...
Cobzon doesn't have much time left.
I don't understand, he's the greatest artist, why does he need to lick Putin's hands.
Is he gonna lose his apartment?
Well, they took down his statue.
Of course, people remember him as an insult to his little homeland.
And the reconciliation is now only up to Vladimir Vladimirovich.
Sunrise Seventh leads the rankings despite Ninth's attempts to cover the leaders' loss on the Today Show.
Carl Stefanovich and Lisa Wilkinson's trip to Canberra to cover the fallout from the Liberal Party's announcement that it was vacating its leader's seat failed to boost Today's ratings.
The morning show of the Ninth was broadcast from the nation's capital after Malcolm Turnbull's defeat of Tony Abbott.
The competition - Sunrise - with David Koch and Samantha Armitage as hosts, was stuck in London as part of a weekly series of international broadcasts that also includes Dubai, New York, Niagara Falls and Cancun.
This torture of distance did not seem to matter much to Australian viewers, with Sunrise's audience totalling 397,000 viewers in the five largest cities compared to Today's audience of 339,000.
Today scored slightly higher than its rankings on Monday (317,000) and last Tuesday (283,000), but its figure was worse than last Thursday's (343,000).
Today has been closing the gap with Sunrise in recent months.
Today had 318,000 in August compared to 330,000 at Sunrise.
At the beginning of the year, the gap was between 40,000 and 50,000.
So far in September, Sunrise has 349,000 viewers against 314,000 for Today.
That's the most interesting thing that's happened all morning.
The winds of change are blowing stronger than Parliament this morning, folks!
Carl and Lisa are fine, thank you for clarifying.

The big news for Seven was the stunning debut of 800 Words with former Packed to the Rafters star Eric Thomson.
The new drama about a recently widowed family man who decides to move to the coast of New Zealand with his two children has garnered an impressive audience of 1.219 million viewers.
Critics have wondered if Thomson could handle the popular show on his own, without Rafters star Rebecca Gibney.
The result of last night is a resounding "yes".
The X Factor Seventh remained in strong positions with an audience of 1.136 million, easily beating The Block (838 000) and TBL Families (726 000).
For Seven, the second night of the Chase Australia was a mixed bag of luck and bad luck.
The first half hour (from 5:00 to 5:30 p.m.) of the new telequotient, hosted by Andrew O'Keefe, drew 446,000 viewers.
The second half of the day (from 5:30 to 6:00 p.m.) saw the number jump to 623,000 - enough for a small victory over Hot Seat Eddie McGuire's 613,000.
On Monday night, the first half-hour of Chase Australia drew 520,000 viewers, and the second half-hour, a whopping 720,000.
Hot Seat has raised $620,000.
Chase Australia's falling ratings for the second night will force the Ninth to quietly admit that Hot Seat will still dominate at 5:30.
Chase Australia is the replacement for Million Dollar Minute, which failed to replay the McGuire show.

The three finalists agree that Sam Wood, the bachelor, is the perfect guy, but who will he choose?
The secret is out?
Lana Jevon-Fellows, Sarah McKay and Snezhana Markoski may have accidentally let you know which one of them would win at "The Hollow".
The woman who will ultimately be left with Sam Wood in "The Ballad" is shrouded in mystery.
And the three finalists, of course, are keeping quiet about which one of them got his last rose.
But when we met with Sarah McKay, Snowy Markoski and Lana Jevons-Fellows on the eve of the day when two of the three girls would be left, they may have inadvertently given a clue as to the winner.
Sam Wood has been steadfast in keeping the silence until the final, which is Thursday.
All three women come in lyrically, explaining why Wood is the ideal man, while mentioning his sense of humor, his determination, his family values, his cheerfulness as reasons why each of them would be happy to be his partner.
But their answers to the question, "If you don't, who should get the last rose of Wood?" may have unwittingly revealed which of them had truly won the heart of the "Twister".
Jevons-Fellows and Markoski have no doubt called McKay the perfect match for Wood.
Sarah and Sam have been on good terms since day one.
"From the moment I joined the cast, I felt the energy of [Sarah] and the energy of Sam and I knew they were a great match, and throughout the show I didn't doubt that", Jevons-Fellows said.
"Sarah is very open, easy and fun", added Markoski.
I've seen them together, and there's a real attraction between them.
They feel great and comfortable with each other.
Sarah McKay thinks she and Sam Wood would make a great couple.
McKay herself said that the house dates last week made her realize that Wood might be "the one".
"As soon as I saw him among my friends and family, I knew that this was not just a game - I believed him with all my heart", she says.
When asked who should Wood choose if it wasn't her, she gave a puzzling answer.
"I don't know if I can talk about it", she said.
I like both girls equally, and Snow White and Lana deserve it equally.
The Bachelor airs Wednesdays at 7:30 on Channel Ten.

Jarryd Hayne had several options to start his NFL career.
Detroit and Seattle have been keenly interested in him since his move to the U.S. - as have a host of other clubs who have sent in requests after a spectacular open day of practice late last year.
But Hayne chose the San Francisco 49ers and coach Jim Tomsall, and it seems like a wise decision.
Some coaches would have Hayne on the bench for the rest of the game for a missed field goal by a former Australian rugby league player on the first punt return in a 20-3 win over Minnesota.
But Tomsula believed in his player and gave Hayne another chance to win the pant, as well as bringing him into the game after Reggie Bush's injury.
Tomsula showed his good side after the game, in the locker room.
Instead of giving the new recruits a hard time in front of the team, he encouraged them.
Tomsula also publicly endorsed Hayne at a press conference after the match.
49ers special reporter Cam Inman reported that Hayne also received support from special teams coordinator Thomas McGoy, who advised him to forget about the fumble and think about the next game.
Jarrid Haney lost a punt return to the Minnesota Vikings in the first quarter.
This was clearly not the start that Hayne and his many Australian fans had hoped for.
Hayne was seen cursing as he walked off the field after losing the ball, and later told the host of the "Hamish and Andy" show on Australian radio station 2DayFM 104.1 that he could not imagine a more unfortunate start to his NFL career.
"That happens, you just think about the next game and that's it", Hayne said.
Hayne compared his failure to his debut in the Origin series in 2007, when a ball in his scoring area brought a try to Queensland.
In the end, the experience proved to be quite useful for the 27-year-old.
Hayne took a photo with the Australian flag and fans after the game and posted the image on Instagram.
Elton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin will meet to discuss gay rights.
In 2003, Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the richest man in Russia, was arrested under threat of gunfire at a Siberian airport.
Khodorkovsky, who openly challenged President Vladimir Putin, was convicted, his oil company Yukos was confiscated, and his attempts to develop democracy were thwarted.
There have been clashes between migrants and police at the Hungarian border.
Refugees staged a protest near the Hungarian town of Reske on the border with Serbia, which escalated into clashes with law enforcement.
As a result, Hungarian police used water cannons and tear gas, reports Reuters.
Migrants throw stones at police and try to tear down the fence at the border.
Reinforcements are being sent to the scene of the clashes, and police are taking action in response to the aggressive actions of migrants and their attempts to violate the border.
As Agence France-Presse reports, the refugees managed to break through the police cordon, after which dozens of migrants fled to Hungary.
Some refugees are leaving the Serbian-Hungarian border in buses heading for Belgrade and the Croatian border, reports BBC.
Authorities allowed migrants to enter Croatian territory and transport them to their destination.
According to Hungarian authorities, 20 police officers were injured.
On September 15, the Hungarian parliament tightened legislation on migration and border protection.
The amendments include the involvement of the army in the protection of state borders, the criminal prosecution of those who cross the border illegally, and the accelerated procedure for the examination of asylum applications.
A Hungarian court has already found one migrant guilty of illegally crossing the Hungarian-Serbian border, and he will be deported and unable to return to Hungary for one year.
The Hungarian parliament is also planning to consider transferring the functions of border protection to the Hungarian armed forces.
In late June, the Hungarian authorities began the construction of a 175 km barbed wire fence on the border with Serbia to stem the flow of migrants and refugees into the country.
A Russian man has confessed to the largest cyber attack in U.S. history.
Russian Vladimir Drinkman, accused of the biggest cyberattack in US history, has confessed to stealing more than 160 million credit card numbers, Reuters reports.
During his trial in federal court in New Jersey, Drinkman pleaded guilty to conspiracy to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and to commit fraud.
During the meeting, the Russian spoke about a conspiracy with three Russian citizens and a citizen of Ukraine, who are accused of cyberattacks on 15 companies.
The combined damage from the defendants' actions was estimated at $300 million.
"Defendants like Vladimir Drinkman, who have the skills to hack into our computer networks, pose a threat to our economic well-being, privacy and national security", said U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman.
Drinkman faces 30 years in prison, as well as a $1 million fine.
In passing sentence, the court will take into account the Russian's confession and may reduce his sentence.
Drinkman will be sentenced on January 15th.
Vladimir Drinkman was arrested in the Netherlands in 2012.
At the same time, another suspect, Dmitry Smilyanets, was taken into custody.
The latter denies any guilt in the crimes alleged against him.
Kerry warned Lavrov of the risks of Russia supporting the regime of Bashar Assad.
During a phone call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry warned that Russia's support for Syrian President Bashar Assad is exacerbating the conflict in the country.
"Secretary Kerry made clear that Russia's support for President Assad risks exacerbating and expanding the conflict and undermining our shared goal of countering extremism if we do not focus on finding a solution to the conflict in Syria through an effective political transition", the State Department said in a statement posted on its website.
Kerry reiterated the US commitment to combat the Islamic State group (banned in Russia by the Supreme Court) in a coalition of more than 60 states.
According to the Secretary of State, Assad "could never be a reliable member" of the coalition.
Kerry also stressed that the conflict in Syria can only be resolved by a political transition away from Assad.
The White House threatened to isolate Russia for supporting the Assad regime.
Yesterday, White House spokesman Joshua Ernest threatened to isolate Russia if it doesn't stop supporting Assad.
As an alternative, Ernest suggested joining the international coalition that is conducting an anti-terrorist operation against the Islamic State.
Recently, the media has often reported the presence of Russian military personnel on the territory of Syria.
Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russian soldiers have been in Syria for many years and are helping the Syrians to master the technology to use it against Islamists.
Four killed when police fired rubber bullets at protesters in Nepal
Four people, including a 4-year-old boy, were killed in southern Nepal when police opened fire with rubber bullets at a crowd protesting the country's proposed new constitution, an official said on Wednesday.
The violence occurred late Tuesday in Rupandey district, about 175 miles west of the country's capital, Kathmandu.
Bishnu Prasad Dhakal, the district police chief, said that more than 1,000 protesters gathered outside one of the police stations, some throwing stones and incendiary bombs.
Mr. Dakhal reported that the police used tear gas, then fired in the air before firing rubber bullets.
Twenty police officers and five civilians were wounded, he said.
It's not clear why rubber bullets, which are known to kill, but traditionally used as a less lethal alternative, caused such a high death rate.
The clash was the latest in weeks of violent protests in the southern, plains region of Nepal, where the Mande people say the new provinces created under the new constitution will reduce their political influence.
Protests have also been held in western Nepal, among ethnic Taru citizens who want to have their own state.
At least 40 people, including 11 police officers, have been killed in violent clashes since 10
In August, when the four main political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces, a crucial step towards a new constitution, it was a highly controversial issue in Nepal, which had been centrally governed for several centuries.
Work on a new constitution has been underway since 2008, but lawmakers accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands in April.
Lawmakers voted for the constitution's articles in Kathmandu this week, and officials said the new chapter would be signed by Sunday.
Sayansky plans to create a 900-employee company.
Sayansk is the youngest city in the Irkutsk region.
It was built in the 70s of the last century as a center of chemical industry, has a developed infrastructure that requires system support.
A year ago, Sayansky was headed by a new mayor - Oleg Borovsky.
He told the correspondent of "Oblastnaya" about the results of the first year of work, about new projects and perspectives.
Oleg Valeryevich, how did you start your work as mayor?
First of all, I got acquainted with the results of the financial and economic activities checks, initiated an independent audit examination of the spending of local budget funds.
Then the municipal property was audited.
One of the first practical steps was to reduce the document turnover to five days.
In the past, court papers could take months to complete.
Measures to increase the income base and optimize expenditures were developed.
In November last year, a government meeting was held in Sajansk, where the issues of socio-economic development of the territory were considered.
There was no project-estimatory documentation (PSD) for any object in the city.
Without this, Sayansk could not participate in federal programs.
We started with the construction of the roads, the kindergarten, the northern sewer and the water supply.
Two sections are already under construction.
How is the Russian presidential decree on the construction of kindergartens being implemented in the city?
In July of this year, 105 babies were born in Sayansk.
This is the best demographic the city has seen in 27 years.
So the issue of childcare is one of the most pressing issues today.
Since September 1, the No. 10 kindergarten, designed for 320 places, has been closed for major repairs.
The estimated cost of the repair is 86 million rubles.
The city has never received such funds before.
Last year, after renovation, kindergarten No. 23 opened, which now serves 200 children.
The repair was made on the terms of co-financing from the regional and local budgets, its cost amounted to more than 67 million rubles.
Thanks to the efforts of the administration and the help of the regional government, funds were sought for the purchase of furniture and equipment, and the program "People's Initiatives" helped.
There are plans to start construction of a new kindergarten in 2016.
With its introduction, we plan to eliminate the queue for children aged between one and a half and three years.
We don't have lines for three- to seven-year-olds.
Investors showing interest in the territory?
We have a clear understanding that the construction of the city should be done primarily by the Sayan enterprises, and they need to be provided with work.
In October, a 60-apartment house for orphans in the Leningradsky microdistrict is already being put into operation.
As for construction, I would add that Sayansk is one of the four cities in the Angara region that has entered the program for the construction of economy-class housing.
All the necessary documentation is in place.
Construction on the 90 block section will begin shortly.
We have announced the construction of 10,000 square meters of housing.
One of the conditions - the housing should be no more than 30 thousand rubles per square meter, this cost includes the "turnkey" decoration.
If we can meet the quota, we can stay in the program.
As for investors, we have other interesting projects.
At one time, the Sajan pig complex was built on the territory, which was sold for nothing in 2004.
We're working with the D.A.'s office to appeal this deal.
Especially since the land under the facility is federal property.
Work is underway with Moscow, the issue of transferring 88 hectares to the regional property, with subsequent transfer of land to the municipality.
There is a potential investor willing to invest 1.5 billion rubles in the reconstruction and launch of the project.
With the pig complex, we'll have 900 jobs, which will be a huge boost to the city.
Is there a social partnership institute in Sayansk?
We have about 140 social and economic partnership agreements.
A lot of projects were implemented thanks to the active social position of business representatives.
Such enterprises as ZAO "Vostok-Center", Novo-Zimskaya TPP, "Sayan broiler" LLC, "PC MDF" LLC, provide tangible support, the management of these enterprises responds to all the appeals.
Directly to the Day of the city, "Sayansky broiler" LLC presented the city with a children's town, the firm "Vostock-Center" repaired the horse courtyard, where specialists are engaged with children and therapy, spending more than 1 million rubles.
Sponsorships helped to improve the area of the city's ZAGS.
Sponsors helped us to celebrate the city day in a colorful way.
Just like old times, a parade was held with the participation of the city's collectives and organizations.
A chronicle of the city, a book of the Sayan poets, was published.
The first builders and people who made a serious contribution to the development of Sajansk were awarded with anniversary medals.
The city's charitable foundation is also supported by the city's patronage.
The very first step was to acquire instruments for young talented musicians.
Over the past nine months, more than 800 thousand rubles have been allocated to supporting talented young people, to helping children in need of expensive treatment, to supporting children from low-income families.
How are the personnel problems in the social sphere solved in Sayansk?
The city has a shortage of doctors and teachers.
The housing of specialists is of great importance for the solution of the personnel issue.
Last year, we gave five apartments to doctors, four to teachers.
We have a housing allocation program with the option of privatizing it in five years.
The plans are to re-plan the building, which will have eight more apartments for teachers.
Teachers and doctors are also involved in the Housing for the Russian Family program.
In the future, a house for the public sector workers.
The most important thing is that I have a team in town that can handle the toughest problems.
It's important to learn from all the crises, and life doesn't stop.
The potential of Sajansk and our region is great.
The Duma has introduced a bill on indexing social pensions with the rise in prices.
A bill was introduced in the State Duma that would index social pensions annually from 1 February, taking into account the rise in prices.
The author of the document - the MP from "Fair Russia" Alexander Lomakin-Rumyantsev - also proposes to carry out additional indexation of pensions on April 1, if the growth rate of the subsistence minimum exceeds the growth rate of prices for goods and services.
According to the current legislation, social pensions are indexed annually from 1 April, taking into account the growth rate of the pensioner's subsistence minimum in the Russian Federation over the past year.
The bill, introduced in the lower house, provides for the introduction of indexation of social pensions, taking into account the growth rate of consumer prices.
The first indexation is carried out on 1 February, and the second indexation is carried out on 1 April.
The head of the OSCE PA told Mogherini that it was unacceptable to impose sanctions against the parliamentarians.
In an official letter to the EU's top foreign affairs official, Federica Mogherini, the OSCE PA spokesperson, Ilkka Kanerva, said that sanctions against lawmakers participating in the assembly's activities were inadmissible.
This was reported by a member of the Russian delegation to the OSCE PA autumn session in Ulan-Bator Nikolay Kovalev.
According to TASS, the position of Canerva was supported by the signatures of European parliamentarians, including representatives of Germany, France, Italy, Cyprus, Greece.
"There is already a strong enough support", Kovalev said.
Earlier, he stated that the head of the OSCE PA spoke with the intention of collecting signatures of deputies who pointed out the inadmissibility of imposing sanctions against parliamentarians.
In particular, Kovalev noted, Kanerva promised to raise the issue to the level of the EU's governing structures and "send the appropriate petition".
The NHC reports a 60 percent chance of a cyclone south of the Green Cape Islands.
A broad front low-pressure area about 350 miles (560 km) south of the southern tip of the Cape Verde Islands has a 60 percent chance of developing into a tropical cyclone within the next 48 hours, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said Tuesday.
But a clearly delineated low pressure area about midway between the islands of Cape Verde and the Lesser Antilles also has a 60 percent chance of forming a tropical cyclone in the next two days, Miami weather forecasters report.
Google launches campaign to double donations to raise $11 million for refugees
Google Inc (GOOGL.O) has announced the launch of a double-bill campaign, aimed at raising $11 million for humanitarian organizations that help flood Europe with refugees fleeing war-torn and impoverished countries.
Google took an uncharacteristically personal approach when announcing the fundraising campaign on their blog.
Instead of a statement from an executive, Google employee Rita Masoud, who fled Kabul with her family when she was seven, described her own experience.
"We traveled by suspicious trains and buses, endured hunger, thirst, cold, and fear", she wrote.
I was lucky.
But as the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has deepened, many people like my family are in desperate need of help.
The donations will be given to four non-profit organizations that work with refugees and migrants: Doctors Without Borders, the International Rescue Committee, Save the Children, and the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Google said it would double the first $5.5 million in donations until the total on its page google.com/refugeerelief reached $11 million.
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II, driven in large part by the four-year-old civil war in Syria, which has displaced more than 4 million people this year.
Many are also fleeing war-torn Afghanistan, Yemen, Iraq and Libya.

For diabetics with a low level of obesity, obesity surgery may be helpful
The beneficial effect of weight-loss surgery in people with mild obesity who have type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years, according to a new study.
However, it is too early to say that diabetics with moderate obesity live longer after obesity surgery than those who receive nonsurgical treatment.
"The mortality statistics are not coming out right away", said Dr. Robin Blackstone, an expert in obesity surgery who wrote about the new study in the editorial column of JAMA Surgery.
Bariatric surgery, or obesity surgery, uses various techniques to reduce the size of the stomach.
They reduce hunger and limit the body's ability to digest food.
Bariatric surgery has been shown to be effective in treating type 2 diabetes for several years, but the main studies have been in people with morbid obesity, with a body mass index (BMI) of 35 or higher.
BMI, a measure of weight relative to height, is considered normal when it is between 18.5 and 24.9.
A BMI of 25 or higher indicates that a person is overweight, and people with a BMI of 30 or higher are considered obese.
You can calculate your BMI here: 1.usa.gov/1D0ZqDv.
For the new study, researchers at Taiwan's Min-Sheng General Hospital used data collected since 2007 to compare two types of bariatric surgery - gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy - with medical treatment of type 2 diabetes in people with mild obesity.
The average BMI of those who underwent surgery fell from 31 to 24.5 by the end of the fifth year of the study.
Meanwhile, those who have been treated for diabetes without surgery have a BMI of about 29.
Of those who had the surgery, 36 percent were completely cured of diabetes and 28 percent were partially cured.
In comparison, the control group had only 1 percent of complete diabetes and only about 2 percent of partial diabetes.
Also, blood pressure, triglycerides, and "bad" LDL cholesterol "were generally better in the surgical group", the authors state.
The researchers also monitored the levels of hemoglobin A1c in the blood, which reflects the blood sugar levels in the dynamics.
A1c is best kept below 7 percent, the researchers write.
After surgery, the average hemoglobin A1c dropped from about 9% to about 6%.
In the treatment group, however, it remained stable at about 8%.
But better glycemic control, reflected in good hemoglobin A1c levels, did not reduce the five-year mortality rate, according to study leader Dr. Chi-Cheng Soo and colleagues.
The research team also compared the average outcomes of two types of surgical treatment.
By the fifth year, the shunt group lost more weight (18.7 kg vs. 14.2 kg) than the sleeve gastrectomy group, had a greater reduction in BMI (7.4 vs. 5.1) and A1c (3.1% vs. 2.1%) than the shunt group, and were closer to complete diabetes remission (46.9% vs. 16.7%).
While the new study does not demonstrate surgical benefits in terms of life expectancy after five years, there is evidence from a study of overweight people in Sweden that surgical treatment does lead to an increase in life expectancy, reports Blackstone of the University of Arizona College of Medicine in Phoenix.
A Swedish study found that the probability of dying over 15 years was about 29% lower for obese people who chose bariatric intervention compared to the group who chose more traditional methods.
Although the new study did not show an increase in life expectancy, Blackstone noted that it was encouraging for people with a BMI below 35 to be interested in such a procedure.
"This report is very important because it says that this surgery is safe in a group with a low BMI, where there is no increased risk of mortality or kidney disease", she said.
Blackstone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as a patient's BMI falls between the range of 27 and 30.
"I think we've waited too long to get people to take it seriously", she said.
It seems to me that once they accumulate the genetic changes that trigger obesity and diabetes in their bodies, it's very difficult to reverse it.
In Mytichy, the robbers took from the house furs and 9 million rubles.
In Mytizh, robbers attacked the residents of a house near Moscow and stole 9 million rubles and three women's coats.
This is reported by "Interfax" with reference to the press service of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Russian Federation.
The incident happened on Tuesday morning.
Two unknown men entered the house through an open front door, tied the 20-year-old son of the house and, threatening both with a knife, stole 9 million rubles and three coats.
According to preliminary data, the amount of damage amounted to 9 million 265 thousand rubles, a criminal case has been opened under the article "Robbery".
The fans from Europe are at risk of becoming homeless.
Only 23 hotels in St. Petersburg have the right to accommodate tourists who will come to watch the 2018 World Cup.
The rest of the hotels are in no hurry to get the proper permits.
Experts say that's a very worrying sign.
In the run-up to the world championship, the authorities will have to think of ways to relocate all the city's guests.
The interlocutors of "Rosbalt" believe that because of the tournament, the cost of renting rental apartments will increase by 10-30%, and after the championship, rental housing will have to be overpaid.
The World Cup has forced the authorities to pay attention to the state of Russian hotels.
According to a law written specifically for the first place, every hotel in St. Petersburg must pass a classification procedure and prove that it meets the stated number of stars and service level.
It is already clear that not everyone will be able to do this: hoteliers are so afraid of inspections that they often do not even send documents to the requests of the Federal Antimonopoly Service for St. Petersburg.
As the head of the Federal Office of Administrative Justice Vadim Vladimirov said, the agency has studied 138 hotels and now plans to open 34 cases against hotels, many of which simply did not respond to the anti-monopoly.
There are signs that the management of three dozen companies deceived the citizens, placing a certain number of stars in advertising, Vladimirov noted.
The problem is that there are literally every number on the table now, and none of them can be lost before 2018.
Officials suspect that during the football championship, fans will be taking over all the hotels in St. Petersburg.
Now tourists can count on 30,500 rooms in the city.
According to Smolny, there are 17 five-star hotels in St. Petersburg, 51 four-star hotels, 100 two- and three-star hotels, and 550 one-star hotels.
According to the first deputy of the committee for tourism development Nana Gvichiya, at the moment only 23 hotels have been classified - so many inspections were carried out by companies accredited in St. Petersburg.
But whether any hotel has ordered such a procedure from regional enterprises, the Smolny, by a surprising coincidence, is not known.
So there could be more that have been classified, but no one knows about it.
"In the last six months, hotels have not been very keen to pass the classification", admitted the director of the North-West Branch of the Russian Union of the Tourist Industry, Ekaterina Shadskaya.
This is because it's the high season, when the hoteliers make the most money and don't want to do anything else.
Another reason is budgets that do not include the cost of checks, and the procedure can cost the hotel from 30 to 100 thousand rubles or more depending on the status.
But recently, hotel managers have become more active and started to apply for classification, Shadskaya said.
Hotels have to be in by July 1, 2016, or they'll not only pay the fine, but they won't be allowed to work at the World Cup.
It's already been announced that a fixed hotel room fee will be established for the duration of the tournament, depending on the star.
The formulas that will calculate the cost will be released next year.
This is done to prevent a 200-300% price spike, as happens, for example, during the St. Petersburg Economic Forum.
You have to have a conscience and not allow a double or triple raise, but you also have to make the hotels earn money.
"I think the increase will be up to 50%", - explained the president of the Russian Hotel Association Gennady Lamshin.
In turn, Vadim Vladimirov is not sure that price fixing corresponds to the understanding of market economy.
I don't know how much of that fits into the framework of economic theory, but I hope this measure is justified.
"It's better than a runaway increase in prices", he said.
It's unclear what will happen to the popular cheap hostels.
State Duma deputies introduced a bill that would ban hostels in residential buildings.
We hope that this law will not be passed or will not affect St. Petersburg.
"We will defend the point of view that hostels should be preserved", Nana Gwatia believes.
However, she said, mini-hotel owners should be prepared for the Housing Code to be tightened.
If the state Duma approves the bill, about 80% of hostels in St. Petersburg will close, and at the moment there are about 1,500 rooms.
According to Leonid Garbar, president of the Northwest Federation of Restaurateurs and Hoteliers, there is a shortage of two- and three-star hotels in St. Petersburg, which are in demand by football fans, but there is a shift towards hotels with four and five stars.
This is similar to the situation when "there are 75,000 VIPs sitting in an 80,000-seat stadium".
That's what the mini-hotels can do.
The expert considers their possible ban "idiot": "It seems strange to me that some people can live in apartments, but for some reason foreigners cannot".
If the hostel is being used as a dormitory, then I agree that it's wrong.
But if it's like a hotel where guests stay for a short period of time, why not?
The mini-hotels are risking missing the World Cup because of their lack of diligence.
Hundreds of small hotels just don't make the grade, and they're digging their own holes.
By the summer of 2016, all the hotels in the city will be ordering the work.
"There are not so many companies that can carry out this procedure, so they will refuse to pay less for orders from mini-hotels, and will choose those that are more expensive", - said Gennady Lamshin, adding that in a number of cities, for example, Moscow and Volgograd, the indicators of inspections are significantly higher than those in St. Petersburg.
The reason for the St. Petersburg delay is also related to the constant changes in the tourist block of the government, which does not contribute to a coordinated work.
According to experts, if St. Petersburg hotels are not enough for everyone, it is likely that regional hotels and holiday homes will have to pay attention.
For example, the celebration of the 300th anniversary of St. Petersburg may mobilize the river fleet into the city, which means that the guests of the tournament will be able to live in cabins.
Many fans will also arrive in prepared vans, which will be able to sleep in.
"The main thing is not to build so many hotels, so that they are empty", says Gennady Lamshin.
Also, the rental housing will be very popular during the football championship.
Most likely, the city will create a reserve of rental apartments.
The rent will go up 10-30%.
"The obvious is that the first to leave will be the housing near the stadium", said Larisa Bragina, a specialist in leasing for the Agency for Development and Research in Real Estate.
And the rent might not be back to where it was after the championship, especially in the sleeping quarters.
The construction of new transport intersections on the outskirts of the city will also contribute to this, she stressed.
And let's not forget the human qualities of the citizens.
For example, Leonid Garbar believes that St. Petersburg has always been a hospitable city, where people not only give directions, but also can take a mini-tour.
There are complications.
My father in 1970 in the yard met a family from Murmansk - father, mother and two children.
They had nowhere to sleep: hotels were difficult, sleeping in the train station was difficult.
"And Dad brought them to our public apartment to sleep", the interviewer recalled.
However, he added that now the city's residents have no such trait - calling home is fraught with consequences and fear.
But in 2018, after the unsuccessful decisions of the State Duma, the mistakes of hoteliers and governments, we may have to remember the past?
Zhirinovsky "slipped" the Amur region.
I was very impressed with the Jirinovsky clown act in the State Duma.
He did this kind of thing when our generation was just learning how to sell newspapers, and he's still in great shape.
The theme of the speech, it seems, is "protest of the LDPR against the election results in the Amur region".
He doesn't shudder at the protocols - because there are none; the LDPR apparently has no other protocols except those signed by the election commissioners.
Here he is, raising Ivan Abramov, the runner-up, and saying something like, "There's the winner of the election!"
And then, out of nowhere, he attacks Rodnina, and then, after a quarrel with the chairman, he drives the faction out of the meeting room, shouting literally "You are all with your frontal crooks and thieves".
The press, of course, focuses not on Abramov, but on the scandal and the demarche of the faction as a consequence of this scandal and insult.
Really, Volfovich beautifully and elegantly merged the Amur region with Abramov.
For the whole country, this is just another stunt by Zhirinovsky in the style of "Scum!" and not a protest by a political party against the results of a specific election.
Both the faction has been formally scandalized, and the election, according to the party website and Ivan Abramov's Facebook, is not recognized, but the leader is clearly off topic.
He allows the dead on the Amur to bury their dead, and he himself is against "United Russia" as a whole and Rodnina is not guilty of anything.
A fine solution, to keep a face and not to get into a real, not a show-off scandal.
It's another thing that Abramov himself is now in a strange position.
He expected nothing but shouts from his superiors, no alternative protocols on hand.
He is not the focus of public attention, on the one hand, and on the other hand - for a narrow circle it was he who became the formal reason for insulting the esteemed champion, and, what is even cooler, the shameful attacks on the EP and the ONF.
And he's got to think very, very hard about what he's doing.
Because from the main beneficiary of the elections, the number 2 politician of the region and the number 1 candidate for the only regional single-mandate constituency, he can turn into a pariah, which has been successfully used by his own party leadership and a super-annoying for the same FN and the party leadership of someone else.
That's right - there was no Zhirinovsky, it should have been invented and respectably watched.
Trump is gonna grow up and grow up.
Word has it that the LDPR will be back in the hall during the next plenary.
I mean, the bathroom fell out of nowhere.
The only thing Abramova buried under her own skin.
It is beautiful.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe" - Dalai Lama - RT News
Europe cannot take in all refugees, the Dalai Lama said, adding that the real solution to the current refugee crisis lies in the Middle East.
The Tibetan Buddhist leader called for an end to violence in the countries that are home to refugees.
The Dalai Lama touched on the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Ethics Research in Oxford, at the start of his 10-day visit to the UK.
He stated that in the present circumstances the interests of humanity must be above the interests of individual countries or even continents.
He also stressed that while this is admirable, the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is not adequate.
"It is impossible for everyone to come to Europe", he said in his speech.
While praising the actions taken by Germany and Austria in response to the crisis, the Dalai Lama stressed that this was only a temporary solution.
"The care of thousands of refugees is great, but at the same time you have to think about long-term solutions, how to bring real peace and real development, mainly through education, to these Muslim countries", he stressed.
After all, we have to think about how to reduce the number of murders in their countries.
We have to reduce the use of force.
The use of force has never solved these problems", he added.
Speaking of violence, the Dalai Lama also commented on George Bush's actions after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, saying that the US's tough response had set off a chain of events that were out of control.
After 9/11, I sent a letter of condolence to President Bush and told him that the solution to this problem was nonviolence.
I know his intentions were good, but he used force, and it had unintended consequences", said the Dalai Lama.
Four-fold increase in children swallowing hand sanitizer in the last four years.
Toxicology centers in the United States have reported an almost 400 percent increase since 2010 in the number of children under 12 years of age who ingested alcohol-based hand sanitizer, according to the Georgia State Toxicology Center.
According to Dr. Gaylord Lopez, director of the Georgia State Toxicology Center, the number of hand sanitizer ingestions reported to the centers by children under 12 years of age increased from 3,266 in 2010 to 16,117 in 2014.
"Children are exposed to these substances more often, and unfortunately, a certain percentage of them are sent to the emergency room", Lopez told CNN.
He said that some children drink the disinfectant liquid on purpose, and some do it to impress their friends or to argue for social media.
YouTube videos show teenagers drinking disinfectant as a cheap drink.
Teens reportedly mixed disinfectant with alcohol-containing mouthwash to make a stronger drink.
Younger children may be attracted to the pleasant smell of the disinfectant.
"The child doesn't think it can harm him", Lopez said.
Many of the most attractive hand sanitizers are the ones that are flavored.
There are hand sanitizers with the smell of strawberries, grapes, oranges, which are very appealing to children.
Hand sanitizer fluid contains anywhere from 45 to 95 percent alcohol.
In young children, especially, just a few sprays can cause alcohol poisoning.
"This is a high-concentration alcohol", said Dr. Stephen Thornton, chief medical officer of the toxicology center at the University of Kansas Hospital, to Fox 4 in Kansas City.
You wouldn't leave a shot of whiskey out, but people keep these hand sanitizers in mind, and if kids get their hands on them, it's a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol.
Naija Russell, a six-year-old girl who recently swallowed a hand sanitizer with a strawberry flavor in the amount of about four sprays, was sent to the emergency room for treatment.
Her blood alcohol level was 179, twice that of an adult who is considered legally intoxicated, according to Dr. Chris Ritchie, the emergency room physician who treated her at Gwinnett Medical Center near Atlanta.
Naija was speechless and unable to walk when she was taken to the emergency room.
Doctors watched her all night in a separate children's clinic to make sure there was no sign of brain injury, as the alcohol caused the girl to fall and hit her head, Ritchie said.
"It was very scary", Orthoria Scott, Naija's mother, told CNN.
It could have been fatal for my child.
Lopes advised parents and teachers to use non-spicy substances or disinfectant wipes, in addition to keeping hand sanitizers out of the reach of children.
Aside from alcohol poisoning, some disinfectant fluids have been linked to deaths.
In 2013, two women in Ontario died after ingesting a disinfectant that contained a toxic, undiagnosed ingredient.
Health officials suspect the product contained methanol, a lethal agent, not the ethanol alcohol that was listed as the active ingredient.
In January, three fourth-grade students in upstate New York conspired to poison their "opposite" teacher by "spreading antibacterial agents in the classroom", according to a police report.
The teacher is allergic to hand sanitizers, and she has banned them from her classroom.
Police believe the failed plan was "empty talk", and are addressing disciplinary issues to the school district.
How the oldest children's library in Barnaul became a family club.
On the back of the bench at the entrance to the regional children's library named after N.K. Krupskaya, a cast-iron owl is sad.
The kids who come for the books try to feed her candy.
He's been going to this library for generations, for 95 years.
The very first readers in the twentieth years of the last century arranged loud readings here, staged plays on the poems of Mayakovsky, held literary quizzes and corresponded with Lenin's wife.
Correspondence lasted four years, and as the newspaper "Young steel", wrote in 1939, with each day "the friendship between Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya and friends of the children's library of Barnaul" became stronger.
Nadezhda Konstantinovna even sent a childhood photo of herself to some of her distant friends in Barnaul.
And when the Barnaul people asked if Nadezhda Konstantinovna objected to the library being named after her, she wrote that no, she did not object.
The letters have long been dusty in the museum, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the first readers have to explain whose stern profile adorns the bas-relief on the library building.
During the reconstruction years, people called and asked why the children's library had not been renamed.
Let there be a library named after some good children's writer, without political coloring!
The library staff sat down, thought about it, and decided to leave it at that.
Krupskaya is perhaps the most famous and beloved library in Barnaul, like Leninka in Moscow.
On the floor in the library lobby is a yellow brick pathway.
"The Wizard of the Emerald City" is a favorite theme of artist Oli Moskowski.
Olya used to be a manager in a law firm, she came to work at eight, left at five, and the only thing that distinguished her from all the other managers was her love of drawing.
And then I found an ad online, "We need an illustrator for a book".
It was written by a little American girl, and it was called "My Cancer Mommy".
Olya was an illustrator, and she thought life could end at any moment, and there would be no miracles in it unless you created them yourself.
Now she works in a library, illustrates children's books by authors from around the world, and writes her own stories.
It's traditionally thought that children lose interest in books, that they live more and more in some kind of virtual space...
But we have children who read, and their parents understand the importance of reading", the library's director, Tatiana Kushvid, told the newspaper.
In recent years we have even had a moment of confidence that the children's library is needed and will live - the children come here!
I think I'm getting a little excited about reading again.
In the library's lobby, a large exhibition window with an updated photo exhibition is hanging.
Every quarter, new pictures of readers come to the library with their families: mom, dad, and kids.
The library is happy that fathers are coming with their children more often.
If a two-year-old child has read all of Chukovsky's books, then at an older age he needs more complex books.
But now there's a law that says an eight-year-old prodigy can't give out a 12+ book.
To get such a book, the child must bring his parents with him - they come, then return again, and gradually "Krupska" becomes for them something like a family club.
The library has treasures - a collection of pre-revolutionary beasts with yats and yars, the Korolenko story in the appendix to the magazine "Niva", the embroidery "Murzilki" for 1936.
We are not just a conceptual space, a "temple of the book", we are open to movement, we are trying to become a special place: not a home, not a workplace, not a school", explains Tatyana Kushvid.
You can come to us, read, play, draw.
We've made a play area for the little ones - the child comes to play, and the hand still reaches for the book!
Some of our readers have parents who are carrying them, but they're struggling, they don't want to leave.
Mothers often come with their strollers, and we are pleased that they put the library in the first place of all the places to come with their babies.
Tatjana Kushvid says: today's children like us once loved classical children's literature:
"The publishing industry is evolving, and there's a lot of attention being given to authors who are the link between generations".
And when it comes to little kids, they want to have a character who travels from one book to the next.
Kids don't like to part with their heroes.
The library regularly issues pamphlets for parents, telling them what is happening in modern children's literature, which books to look out for and why.
The booklets are so fascinating and intriguing that even adults are interested, but this library is not for them.
Adults are not allowed to take books outside the reading room.
That's a magical privilege only for children.
In the farthest room of the library there is a square hatch with an ancient wooden staircase to the basement, in the book storage.
The steps will creak under your feet, it's a very old time machine.
You meet your childhood book like an old friend: hello, it's good that we don't change.
Ellie still walks happily down the yellow brick road, the sluggish Tolya Ryzhkov steals magic matches, and Malchach-Kibalchach never told the cursed bourgeoisie the Military Secret - that's his strong word.
Books like this are like passwords, you can use them to find your people anywhere.
There are also real book rarities in the storage - for example, a pre-revolutionary collection of dishes with yates and eras.
Or to put Korolenko in the famous supplement to Niva magazine.
Or a 1936 "Murzilki" patch from the back.
Time has aged the pages, painted them tea-colored.
These publications are no longer being distributed to readers.
These are the fragments of our future collection, and I've always dreamed of retiring and doing rare children's books.
But the children are not so good at it, so to speak: and the colors in old books are not very bright, and the topics... you open the first page, and there - Lenin, party, Komsomol.
Now, I wonder why we all signed up for this Pioneer Truth thing.
But it was still interesting", Galina Ilyasova, the head of the bookstore, told Russian Planet.
The pages of "The Weaver" are blackened by time.
Galina Vasilyevna has been a librarian all her life.
She knows the color of the Buratinos' caps, what school year Harry Potter became captain of Gryffindor's quidditch championship team, what situations Carlson uses a motorcycle silencer in, and who Alice Celestine's father works for.
Librarians are paid very little, and those who can live without these bookshelves find other jobs very quickly.
Only the most convinced remain: educators, teachers, servants of the cult of the book.
They can also be identified by their smile, which is considered to be the professional trait of a children's librarian.
If he smiled at you the first minute you spoke to him, he was a pro.
I like children's books: as a librarian, I like them to be, to be flat and beautiful on the shelves, and I also love to read them, - says Galina Vasilyevna.
I read everything: military novels, historical novels, short stories, and fiction.
I read modern Russian authors, fresh translations...
Of course, I think it was different when I was a kid.
Books were the most interesting and exciting thing that happened to me at that time.
And because I was madly in love with them, I thought the library was a magical place.
And I wanted to work where everyone was sitting and reading.
I hope books will always be there, despite the reader.
And I'm glad when our former readers bring their children, or grandchildren...
The Celtics are not divided.
Griffiths has denied any talk of a rift at Celtic after Dale admitted the Hoops were in a bad situation, but he's fixing it.
Hearts will protest the Scottish FA's claim on Neilson, and Warburton fear signing contracts in January that could undermine team unity.
The Dons have increased their lead over the Celtics to five points.
Adam Rooney's first-half penalty gave Aberdeen a small lead over Hamilton at Pittodrie, allowing the Dons to take a five-point lead over Celtic.
Griffiths denied any talk of a disagreement.
This sparked rumors of disagreements within Celtic, which were quashed by Griffiths, who stated that he and his team-mates were not suffering from any intensified criticism as they prepared to meet the leaders of the Dutch League.
I don't think we feel the pressure, I think the players are striving for it.
The Dutch are bored because the Scots are not in the title fight - de Boer
Former Rangers midfielder and former Netherlands international Ronald de Burgh has claimed that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic as he is not competing for the title with Rangers.
De Boer, now a spokesman for Ajax, said: "The most attractive moments of Celtic games are no longer shown in the Netherlands, why?"
That's because there are no Rangers.
People here are not just talking about the Rangers coming back.
They're talking about the old firm.
They talk about both teams together, and that's what they're interested in.
There's a lot of tension in the Old Firm games, and it's not just people in Scotland who want to see these games.
"I'm going to change everything", said Dale.
Ronnie Della admitted that Celtic are struggling, but the Norwegian coach has vowed to change things.
The defeat by Malmö and their subsequent exit from the Champions League was soon followed by a loss to 10 Aberdeen players, who are now five points off the top of the table.
However, Della stated, "Selicka has had bad periods before, and we'll be out again".
Right now, we want to get out of here as quickly as possible.
I know this is very upsetting, and a lot of people are very, very angry or upset about what's happening.
Neither do we, but we have to keep going.
And we really, really need the Celtics to support us, because it makes the players so much better.
It's so important to stay together now.
Warburton is looking forward to January transfer.
Despite speculation that he had identified some of the targets for the January transfer window just a few weeks ago, Rangers boss Mark Warburton is skeptical about the January campaign, saying he does not want to disrupt the team's unity.
The former Brentford forward said: "The January transfer window is very different from the summer transfer window".
As for the players that come in the summer, you have a period before the season to adapt, which you've seen in our own group this season.
The team's working really well.
Sometimes the most damage is done by adding unnecessary players to the ones you really need.
Mitch, who's interested in Celtic, has hinted at a possible retirement.
Swansea striker Michu, linked with Celtic during the transfer window, has hinted he could leave football after his deal with the Swans expires.
The 29-year-old has been suffering from ankle problems for two years and was unable to leave Wales this summer.
The Hearts are going to confront the SFA over the Neilson allegations.
The Hearts were leading 2-1 when Patterson was removed, and were down 3-2, but the defender's red card was later rescinded; it was the third red card for Colum to be rescinded in eight months.
Nelson does not retract his words, stating: "I did not question the ethics, I did not comment on the game".
Griffiths swore to avoid the Tyne Castle .
A hard-nosed Hibernian player has been suspended after admitting to singing a song with offensive language about former Hearts player Rudy Scatzel.
The incident occurred in a pub in the Roseburn area of Edinburgh before the start of the Edinburgh Derby at Tynecastle in March 2014.
"It was a derby and it was hot", said the striker, adding: "I can safely say that I wasn't going to return to Tynecastle if he doesn't play for Celtic.
The board of Tannadice is confident in the management of Dundee United.
Simon Donnelly says the Dundee board is still confident the management team will turn things around, but agrees the deterioration of the pitch must end.
I think Stephen Thompson has faith in us.
We're gonna get these guys ready to go out again", Donnelly said.
MacInnes is happy that the ugly beat Hamilton.
Derek MacInnes admitted that his Aberdeen team had to fight desperately against Hamilton Assisi to win their seventh consecutive league title, which put them five points ahead of Celtic, at the top of the table, thanks to a penalty by Adam Rooney in the first half.
McInnes said, "There's not a team here that's won anything -- a cup, or a league championship -- that hasn't won games that way".
The unemployment rate for Scots is stable, while in the UK as a whole it is rising
THE unemployment rate in Scotland remained at 164,000 during the May-July period, while the number of unemployed in the United Kingdom as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.82 million during the same period.
Scotland's unemployment rate, at 5.9%, was higher than the United Kingdom's 5.5%, as shown by figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
At the same time, employment in Scotland fell by 12,000 in three months, with the number of people working now standing at 2,612,000.
The employment rate for Scotland fell to 74.0% in the quarter, above the UK average of 73.5%.
Commenting on the latest figures, Scotland's Secretary of State David Mandell said: "The government's long-term plan has laid the foundations for a strong economy".
It's been almost exactly a year since Scotland made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom.
Over the past 12 months, we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market, with employment growth and unemployment falling.
Why I 'm a witness to the Oklahoma execution .
Today, by avoiding legal intervention at a late stage, I will watch a man be executed.
If it does, and I hope it doesn't, I'll be sitting in the gallery of the death row at Oklahoma State Prison when Richard Glossop is executed by lethal injection.
He asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death.
The first time was in January, through a close friend, and, although I was shocked, I agreed.
As that day drew near, I began to fear.
So why do it?
I agreed, because I thought it was a good way to tell the detailed story of capital punishment.
It would offer a unique perspective.
Yes, journalists are allowed to attend executions in America, and since there are often more people than places, the results of a dark lottery determine who gets selected.
In Oklahoma, the number of press seats has been reduced from 12 to five.
Whoever is chosen will look at it without emotion.
I can't do that. I have to go.
I'm gonna be sitting with Richard Glossip's closest friends, and he and I have developed a relationship after months of phone calls and one visit that lasted two and a half hours.
I like this guy.
We often laugh when we talk to him.
The prison administration says I can't be both a witness and a journalist, so they won't let me take a notebook and a pen to write down what I see.
I'll have to try to remember all the details.
A journalist from Oklahoma accused me on Twitter of compromising my impartiality.
This is a lesson.
Tell the prisoner's story the way he wants it, get access.
I complained to her.
She admitted that she "could have said it better", but she still felt that I was wrong in what I was doing.
Richard Glossop disagreed with some of what I said and wrote.
He didn't tell me what to write, and I wouldn't have done it if he had.
I told him he could cross me off his witness list at any time.
But he wants an international journalist to be there to cover it.
If he dies, he thinks publicity will help the abolitionist movement.
Kim Bellver, a reporter from the Huffington Post, will be joining me.
If you want to know more about this case, listen to the podcasts I've recorded.
I'm not going to go into details here again.
I can't say for sure that Richard Glossop is innocent.
His actions after the murder of Barry van Treese make him guilty of aiding and abetting.
But I believe there's a strong possibility that he's not guilty of murder.
I'm pretty sure that wasn't enough to get a death sentence.
I think his execution was a mistake.
And from this angle, I'll be watching him die.
I can't claim to be completely objective.
There's gonna be other reporters we can turn to.
I'm going to tell you what it's like to watch someone I care about die unnecessarily.
A man pursued by police was persuaded to climb out of the Canning River.
A constable in Canning Vale managed to talk a man out of the Canning River, but he stayed dry.
A Perth resident was trying to escape the police but was caught in muddy shallow water a few metres away from a police officer who was trying to "gently persuade him to come ashore".
Canning Valley Police were called Tuesday on a trespassing charge in Buckingham.
When the police spotted the suspect, he tried to escape by jumping into Canning.
But he didn't get far.
"He was standing in the water and saying, 'I'm not coming out, come on, grab me,'" said Senior Sergeant Sandell Cassaldine.
Constable Laklan Perhaves was not too keen on wetting his uniform, so he used a safer technique - "negotiating with a good cop".
"Sometimes people do strange things to try to escape", says Sergeant Major Castledine.
Champion soccer player Ben Cousins remembers it as such.
In 2006, Cazines drove into the cove to avoid a police alcohol inspection patrol and attempted to swim across the Swan.
His efforts were in vain, but prompted the locals to invent a joke "Ben Kazinza biathlon".
Peter Moody accuses the stewards of attempted espionage and threatens to retire from horse racing.
Peter Moody accused the stewards of Racing Victoria of trying to plant a spy in his stable last year and threatened to quit the sport immediately.
He targeted the stewards and ethics staff of Racing Victoria, whom he accused of having organised a campaign against him personally, and the withdrawal of Lady Tattai from the race for a drug violation on the day of the race, on Wednesday, was the last straw.
Moody told Fairfax Media that he always does his best when he's racing, and he was put in a tough spot when Lidar tested positive for cobalt, which he can't explain.
He's been keeping his mouth shut about suspected espionage for a year and a half and doesn't want it to "look like a green grape".
"I didn't want to say anything about it, and I've been putting up with it for a long time, but sometimes it gets you so upset that you can't hold back", Moody said.
They know it's been going on.
Sometimes you react, and then you have to live with the consequences, and I have to live with what I said.
I'm going home tonight and I'm gonna sleep it off.
I want to walk tall and I want my owners to know that I do what I can for them.
When they start thinking it's not, then I'll have to stop coaching.
Then I'll have to figure out what to do with my license.
Moody previously sensationalized in an interview with racing.com that the ethics department tried to spy on his stable.
"A year and a half ago, Terry Bailey, Dale Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart sat in a room with a man I'll name if they ask, and offered him a job in my stable to report what I was doing in my stable", Moody told Racing.com.
They obviously think I'm a fraud.
If so, they should all no doubt file a report, since their attempt to capture me failed.
Robert Rolston, former chairman of RVL, David Moody, current chairman of RVL, and Bernard Sondri, current CEO of RVL, have known this all along, and they know it now.
Shouldn't that make me think this is getting personal?
Shouldn't RVL have the courage to hold other people accountable for what's going on in the business, besides the coaches?
Am I bad for this job?
Am I so bad for this profession?
Maybe people there think that's what it is.
Maybe they should take away my license and kick me out, and I'm sure what I'm saying now might make them think about it.
But I've gotten to the point now where I don't care, and that makes me sad.
I'm really sad about that.
I'll put pressure on them and make them responsible for making the decision.
I have the support of my family, and I can go.
The coach's frustration grew during the long investigation into the cobalt and Lidari case, and the last horse's removal from the start forced him to declare that he could "throw his license on the table".
Moody, best known for grooming the undefeated champion Black Caviar, called the demands for the use of medical drugs on the day of the competition "ridiculous" after a clay compress was applied to the horse's leg, which is a violation of the rules.
That's a breach of the racing rules.
"I have to take full responsibility for this", he said.
One of my workers accidentally put a compress on her leg.
She could have gotten a compress last night.
She could have gotten it yesterday, as it was.
She was with him on the day of the race.
Moody could be suspended for three months under the competition day medical regulations for the use of a compress, which the stewards have launched an investigation into.
It was a joke.
The people who make these rules don't know anything about horses.
"We all know we need rules, but this has gone too far", said Moody.
The driver who drove into and fled the scene in Kobram, arrested
Police have arrested a man who hit a motorcyclist in Cobra on the weekend and fled the scene.
The motorcyclist was airlifted to Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after being hit by a car on the Murray Valley Highway on Saturday morning.
Police say the driver left without stopping to help an injured motorcyclist.
On Monday, a 50-year-old resident of Natalya turned himself in to police in Shepparton.
He's expected to be charged with leaving the scene of an accident, failure to provide assistance and other traffic violations.
The motorcyclist, a 40-year-old resident of Cobram, remains in hospital in stable condition.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy defends his opponents' accusations of using harsh force.
Melbourne Storm coach Craig Bellamy called the criticism of his team's interception "an imposition of the agenda" by the two NRL favourites.
Sydney Roosters coach Trent Robinson said the referees had allowed Storm to "fight" his team during Storm's surprise win in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday night.
Brisbane Broncos coach Wayne Bennett made a clear reference to the Storm after his team won the qualifying final against the North Queensland Cowboys on Saturday night, when he called the game "typical" for rugby league and said two of the Queensland team were "not too successful" in hand-to-hand combat.
Bellamy defended his team's interception and stated that they were just focused on "contact", intercepting the ball.
Bellamy added that he was reassured by the criticism of his team from the two leading coaches, as it meant they were worried about losing to Storm.
"It keeps coming up - I didn't hear Trent Robinson talking about tough tackles when they beat us 24-2", Bellamy said Wednesday.
I can tell you that we haven't changed anything in our defensive systems or techniques all year, but in the last six weeks we've been focusing on the contact balls, and that's been a turning point for us.
Trent's been there three years and he's obviously coaching a great team, so he's probably not used to losing, and it's been a bit of a shock for him.
Funny how it always comes out this time of year.
Bellamy argued with Bennett's idea of "impressive football", reminding his teacher that Bennett's St. George Illawarra Dragons won the championship in 2010 by showing "boring" football.
Wayne's talking about exciting football.
He decided to compare his game on Saturday night with ours on Friday night and see how impressive their game was", Bellamy noted.
I remember back in 2010, there was a lot of criticism that St. George was a boring team, and Wayne said he didn't care.
But now he has a team that can show what he thinks is impressive football, especially his young midfielders with their speed.
It's the kind of football you want to play when you have players like that.
He made that comment in 2010, and now he wants everyone to play football his way -- not every team has two midfielders like Anthony Milford and Ben Hunt so they can play that way.
It makes me more confident, because they say these things because they're a little worried about playing us.
Six weeks ago, they probably didn't think about us when they got to the big games.
Bellamy also noted that the Storm-Rusters game was a more point-based contest than the Broncos-Cowboys game.
The Broncos game was probably good, I haven't seen it yet, but what was the score?
Our game was 20:18, two more tries - and what, that's impressive football?
Or do you think of breaks and failed attempts as impressive?
It's a routine for me.
If they mention us, it means that at some point we might meet them there.
The Storm are off at the end of this week, having won the right to host either the North Queensland Cowboys or the Cronulla Sharks the following Saturday night at the AAMI Park pre-final, with tickets going on sale the following Tuesday morning.
Serb accused of drug possession released on $ 200,000 bail
A man facing life imprisonment for attempting to smuggle 40 kilos of cocaine into Queensland has been released on $200,000 bail.
Marco Maksimovic, 29, is one of five people arrested last month after federal police found 100 kilos of drugs on a Solay yacht that was sailing from South America via Vanuatu and docked in Kummer in August.
Throughout the morning, Maximovich and his accomplices were seen at the pier, and later he met them at the Coomera Roadhouse Cafe, where police found 40 kg of narcotics in a Toyota Echo.
Although Maximovich faces life in prison for attempting to possess narcotic drugs in quantities sufficient to sell, Maximovich's attorney claims that there is no evidence that he was trying to obtain the entire batch, and that the man could have been in the cafe without any intent.
Supreme Court Justice Peter Flanagan questioned whether Maximovich should be released on bail.
The latter has ties to Serbia.
He often travels to Serbia", he told the court on Wednesday.
During the criminal investigation, he lied to the police about his whereabouts.
Maximovich's mother and stepfather were offered a joint $200,000 bail for his release.
"It is clear from the testimony of both that the $200,000 bail is too great a financial burden for them", Judge Flanagan observed.
But this measure alone is not enough to guarantee that it will not disappear, the judge added.
Maximović was granted bail on condition that he surrender both his Australian and Serbian passports, register with the police daily and observe the 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew.
Fotis Katsikaris: "I am proud of the Greek national team, which fought until the last seconds".
Greece's head coach Fotis Kacicaris praised his team after the EuroBasket 2015 quarterfinal match with Spain (71:73).
He said that the game was decided by a few mistakes.
It was a big game", AFP quotes Kazikaris as saying.
We were preparing for a great performance by the Spaniards.
We tried to work on the defense, but mistakes on the defense decided the fate of the meeting.
It's sad, but I'm proud of my boys.
They fought to the last second.
Joel Freeland: "I will be assigned the functions of Kaun in CSKA".
CSKA rookie Joel Freeland has stated that he does not believe in the army's curse.
The Briton also expressed confidence that his new club would be able to break the negative trend and finally win the Euroleague next season.
I've spoken to coach Dimitris Itudis a few times this summer and, of course, after I joined the team, I'm going to be basically in charge of Sashi Kaun, who left the team, both in the defensive line and in the three-second zone, and I think I can handle that.
Yeah, it's gonna take me a while to adjust to the center position, but I was more of a forward in the NBA.
Now, it's gonna be more about taking on a bigger center, but I've done it before, so I think I can handle it.
The Army last won the Euroleague in 2008.
They've made it to the Final Four six times since, but they haven't been able to put their best basketball on the court.
There's an opinion that the team has been compromised.
That's the whole game, you can't win forever.
It's hard, of course, and I understand the frustrations of the club and its fans.
But we have a great team now, and if we do our best, we have a good chance of winning the Euroleague, I really think so.
I always wanted to win this title, the Muscovites have won the tournament before, and I think this year will be the year of CSKA.
As for the eye, I'm not superstitious and I don't believe in any kind of curse.
I believe in hard work and determination, and if you combine those two things, anything is possible.
I don't have any rituals before games either, I just listen to music and try to relax as much as possible.
Luis Enrique: "For me, the match against Roma will be special".
Barcelona head coach Luis Enrique has made it clear that he is back in Rome for the Champions League group stage match against Roma.
According to the coach, the head-to-head matchup between his current and former team will be far from ordinary for him.
Recall that Luis Enrique coached the "wolves" in the 2011/12 season, but failed to show himself on the best side in the capital of Italy.
I returned to Rome after a few years, during which I gained some experience. - The official UEFA website quotes Luis Enrique as saying.
I have only warm memories of Rome.
It's gonna be a special game for me, but it's not that important.
The main thing is to start the Champions League with a win.
The August meeting at the Joan Gamper Cup will not affect the teams' actions in the upcoming match.
I'm waiting for Roma to play the game they showed in Serie A against Juventus.
They're a strong team, they know how to press and they know how to use the ball.
Vadim Skripchenko: "Krasnodar has various variants of the offensive actions".
The acting head coach of "Ural" Vadim Skripchenko on the eve of the match of the 9th round of the premier league with "Krasnodar" noted the diversity of attacking schemes of the rival team.
According to the coach, the Bulls have several offensive models in their arsenal.
The match will take place on September 21 and will begin at 16.30 Moscow time.
How we will play with "Krasnodar", we will see, - the official website of "Ural" quotes the words of Skripchenko.
We have a whole week of preparation ahead of us.
This team has different offensive options, they have different attacks, but we're not a slow team, so I think it's going to be a very interesting game.
In anticipation of this game, considering that Krasnodar is holding a match of the Europa League against Dortmund's Borussia, we will try to prepare very well to win.
Rocher Kanyas: "Astana can take the points from anyone".
The midfielder of "Astana" Rocher Kanyaas after the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with "Benfica" (0: 2) expressed confidence in improving the quality of the game of his team in the future.
According to the quarterback, the Aston Villa can take points from any opponent on their own court.
Despite the fact that the match was difficult for us, I can say that we played well, - quotes the official website of UEFA words of Kanyas. - We lacked a little courage in the attack.
Benfica are a little bit better, but in the home game, I think we can count on taking away their points.
It's totally real.
But first we have to think about Galatasaray, and then Atletico.
At home, we can take points from anyone.
Rafael Benitez: "I'll say it again and again: Cristiano Ronaldo is the best in the world".
The head coach of Real Madrid, Rafael Benítez, expressed his satisfaction with the big victory in the match of the 1st round of the group tournament of the Champions League with Shakhtar (4:0).
The specialist paid tribute to forward Cristiano Ronaldo, who became the author of three goals.
The match was not easy because Shakhtar know how to control the ball, - the official website of UEFA quotes Benitez.
The opponent didn't have many chances, but their counter-attack always hides danger.
I'm not saying that Real Madrid played perfectly, but we had plenty of scoring opportunities.
I'm glad we didn't miss a ball and scored four.
Cristiano Ronaldo has confirmed his level.
He's the best player in the world, I'll say it again and again.
Jordi Alba: "Cristiano Ronaldo is not to be compared with Messi".
Barcelona defender Jordi Alba believes that his teammate Lionel Messi is the best player in the world.
According to the Spaniard, Real forward Cristiano Ronaldo can't do it either.
Messi is five points above the rest, - quotes Le Figaro Albu. - What Leo can do, no one can.
Not even to Cristiano Ronaldo.
With Leo on the field, things are changing, I can't compare him to anyone.
Daniele De Rossi: Barcelona have not only a unique style, but also a vibrant personality.
Roma midfielder Daniele De Rossi, ahead of the Champions League group stage match against Barcelona, noted the importance of compactness and safety in a game against such a strong opponent.
The meeting will take place tomorrow, beginning at 9:45 p.m. Moscow time.
Remember, the "E" will be doing a text broadcast.
"Barcelona is a special rival, a good team with great players", De Rossi was quoted as saying by UEFA's official website.
Blue grenades are difficult to play with, because they have not only a unique style, but also a distinctive personality.
To keep them, we'll have to plow through the game and insure each other.
Messi is almost always successful when he's going into the wire, so we need to keep things compact and organized.
Yezhov hopes to be in the starting line-up of the SKA in the match against "Slovan".
SKA goalkeeper Ilya Yezhov emphasized that he hopes to be in the starting lineup of the Army in the next match of the KHL championship.
Yezhov came on ice instead of Mikko Koskinen in the 23rd minute with a score of 0:3 and reflected all the throws on his own goal, the fourth goal of the SKA missed after replacing the goalkeeper with the sixth field player.
The team will play its next match away against "Slovana".
I hope to be in the starting line-up for the next match, - R-Sport quotes Yzhov.
I'm not an expert on goalkeepers, I'm a goalkeeper myself, and we don't have repeated missed goals, so it's hard to track.
Dynamo played well, everyone has a bad game.
The team still lost.
I'd rather have missed a lot, but the team won.
Shajofarva was hospitalized with a viral infection.
Lucy Shafarzhoff was hospitalized with a bacterial infection, AFP reports.
The Czech tennis player is currently in a clinic in Brno.
The timing of the recovery of the finalist of Roland Garros-2015 is not yet known.
On Monday, Shafarova moved up one spot in the WTA rankings to become the world's fifth-ranked female tennis player.
Stephen Hogg used a girl's phone to get pedophiles to send him photos.
A pedophile used an 11-year-old girl's phone to ask for images of child abuse.
Steven Hogg took the girl's phone while she was sleeping, logged into an Internet messaging service, where he received a series of lewd images of children sent to him by another user.
The girl woke up, discovered the phone was missing, and found it in Hogg's sleeping hand.
She examined it and found shocking photographs, which she then immediately brought to her mother's attention.
The police came and saw five images, then searched the computers found at that address, and found "corresponding" search queries using words to detect indecent images of children.
Hogg then told the police that he had done it because it would "attract pedophiles" and then he would "pretend to be a policeman to scare them".
Elid Robertson, the deputy bailiff, told the Dundee Sheriff's Court: "He said it was a predisposition, he was a predisposition to frighten people.
He admitted making the requests on the computer, but stated that it was because he wanted to pretend to be a police officer to scare pedophiles.
He was questioned about the conversation with the unknown person who sent him the images and about the fact that he asked to send more photos.
He said he did it to lure them.
He said he had trouble with his head when he drank, and he said he wanted to see images of rape and murder.
Mrs. Robertson added: "When the girl found the pictures on her phone, she called her mother, shivering and crying.
She saw the indecent images on the phone, and then the defendant was blindfolded.
The girl was questioned and reported that the accused used a computer and a Playstation to talk to girls who looked much younger than him.
Hogg, 23, of Ward Road, Dundee, pleaded guilty to charges of making indecent photographs of children on 14 June last year, breaching bail terms on 25 January this year and failing to appear for a hearing on 24 March this year.
The defendant's lawyer, Gregor Sim, has requested that Hogg not be added to the sex offender list because it can be proven that there was no "significant sexual element" in the crime.
Sheriff Alistair Carmichael has postponed sentencing until October, pending a report from social services.
Hogg was released on bail in this case, but has been remanded in custody pending hearings of other remaining cases.
He was listed as a sex offender before the sentencing date.
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe makes a very bad speech in Parliament
Mr. Mugabe, Africa's oldest head of state, fell from the steps leading to the podium earlier this year.
He was not hurt, but a video of the fall went viral on social media.
The opening of parliament was also marred by statements from parliamentary oppositionists that they had received anonymous threats warning them against whistling at Mugabe during the speech.
A month ago, they squealed at the president during his address to the nation in parliament; this is the speech that Mugabe repeated on Tuesday.
MDC MP Innocent Gonyeze said that seven opposition politicians received text messages on their mobile phones warning them not to interrupt Mugabe's speech.
"The message came from a number that doesn't ring, but it's titled 'Death,'" he told reporters after Mugabe's speech.
It warned the honorable members of Parliament that the immunity in the Parliament building was over, and as soon as they left, the immunity was no longer valid.
A member of parliament said the party, led by Morgan Tsvangirai, was "concerned" by the threats to its politicians.
Hewlett-Packard is cutting up to 30,000 jobs .
Hewlett-Packard is planning to cut between 25,000 and 30,000 jobs as part of its restructuring and cost-cutting program in the services sector.
In the same year, Hewlett-Packard would split into two publicly traded companies, separating computer and printer manufacturing from the more rapidly growing hardware and service operations.
The estimated cost of the job cuts will be approximately $2.7 billion, beginning in the fourth quarter, Hewlett-Packard said in a statement.
"This restructuring will provide a more competitive, sustainable cost structure for the new Hewlett Packard Enterprise", said Meg Whitman, Hewlett Packard's chair and CEO, who will lead the organization after the split.
"Hewlett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than Hewlett-Packard is today, and the portfolio of business lines will be broader and deeper, which will help the company transition to a new style of business", Whitman said.
As a separate company, we are better positioned than ever to meet the growing demands of our customers around the world.
Hewlett Packard Enterprise will have annual revenue of more than $50 billion and "will focus on providing previously unattainable end-to-end technology solutions" to companies, the company said in a statement.
This is the breakdown of a company founded in the 1930s by Stanford University graduates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard to manufacture electrical equipment; their Palo Alto garage was dubbed the "birthplace of Silicon Valley".
Hewlett Packard is in the process of a major reorganization to move from traditional personal computers to mobile devices.
This move by HP, the world's second-largest personal computer maker and one of the largest U.S. technology companies, is a new development in the sector, based on the belief that highly specialized companies do better.
Arsenal captain Mikel Arteta says his team-mates should support injured Jack Wilshere ahead of Dynamo Zagreb
In his conversation with Wilshere, Wenger also stressed that it was only September, and that provided Wilshere's recovery went according to plan, he would be able to return to the game by Christmas.
In the best case, Wilshere will definitely miss at least the next four games in England and, given what has happened, his participation in the European Championship next summer remains in question.
The most hurtful part of this recent problem is that Wilshire finished last season with only an ankle injury and was going to return to his usual aggressive style of play during preseason.
Wenger: "This injury is not a threat to his career".
It's just not a fully healed bone.
It's not that big of a deal.
It was an accident.
It's not related to his ankles or any injuries he's had in the past.
These may be medically related things, but as Wenger also admitted, there is an associated risk of additional injury for any player returning to play mid-season.
There is also a negative trend.
According to Premier Injuries Ltd, Wilshire has 23 injuries in the six years since his debut.
He has also played in only 65 of Arsenal's 157 league games over the past five seasons.
Looking at the wider Arsenal schedule, six of the eight seasons since 2007-08 have seen Arsenal one of the two Premier League clubs with the highest number of injury-related days.
Wenger acknowledges the possibility of being caught in a vicious circle, but Arsenal believe the improvement in injury statistics in the last season will continue.
"Sometimes when you come back from an injury, you're vulnerable for a while, and you need to recover and gain a competitive edge", Wenger said.
Jack's young enough to handle it.
I hope he recovers physically, I'm sure of that, as I'm sure his career will be the one he deserves.
Arsenal start the Champions League campaign on Wednesday with Dinamo Zagreb and continue with Chelsea on Saturday and Tottenham Hotspur next Wednesday, and Wenger is keen to rotate the squad.
Hector Bellerin and Aaron Ramzi did not arrive in Croatia, so most likely in the starting line-up will play Matteo Debushi and Arteta.
It's possible that Wenger will also bring in Kiran Gibbs and Olivier Giroux to replace Nacho Moreal and Theo Walcott.
"I try to keep my balance and give a little respite to the players who need it", Wenger said.
Although Arsenal are the clear favourites in Group F, the Maximir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the most depressing in Europe.
Dynamo hasn't lost a game in 41 games since they made it to the Invincibles last season.
On Tuesday evening, the stadium was hit by an earthquake measuring 3.2 on the Richter scale.
It was the 10th in Zagreb this year.
Wenger is confident that Arsenal have learned the lessons of last season, when they lost to Monaco in the Champions League, and remains with a slim chance of leading the club to victory in the Champions League final.
"This is an incredible drive", Wenger remarked.
Arsenal have never done that before.
We were very close in 2006, but on the other hand, I'm realistic about the internship.
We have ambition, but we are not dreamers.
FriendsFest: the comedy show that taught us the serious lessons of male friendship
The lack of such stories is striking, especially when you consider how desperate men's need for openness has become, now more than ever, with suicide rates among young men at a 15-year high.
In 2013, it was the single biggest cause of death for men aged 20 to 45 in the United Kingdom, and it's three times more common in men than in women.
In an attempt to address the issue, the Campaign Against Unhappy Lives has declared 2015 the Year of the Man to challenge a culture that prevents men from asking for help when they need it.
Friendship is at the heart of this battle to take up this challenge.
A recent study of more than 2,000 university students with symptoms of depression found that having a sufficient number of "normal-minded" friends doubled the chances of recovery.
Similarly, for those who are not depressed, having a circle of mentally healthy friends reduces the likelihood of developing a mental disorder by half.
But, of course, for a friendship to work, it must first be.
In an age when communication is driven by social media, when style is preferred to content, the speed of response is often valued more than the content of the contact.
Our digital lives double down on the need to appear strong, fun-loving and successful, even when we're lonely in the real world.
And this surface success is based on what psychologists call external values -- money, image, social status -- all at the expense of internal values, our inner drive for personal growth and friendship, which is what's most impactful on our mental health.
And as a billionaire video game developer recently observed, money really can't buy happiness anymore.
The beauty of Friends is that they bring attention to it.
Each of the characters was defined not by their work, but rather by the personality that manifested itself in their interactions with their friends.
Joey's humor and Chandler's constant hugs, the moments of watching football in the comfort of the chairs, Ross's sigh for Rachel, all come from the realization that men can feel this, even if they often refrain from fully exploring their feelings.
As a Samaritan's rep told me, "...my role as a listener for people who are experiencing depression and suicidal thoughts highlights how even the smallest of friendships can be beneficial".
Often, the men who come to us feel uncomfortable talking to their friends.
The old adage of "get over it" is strong, as is the feeling that open discussion of problems can be seen as a weakness".
Friends is one of those shows that comes to mind when I'm trying to suggest more long-term coping mechanisms.
It highlighted the unremarkable moments of male friendship.
As for my task, the status of an outsider, on the phone, helping people in times of desperation, the long-term support comes from my close circle of family and friends.
So if you're visiting FriendsFest at Comedy Central this weekend, where the festival has completely restored the scenery, why not take your friends out for a drink at Central Perk.
Or better yet, if you see a lonely person at Starbucks, smile and say, "Hi".
You never know what friendship can bring.
Friends aired on Comedy Central from start to finish, all 236 episodes, under the tag #FriendsFest
Di Maria scores a goal to help PSG defeat Malmö
Angel di Maria, along with Blez Matyuidy and Edinson Cavani, celebrates the goals scored in the goal of Malmö.
Angel di Maria, making his Champions League debut, scored a goal which allowed PSG to easily overtake Malmö on Tuesday.
Here's the report on the game and the reaction to the game.
Angel di Maria and Edinson Cavani did their thing when Paris Saint-Germain started their Champions League campaign with a very comfortable 2-0 win against Malmö at the Parc des Princes on Tuesday.
Di Maria scored less than four minutes into his first Champions League game as a PSG player to give the French champions a direction, but they missed a number of opportunities before finally increasing their lead when Cavani scored in the 61st minute.
Along with Real Madrid and Shakhtar Donetsk in Group A, Paris needed to get off to a good start against the Swedish champions, as they aimed not for a play-off qualification but for a continuation of a successful run of games over the last three seasons, where they had reached the quarter-finals.
They earned points, but at the same time it was not the best decision by Laurent Blanc to consider Zlatan Ibrahimovic useless in attack and later replace him on the field in a game against a team from his home town and the club where he started his brilliant career in 1999.
"It's not easy to win at home or away in the Champions League, so to win 2-0 and give the opposition problems and play well in defence is a good start, even if there are still moments that we will need to work on during the season", said Blanc.
It's promising.
We wanted to win, and we did, although I regret that we didn't score one or two more goals.
Ibrahimovic returned from injury in one of the substitutions in the Paris team, which brought her a draw with a score of 2: 2 in the match against Bordeaux in the First League on the weekend, but he was pushed to the back of the field by Di Maria in the fourth minute.
The Argentine forward was touted as a player capable of taking PSG to a new level in Europe after being bought from Manchester United last month, and he proved why when he ran a pass from Marco Verratti behind the defence of Malmö and beautifully completed the attack, sending a ball past Johan Villand into the far corner of the goal.
However, if anyone expected an easy and big victory from PSG then, they had to be disappointed.
Malmö, who beat Celtic in the play-offs to reach this stage, with nine world-class players on the pitch at the start of the game, five defenders and two core midfielders in the middle of the field, were a serious contender.
But, except for a shot by Nikola Jurdzhič, where the ball flew past the far post of Kevin Trapp's goal in the 34th minute, they attacked little.
But PSG have sometimes let themselves down with unproductive passes and weak attacks, especially from Ibrahimovic, who only in the first half could not realize at least five attempts, and then could not handle the ball scored by Kavana immediately after the resumption of the game.
However, he proved himself much more adept at accurate passes, and it was a pass from Ibrahimovic, receiving which, Di Maria sent the ball with a twisted stroke that passed in a close-up to the bar by Viland at the 52nd minute.
The second goal was finally scored after a time of one hour thanks to Cavani, the Uruguayan scored his sixth goal of the season after Ibrahimovic had a ball sent into the centre of the field from the left flank by Maxwell.
This put an end to any ideas Malmö had about returning to the game, and only Wiland's close-range interception prevented David Luis from increasing the final score before substitute Esquivel Lavessi scored a goal in the very end of the match.
Malmö manager Age Hareide later admitted that PSG were a class above his team, with the Norwegian saying: "Our last game in the Champions League was in December last year".
Since then we've only played in the Swedish league, which is not that level.
Qualification is not enough.
The glory of Paris!
It was a great match with them.
Glencore makes $2.5 billion from the sale of shares.
Swiss-based mining and trading giant Glencore, hit by a drop in commodity prices, has made $2.5 billion from selling shares as part of its grand debt-reduction plan.
Glencore, a London-listed company, has announced that it has sold new shares worth about £1.6 billion to pay off its debt.
The company, which has lost 57 percent of its market value, is struggling to cope with a collapse in raw material prices as China's economic slowdown worsens demand and creates chaos in global markets.
Thanks to the issuance of new shares at a discount price, Glencore's share price on the London Stock Exchange soared in early morning trading on Wednesday.
The shares jumped 2.77 percent to 131.60 pence on the FTSE 100 Index, which was trading 0.69 percent higher when it opened.
Glencore last week began a $2.5 billion stock sale as part of a sweeping plan to reduce its $30 billion debt by about a third.
The company was selling new shares at 125 cents a share, a 2.4 percent discount to the closing price on Tuesday.
She placed 1.3 billion new shares, which is 9.99 percent of the company's capital.
Fears of a continuing downturn in the Chinese economy have reduced the price of iron ore by about half, while coal, copper, and other raw materials have fallen in price by 20 to 40 percent.
The White House confirms Xi Jinping 's visit to Washington
The White House confirmed in an official statement on Tuesday that Chinese President Xi Jinping will arrive on an official visit to the United States later this month.
The visit, Xi's first to Washington, will take place on September 25 and will be a response to President Barack Obama's visit to Beijing last November, the statement said.
President and First Lady Michelle Obama will also host President Xi Jinping and his wife, Ms. Peng Liyuan, at a government dinner later that day after the two leaders hold bilateral talks.
"President Xi Jinping's visit will provide an opportunity to expand cooperation between the US and China on common, regional and bilateral issues of mutual interest, and will allow the presidents of the US and China to constructively address contentious issues", the statement said.
Xi Jinping, whose visit was first announced in February, is expected to stop in Seattle to meet with the heads of several leading American technology companies on his way to Washington, and then travel to New York to attend the UN General Assembly in September.
Obama and Xi are expected to discuss a number of contentious issues, including Washington's concerns over alleged Chinese cyber espionage and China's growing assertiveness over the disputed South China Sea.
The biker who beat the KuTuzovski Lihac was given 2 years in a colony.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims against Den Mirzoyev in the amount of 1.2 million rubles.
The Moscow City Court has issued a verdict against Denis Mirzoev, who fatally struck a motorcyclist on Kutuzovsky Avenue in Moscow.
According to the Russian news service, Mirzoyev was sentenced to two years in a penal colony.
He was found guilty under the article "Violation of the rules of road traffic and operation of vehicles" of the Russian Criminal Code.
In addition, the court partially satisfied the civil claims of the victims in the amount of 1.2 million rubles.
During the debate, the prosecutor asked to sentence Mirzoyev to three years in prison and to recover from him the full amount of the victims' claims - eight million rubles.
The accident in question occurred on May 22 at about three in the morning in the area of house 30 on Kutuzovsky Prospekt.
A BMW, driven by Mirzoyev, crossed the opposite lane and hit a motorcyclist standing on the side of the road.
The man, born in 1989, died of his injuries.
Friends of the deceased reported on social media that the BMW driver was driving at high speed and before the accident he drove into the opposite lane.
Fearing that the driver would try to escape from responsibility, bikers organized a motorcycle race from the Vorobyov hills to the building of the Moscow GUMVD on Petrovka, 38.
Soon after, it became known that the investigation detained the alleged perpetrator of the accident.
A naked man was arrested in Moscow after he entered a church.
He was calm and did not commit any illegal acts, and the police transferred him to the emergency psychiatric services.
The police officers of Moscow arrested a resident of Moscow who entered one of the temples without clothes.
This is reported by the agency "Moscow".
As told by the head of the press service of the Moscow MIA, Andrey Galiakberov, the incident occurred on Tuesday, September 15, about 16.00, on the Kashirsky highway.
A naked man entered the church of St. Nicholas.
He was calm and did not commit any illegal acts.
A police unit was called to the scene.
The police waited for the doctors from the emergency psychiatric team and handed the man over to them.
He turned out to be a 26-year-old resident of Moscow.
More than 40 decrees and orders were signed by Vladimir Yakushev.
More than 40 resolutions and orders were signed by the governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushev at a meeting of the presidium of the regional government.
Some of them were about the allocation of funds for educational and medical institutions in the municipalities of the region.
In particular, funds were used to purchase a bus for one of the schools of Nizhnetovda district, to carry out a major repair of the regional hospital in Kazan district.
According to the accompanying documents, the money will be used to complete the major renovation of the second floor of the therapy ward.
The hot and cold water supply networks, water drainage, electrical networks and electrical equipment, ventilation systems will be repaired, the facade of the building will be brought into order, the premises will be repaired, a set of measures will be implemented on fire safety and energy saving.
The second forum of regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi.
The second forum of the regions of Russia and Belarus will be held in Sochi on September 17-18, in which the Tyumen delegation headed by the governor will take part.
The upcoming event in Sochi and the intermediate results of cooperation are told by the honorary consul general of the Republic of Belarus in Tyumen Vladimir Shugla, who is part of the official delegation.
Vladimir Fedorovich, what are the goals of the Sochi Forum?
The large-scale event in Sochi reflects the industrial policy of the Union State.
It is built on the fruitful cooperation of the regions - important links between the two states.
It is planned that the Russian President Vladimir Putin and the President of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Lukashenko will participate in the plenary session.
The plenary and sectional sessions will discuss the experience of regional and local authorities of Russia and Belarus in the implementation of industrial policy, normative-legal support and programs of the Union State.
The governor of the Tyumen region will speak at the forum.
I think that this is a sign of successful, sustainable interregional cooperation between the region and Belarus.
Representatives of relevant ministries and departments, Russian and Belarusian entrepreneurs will also attend the forum.
Trade fairs and specialized exhibitions will be held, including from the Tyumen region.
I hope that the forum will help to conclude new profitable contracts and agreements.
I would add that the first such meeting was held in Minsk last June.
More than two hundred delegates, including from 19 regions of Russia, participated in its work.
At the same time, a very important cooperation agreement was signed between the Tyumen and Minsk regions.
The importance of our work is also indicated by the fact that a meeting of the permanent seminar at the parliamentary assembly of the Union of Russia and Belarus was held in Tyumen.
Besides, the delegation of the Tyumen region agricultural cooperative visited the Republic of Belarus in order to study the experience of Belarusians in the training of agricultural personnel, to identify additional points of contact and to organize new investment projects in the sphere of the agro-industrial complex.
You recently met with the regional head and the head of the city administration.
What were the topics discussed?
During the meeting with the Governor of the Tyumen region Vladimir Yakushov, the region's cooperation with the Republic of Belarus in modern difficult conditions was discussed.
The issue of supplying Belarusian agricultural machinery and using financial mechanisms will be raised - they are needed to reduce the cost of machines for the final consumer.
The problems in the work of the Tyumen trade house "Belshina" and options for preventing losses were discussed.
These are important questions, because investment projects must be clearly functional and bring benefits to the region.
It was said about further deliveries of passenger-cargo equipment of OJSC "MAZ", development of the service center of OJSC "MAZ", which was created in Tyumen on the basis of OJSC "TPATP".
The conversation also touched on the preparations for the visit of the working delegation of the region to the Republic of Belarus before the end of this year.
Another topic of conversation was the completion of the coordination and signing of the agreement on trade-economic, scientific-technical and cultural cooperation of the Tyumen region and the Republic of Belarus.
So the dynamics of relationships are promising to take a new level.
These issues also concerned the regional center.
During the meeting with the head of the administration of the city of Tyumen Alexander More, we talked about the renewal of the Tyumen bus fleet.
About 100 buses are already "breathing incense", so a new batch of cars from Belarus is required, which will run on gas, an environmentally clean fuel.
Another aspect: the Tyumen elevator factory cooperates with one of the leading elevator manufacturers, Mogilevliftmash, obtaining components.
In my opinion, this activity could be more active, given the plans for the installation of new lifts in the regional center.
I would add that within the framework of the expanded powers of the consul, a meeting was held with the governor of the Kurgan region, Alexey Kokorin, during which the issue of increasing trade turnover and the supply of modern Belarusian equipment to Trans-Ural was discussed.
A meeting with the Omsk governor is scheduled for the end of September.
The expanded consular district includes five constituent entities of the Russian Federation, but Tyumen can be called a kind of headquarters of the district.
The region is a testing ground for many promising projects, including the work of the honorary general consul.
In general, such meetings are meaningful and good because they allow many problems to be solved directly and quickly, reducing their acuteness and developing mutually beneficial cooperation.
In the current situation, it's crucial not to destroy the foundation, but to continue working on the future.
Matt Damon is against focusing on the ethnic diversity of people in the film industry.
Matt Damon has argued with African-American producer Effie Brown, saying behind the scenes that ethnicity doesn't count.
During the Sunday edition of Project Greenlight on HBO, Brown was interrupted by a well-known actor when she tried to emphasize the need for alternative points of view for the main black heroine in the script chosen for the project.
"Diversity is appropriate when you're casting for the movie, not the show", Damon insisted.
The stunned Brown, unable to believe her own ears, exclaimed "Wow, wow, wow" all the while the "Martian" actor was giving live commentary.
Damon and Brown were joined by fellow producers Ben Affleck and the Farrelly brothers to discuss the show's finalists.
"I would like the participants - no matter who the director is - to think about what interpretation of the image of Harmony they are going to stick to", Brown said at the beginning of the discussion.
The only black character is a prostitute who gets beaten up by a white pimp.
The producer of Dear White People had advocated that Leo Angelos and Kristen Brancaccio direct the film; Damon was strongly opposed, saying that "in the end we may not get what we want".
After the debate was shown on television, social media exploded with unflattering comments directed at Damon.
Twitter user MrPooni angrily commented on the video: "Matt Damon's explanation of diversity to the only black person in the room is SO BLACK that it hurts".
The tweet has over 5,000 retweets and 4,000 likes.
Damon's comments come at a time when the media's proper coverage of race is the most pressing issue on the public agenda.
After the 2014 shooting death of a teenager named Michael Brown by a police officer, the Black Lives Matter movement gained national prominence by calling on lawmakers and authorities to end discriminatory practices against people of color.
In February, singer Prince mentioned the move during a presentation of the contenders for the Album of the Year nomination at the Grammy Awards.
"The albums still matter", he said.
Like the books and the black lives, the albums still matter.
Recently, the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement released an official statement in response to a question from Fox News contributor Elizabeth Hasselbeck about whether the group would be considered a hate group.
"Black Lives Matter is a love group", the movement's leaders said.
It was recently announced that Damon was included in a list of show business executives, producers and media moguls invited to visit the Pope to discuss the image of the Catholic Church in the West.
It is not known whether the actor accepted the invitation and met with the Pope.
American Ninja Warrior to award its first champion
Professional rock climber and waitress assistant Isaac Caldiero on Monday night became the first winner of the show "American Ninja Warrior", taking home the prize of 1 million dollars.
In this sports show, which has just finished its seventh season, not one of the contestants has ever made it all the way through the obstacle course.
In the season finale, two contestants - Calderon and cameraman Jeff Britten - made it to the final round.
The final challenge involved climbing a 75-foot rope in 30 seconds.
Britten completed the task first and settled in time, becoming the first American Ninja Warrior to complete the grueling Stage 4, but Cagliero completed the task three seconds faster, making him the winner.
After the hard-won victory, Cagliero, who was shocked to have won the million dollars, gave an interview to E!News.
"It's amazing to think, I've never made more than $10,000 a year and lived on less than $10,000 a year", Isaac told E! about the huge jump in his income.
And then all of a sudden, like... I never even imagined what it would be like... the future is unknown.
Executive producer Kent Weed met with The Hollywood Reporter to talk about the finale and why Britten, who crossed the finish line first, will not receive any prize money.
According to the rules, the fastest player gets the money.
"If there is more than one player, the fastest player gets the prize", said Wade.
Although money is a wonderful reward and a life-changing one, it still brings great satisfaction.
I don't think he feels bad about it.
He's happy with what he did.
It's gotten tons of rave reviews from fans.
He's a wonderful man and a family man.
He's a hero to his kids and his wife.
Jeff told me, "If I'm ever going to lose to anyone, I'm glad it was Isaac".
And I think Isaac would feel the same way if we were in different roles.
America Ninja Warrior will return for an eighth season, which will begin filming in the spring of 2016.
The Detroit Tigers are quietly edging the Minnesota Twins.
The second half of the season hasn't been a particularly fun one for the Detroit Tigers.
One of the best baseball teams ever, the Tigers are now in last place in the American League Central Division.
Pretending to be nothing more than a distraction, the Tigers won a glorious 5-4 Tuesday at Target Field over the Minnesota Twins.
The Twins missed a chance to cut the Houston Astros' lead to half the way and finish second in the playoffs in runs scored.
For Detroit, even for one night, it was a return to the F word that eluded them for much of the second half of the season.
"All wins are fun, no matter how they turn out", said Tigers manager Brad Osmus.
Tigers pitcher Alfredo Simon made his contribution to the offense, leading Detroit to three runs in the first two innings, then added another in the sixth and one in the ninth.
Simon (13-9) pitched 6 1/3 innings and allowed three runs.
It was only his third quality start in nine starts.
"I just want to finish the year with a good record", Simon said.
The relief pitchers don't throw every game, so I want to get into the game.
Tigers designated hitter Victor Martinez had three hits and two runs - his first RBI since mid-August.
It was the first three-strike day since the four-strike game against the Seattle Mariners on July 6.
"He was a good hitter", said Osmus.
He showed himself well in (the quality of a batter), noticeably better in the work of a batter and kept this quality for the game.
With three runs in the second half of the seventh inning, the Twins have their best chance of getting back in the game.
Central receiver Byron Buxton opened the inning with a double on the left side of the line.
Right fielder Aaron Hicks, batting first, took over first base, and second baseman Brian Dozier was struck out on a Simon swing before being replaced by lefty Blaine Hardy.
Hardy passed Moyer, the only player on the road, before newly appointed reliever Miguel Sano, who hit a two-run single to the left of right-hander Drew Verhagen.
With a pair of no-hitters and a second-base hit, Verhagen managed to get third baseman Trevor Pluff to a double play.
It was the 27th time for a major league player this season that Plouffe had thrown a double play.
After Detroit added a safety in the first half of the ninth inning, Moyer earned an RBI double in the outfield against Tigers closing pitcher Bruce Rondon, making it 5-4.
However, the right-hander struck Sano out of the game after three strikes and got his fifth save.
Detroit took advantage of a temporarily untrained Phil Hughes early in the game.
The Tigers have three hits in the first two innings against a veteran pitcher who was on the injured list before the game, missing more than a month with a back injury.
"It was definitely not the start I wanted", Hughes said, "but as the game progressed I started to feel more comfortable and so I was able to make some pretty good shots in the third inning".
After the first batter reached first base, Hughes threw the single to second baseman Ian Kinsler.
Wook with two outs of right fielder J. D. Martinez ejected Victor Martinez, who singled to center for the first shot of the game.
Victor Martinez finished his series 0 for 21 with the runners in the resulting position.
Third baseman Nick Castellanos followed with a single, bringing another hit, but Victor Martinez was knocked out in an attempt to get close to third base, thus eliminating the threat.
The Tigers extended their lead in the second inning, taking a one-out double from catcher James McCann and a two-out single from center fielder Anthony Goose to make it 3-0.
"It was a power hit", said Twins manager Paul Molitor.
He wasn't a very good hitter, but he hit the right spot.
Hughes, whose pitches were counted, pitched a scoreless third inning, after which he was replaced by right-handed reliever A. J. Achter.
Hughes has three hits on six hits and four strikeouts.
NOTE: Tigers right-handed pitcher Anibal Sanchez has been ruled out of the game with a strained right shoulder.
He'll be seen by Dr. James Andrews, who performed Sanchez's shoulder surgery back in 2007.
Sanchez, who has been on the injured list since mid-August, is scheduled to start Wednesday.
With Sanchez out of the game, left-handed pitcher Daniel Norris will be leaving the injured list and will be playing against the Twins.
Norris, who has made four starts with the Tigers since being acquired in exchange for left-handed pitcher David Price on July 30, has one win and one loss.
He has not participated in a game since August 20 due to a strained hamstring.
The Tigers and Twins will conclude a three-game series at Target Field on Wednesday.
Norris (2-2, ERA, 4.43) will be opposed by right-handed pitcher Erwin Santana (5-4, ERA, 4.73).
The original of Kadyrov's complaint on the book "Prayer to God" was received in the South Sakhalin court.
The original of the appeal of the representative of the president of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov against the decision to recognize the book "Molbah to God: its meaning and place in Islam" as "extremist material" has been received by the South Sakhalin City Court, "Interfax" reports with reference to the chairman of the city court Alexander Chuhraj.
The court is now awaiting possible objections from the parties.
Chukhrai refused to comment on the statements of some Russian State Duma deputies about the need to check the city court for possible cooperation with foreign special services and ISIS.
"Let them comment on such nonsense", he said.
On September 11, the South Sakhalin City Prosecutor's Office filed an appeal against the decision of Judge Natalya Perchenko to declare the book "extremist material".
An appeal came from the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk Prosecutor's Office on Friday evening.
There are some nuances: the prosecution believes that they asked the court to consider only the author's opinion of the book as extremist, not the verses from the Koran.
According to the prosecutor's office, the judge made the wrong decision", said Chuhrai.
The decision to recognize the book as "extremist material" was made on August 12, 2015.
In particular, quotes from the Quran were called "extremist" - "You alone we worship and You alone we ask for help", "Do not call on anyone else besides Allah".
Kadyrov called those who made the decision based on the book "devils and provocateurs".
He called on the State Duma deputies to legislatively prohibit judicial decisions concerning the texts of the holy scriptures.
"I am firmly convinced that the State Duma should pass a law prohibiting the judicial decision directly concerning the texts of the Koran and other divine writings", Kadyrov wrote on his Instagram.
Facebook to remove comments that insult migrants and refugees
Facebook is removing posts and comments that negatively assess migrants and refugees.
In addition, the social network will provide financial support to organizations that collect user complaints about illegal content.
Facebook is working with the German Ministry of Justice to combat xenophobia and racism online.
So, the head of the department, Hayko Maas, said that the Ministry of Justice is currently working with social media specialists to create a special group of moderators.
Its participants are obliged to track and delete comments that are incorrect in relation to migrants and refugees.
According to Haiko Maas, it is expected that the authors of intolerant posts will receive notifications indicating the reason for the deletion of their posts.
Organisations whose specialists collect complaints from social network users about offensive posts should also contribute to the prompt blocking of illegal content.
Facebook management is committed to providing the financial support they need.
The decision to remove posts containing negative comments about migrants and refugees was made by the social network's management and the German Ministry of Justice after xenophobic sentiments rose sharply in the German segment of Facebook.
One of the most obvious reasons for this is the unprecedented migration crisis that has hit the EU countries recently.
In Germany, for example, refugee resettlement centers are already overcrowded.
The day before, the authorities decided to temporarily settle the migrants in the territory of the former Buchenwald concentration camp.
Forced migrants from the Middle East and Africa are housed in the same barracks that Nazi prisoners and prisoners of war were housed in.
Moscow cemeteries will have relaxation areas.
In the near future, several of the capital's cemeteries will be equipped with special zones for relaxation and psychological rest.
The first will be the Butov, Domodedovo, and the Shcherbin cemetery.
The first psychological rest area has already been established at the Troyekurovsky Cemetery in Moscow.
In the future, similar sites will appear in other areas of the city.
This was reported by Artem Ekimov, the head of the State budgetary institution "Ritual".
The relaxation areas will be small landscaped areas, reminiscent of parks.
Experts believe that such "corners" are a place where visitors can relax, be alone, and regain their psychological strength.
In the near future, relaxation zones will be built in Domodedovo, Butov and Shcherbin cemeteries, and then in other areas of the capital.
According to the head of the Ritual State Cemetery, if the cemetery needs to be expanded, the builders will try to preserve the existing forest areas as much as possible.
The green spaces will serve as a living fence that will separate the recreation areas and the areas set aside directly for the burial sites.
The Ritual State Bureau of Experts also announced their intention to propose the abolition of the burial fences.
New cemeteries can really become barrier-free.
In addition, the Ritual State Cemetery Office said it was ready to install electronic terminals, with the help of which visitors to cemeteries can learn the GPS coordinates and number signs of burials.
In June this year, Ritual also proposed to adjust the cost of funeral services depending on the time of year.
So, digging a grave in the summer will cost a thousand rubles less, a week in the winter when the ground is frozen.
It should be noted that in the past year, the average price of all types of ritual services has risen by 10 percent.
Five days later, a lost mushroom was found in the Elin forest.
The old man was alive, though he had been in the woods for more than a hundred hours without food.
The mushroom hole was discovered by a team of rescuers and volunteers.
Alexander Blinnikov, correspondent: "79-year-old pensioner from the Tambov region spent five days in the forest".
No food or water.
He was searched by relatives, rescuers, volunteers.
There were even dog movies, but nothing came of it.
The man was found after a helicopter joined the search.
That day Vitaly Alexandrovich went to the forest as usual for the opia and the sub-bearers, but did not return by the evening.
The next day, rescuers and caring residents from a nearby village - some 30 people - were called in to help.
On the fifth day, a helicopter from the fire and rescue center joined them.
Andrei Seletsov, head of the search and rescue team of the Smolensk Region Fire and Rescue Center, said: "The helicopter was brought in, the man was found".
He's gone far away, to a different place.
It was about seven miles from the search site.
He's come a long way at his age.
It was a miracle he was alive.
Gribnik was taken to the central district hospital in Yelnin without consciousness, in extremely serious condition.
The doctors diagnosed him with pneumonia, as well as severe dehydration and hypothermia.
How the elderly man survived five days in the woods, doctors have no idea.
Valentina Nepsh, head of the therapeutic department of the Elin Center: "The patient was examined, treated".
Infusion therapy, the antibacterial.
Given all his chronic illnesses.
The patient's condition improved this morning, remains critical, but with positive dynamics.
Vitaly Alexandrovich, a pensioner, comes to Smolensk every year from the Tambov region.
His grandson says that his grandfather had been a mushroom picker before, but he had never gone far into the woods.
Alexey Spitchenko, the grandson of the found mushroom, shared: "The forest is not far from the road, it is not local in principle".
I've been coming to visit my relatives for a few years.
Well, he went to get mushrooms.
He must have gone too far and got lost.
With the onset of the mushroom season, people are regularly disappearing in all areas of the Smolensk region.
Five similar cases in the last few days alone.
Rescuers remind us that we should wear bright clothes, carry a small amount of food, and carry matches and a compass.
Also, it is desirable to leave traces behind so that you can return later.
An-2 crashed in the brown forest.
An An-2 crashed into a Siberian field.
The plane of the Krasnoyarsk airline "Yenisei" made an emergency landing 68 kilometers from Bratsk.
There were no fatalities or injuries, but the plane itself sustained significant damage on landing.
An-2 was on a business trip.
The plane was carrying three crew members - the captain, the co-pilot and a flight attendant, Interfax reports.
The emergency aircraft was flying on the route Zheleznogorsk-Ilimsky - Achinsk, where the airline is based.
The crew has already been taken to Bratsk.
The Brotherhood Transport Prosecutor's Office after the An-2 emergency landing began to check compliance with the flight safety legislation.
The East Siberian Transportation Prosecutor's office has arrived at the scene.
In September 2010, the crew of the Tu-154 landed its passenger plane due to a technical fault on an abandoned airfield in Komi.
The ship's engines and onboard electronics were down, but the crew did the impossible.
There were 10 crew members and 72 passengers on board.
No one was hurt in the emergency landing.
The news is the news.
The processes of globalization were supposed to help reduce inequality in the world.
In fact, the reality is that the income gap in developing economies is actually growing.
Eric Maskin.
To remedy this, education levels of low-skilled workers need to be improved, says Eric Maskin, chief scientist of the International Laboratory for Decision Analysis and Choice at the National Institute of Economic Research, and winner of the 2007 Nobel Prize in Economics.
The world has experienced unprecedented growth in global markets over the past 20 years.
Trade borders between countries became more and more open.
Proponents of globalization predicted great benefits for emerging economies.
"And those predictions have largely come true", Maskin points out.
China and India, for example, have seen significant GDP per capita growth.
But it's not all that glowing.
Globalization was expected to reduce the gap between the "haves" and the "have-nots" in poor countries, which is manifested in the great inequality of income, or more precisely, of wages.
But in fact, inequality has only increased, notes Eric Maskin in his article "Why Global Markets Have Failed to Reduce Inequality in Emerging Economies", published in The World Bank Economic Review, translated and quoted by the IEA.
Together with Harvard University economist Michael Kremer, Professor Eric Maskin has developed an alternative theory that demonstrates why income inequality in poor countries is increasing as globalization increases, the HSE reminds.
The new global market is undergoing a specific process.
To illustrate this, Muskine identifies four levels of qualification for professionals: A and B for rich countries, C and D for poor countries.
After globalization, D specialists from poor countries are not qualified to cooperate with A and B specialists from rich countries.
And while the C workers in poor countries are getting their pay raised by working with B workers in rich countries, the D workers are not getting their pay raised or are getting their pay cut.
The net effect is that the internationalization of production will increase the wage gap between the two categories of professionals in poor countries and thus increase inequality.
Cremer and E. Maskin have proposed a surprisingly beautiful model, an alternative to the Ricardian theory of comparative advantage.
It helps explain why globalization has led to income inequality", says Fuad Aleshkerov, professor emeritus, head of the International Laboratory for Analysis and Decision Making, head of the mathematics department at the National Institute of Higher Education.
And like any powerful theory, I'm sure it will lead to a flurry of empirical work in this area.
The solution, according to Eric Maskin, is to increase the education of low-skilled workers.
However, the workers themselves, as the scientist notes, do not have the means to do so, and it is not profitable for companies to pay for their training.
Governments, international agencies, NGOs and private foundations can play a significant role in this situation, according to Maskin.
The scientist notes that the developed theory in no way calls for stopping the process of globalization, which has brought and is bringing its fruits in the form of GDP growth of countries.
Derbent: a living link to the times.
Derbent, one of the oldest cities in Russia, is celebrating its 2000th anniversary in September.
The program of the festive events - festival of national cultures of the peoples of Dagestan and a fair in the style of the past times, an exhibition of derbent carpets and the Open Temples Day, a historical-musical show "2000 years in two hours" and an excursion to the reconstructed Peter I Museum.
The medieval stones of the Naryn Kala fortress, the ancient Arabic inscriptions on the walls, the narrow streets and the palace gardens - all this is as if it came from the pages of "The Thousand and One Nights".
Derbent is the only city in Russia that has been preserved in its place since ancient times.
Although it was claimed by the Roman Empire, Byzantium, the Khazar Khanate and the Golden Horde.
The eastern plane trees that grow in the courtyard of the Durban Juma mosque are several centuries old.
These mighty plants are protected by the All-Russia program "Trees - Monuments of Living Nature".
The shade of the radiant towers provides a refuge for pilgrims and tourists during the summer heat.
The visitor is served with fragrant tea and Dagestani delicacies - honeyed figs, dates, mushrooms, miracle cakes, ayran and sweets.
In Derbent, large samovars have been used for centuries to serve tea to numerous guests at once.
The inscription above the entrance to the Jumma mosque says that the building was built in the year 115 Hijra.
That's 733 on the Gregorian calendar.
It's the oldest mosque in Russia.
The interior is striking in its grandeur and solemnity: the arches of the domes and vaults are supported by square columns and are illuminated by the rays of the sun from tiny windows.
The keeping and breeding of pigeons is a traditional hobby of the inhabitants of Derbent.
Bird owners keep pigeon-houses in their yards, under trees, in attics.
The spectacle is a flock of white doves, which look like the flashes of a festive fireworks display.
In order to protect the ancient Persians from the enemy, they blocked the Caspian Gate with a double stone wall.
The structure, which extends 500 meters into the sea, blocks the harbor of Derbent.
In 2003, the Derbent fortress walls were included in the UNESCO World Heritage List as the best preserved monument of ancient Persian fortification architecture.
Carpets were woven in Derbent as early as the fifth century, and the technology of this unique craft has remained virtually unchanged to this day.
On one of the streets adjacent to the city market, carpets for every taste are sold - strips of wool, cotton, or wool in all colors and shades, with hair and without, with intricate ornaments and a whimsical border.
The city began with the construction of the maghals - quarters with one-story stone buildings.
Over the years, the Mughals have changed little.
Satellite dishes, wall-mounted air conditioners, and street lamps are the only things that remind you that you are not in a medieval city but in a modern one.
In the old part of the city, there are still parts of a water supply system built by the Persians about a thousand years ago.
The ancient springs have survived to this day, and the local people still draw water from them.
Many Derbent residents prefer tap water to water from historic fountains.
Derbent was one of the centers of the pottery trade.
The vessels, dishes, cups, and cups used for drinking were prized throughout the Caucasus.
The potter's hands still produce fine ceramic objects for practical and souvenir purposes.
On holidays and festivals, crowds of spectators gather under the wire rope, on which the students of the Republican School of Circus Art perform.
The history of this amazing and risky craft goes back centuries.
A new trend is that more and more girls are being seen among the tightrope walkers.
The former Virgin Bath is now the home of the Museum of the Culture and Life of Ancient Derbent.
Unmarried girls and brides used to bathe here accompanied by their friends, but now anyone can see the domed hall, hot and cold pools, and bathing facilities that have passed into the past.
Most houses in Derbent have hot water, but the baths and steam rooms are as popular today as they were in the old days.
The benefits of steam heating are written in old books.
After the bath, blood flow improves, muscle fatigue disappears, and the body becomes more flexible and agile.
The festival "Solidarity", which takes place on the territory of the fortress of Naryn-Kala, is attended by ethnic couples from many districts of Dagestan.
Participants in national costumes dance, play folk melodies, sing songs of the peoples of the Caucasus and treat visitors with delicious homemade cheese.
The Kyrklyar is the burial place of forty martyrs who laid down their heads for Islam.
It is one of the most revered complexes for Muslims of the North Caucasus.
The sarcophagi, which have become yellow over time, are carved from solid stone blocks and oriented, as is customary among the Arabs, on the west-east axis.
Brothers Gavril and Albert Yakubov cut and shave customers in a small salon near the Upper Bazaar.
The barbershop has been in this location for years.
The techniques of the curling craft are passed down from generation to generation.
The Jacobov brothers can do not only traditional, but also the most modern hairstyle.
On one of the streets of the Old City, a house was preserved in which lived the writer-decembrist Alexander Bestuzhev-Marlinski, who was exiled to the Caucasus.
Having learned the Turkic language and collected ethnographic material, he described the Derbent of the first third of the XIX century with its ancient monuments, the life and everyday life of the townspeople.
The Teahouse is a traditional Oriental club, where only tea and homemade pastries are served.
Men come here to quench their thirst, talk to their friends, and solve some work problems.
As in the past, women are not allowed to enter the teahouse.
The Derbent dance ensemble "Kaspi" was created three years ago, but has already managed to take part in events of the republican and Russian level.
The soloists of the ensemble rehearse every day, perfectly mastering the folk Avar, Dargin, Tat, Armenian dances.
As the noise dies down and the street lights are lit, the locals sit on benches near the houses with their terraces.
Usually, the Derbent discusses the issues of the day.
But as the anniversary approaches, they are increasingly recalling the episodes of their city's unique history, which influenced the fate of the entire Black Sea-Caspian region.
Domodedovo has had a business "airport game".
A new form of education is being tested in the capital.
Four hundred students tried out as airport employees.
For this purpose, three airports were built in Domodedovo.
The young men not only inspected and registered the passengers but also serviced the planes.
It was all in the form of a business game, but it was no less complex than reality.
Delayed flights, two passengers with fractures on board, a stairway lost somewhere on the way to the plane.
Hell for a real airport.
For someone who's settled in the Domodedovo hangar, it's a standard set of tasks that newcomers have to solve.
In one hangar, three major airports from different countries of the world were accommodated.
They now employ 400 students from the capital's colleges and universities.
An unprecedented opportunity to learn all about the inner world of the airfield.
They were given the job of checking passengers, servicing planes, handling baggage - even buses at the airport, boarding gates, and passenger inspection.
And the passengers are a problem.
One with a paperwork problem, another one late for a flight, and a third one with a bag full of suspicious items.
And you have to deal with all of this, like in life, in the shortest possible time.
For each of these tasks, they get paid a certain amount of money, virtual money, as if they were paid by the airline for the flight.
"They are being fined for not fulfilling the tasks", explains Dmitry Hilko, a financial analyst for the game, in an interview with Vesti-Moscow.
The Ministry of Education officials are closely monitoring the situation.
For them, the test is an attempt to test a new form of learning.
She's already been accepted into the secondary vocational education course.
"Six interregional competence centers will be formed, which will become, in fact, new models of modern colleges with a modern management system, with highly qualified personnel, with modern equipment", - says the director of the department of state policy in the field of training of working personnel and additional professional education of the Ministry of Education and Science of Russia, Natalya Zolotareva.
But students don't have to worry about global plans.
After three days of training like this, they're gonna need a day off.
But the marks on that exam were purely material.
The newest smart glasses, the best I've ever seen!
"I got them for responding to a complaint about our airport on Instagram in a timely manner", said a satisfied participant of the game, the PR manager of the Frankfurt Airport team, Sergey Shuvalov.
The best judges, so to speak, were hired to work for them by the time they graduated.
The U.S. Embassy regrets the closure of the American Center in Moscow.
The American Embassy in Russia expressed regret over the closure of the American Center for Foreign Literature at the Library.
The center has been operating in Moscow for more than 22 years.
The U.S. Embassy in Moscow deeply regrets the Russian government's unilateral decision to close the American Center of the U.S. Embassy at the All-Russian State Library named after M.I. Rudomino in Moscow.
"The unilateral steps taken by the Russian Federation in recent times call into question the commitment of the Russian government to the ties between the Russian and American peoples, which were not interrupted even during the Cold War and other difficult moments in the long history of relations between our countries", said the statement of US Ambassador John Tefft, received by Interfax.
The American Center has created deep and lasting connections between the people and cultures of Russia and the United States.
It was the center of American culture, history and literature in the Russian capital, and also served as a meeting place for numerous prominent American figures, among whom were astronauts, artists, athletes, scientists, politicians and writers.
"Last year alone, the American Center hosted more than 400 cultural and educational events and welcomed more than 50,000 Russian visitors", the diplomat stressed.
Tefft recalled that about a year ago, it was decided to close another joint Russian-American project - the FLEX (Future Leaders Exchange Program) educational exchange program.
The Green Tribunal was quick to execute.
A typical situation: four officials stand in front of the judge Swatantra Kumar's desk, listening to his grievances about the work done.
The court is completely dissatisfied with the quality of your work.
We did not give you a 110-page order to make fun of", says Kumar.
If there's another brick, we'll have to tear down the existing structures.
Kumar heads the National Green Tribunal (NGT), a judicial body established in 2010 to stop the rapid environmental pollution that has accompanied the rapid economic growth of recent decades.
During that time, the Tribunal has handled over 10,000 claims related to air pollution, garbage collection, geological development, toxic waste and dam construction.
In two out of three cases, the court decides to stop the construction that is causing the pollution.
The stakes are incredibly high: in less than 60 years since the declaration of independence, with the intensified industrial development, India has transformed from a country of virgin jungles into one of the most overcrowded and polluted countries in the world.
The problem is particularly acute in large cities, where infrastructure development is lagging behind rapid urbanization: cities are covered with dense smog, rivers are filled with pesticides and waste from enterprises and households, and the few remaining residential areas are being cut down for new residential quarters.
Despite the formal support of the green movement by the state, the NHT is regularly criticized by the Narendra Modi government, as it is often the main reason for the cancellation of major investment projects.
In May of this year, the Minister of the Environment called the court's decisions "extreme" and "impracticable".
Sometimes it is really impossible to enforce a court's decision within the time limit set by the court, as environmental lawyer Raj Panjwani confirms.
But there's a silver lining to missed deadlines: At the very least, they force the responsible ones to move.
"His main goal is to shake up the system", adds the lawyer.
The Green Tribunal has repeatedly canceled major construction projects, including the airport, the power plant, and hundreds of smaller projects.
But people are also being considered, as was the case when a pharmaceutical company in Telangana State polluted a local river with fluoride.
We can shut down your factory, but we're also responsible for the economic consequences.
"People will lose their jobs", Kumar commented on his decision.
However, such explanations are not always understood by the common people, whose lives can be changed by a single stroke of the judge's pen.
In April, the tribunal decided to ban all vehicles older than 10 years from entering the capital, which caused public outrage.
Despite a sharp drop in popularity and a flurry of criticism, Swantar Kumar refused to overturn this decision.
Instead, he ordered the Delhi government to provide statistics on the traffic coming in and going out, and also proposed to buy 10,000 additional buses, after first asking the factories whether they could fulfill such an order.
As pollution sources such as landfills, fuel quality, and even traffic accidents came into the court's attention, public anger began to subside.
But the most painful topic for the principle judge was the Ganga river cleanup programme, which was announced with pomp by Prime Minister Narendra Modi last year.
When it comes to the Ganga, a sacred river for Hindus, the judge often loses control of his emotions and goes on a rampage.
Do you know what the word "sacred" means?
Someone poured water from the Ganges on the statue of God, and it turned out to be fecal matter, - the judge is hot.
You keep polluting the river because you think the Gang is the Gang, it will take away all our sins.
This is the river we worship, and look what you do with it every day.
The Ganga cleanup is the most ambitious and costly environmental project announced by the new government.
Now, the amount of fecal bacteria in this river is more than 120 times the normal amount.
Each year, 1.5 to 3 of the 700 million bathing Hindus die from infectious diseases.
In February, Narendra Modi even donated to the Ganges Salvation Fund the proceeds from the sale of his suit, in which he met Barack Obama, and 455 items from his personal collection.
Environmentalists immediately accused the prime minister of being a populist: the suit was bought for $700,000, while the river needed at least eight billion to be cleaned.
The Green Tribunal's supporters agree that India has a long way to go before it can call itself a developed country, but they do not believe that progress should come at the cost of the environment.
"In a developing country, talking about the environment is often seen as an unconscionable luxury", says Ganga Voice activist Malika Bhanot.
The court is trying to find a balance between ecology and development".
A man has bled several Dalí paintings at an exhibition in Riga.
A visitor to the exhibition of the Latvian Artists' Union in Riga smashed windows in the museum and ruined the sculpture of Salvador Dali "The Appearance of an Angel".
The museum is currently hosting an exhibition of works by Salvador Dali and Pablo Picasso.
A man born in 1985 entered the sculpture room at 2:20 p.m.
He immediately misled: he ruined the sculpture, he broke the windows.
Then he started moving around and bleeding on some of the permanent exhibits.
Among them is a portrait of the Brush Arm of Miervaldis Polis.
According to the president of the Latvian Union of Artists, Igor Dobychyn, to whom Interfax refers, the windows were also damaged.
Police and art experts are on the scene.
The latter determine the extent of the damage and the damage.
A criminal case has been opened against the man for hooliganism.
The Latvian Union of Artists is hosting an exhibition of Picasso and Dalí's works from 4 August to 27 September, featuring more than 200 original works by the artists.
Commentator Gennady Orlov is hospitalized in Spain.
On Wednesday, Russia's champion Zenit from St. Petersburg will play its first Champions League group stage match against Spain's Valencia.
Unfortunately, Gennady Orlov will not be able to comment on the St. Petersburg game.
NTV commentator Gennady Orlov was hospitalized Wednesday in a Spanish clinic with a suspected acute appendicitis.
The examination will give the answer - whether the seventy-year-old Gennady Sergeyevich needs operative treatment.
The match will be commented by Konstantin Genich.
Zenit are in the Champions League group.
His rivals are Spanish "Valencia", French "Lyon" and Belgian "Gent".

The Russian-Belarusian "Shield of the Union-2015" exercises have ended.
The joint Russian-Belarusian exercise "Shield of the Union-2015" has ended in the west of the country, "Russia 24" reports.
The maneuvers were held at the polygons in the Leningrad, Pskov and Kaliningrad regions, as well as in the waters of the Baltic Sea.
More than eight thousand military personnel and about four hundred units of equipment participated.
On the last day of the exercises, the ships of the Baltic Fleet worked out the artillery strike on sea and coastal targets, as well as the repulsion of the air attack of the conditional enemy.
Where can I leave a review of the bailiff's work in Murmansk?
The Office of the Federal Service of the Prosecutor for the Murmansk region reported that in order to improve the work on the protection of the rights and legitimate interests of citizens and organizations in the department there is a book of reviews and proposals.
In it, citizens can leave a note about the quality of the work of bailiffs and other officials of the administration, information about shortcomings in the work, as well as express their suggestions and wishes.
In the administration, a copy of the book of feedback and proposals is in the central hall, in a special pocket in a visible and accessible place at the entry point into the building.
In the administrative departments, the book is kept in the office.
Taking into account the nature of the objection or proposal, a written response is sent to the initiator of the objection or proposal, where appropriate.
Xi Jinping calls for more open economy
The economy needs to be more open to the world to boost growth, President Xi Jinping said Tuesday in an address to a group tasked with leading reforms.
"China should concentrate on attracting foreign investors and experts and develop an open-door policy", he said, addressing the participants of the 16th meeting of the Committee of the central lead group on comprehensive deepening of reforms.
He said expanding openness and deepening reforms would give the economy new impetus and vitality and provide new space for economic development.
The group adopted a number of directives, including regulating investor access to markets, changing border control rules, encouraging state-owned enterprises (SOEs) to attract private capital and revising the resident registration system.
According to the statement, a list of economic and production sectors that are not available for investment will be drawn up.
The system will be gradually debugged through trial programs.
This is an important step as it will give the market a more significant role in allocating resources, ensuring business legitimacy and increasing transparency, the statement said.
The government will also loosen the control of the powers it gives to companies, thereby ensuring that companies will run their own businesses.
The statement also said that China will allow border regions to learn new models of cross-border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to enhance local growth.
More spheres will be open to private investors in order to increase the openness of state-controlled sectors of the economy.
"The government will not change its policy towards foreign investors and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign-funded companies and provide them with the best conditions", the statement said.
The application process for a permanent residence permit for foreigners, or "green card", will be further simplified by streamlining the requirements and simplifying the application process itself.
The meeting also discussed the provision of the rights of lawyers and the issues of training of professional judges and prosecutors.
According to an official report issued after the meeting, it was also attended by Prime Minister Li Keqiang and Ministers Liu Yunshan and Zhang Gaoli.
