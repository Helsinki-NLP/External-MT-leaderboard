'Welsh Assembly members are concerned about their appearance as a "Mamphet".'
There is a panic among several Assembly members about changing their titles to MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reason for this panic is the proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Western Parliament.
Members of the assembly of various political parties fear ridicule over the name change.
A Labour MP said his party was concerned that the new post would fit in with the Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside of Welsh: In Welsh, Twp means fool and Pwp means mole.
A Plaid Assembly member said they were "not happy" as a party and suggested alternatives.
A member of the Welsh Conservative Party said the party was "open minded" about the name change but noted that there was little difference in pronunciation between MWP and MPET.
In this sense, the Wesch W is pronounced like the Yorkshire English U.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently making provisions for the start of the name change process, said: "The final decision on what the description of the Assembly members' posts will be will be made by the members themselves".
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the right to change their name.
In June the Commission published the results of a referendum in which the proposal to change the name of the Assembly to the Welsh Parliament was overwhelmingly supported.
As for the position of Assembly Members, the Commission is in favour of the Welsh Members of Parliament, or WMP, but the MWP has the most support in the public opinion.
Apparently, Assembly members are suggesting different options, but it will be difficult for Presiding Officer Ellen Jones, who is due to submit a draft legislation in a few weeks, to reach a consensus.
The reform bill will include several changes to the functioning of the Assembly including disqualification of Assembly members and design of the committee system.
After the debate on the provision, the Assembly members will have the opportunity to vote on what their post should be.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the name of the country
Voters will vote on Sunday to decide whether to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The popular vote was held to avoid decades of conflict with neighboring Greece, which has its own province called Macedonia.
Athens has long claimed that its northern neighbour's name is a symbol of claim to their territory and has therefore repeatedly objected to the country's application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Georgi Ivanov, who opposes the referendum on the name change, says he will ignore the referendum.
However, supporters of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zayev, believe that the name change is only a necessary step to join the European Union and NATO.
The church bells of St. Martin's Day are silent as the churches of Harlem continue to ring
"The older people I spoke to said that historically there was a church and a pub on every corner", Mr. Adams said.
"None of that today".
He said that the disappearance of the water bottle is understandable.
Today, "people communicate in different ways".
"Baths are no longer the area living rooms where everyone goes on a regular basis".
As for the church, he is worried that the money from the property sale won't last as long as the leaders think, and that today and tomorrow, they will go back to where they started.
He also said that apartments and condominiums could be built on the site of the church, where people would live who would not help the rest of the churches in the area.
"Most of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white", he said, "and so they will hasten the closing of these churches because most of the people who live in these condominiums are less likely to be members of the church".
Both churches were founded by white congregations before Harlem became a predominantly black metropolis. The Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's a decade later.
The Mull White Methodist congregation left the church in 1930.
A black congregation worshiping nearby took over the building.
A black congregation occupies St. Martin's under the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who leads a boycott against retailers on One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street, a major shopping street in Harlem, for refusing to hire and promote black workers.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but when the parishioners of Father Johnson planned to restore it, they arranged for the construction of the Carillon.
The Rev. David Johnson, son of Father Johnson and heir to St. Martin's, proudly called the carillon "the poor man's bell".
The expert who played the carillon last July called it something different: "a historic treasure" and "an incomparable historical instrument".
Experts Tiffany Neing of the University of Michigan said it was the world's only carillon played by a black beetle, played by Donio A. Lind, who was hired to play the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Maryweather said St. Martin's did not replace him.
What has happened in St. Martin's in recent months is a complex case of architects and contractors being hired by the general leaders of the church or the Episcopal dioceses.
The governing body of the parish of Vestry, which is made up of general leaders, expressed concerns in July that they would consider transferring costs to the diocese of Vestry, although Vestry was not involved in the hiring of architects and contractors sent by the diocese.
Some parishioners complained of a lack of transparency in the work of the diocese.
13-year-old Golda, California, is injured by a shark attack after diving to catch shrimp
A 13-year-old boy was injured by a shark attack after diving for shrimp on Saturday, the first day of the shrimp season, officials said.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. in Beacons Beach near Encinitas.
Chad Hamel told KSWB TV in San Diego that he and friends had been diving for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and he and a group of people paddled over to help him out of the water.
Hamel said that at first he thought the boy was screaming for joy at catching a shrimp, but then he realized that the boy was screaming, "It bit me!"
He bit me!'
"His throat was torn", said Hamel, as he reached the boy.
"I'm yelling at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" adds Hamel.
The boy was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where he is in critical condition.
The species of the attacking shark is unknown.
Lifeguard Captain Larry Giles told a news briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks ago, but was not identified as an endangered species.
Giles also said the victim suffered severe injuries to the upper part of his thigh.
Authorities have banned access to beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Encinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety reasons.
Giles said more than 135 species of sharks have been spotted in the area, most of which are not endangered.
Sainsbury's planning to enter the UK market
Sainsbury's Boots, SuperDrug and Debenhams are set to compete with department stores in the retail business with cosmetic eyewear and expert support staff.
As part of a massive push to enter the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, the massive beauty aisles will be rolled out in 11 stores nationwide and, if successful, in other stores. The UK beauty market is growing where the market for fashion and home decor essentials has fallen.
The investment is coming as supermarkets are looking for new ways to fill shelves once filled with TVs, microwaves and home decor items.
Sensbury said it will double its lineup to 3,000 products, including Revlon, Easy, Twizerman and Doctor Who for the first time.
The existing cosmetics ranges like L'Oreal, Mabelyn and Barts Beach will have more space with separate space for brands like Shoes.
The supermarket is launching its boutique makeup range, with most products being vegan-friendly, which has become very popular among young shoppers.
In addition, perfume retailer The Fragrance Shop will run a trial of discounted deliveries at two Sainsbury's stores, the first of which opened in Croydon, south London, last week, and the second will open in Sale Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Shopping online and buying less food at local grocery stores means supermarkets have to increase their efforts to attract more customers.
Mike Coop, CEO of Sainsbury's, said the outlets would have to look like department stores as the supermarket chain competes with discount stores like Aldi and Lidl and will have more service and non-food items.
Since Sainsbury's bought Argos and Habitat's two years ago, it has installed hundreds of Argos outlets and opened several Habitat stores, which the company claims has increased grocery sales and made the acquisition more profitable.
The previous attempt to merge the supermarket and pharmacy departments has failed.
Sainsbury's experimented with a joint venture with Fike Boots in the early 2000s but the project was abandoned due to a conflict over how to share profits from chemist shops in supermarkets.
Sainsbury's is taking this new approach after selling its 281-store pharmacy business to Lloyds Pharmacy owner Selessio.
The company said that Lloyds will contribute to the plan by adding a luxury range of skincare brands, including La Roche Pose and Vichy in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sales Director at Sainsbury's, said: "We have changed the layout of our islands to improve the environment for our customers.
We have also invested in hiring specially trained staff who will be present to give advice.
Our brand range is designed to meet all kinds of needs and with attractive environment and convenient location we are now a reliable fashion destination that will challenge old methods of shopping".
Peter Jones fires after Holly Willoughby pulls out of £11million deal
TV presenter Holly Willoughby is furious over the cancellation of her deal with the lifestyle brand of Dragon's Den star Peter Jones to focus on her new deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time for their household goods and the associated brand Truly.
The pair's business has been compared to Ginneth Paltrow's Gup brand.
The morning host, 37, announced her departure on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby's Dragons of Denmark star Peter Jones has angered the media by withdrawing at the last minute from their attractive lifestyle brand business, which aims to focus on his new bumper deal with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Jones became "firebrand" in anger when, during an interview at the headquarters of her business empire in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, the TV golden girl admitted that she had no time for their household goods and associated brand trolleys due to her new deal worth up to £1.5 million, sources said.
The business was compared to Ginneth Paltrow's Gup brand and was expected to double Willoughby's £11 million fortune.
Willoughby, 37, left Britain on a jet plane for his holiday residency after announcing his departure from Truly on Instagram.
A source said: "Truly has been at the top of the list of priorities of the Hall so far.
It was part of his long-term future plan to meet his economic needs for decades to come.
His decision to withdraw has taken everyone concerned by surprise.
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday, the project was supposed to be launched very soon.
Marlowe's headquarters has a warehouse full of goods ready for sale".
Experts believe the departure of the This Morning host, who is now one of Britain's most trusted stars, could cost the firm millions of pounds as they have already invested heavily in products ranging from cushions to candles, fabrics and household goods, and a possible delay in its opening will add to the loss.
And it could end a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin have been close to Jones and his wife Tara Cap for a decade.
Willoughby started Truly with Cap in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as president in March.
The couple vacation together and Jones owns a 40 percent stake in Baldwin's TV production firm.
Willoughby will be the brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as the presenter of ITV's I Am a Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night: "We will not comment on his business dealings".
'Trouble discussion and then we fall in love'
He joked that he was positive about the North Korean leader and made a comment that some people would consider "unpresidential".
Why did President Trump make such concessions?
Trump said in his "news anchor" voice.
"I have not given up".
He said Kim was looking forward to a second meeting after their initial meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step towards North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
But the nuclear disarmament talks have stalled.
More than three months after the Singapore summit, North Korea's top diplomat, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no "relevant response" from the United States to North Korea's earlier disarmament efforts.
However, he said the US imposed sanctions for the purpose of pressure.
Trump expressed even more positive views during his rally speech.
"We are in good standing with North Korea", he said.
"We were facing war with North Korea.
Tens of millions of people could have been killed.
We have a great relationship now.
He claimed his efforts to improve relations with Kim had paid off, which helped to bring the end of the rocket tests, the release of prisoners and the return of the remaining American personnel.
And he endorsed her unusual way of talking about her relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be a president, but instead of 10,000 people standing outside this crowded arena trying to get in, there would have been 200 people standing here", Trump said, pointing to the crowd in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake devastate an island in Indonesia, killing hundreds
After the Lompoc earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were told they didn't need help.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, no national disaster was declared, a prerequisite for international aid.
"In many cases, unfortunately, they have made it very clear that they are not asking for international cooperation, so it is challenging", Mr. Sambang said.
While Save the Children is putting together a team to travel to Palouse, it is still unclear whether foreign workers will be able to work in the field.
Mr. Sutopo, spokesperson for the National Disaster Agency, said Indonesian officials are assessing the situation in Palua to determine whether foreign entities will be allowed to participate in the relief effort.
Despite Indonesia's frequent earthquake events, the country is woefully unprepared to deal with the wrath of nature.
While tsunami shelters have been built in Aceh, shelters are being built in other coastal areas.
Despite the alert, the tsunami warning in Palo is clearly a lack of sirens, possibly contributing to the loss of life.
Even when the weather is good, many of the islands in Indonesia are challenging to travel.
Natural disasters make communication systems more vulnerable.
A ship deployed to Lombok is about to leave the hospital to help the victims, but it will take at least three days for the ship to reach the site of this new disaster.
President Joko Widodo has made the development of Indonesia's waste infrastructure a focus of his election campaign and has invested heavily in the construction of roads and railways.
But a lack of investment before the next year's re-election has hampered Mr. Jokor's government.
Mr Joko is also feeling pressure from the long-standing communal tensions in Indonesia, where the Muslim majority have adopted a more conservative lifestyle of their religion.
More than 1,000 people were killed and more than 10,000 were left homeless in the clashes between Christians and Muslims, which saw the two sides fighting in the streets with daggers, arrows, bows and other heavy weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge's beautiful equaliser against Chelsea in the game
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League at Stamford Bridge in London on Saturday with an 89th-minute goal.
Sturridge was 30 metres from the Chelsea goalpost when he received a pass from Jordan Shakiri, who was 1-0 down.
He first carried the ball to the left and then took a shot at the far post.
The shot goes to the top of the box to the right corner of the net.
The ball finally jumped past the kipa Ariyaballaga and entered the net.
"It's important to get in the right position to catch the ball in time, because players like Shaq always move the ball as far as possible, so I was trying to give myself as much time as possible", Stearns told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I tap on the ball when I see Kante coming and I don't think much of it".
Chelsea were 1-0 up at half-time after Belgian star Eden Hazard scored a goal in the 25th minute.
The Blues striker also passed Kovacic on the ground, then ran around the midfield and into Liverpool's half.
Kovacic went on to score in the midfield.
He then gave Hazard a nice shot in the box at the Liverpool defensive end.
Hazard ran out the defense and delivered the goal with a left foot shot into the far post net.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage at the Stadio San Paolo in Naples, Italy, on Wednesday at 3pm.
Chelsea will face Videotron in the UEFA Europa League in London on Thursday at 3pm.
The death toll from the Indonesian tsunami rises to 832
The death toll from the Indonesian earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's disaster management agency said Sunday morning.
Many people are reportedly trapped in the rubble of buildings that collapsed in the 7.5 magnitude quake, which struck on Friday and caused a 20-foot high landslide, said agency spokesman Sotopo Puro Nugroho at a symposium.
The city of Palo, home to 380,000 people, is filled with the ruins of destroyed buildings.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man suspected of killing a woman in Suryakha
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead Merseyside.
The body of a 44-year-old woman who was stabbed to death was found at 7:55 a.m. today in Grayson Moose on John Street, a 32-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging the public to report any sightings or reports.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said: 'The investigation is in its early stages but I am asking anyone in the John Street neighbourhood of Birkenhead who sees or hears anything suspicious to contact us.
I am asking everyone, especially taxi drivers, who may have footage captured on the dash cameras, to contact us as they may have information that is critical to our investigation.'
A police spokesman confirmed that the victim was a resident of Birkenhead and her body was found inside a house.
This afternoon, friends who thought the woman was familiar to them arrived at the scene and asked about where the woman's body was found this morning.
An investigation is underway and police say they are trying to inform the woman's relatives.
When a taxi driver in Grayson Mews tried to enter his flat, police told him that no one was allowed to enter or leave the building.
He was shocked to hear about the incident.
Residents of the building are being told that it will take several more hours for them to be allowed inside.
A police officer was heard telling a man that the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman appeared at the scene, crying.
He was saying that it was a sad business.
At 2 pm, two police vans were inside the barricades and another one was outside the barricades.
Inside the barricades, a group of police officers were monitoring the blocks of flats.
Anyone with any information is requested to send a direct message to @MerPolCC or call 101 or call CrimeStoppers anonymously on 0800 555 11 with the date of 30 September, log 247.
Cromwell's statue in Parliament is the latest victim of a debate over "rewriting history".
The removal of the statue will be poetic justice after the Taliban's destruction of many cultural and religious monuments in England at the hands of its fanatical followers.
But the Cromwell Society has described Mr Crick's suggestion as "ill-advised" and "an attempt to rewrite history".
The president of the Cromwell Society, John Goldsmith, said: "In the current debate over the removal of the statue, it was inevitable that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster would become the target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was not ordered or carried out by Cromwell.
The statue of the false Cromwell will be scrapped in the works of his predecessor Thomas in the previous century.
The extraordinary statue of Cromwell by Sir William Hammond Thornycroft is a 19th-century landmark and part of a historical character that many people consider worthy of celebration.
Mr Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Many people think of Cromwell as the protector of Parliament in the face of external pressure, in his case, against the pressure of monarchy, which is now the opinion of few but was the opinion of many in the 19th century.
But whether this is a completely accurate representation of the time is part of an ongoing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflicts of the mid-17th century shaped the subsequent development of our nation, and Cromwell is a familiar figure who represented one side of this division.
His achievements as Lord Protector are worthy of celebration and remembrance".
The killer pig slaughtered the Chinese farmer
According to local media reports, a pig attacked and killed a farmer in a market in southwest China.
The man, identified only by his surname Yuan, was found with a severed artery and blood on his face near a pig barn in the Liupanshui market in southern China's Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to vaccinate pigs on a pig farm in Shining, Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He reportedly came to the market with his brother Fupato from the nearby Yunnan province on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs.
The next morning, his brother Fupato finds him dead and sees that the door to a pigsty next door is open.
He said that in the stable there was a large male pig with blood on his face.
A forensic examination confirmed that the 550-pound pig attacked and killed the farmer, the report said.
"My uncle's legs were both bloody and bruised", said Fupato, who was identified by his surname as Wu, as quoted by Guiyang Evening News.
Security camera footage showed Yuan entering the market to feed his pigs at 4:40 am on Thursday.
Her body was found about an hour later.
The pig that killed the man is not the man or his brother.
A market manager told Evening News that police were gathering ammunition at the scene and the pig was being held in isolation so it could not attack anyone else.
Yuan's family and market authorities are in talks to determine the amount of compensation for his death.
Although rare, pig attacks on humans have occurred before.
In 2016, a Massachusetts woman and her husband were attacked by a pig on their farm, seriously injuring the man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig named Exxon kept a Welsh farmer trapped in his tractor until his wife came along and scared the pig away.
After eating a pig from an Oregon farmer in 2012, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that pigs are not normally aggressive but can act as "blood-tasting triggers".
"They are only committing evil.
They're small bites, very curious creatures... but they don't try to hurt anyone.
But you have to understand them enough", he said.
Remnants of Hurricane Rosa will cause heavy rainfall across the southwestern United States
According to forecasts, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it flows over the cooler waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
However, in the coming days, the roses will cause heavy rains that will cause flooding in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rosa was a Category 1 hurricane at 5 a.m. eastern time Sunday, moving at 85 mph, and was located 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosario's supposed to go north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a system in the Pacific Ocean is beginning to take shape and is rushing eastward toward the U.S. West Coast. Rosa will hit the Baja California peninsula as a seasonal storm on Monday, pushing deep tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Due to the rosary, up to 10 inches of rain will fall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Deep tropical humidity will then join the system, which will cause heavy rainfall across the southern hemisphere over the coming days.
Locally, flash flooding or flash flooding due to rainfall of 1 to 4 inches will cause hazardous flooding, debris flows and possible landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity can cause rainfall of 2 to 3 inches per hour in various places, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Rainfall of 2 to 4 inches is expected in parts of the southwest, especially in most areas of Arizona.
The scattered speed of tropical rainfall is likely to cause flash flooding and rapid deterioration of the situation.
It would be foolish to walk out into the desert in the face of the threat of tropical rain.
Heavy rainfall could turn the canyons into dangerous rivers and thunderstorms could lead to strong wind currents with dust.
The system will cause locally heavy rainfall in several parts of the coastal region of Southern California.
Rainfall can be as much as half an inch, which can cause small debris streams on the streets.
This will be the first rainfall of the rainy season in the region.
Some scattered tropical rainfall is expected in Arizona from Sunday night and Monday morning, before picking up and spreading across the region from Monday night to Tuesday.
The heavy rains will reach the Four Corners on Tuesday and continue until Wednesday.
Several extreme temperature changes can be seen in various parts of the US in October as the Arctic cools, but the tropical temperatures are still quite warm.
This can sometimes lead to dramatic temperature changes over short distances.
A good example of the dramatic change in temperature was seen in the central United States on Sunday.
Temperature differences of about 20 degrees were observed between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
The remaining summer heat will try to rise and spread again in the coming days.
Most of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start to October, with temperatures in the 80s from the southern plains to the northeast.
New York City could see temperatures reach 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the average.
Our long-term weather forecast suggests that temperatures in the eastern United States are likely to be above average for the first half of October.
Brett Cavan's hearing was watched by over 20 million people.
Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and alleged sexual assault allegations against her by Christine Blazy Ford, which allegedly took place in the 1980s, were watched by more than 20 million viewers on six television networks on Thursday.
Meanwhile, the political row continues, with broadcasters suspending regular shows due to the last-minute surprise of Friday: a deal made by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake that would give the FBI a week to investigate the allegations.
Ford told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% sure that Kavanagh touched her body while drunk at a high school party and tried to unbutton her clothes.
Kavanagh said in an emotional testimony that he was 100% sure that the incident did not happen.
It is likely that more than 20.4 million people listed in the Nielsen report watched Friday's activity.
The company was averaging viewership for CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Other networks, which broadcast the program, did not have viewership numbers available at the same time, including PBS, C-SPAN, and Fox Business Network.
And Nielsen usually has problems with the number of people sitting in the office.
The audience of the event was the same as the football play-offs or the Academy Awards.
Fox News, whose opinion show hosts strongly supported Kavanagh's nomination, attracted the most viewership of any network broadcasting the all-day hearing with an average of 5.69 million, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS was watched by 3.1 million, NBC by 2.94 million, MSNBC by 2.89 million and CNN by 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
There was little interest after the hearing.
Flake was the centerpiece of today's drama.
After the moderate Republican's office made a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, he was caught on CNN and CBS cameras Friday morning as he climbed into the elevator to reach the Judiciary Committee hearing and protesters shouted at him.
He stood with his head down for several minutes in the face of the protesters' insults, which were broadcast live by CNN.
"I'm standing right in front of you", said one woman.
"Do you think Kavanagh is telling the truth to the country?
She's told, "You have power, when many women are helpless".
Flake said his office issued a statement and said before the elevator closed that he had more to say at the committee hearing.
Later, when the Judiciary Committee voted to advance Kavanaugh's nomination to a full Senate vote, all of the cable and broadcast networks broadcast live.
But Flake said he would vote on the condition that the FBI investigate the charges against the nominee next week, which had been requested by minority Democrats.
Flake's agreement was partially influenced by his talks with his close friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coon.
After talking to Coon, Flake talked to a few other senators and came to his conclusion.
Flake's decision was a shock, because it was clear that Republicans had no vote to approve Cavanaugh except for an investigation.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accuses critics of playing politics on Brexit
In an interview with the Sunday Times, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing "political games" with Britain's future and ignoring the nation's interests.
On 29 September 2018, British Prime Minister Theresa May attended the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham, UK.
In another interview published alongside his interview on the front page of the newspaper, his former foreign minister Boris Johnson continued to criticize May's so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the UK and EU's proposal to collect each other's revenue was "completely absurd".
Police arrested Dayton Simpson, suspected in the death of LSU player
Police arrested a suspect in the shooting death of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Sims.
Dayton Simpson, 20, was arrested and jailed for second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released video of the fight between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police recovered the glasses from the scene and said Simpson's DNA was found in the glasses, CBS affiliate WAFB reported.
After questioning Simpson, police say he confessed to shooting Wade to death.
According to The Advocate, his bail has been set at US$350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday citing gunshot wounds to the head and neck as the cause of death.
The department is credited with assisting the Louisiana State Police Fugitive apprehension task force, the State Police Crime Lab, Southern University Police and area residents in the investigation that led to the arrest of the fugitive.
LSU athletic director Joe Aleva thanked the area's law enforcement for its "tireless efforts and pursuit of justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-6 forward grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father played basketball for Wayne and LSU.
Last season, he averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game.
LSU basketball coach Will Wade said Friday morning that the team was "deeply saddened and devastated" by Wade's death.
"It's always a concern", said Wade.
Volcanic eruptions in Mexico City
Fossil deposits from the Popocatepetl volcano have reached the southern part of Mexico's capital.
The National Disaster Management Center on Saturday warned Mexican citizens to stay away from the volcano after the volcano's facial activity increased and gas and vapour emissions reached 183 on a 24-hour scale.
The center was monitoring a series of thunder and tremors.
Images posted on social media showed the car's windshields being engulfed in flames in areas such as Mexico City's Jochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in volcanic activity since a September 2017 7.1 magnitude earthquake that rocked Mexico, located just 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the capital.
The volcano, known as Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Police clashes with Catalan separatists ahead of the anniversary of the independence vote
Six people were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday in clashes between right-wing police and pro-independence protesters as they joined opposition protesters to celebrate the first anniversary of the vote, which sparked public controversy.
A group of masked separatists threw eggs, paint powder and other items at them in the face of police interference, creating a black cloud on the streets that are usually crowded with tourists.
Later in the day, there was a fight that was stopped by police using batons.
For hours, the liberals chanted "I will not forget, I will not forgive", and the protesters faced the unity supporters who chanted "Long live Spain".
14 people were treated for minor injuries due to the protests, local media reported.
Tensions have been building in the independence-minded region since Madrid declared the October 1 referendum, celebrated by separatist Catalans, illegal.
The majority of voters voted for independence, although the turnout was low as the majority of the anti-secession public boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, around 1,000 people were killed in deadly clashes with police last year as a result of voter suppression during the region's general election.
Freedomists were on the streets all night on Friday to stop the demonstration against the National Police.
The protesters continued their activities but were forced to take to the streets.
Narcisse Termis, 68, an electrical worker who participated in the separatist protests with his wife, said he was no longer optimistic about Catalonia's independence.
"Last year was one of the best times of our lives.
I saw my parents tears in their eyes for the opportunity to vote, but now we are stuck", he said.
Despite achieving a significant but narrow victory in the provincial elections last December, Catalan pro-independence parties have struggled to maintain their momentum with many of their well-known leaders awaiting arbitrary deportation or detention for their organisation's role in the referendum and subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who records the protest in support of the police on his phone, says that politicians from both sides caused the riots.
He added, "The unrest is intensifying day by day".
Oriol Junqueras, one of the Catalan leaders not in pre-trial detention on Saturday, announced late last year that he would contest the European Parliament elections next year.
He said that "the best way to prevent the suppression and repression of democratic values by the Spanish government is to stand as a candidate in the European elections".
LONDON: Man arrested after car crashed into house.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after being repeatedly hit by a car in a house in Londonderry.
The incident occurred at 19:30 Bangladesh time on Thursday in Ballinagar Crescent.
Deputy Inspector Bob Blimings says the gates and the building were damaged.
At some point, he'll probably cross-drop and aim the car.
Livingston win 1-0 against Rangers on a Manger goal.
Dolly Menger scored the first goal for Livingston to secure the win.
The promotion of Livingston Rangers stunned Steven Gerrard, giving him his second defeat in 18 games as Ebrooks manager.
Dolly Menger's goal was the difference as Gary Holt's team tied with the Hibernians for the second goal.
This left Gerrard's side without a win in the Premiership this season and they will face top-flight Hearts on Sunday, who are eight points ahead of them.
Before that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, who have already extended their run of undefeated in the division to six games, have yet to taste defeat under head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month.
Livingston missed several chances against their unlikely opponents.
The Holt team should have been ahead long before they scored, as their offensive attitude caused all sorts of problems for the Rangers!
Scott Robinson continued with the defense but failed to make his effort pay off, while Alan Lithgow could only drive his effort wide after sliding across to meet Craig Halkett's head.
The hosts were letting the Rangers play in front of them, knowing that guests could be in trouble on the set.
And that strategy was the key to the goal.
Rangers conceded a free-kick and opened the scoring for Livingston. Declan Gallagher and Robinson teamed up to set up Menga, who scored from the centre of the box in a touchdown.
At this stage, Rangers were dominating the ball but they were seeing the defense of the hosts as a weakness and goalkeeper Liam Kelly spent most of the time in the bullpen.
This trend continued in the second half, although Alfredo Morelos blocked a shot from Kelly.
Scott Pittman was beaten at the feet of Rangers goalkeeper Alan McGregor and won another set piece for Livingston from Lythgoe Wide.
Crosses were constantly coming to the Livingston box and were also constantly being cleared, although two penalty claims - one for alternate Glenn Middleton after a challenge by Hallett and one for handball - were dismissed.
The incredible achievement of Livingston.
The BBC Scotland's Laundry at the Tony MacArthur Arena in Alasdair
A remarkable performance and result for Livingston.
For one person, they were great, continuing to exceed everyone's expectations at their own upward pace.
Their style of play and players have changed little since their return to the top flight, but the credit goes to Holt for the way he has brought the team together since his arrival.
He had many, many heroes.
Captain Halcett was exceptional, building a well-organized defense, and keeping Mango Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on the loose at all times.
Though the Rangers were under-motivated.
They're not as good as they were under Gerard.
They lacked the final ball - only once did they open the hosts - and it's a warning for Rangers, who are now in the middle table.
Erdogan received a mixed reception in Cologne
The situation was very gratifying when the leaders of Turkey and Germany met in Berlin on Saturday for Brexit.
It is the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which is aimed at repairing relations between NATO allies.
They discussed human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's EU accession.
Erdogan then made his way to Cologne to inaugurate a massive new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
Police have put up security to prevent 25,000 people from gathering in front of the mosque, but many supporters have come to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters - many of them Kurds - voiced their condemnation of both Erdogan's policies and the decision to welcome him to Germany.
This conflict demonstration is proof that a visitor is hailed as a hero by the German Turks and condemned as a dictator by others.
Road accident in Deptford: bicyclist killed in collision with car
A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car in London.
The accident occurred at around 10:00 local time, near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, south-east of the city.
The driver stopped the car and the cyclist was given first aid, but the man died at the scene.
The accident happened months after another bicycle accident on Childs Street, which is located about a mile from the scene of Saturday's accident.
Metropolitan Police said officials were working to identify the man and notify his next of kin.
The road has been blocked and buses have been barricaded and drivers have been advised to avoid the area.
Long Latrine Prison: Six officers injured in riot.
Six prison officers were injured in a riot at the high-security men's prison, the prison office said.
Around 9:30am on Sunday, chaos broke out at the HMP Long Lyrinth in Worcestershire and is ongoing.
Tornado officers, specialists in dealing with disorder, have been brought in, including eight prisoners who are part of a branch.
Officers were treated for facial injuries at the scene.
A Prison Service spokesperson said: "Specially trained prison staff have been deployed to deal with an ongoing incident at HMP Long Latrine.
Six crew members were treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and it is clear that the guilty will be brought under the law and they will spend longer time behind bars".
HMP Long Latte has over 500 inmates, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals.
In June it was reported that the prison administrator had been hospitalized after being attacked by a prisoner.
And in October last year, Wright officers were called to the jail to deal with a serious riot where staff were attacked with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City with sudden flooding (although drought-prone areas may benefit).
Tropical low pressure is rare to hit Arizona, but that's exactly what seems to happen early next week as Hurricane Rosa rattles its remaining strength across the southwest desert with the risk of flash flooding.
The National Weather Service has already issued flash flood watches for the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City, including southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah in western Arizona for Monday and Tuesday.
Roza is expected to pass directly over Phoenix on Tuesday and arrive with rain by late Monday.
Phoenix's National Weather Service tweeted that only "ten tropical cyclones have maintained tropical storm or low pressure status within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950!"
Katrina (1967) which was a hurricane within 40 miles of the A-Z border. "
The latest National Hurricane Center model predicts rainfall of 2 to 4 inches, with isolated amounts of up to 6 inches in the Mogollon Rim of Arizona.
Other areas of the southwest desert including the Central Rockies and Great Basin are expected to experience rainfall of roughly 1 to 2 inches, with isolated amounts of up to 4 inches.
The rainfall of the fast can be a blessing for those who are not at risk of flooding as areas are drought-stricken
While flooding is a serious concern, the rainfall is likely to be somewhat beneficial as the southwest is currently experiencing drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, more than 40 percent of Arizona is facing extreme drought, the second highest category, according to Weather.com.
First, the path of Hurricane Rosa will cause landslides across the Baja California Peninsula in Mexico.
Rosa, which is still a powerful hurricane, reached a peak of 85 miles per hour on Sunday morning, moving 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and 12 miles per hour north.
The storm is strongly predicted to face cold waters in the Pacific.
So, a tropical storm is expected to hit Mexico Monday afternoon or evening.
Heavy rainfall is expected across parts of Mexico, creating a significant risk of flooding.
"Up to 10 inches of rainfall is expected in northwestern Sonora from Baja California".
The storm will then travel north across Mexico as tropical low pressure before reaching the Arizona border early Tuesday morning and it will enter southern Utah through Arizona on Tuesday night.
"The main threat from the storm or its remnants is expected to be very heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwest desert of the United States, according to the National Hurricane Center.
The rainfall could lead to deadly flash floods and destructive flows in the desert and landslides in the mountains.
Midsomer Norton attack: four attempted murderers arrested
Three teenagers and a 20-year-old man have been arrested in Somerset for attempted murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed.
The teenager was found injured at around 4pm Bangladesh time on Saturday in Excelsior Terrace, Midsomer Norton.
He was taken to hospital where he is now in "stable" condition.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old were arrested in the Radstock area, Avon and Somerset Police said.
Officers are asking anyone who may have mobile phone footage to come forward.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been a victim of the Democratic Party's "cruelty, anger"
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote to reject the Democratic Party's brutal and outrageous tactics", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said Kavanagh has been a victim of the Democratic Party's "cruelty, anger" throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, strongly and passionately denying Christine Blasey Ford's allegations that she was sexually abused by him as a teenager decades ago.
Ford also testified at the hearing on her complaint.
The president said Saturday that "the American people saw the extraordinary and the virtues and the courage of Kavanaugh that day".
Addressing West Virginia supporters, he said a vote for Jazz Cavanaugh would be a vote to protect one of the most successful legal personalities of our time, a lawyer with a sterling record of public service.
Speaking of the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president vaguely acknowledged Kavanaugh's nomination.
"We are just five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetime.
I am not participating, but I am participating", he said.
"That's why I always strive to fight for great candidates".
Trump argued that Democrats are on a "prevention and deterrence" mission.
The first Senate major presidential vote on Kavanagh's nomination is not expected until Friday, a senior aide to the GOP leadership told CNN.
The Indonesian earthquake, tsunami, and death toll are increasing.
At least 384 people have died and many more have been washed away by a massive wave that hit the beaches of the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities said on Saturday.
Thousands of people gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palo on Friday when a six-meter (18-foot) high wave broke ashore in the evening, pushing many to their deaths and destroying everything in their path".
The tsunami comes after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"People were still doing their activities on the beaches yesterday when the tsunami threat was felt and those who could not immediately run and became victims", said Sutopo Puro Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency BNPB, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami did not come by itself, it dragged cars, logs, houses, it hit everything on the ground", Nugroho added, noting that the tsunami traveled at 800 kilometers (497 miles) per hour in the open ocean before hitting the shore.
Some climbed trees to survive the tsunami, and they survived.
About 16,700 people have been evacuated in 24 centres in Paluru.
Aerial images released by the disaster agency showed many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges overturned and collapsed, and a mosque submerged.
Aftershocks continued to swarm the coastal city on Saturday.
The series of earthquakes were felt in an area with 2.4 million people.
Indonesia's Agency for the Assessment and Application (BPPT) said in a statement that the energy released by Friday's massive earthquake was nearly 200 times the power of the World War II atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima.
The geographical location of the city, which is at the end of a long, narrow bay, may increase the size of the tsunami.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive", saying that thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels were destroyed.
Some bodies were found trapped under the rubble of the collapsed building, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 were missing.
The death toll and damage could be higher in Dangala, a region 300 kilometers (190 miles) north of Palo on the coastline near the epicenter, Nugroho said.
The communications system was "completely crippled without any information", Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that workers and volunteers are heading to the affected areas.
"It's already a tragedy but it could be worse.
The agency was widely criticized on Saturday for not reporting the tsunami hit Palouse, although officials said the waves came as the warning was issued.
Footage of the quake shared on social media showed a man on the top floor of the building shouting to people in the street below, sounding a tsunami warning.
Within minutes, a wall of water rushed ashore and washed away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to verify the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages that disrupted communications around Pallu and hampered the authorities' rescue efforts.
The military has begun sending cargo planes in support of Jakarta and other cities, authorities said, adding that rescuers are now in dire need of food and other basic essentials.
The city's airport has been reopened for relief efforts only and will remain closed to the public until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the Palus shelters on Sunday.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has risen to over 800.
It's too bad.
According to Mr. Doseb, as the World Organization staff were safely travelling from Donggala to the city of Palo, where the staff were sheltering in their office yard, they saw images of destruction on the way.
Doseba added that they saw many houses destroyed.
It's a shame.
Even when aid teams started disaster relief operations, some complained that foreign aid workers were being skillfully obstructed from reaching Pallu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funding, food supplies and personnel can only come when a disaster site is declared a national disaster area.
But it hasn't been announced yet.
Auliya Ariani, a spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross, said: "This is still a provincial disaster.
Once the government says yes, it is a national disaster, then we can start international aid but we have not yet made any announcement.
On the second night after the tsunami hit in Palouse on Friday, friends and family of the missing are waiting for a miracle that will bring hope to their path after a brutal chapter of natural disaster.
A little boy was taken from the nursery on Saturday.
On Sunday, rescuers rescued a woman who had been lying next to her mother's body for two days after she was hit by a rock.
Indonesian national paraglider coach Jendon Subandono trained two Asian Games paragliders who are now missing, which happened in Indonesia earlier this month.
Mr. Mendagi also mentioned that those trapped at the Roya Roya Hotel were his students.
He also said that as a pioneer in paragliding, I have a responsibility to my own passion.
Mr. Jendon recalled how the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse spread to the paragliding community hours later, he backed off and shared it via WhatsApp to the Palo contestants who were attending a beach festival.
Although his message was not read.
He said, "That means the message was not sent".
Thieves stole $26,750 while refilling the ATM machine in Newport, Va.
A Newport Police Department press release said thieves stole $26,750 on Friday morning while Brink's employees were depositing money at the ATM.
The driver was emptying his ATM at the entertainment complex and was ready to pay more, Detective Dennis McCarthy said at a news conference.
While he was working, another Brink's worker ran behind him and escaped with a bag full of money that was ready to be handed over.
According to news reports, witnesses saw many suspects flee, but police have not yet specified the number of people involved.
If anyone can identify these individuals they are asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
This rapper changed his name to Ye.
Rapper Kane West is changing his name to Yee.
Announcing the change, he tweeted on Saturday: "Officially known as Kane West".
West, 41, was also known as Ye for quite some time and used that name as his nickname.
The name change came before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she was expected to unveil her new album Yandy.
The producer of the show said he was replacing singer Ariana Grande, who cancelled the show for "emotional reasons".
West has previously said that the word has religious significance to him, as well as being an abbreviation of his current professional name.
West said earlier this year when discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy, "I believe that 'Ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you'".
So I'm you, I'm us, this is us.
Cain is told that the "yes" is the only person, reflecting our good, our bad, our confusion, everything.
This album is more about who we are".
He is one of several famous rappers who have changed their names.
Sean Combs is variously known as Puff Daddy, PDD or DD, but this year he announced Love and the Brothers Love as his preferred names.
A former associate of West's, J-G, has worked with O Hyphen, without Hyphen and with Capital.
Mexico's AMLO has also vowed not to use military force against civilians.
Mexico's elected president Andres Manuel Lopez has vowed not to use force against civilians on the 50th anniversary of the bloody massacre of students.
Lopez Abrador vowed Saturday in Tlatelolco Plaza that he will not use military force to oppress the people of Mexico.
On October 2, 1968, soldiers opened fire on a peaceful protest that killed 300 people as leftist student movements were building their foothold in Latin America.
Lopez Abrador apologizes to young Mexicans for monthly tuition and helping build more public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are attracting young people to gangs.
The United States should double its funding for artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its spending on research in this area, said AI researcher and investor Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
This quote comes from various parts of the government, in the United States, announcing that the United States has a formal strategic shortfall in artificial intelligence.
China already launched its new plan last year: its goal to be the number one AI innovator by 2030.
Li added, "Doubling the budget for AI research will be a good start where most countries are far behind and we are looking for the next step in advancing AI".
Double funding could double the chances of the US acquiring the next big AI, Lee said in an interview with CNBC this week.
Li, whose book "All Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order" was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, CEO of SinoVenture, which invested in Face++, one of China's leading artificial intelligence companies.
In the 1980s, Carnegie worked on an artificial intelligence system at Mellon University that beat the highest-ranked American player, and in the fall he was an executive at Microsoft Research and president of Google's China branch.
Lee acknowledged previous U.S. government technology competitions such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to determine the next steps.
Researchers in the United States often have to work hard to win government grants, Lee said.
China is not removing academic leaders; it is corporate ones who are paying", Li said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have recruited luminaries from universities to work on artificial intelligence in recent years.
Lee said changes to immigration policy could help further scale up U.S. AI efforts.
"I think the green card should be offered automatically to PhDs in artificial intelligence", he said.
China's State Council issued its next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to people from academic institutions such as the National Science Foundation and other government agencies, spending money on US researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is low, Li said.
Earlier this year the US Department of Defense established a joint artificial intelligence center, involving industry and academic partners, and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DRPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
As NSF, it currently invests over $100 million per year in AI research.
Meanwhile, the US law that sought to create a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not seen progress in months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on whether to change the country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum on whether to change its name to "Republic of North Macedonia", a move that would resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece that blocked its bid for EU and NATO membership.
Greece, which has a province called Macedonia, the name of its northern neighbor represents a claim to its territory and vetoed NATO and EU accession.
The two governments reached an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents believe that the change will undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic majority population.
President Georgy Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum and expressed doubts that the boycott campaign would meet the minimum 50 percent required for a referendum to be valid.
The question on the ballot was: "Are you for NATO and EU membership with the recognition of the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have argued for a price to pay for Macedonia, one of the countries that emerged from the collapse of Yugoslavia, to join the European Union and NATO.
"I have come today to vote for the future of the country, for the young people in Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union because it means a safe life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
While not legally binding, enough members of parliament have said they will follow the results of the vote through decision-making.
A two-thirds majority in parliament is required for the name change.
The State Election Commission said that no irregularities were reported as of 1pm.
However, turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% in the 2016 National Assembly elections, when 66% of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I came to vote because of my children, we have a place in Europe", said Josie Tenevsky, a voter in the capital Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaiev, his wife Zorica and his son Dusko voted in favour of a referendum in Macedonia to change the country's name, which will pave the way for Macedonia's accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumnica on September 30, 2018.
In front of the parliament in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavadarkov was preparing a small stage and pulling chairs in front of the tents set up for those who would boycott the referendum.
"We are in favor of NATO and the European Union, but we want to join with our heads up, not through the service door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want to take us as Macedonia, we can go to others like China and Russia and be part of the Euro-Asia alliance".
Prime Minister Zaev said NATO membership will bring much needed investment to Macedonia, where the unemployment rate is over 20 percent.
"I believe the overwhelming majority will be in favour because more than 80 percent of our citizens are in favour of the European Union and NATO", Zaev said after casting his ballot.
He said that a "yes" result would be our "future guarantee".
A poll released by the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research on Monday said that 30 to 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, below the turnout required for a turn out.
Another poll conducted by Telma TV in Macedonia found 57 percent of respondents planning to vote on Sunday.
Of those, 70 percent said they would vote yes.
The referendum needs more than 50% of the vote to succeed.
The failure of the referendum would represent the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took power in May last year.
Manchester City's Sergio Aguero is going into the Brighton defence for a goal
Sergio Aguero and Rahim Sterling have knocked out Brighton defence in a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero made his score extra easy to see in the 65th minute.
The Argentine striker received a pass in midfield at the beginning of the sequence.
He ran through three Brighton defenders before heading out onto the open field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He turned a defender before passing several others on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he threw a pass to the left, which found Sterling.
The English forward used his first touch in the box to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right boot to hit the right side of the net, beating Brighton defender Matthew Ryan.
"Aguero is struggling with some problems in his legs", city manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
"We talked about his game for 55 minutes, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored a goal at that moment".
However, it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the initial advantage of the Premier League battle.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero got the ball deep in the Brighton area in that game.
He sent the ball to Leroy Sen through a beautiful pass on the left side.
Sen took a few touches before taking Sterling to the far post.
The Sky Blues forward tapped the ball into the net just before it crossed the line.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55pm on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play in the game between Spoiler and the Rockies.
There wasn't much reason to force the Nationals to start over after they were eliminated from playoff contention.
But the ever-competitive Scherzer is hoping to mount against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only if the playoff effect is in favor of the Rockies, who have a one-game lead over the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West.
The Rockies earned at least a wild card berth with a 5-2 win over the Nationals on Friday night, but they are still looking to secure their first division title.
"Even though we're not playing for anything, at least we can get a foot in the door with the Denver crowd knowing that the ABA and the other team will probably play at the highest level of any points I've faced this year.
Why wouldn't I want to compete?"
The Nationals have yet to announce a starter for Sunday, but are rumoured to be able to pitch Scherzer in such a situation.
Scherzer, who will be starting his 34th season, threw a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitch in his normal rest on Sunday.
Washington is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump rally in West Virginia
Speaking of the importance of Republican voting in the midterm elections, the president made a sharp reference to the situation surrounding his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
"Everything we have done is at stake in November.
Five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lifetimes.
It's a big, big -- I'm not running, but I'm really running, so I'm all over the place fighting for great candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You see this terrible, terrible radical group of Democrats, you're seeing it happening right now.
And they are determined to take back power by any means necessary, you see this degradation, this cruelty.
It doesn't matter who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, they just want power and control, we won't give it to them".
He said the Democrats are on a mission of "prevention and deterrence".
"And you've seen it over the last four days", he said, calling Democrats "angry and mean and ugly and untrustworthy".
He named Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which received a loud tickle from the audience.
"Do you remember his answer?
Did you leak the documents?
Ah, ah, what.
No, no, I'm waiting -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen".
Labour is no longer a liberal organisation.
People who say what they think are not tolerated here.
When the Momentum workers of my party in the area voted me guilty, it was no surprise.
Because your outspokenness is not welcome here - I was the last Labour MP on the list to tell you.
My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan was treated similarly because she was strongly anti-Semitic.
In my case, I was found guilty of disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on Europe and national security, and on similar issues, Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
The notice for Friday's Nottingham East Labour meeting said "we want to make the meetings inclusive and productive".
In my eight years as a local Labour MP, this is the first time that a Friday night GC meeting has been exactly like this.
But sadly, today, that is not the tone of that meeting and the promise of "kind, gentle" politics has long been forgotten, if it ever really began.
It has increasingly become apparent that dissent is not tolerated in the Labour Party and that each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
It started soon after Jeremy became the leader, with colleagues who I thought shared the same political views starting to expect me to take a U-turn and take a position that I would not have agreed to under any circumstances - be it national security or the EU single market.
Whenever I speak in public and it doesn't matter what I say - there are social media scandals calling for me to be removed, criticism of the politics of the Centre, and being told that I shouldn't be in the Labour Party.
And it's not just my experience.
In fact, I know I am luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments directed at me are also political.
I am amazed at the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face a storm of gender discrimination or racist abuse every day but never feel ashamed.
The most disappointing aspect of this era of politics is how the scandal of gossip has become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn last week claimed that the Labour Party should build a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer a liberal organization and every "no-confidence" vote or change in election rules narrows the party.
Over the last two years, I've been told by a lot of people to keep my head down, not be so loud, and that I'd be "okay".
But I didn't come to politics to do that.
When I joined Labour as a schoolboy 32 years ago, we were roused by the Thatcher government's neglect that literally destroyed our vast school classrooms, I tried to provide essential public services to those who needed them most - whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my politics, including the last election.
No one in Nottingham East was in any way confused about my policy stance and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
To those who campaigned on Friday, I will only say that I cannot understand the desire to waste my time and energy in showing allegiance to the leader of the Labour Party when the country is heading towards a Brexit that will hurt families, businesses and our public services.
But I don't really have a message for the Nottingham Momentum, it's for my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you, and I promise that no threat of disorder or political activism will stop me from doing what I believe is in the best interest of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the MP for Nottingham East
Ayer 38-17 Melrose: Rise to the top of undefeated Ayer
Two late attempts may have narrowed the gap to the final result, but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win the premiership match of today's exceptionally entertaining tenant.
They're now top of the table, the only undefeated team in the top 10.
In the end, it was their best defense, just as good as their ability to take advantage, that helped the hosts win and was a valid reason for coach Peter Murcie to be happy.
"We've been tested in every game so far and we're still undefeated, so I have to be happy".
Robin Christie of Melrose says: "I have to give credit to Ayer, they've exploited their potential better than we have".
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute attempt, converted by Frazier Climo, gave Ayr a lead, however, a yellow card from Scotland player Rory Hughes, who was sent off for the game by the Warriors, gave Melrose a majority and Jason Baggott an unsuccessful attempt.
Climo extended Eyre's lead with a penalty, just before, during halftime, he scored a solo goal to make it 17-5 at halftime.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's effort, converted by Bagot, reduced the gap to five points.
The game was then suspended for a long time due to a serious injury to Rudy Nutt, who was stretched and after the restart of the game, Ayer went further through the efforts of Stafford McDowall, who converted Climo.
Ayres acting captain Blair Macpherson then received a yellow card and again after a deadly spell of pressure, Melrose's Bruce Colvin tried to penalise Ayres' extra player.
Although the hosts returned just right, and when Struan Hutchinson saw a yellow card to face Climo without the ball, McPherson scored a touchdown from the penalty line out to lead the incoming mole.
Once again Climo converted, as Kyle Rowe kicked David Armstrong's box and sent out Flanker Gregor Henry on the fifth attempt from the home side.
Steel Game star is set for a new career in the restaurant industry
Steel Game star Ford Kieran has announced he is ready to enter the hospitality industry after being named director of a licensed restaurant company.

Both have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the show's last and it seems that Keiran is planning her life after CraigLang.
According to the official record list, he is the director of Adriftmorn Ltd.
The actor declined to comment on the matter, although Scottish Sun sources indicated that Keiranan was looking to get involved in Glasgow's "rich restaurant business".
'The sea is ours': landlocked Bolivia hopes court will reopen the path to the Pacific
The sailors are patrolling a rigged naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings fly an ocean-blue flag.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the docks are decorated with the motto: "The sea is ours".
It's a responsibility to recover".
All over landlocked Bolivia, memories of losing the 19th century to Chile in a bloody treasure conflict are still vivid, as is the desire to sail once more to the Pacific Ocean.
These hopes are probably the highest in decades, as Bolivia awaits the International Court of Justice's ruling on October 1 after five years of negotiations.
"Bolivia has that momentum, unity and calm spirit and of course we are looking forward to the outcome with a positive outlook", said Roberto Calzadilla, Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will see the ICJ ruling on the big screen across the country, hoping that the Hague Tribunal will back Bolivia's claim that - after decades of proper negotiations - Chile is obliged to negotiate a sovereign outlet to the sea for Bolivia.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president - who faces a controversial re-election bid next year - also has much to depend on Monday's ruling.
"We are very close to returning to the Pacific", he promised in late August.
However, some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to rule in favor of Bolivia - and if it does, it will change little.
The Netherlands-based UN agency does not have the authority to grant territory to Chile and has said it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The ICJ ruling, which comes just six months after the final arguments were heard, indicates that the case was "not complicated", said Chilean international law expert Paz Jarrete.
And it may have gone backwards in the last four years rather than pushing the cause of Bolivia forward.
"The access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration", Jarrett said.
Morales' anti-war speech has removed any remaining wishes from Chile, he said.
Bolivia and Chile may continue to talk until a certain point, but it will be very difficult to negotiate after that.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The Bolivian representative in The Hague, former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velázquez, rejected the court's decision as being unusually quick.
Monday will bring Bolivia "a tremendous opportunity for a new era in relations with Chile" and "an opportunity to end 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit", he said.
Calzadilla also denied that Morales - still one of Latin America's most popular presidents - was using the maritime issue as a political pillar.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific", he added.
"The verdict is a chance to see that we have to overcome the past".
North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not come until the United States is trusted.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation will not disarm nuclear weapons first if Washington cannot be trusted.
He was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
He urged the United States to honor the pledge it made during a summit of rival leaders in Singapore.
His comments come as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears on track to restart nuclear diplomacy with North Korea's Kim Jong-un after more than three months in Singapore.
Ri said it was a "pipe dream" that continued sanctions and US objections to the declaration of the end of the Korean War would tip North Korea.
Washington is wary that Pyongyang may agree to the declaration without first having to undertake a significant disarmament process.
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But there is widespread doubt that Pyongyang is serious about abandoning an arsenal, which the country may see as the only way to guarantee its security.
Pompeo also wants to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
Paris fashion shows unveil the latest line of huge headwear on a high street near you
If you want to increase your hat collection or block out the sun completely, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Brown unveiled a trend of oversized head gear for their SS19 collection at the runway that shocked the Paris Fashion Week style set.
This summer, a very unusual hat was teared up on Instagram, and these designers sent their eye-catching creations to Catwalk.
One of Valentino's creations was an over-the-top beige hat decorated with feather-like broad trunks that covered the heads of the models.
Other oversized accessories include an ornamental watermelon, a wizard's hat, even a pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Tom Brown also released a selection of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colored masks were similar to Hannibal Lecter in their lip-stitching and gruesome humor.
One creation resembles a full scuba diving gear with snorkels and goggles, the other looks like a melted ice cream cone.
And if you keep up the big fashion statement -- you're in luck.
Style watchers predict that giant bonnets could be heading to the high street near you.
The outsized hats are competing with La Bomba, a two-foot-wide straw hat that has been seen wearing everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult label behind the highly absurd hat spread across social media has sent Catwalk another big creation - a straw beach bag that is almost as big as a swimsuit model.
The burnt orange raffia bag, trimmed with raffia fringes and with a white leather handle on top, was one of the items in Jacquimes' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told Female: 'I'm expecting big hats and beach bags to hit the high street next summer - it's hard to ignore the demand for oversized accessories with the designer having made such an impact.'
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens.
Independent schools in Scotland have maintained a track record of academic excellence, and this continued with another outstanding test result in 2018, which is only reinforced by individual and collective success in sports, the arts, music and other community endeavours.
With over 30,000 students across Scotland, the schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best level of service to their students and parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, their chosen profession and their place as global citizens.
As an educational field that can design and implement a specific school curriculum, we see modern languages continue to be popular and preferred subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said: "If you speak to a person in a language that he understands, it goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, it goes to his heart".
It is a powerful reminder that if we want to build relationships and trust with people in other countries, we cannot rely on English alone.
From the results of the recent test this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league tables with the highest pass rates among the individual schools.
68% of students studying foreign languages have achieved higher grade A.
Data collected from 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72% of students achieved an upper grade in Mandarin, while 72% studied German, 69% studied French and 63% studied Spanish.
This demonstrates that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future.
Language is now, as a subject choice, held in the same way as the curriculum of independent schools and STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) elsewhere.
A 2014 UK Commission for Employment and Skills survey found that 17% of the reasons employers gave for struggling to fill vacancies were due to their lack of language skills.
So, more and more, language skills are becoming essential to prepare young people for their future careers.
These skills are needed in a globalized world for more potential job opportunities that require language.
Whatever career someone chooses, if they learn a second language, they will have real benefits in the future as they acquire their life-long skills.
Being able to communicate directly with people from abroad automatically puts a multilingual person ahead of the competition.
Yogv: A survey of more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013 found that 75% could not speak a foreign language fluently during a conversation, and French was the only language of the decade-long percentage, 15%.
That is why it is important for children today to invest in language learning.
Having multiple languages, especially in developing economies, will give children better opportunities to find meaningful employment.
Within Scotland, each school will be different in the languages they teach.
Several schools will focus more on classical modern languages, while looking towards 2020 it looks like others will be teaching the languages that are considered most important to the UK, such as Mandarin or Japanese.
Whatever your child's interests, there will always be a wide range of languages to choose from at the independent schools, with specialist teaching staff.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to providing a learning environment that will prepare children and equip them with the skills they need to succeed whatever the future may bring.
In the global business environment, it is undeniable that languages play a vital role in the future of a country, and this must be reflected in education.
Indeed, modern languages should be considered truly "international communication skills".
Independent schools will provide this choice, diversity and encouragement for young people in Scotland.
It has to be done.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron is making his debut for the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego.
The fans' wait to see LeBron James make his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers is almost over.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James will play Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
However, the number of minutes he will play is yet to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one and less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James will likely play limited minutes.
After practice earlier this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' six-game preseason schedule.
"I don't need a precision game to prepare me at this stage of my career", he said.
Trump during the West Virginia rally, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump is raising a campaign rally in Wheeling, West Virginia tonight.
This is the first of five scheduled rallies for Trump next week, including stops in friendly places including Tennessee and Mississippi.
With a confirmation vote in favor of his election to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court in recess, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans risk losing control of Congress after voting in November.
What time is Trump's rally in West Virginia tonight and how are you watching online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET tonight, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia rally live on YouTube below.
Trump is likely to speak this week at the hearing of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has been sparked by allegations of sexual misconduct with an expected Senate confirmation vote during an FBI investigation.
But the primary goal of the rallies' opening is to help Republicans gain some momentum in the run-up to the November election.
Thus, the Trump campaign says that the five rallies next week are aimed at boosting volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to maintain and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, Reuters reported.
"Congressional control is so important to his agenda that as we enter a busy campaign season the president will travel to as many states as possible", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.
Scheduled for the Wesbenko Arena in Wheeling, today's rally "could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and coverage from the Pittsburgh media", according to West Virginia Metro News.
Trump is visiting West Virginia for the second time since last month, a state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percent of the vote.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrissey, who is lagging in the polls, ahead of the election.
"It's not a good sign for Morrissey that the president should try to get him more involved in the election", said Simon Heather, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA show hunger to fight to keep hope alive in Sunday's singles
The Ryder Cup was needed on Saturday afternoon after three one-sided sessions.
The momentum pendulum swing is a completely new sporting concept but it's what the players really believe in, and it's the most in this kind of competition.
So where does Momentum say they are now?
"They had a six-point lead and now it's four, so I think we have a little bit of momentum now", Jordan Speith said as he walked for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with 12 games to go and four points to go.
As Speith said, the Americans feel they have some help on their way and they can be encouraged by a lot of things, especially the form of Speith and Justin Thomas who have played together all day and they both took three points from four.
Speith was deadly from start to finish and leading from the front.
The loud shouts of celebration intensified as he went through the round, when he and Thomas made the crucial four-point field goal to take the game by two points after scoring two.
The one he hit that won them the game in the 15th had the same kind of scream, which tells you a lot about how he believes the American team is not out of the woods.
"You have to really go deep and think about your match", said Speeth.
All these players have it now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players to score more points in the last two days than Speeth and Thomas are Francisco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the story of the Ryder Cup's indiscretions.
Europe's weird but adorable pair of four-to-four and can't make any mistakes.
"Mollywood" was the only duo that didn't shoot a bogie on Saturday afternoon, but they avoided bogie on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and Friday morning at the back nine.
That run, and the way their energy was flowing to and from this enthusiastic crowd, made it look like they were the losers on Sunday, and as the sun set at Le Golf National, there were no other potential popular players to seal a European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari.
It's better if they're both in different holes at the same time.
But the idea of European glory is premature.
Bobba Watson and Web Simpson had some problems for Foreball hero Sergio Garcia when they paired with Alex Naren.
The first nine dropped a bogey and two double Spaniards and the Swede into a hole from which they could never get out.
On Sunday, though, there's no one to get you out of your hole.
It is interesting to see the Forball and the ForSum up close because of the interaction between the pairing, the advice they give, the advice they don't give, and the strategy that can change instantly.
Europe have so far played relatively well as a team and took a significant lead on the final day, but this foursome session further proved that Team USA has a hunger for a fight that some, especially Stateside, suspected.
Europe take a 10-6 lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will take a healthy advantage of Saturday's foreball and foursome match on the final day of the Ryder Cup with a 10-6 lead against the United States.
The spirited pair Tommy Fleetwood and Francisco Molinari have now increased their tally to four points at Golf Nationals with two wins against the sluggish Tiger Woods.
Thomas Jorn's European side, bidding to regain the trophy lost to Hazeltine two years ago, won the series 3-1 by blowing out the flawed American side in the morning fours.
The U.S. won two matches and offered more resistance in the forums, but they could not fill the gap.
Jim Furyk's team needs eight points from 12 singles matches on Sunday to reclaim the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row and he and Molinari, together, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points from their first four matches after an exceptional weekend at Fleetwood.
Woods and Patrick Reed were crushed to the foreball and they then jailed a superb superbly to beat a losing Woods and American rookie Bryson DeCambiu even more hard by 5 and 4.
Woods, who pulled himself up in two matches on Saturday, has occasionally flown in with a storm of brilliance but now has lost 19 of his 29 games in foreball and forehand and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, taking a break for the morning foreball, returned to partnership with Forsam Henrik Stenson with a 2-1 defeat to Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koppker - world number one and number three.
On a lovely, windy day southwest of Paris, Europe was not on its own.
Three-time major winners Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won 2-1 strongly against Spain's John Ram and Ian Poulter in the foreball and came back to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 on the opening two holes in the forehand.
It is only the second time in Ryder Cup history that a team has come back from a four-point deficit in a single season, although as of now, the Furyk side only need a draw to regain the trophy.
After being second best for two days, however, Sunday's counter-attack looks set to overtake them.
North Korea says it will not unilaterally disarm without trust 'in any way'.
North Korea's foreign minister told the UN on Saturday that the existing sanctions are deepening mistrust in the United States and that there is no chance of the country unilaterally giving up its nuclear weapons in such a situation.
"North Korea took significant positive steps last year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear laboratory, and pledging not to increase nuclear technology and nuclear weapons proliferation", said Ri Yong Ho at the UN annual general meeting.
"But we haven't seen any similar reaction in the United States", he said.
"If there is no trust in the United States, we will have no confidence in our national security, and there is no way for us to unilaterally disarm in such a situation".
While Ri was describing North Korea's allegations against Washington's "armed" approach to nuclear disarmament as rewarding for North Korea's gradual steps, his remarks proved significant because he did not unilaterally dismiss nuclear disarmament as completely out of the question, as Pyongyang has done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement issued by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at the first summit between the US president and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim "pledged to work on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and when Trump guaranteed North Korea's security.
North Korea 1950-53 Seeks a formal end to the Korean War, but the United States says Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted calls for relaxing tough international sanctions on North Korea.
"The US has insisted on 'disarmament first' and has increasingly increased pressure through sanctions to achieve its objective, even protesting the 'declaration of the end of the war.'"
"The idea that restrictions can bring us down is a pipe dream for those who don't know about us.
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our distrust".
Ri did not comment on the plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president had raised at the UN earlier in the week.
Instead, the Minister pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months: "The issue of disarmament would not have been so stagnant if it had not been for the United States and South Korea".
Yet, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable to target the US mainland with North Korean rockets while "Mr. Evil President" Trump called Kim a suicidal "rocket man".
At the UN this year, Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage in taking steps to disarm, but said there was still much work to be done and that sanctions must remain in place until North Korea is disarmed.
Trump said on Wednesday that there is no time limit for this, saying, "If it takes two years, three years or five months - it doesn't matter".
China and Russia argued that Pyongyang should be rewarded for the action taken by the UN Security Council
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the Americans at the Security Council on Thursday that: "The Security Council sanctions must be effectively maintained until we realize fully final verified disarmament".
The Security Council unanimously extended sanctions on North Korea since 2006 to stop funding Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and then said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was not a good one.
He said when he left Pyongyang in July that some progress had been made, only hours before North Korea denounced him for "claiming like a fool"!
North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex at a meeting with Moon this month if the United States "takes appropriate action".
He said that the "relevant steps" Kim told him he was looking for were the security guarantees Trump had given to Singapore and the security guarantees he was moving towards normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students are taking a rest course.
This year, a new course from Harvard University is giving all its graduates a way to get more sleep to combat the growing culture of caffeinated night owls".
One educator has discovered that the world's top university students are often confused about the very basics of how to take care of themselves.
Charles Ciccilar, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at Brigham and Women's Hospital, created the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
She was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture about the impact of sleep deprivation on education.
"A girl came up to me and said, 'Why did you take so long to tell me this, even in my senior year?'
He said that no one had ever told him about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me -- 'he was telling the Telegraph.
The course, which was first launched this year, explains to students how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as how it is necessary to improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barrera, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health care division, said the university decided to launch the course after students were severely sleep deprived this week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interrelated tasks.
One section features a picture of a dorm room, where students will learn about the effects of caffeine and light by clicking on coffee cups, screens, trainers and books, and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, and realize the importance of a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants were told how long-term sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
A map of the campus with interactive icons, then encourages participants to think about their daily routines.
'We know it won't change student behavior immediately.
But we believe they have a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of choosing to smoke,' added Professor Ciccilar.
He said that the culture of pride in staying up all night is still present, adding that sleep deprivation is a growing problem due to modern technology and the increasing pressure on students.
Ensuring you get enough quality sleep should be a student's 'secret weapon' to fight stress, fatigue and anxiety, he says - even sleep deprivation makes the brain starved, leaving them constantly hungry.
Raymond Shaw, a 19-year-old California chemical and physical biology student who helped Professor Siegler design the course, also took a class during his freshman year at Harvard last year.
He said that the course opened his eyes and inspired him to do a campus-wide course.
In the next step, he hopes to encourage all postgraduate students to complete a study programme before joining a competitive institution.
Professor Ciccilar recommended that students should consider setting an alarm for when to go to bed as well as when to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of 'blue light' emitted by electronic screens and LED lights, which can destroy your circadian rhythms, leading to sleep problems.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers defeat the Shiites at the Manger Gollor Gerard.
Rangers lost another away game after Steven Gerrard's random team lost 1-0 to Livingston on Dolly Menger's goal.
The Ibrox side were looking for another win after a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's side gave Gerard his second defeat as manager in 18 games, which put him eight points clear of Leeds' premiership-toppers Hearts.
Menga was injured seven minutes before half-time but the desperate Rangers lineup never got a chance to match them.
Rangers are down to sixth, Livingston are up to third, and have overtaken Hibernian on goal difference.
And there could be more trouble for the Rangers because linesman Calum Spence has to be treated for a head injury from an object thrown off the Ave.
Gerard made eight changes to the team that topped Ayr to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, meanwhile, went with the same Levi 11 that took a point from Hearts last week and should be proud of the way his well-dressed team crushed the opponents to a breaking point.
The Rangers may have dominated with the ball, but Livingston did more with their balls.
Menger sent Scott Pittman to the first goal of the league-leading Alan McGregor, who should have scored in just two minutes, but the midfielder squandered his big opportunity.
Keegan got a long free-kick from Jacobs to captain Craig Halcott but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to hit the ball in the back post.
Rangers regained control but in the final third they had more than their faith in the game.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt that his clash with Steven Lawless should have earned him a penalty in the quarter-hour but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's plea.
Rangers were able to score just two shots on target in the first half, but former Iroquois goalkeeper Liam Kelly was slightly hampered by Lasagna Coulibaly's head and shots from OV Aguirre.
Levy's opening goal in the 34th minute may have been against the flow, but no one can deny that they are the only ones to have their design.
Again the Rangers failed to handle Jacob's deep set-piece.
Scott Arfield did not respond to Deacon Gallagher's Scott Robinson's ball-slot, he was cool to pick Menga for the normal finish.
Gerard took action at half-time with Ryan Kent in a switch to Coolidge and the switch was going to go into effect almost immediately as the winger was at Morels, but the remarkable Kelly left him off the line.
But the Livingston visitors started playing the exact kind of game they enjoyed, with Lithgow and Halcett sending long balls after long balls.
Holt's team could have taken their lead in the final but McGregor stood by to ruin Jacobs's efforts before heading from the Litgo corner.
Thompson again turned his back on Rangers substitute Glenn Middleton, who claimed a late penalty as he stumbled on Jacobs.
He invented the Geiger counter.
And now a page from our "Sunday Morning" almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today... the day the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually became known as the Geiger counter.
Since then, a cornerstone of science, the Geiger counter has also become a cornerstone of pop culture, in the 1950 film "Bells of Coronado", starring the seemingly potential cowboy scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: "What is that?"
Rogers: "It's a Geiger counter, used to detect radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you bride these earphones, you can hear the effects of the atoms given off by the radioactivity in the minerals".
"That's a lot of noise, isn't it?
"Hans" Geiger died in 1945, just before his 63rd birthday
But his eponymous invention still lives.
The new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to detect malignant cells.
The new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to detect and kill malignant cells.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells as part of treatment.
The procedure involves removing immune cells from the patient and changing them in the lab.
They can then 'see' a protein common to many cancers and then re-enter.
An experimental vaccine has shown promising results with patients with various degrees of cancer.
One woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells, has seen her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The procedure involves harvesting immune cells from the patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can "see" a protein common to many cancers called HER2, and then re-entering the cells.
Professor Jay Berzewski of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our results show that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 "causes the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer", explains Professor Barzofsky.
Taking immune cells from outside patients and "teaching" them how to target cancer cells has worked similarly for treating leukemia.
Kanye West is wearing a MAGA hat in the pro-Trump debate on SNL
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed into the studio after a stunning performance during Saturday Night Live where he praised US President Donald Trump and said he would continue to dream in 2020.
After performing her third song of the night, Ghost Town, where she wore a Make America Great Cap, she lashed out at Democrats and reiterated her support for Trump.
"A lot of times when I talk to a white person, they say: "How can you like Trump, he's racist!"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America long ago", he said.
SNL opened the show with a skit starring Matt Damon where the Hollywood star mocked Brett Kavanagh's testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on claims of sexual assault by Christine Blazy Ford.
Although it was not aired, footage of West's parody was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It's unclear if the rock post was meant to mock West.
In addition, West complained to the audience that she was having trouble with her headgear backstage.
"They made fun of me backstage.
They said, 'Don't go out in your hat.'
They've been screwing me!
And then they said I was in a sinking place, according to the Washington Examiner.
West added: "Do you want to see the place?" saying that he would read his "Superman Cape, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Then try with love".
His comments were booed from the audience at least twice and embarrassed SNL cast members, Variety reported, with one person telling the publication: "There was a pin-up silence in the whole studio".
West was brought in as a replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose ex-boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, died a few days ago.
West's performance of I Love It has been a mixed bag.
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest souls: Thank you for standing up to the evildoers".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West "was what he was and he's absolutely great".
"But I have chosen not to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their 'art') who is embracing and spreading ideals that are harmful to my community.
He's free.
And so are we", he added.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that she had changed her name and is now "officially known as Kanye West".
D is not the first artist to change his name and D.D., who is known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P.D.D., has followed in his footsteps.
Another contemporary rapper, Snoop Dogg was named Snoop Lion and of course the late music legend Prince, changed his name to an icon who was previously known as Prince.
Accused of attempted murder in a Belfast restaurant stabbing
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed at a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident took place in Balihakamore, police said.
Asami is due to appear in Belfast Magistrates Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harrington has attacked toxic masculinity.
Kit Harrington is best known for his militant role as Jon Snow in the HBO offensive medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor said that playing the role of a hero on screen means giving young boys the impression that they have to be tough to get respect.
Speaking to the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes 'something went wrong' and questioned how to tackle the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie at the age of 31, admits that he feels strongly about the issue.
'I personally feel, quite strongly, at the moment - where are we going wrong in masculinity?' he said.
'What did we teach men growing up that we're facing this problem now?'
Kit believes that television may be partly responsible for the rise of toxic masculinity due to its overly masculine characters.
He added: 'What is simplicity and what are we learning?
What is it that is taught on TV and on the street that boys think that this is the particular path they must follow to become men?
I think that's really one of the big questions of the time: how do we change this?
Because obviously the young people have made some big mistakes.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he will not be doing a Game of Thrones prequel or sequel when the series is renewed next summer, saying that he has 'finished the battlefield and the horse's life'.
From November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's remake of True West, a story about a film producer and his bandit brother.
The actor recently revealed that he considers his wife Rose to be the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
'I met my wife on the show, so it's my future family's gift of my life.
Rose starred in the Emmy Award-winning fantasy series Egrit, as the girlfriend of Kit's character John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China has reported a 14% increase in new cases.
China has reported a 14% increase in HIV and AIDS cases.
There are more than 820,000 cases in the country, health officials said.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, nearly 40,000 new cases were reported.
The majority of the new cases were due to sexually transmitted infections, which is a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV infection has spread rapidly through the bloodstream in different parts of China.
But the number of people infected with HIV along the way has been reduced to almost zero, Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan province.
Yet every year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China is increasing by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is a serious problem for the LGBT community in China.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still seen as blatant.
Because of the country's conservative values, research estimates that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men, marry women later.
Many diseases are transmitted from inadequate sexual protection in these relationships.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has pledged universal access to HIV drugs as part of its efforts to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters denies GOP Senators' leaks, 'dangerous lies' and 'conspiracy theories' - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India - The Times of India are the most widely read read and widely read in the media
US Republican Maxine Waters denied Saturday allegations that a member of her staff posted the personal information of three Republican US senators to lawmakers' Wikipedia pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat insisted that these claims were being promoted by "ultra-right-wing" scholars and websites.
"Lies, lies and more hateful lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The leaked information reportedly includes the home addresses and phone numbers of the two U.S. senators, Senator Lindsay Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orin Hatch, both of whom are U.S. citizens.
The information, which came online on Thursday, was posted by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a Senate panel hearing on sexual misconduct charges against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanagh.
Conservative sites like Gateway Scholar and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of the post was associated with the "Waters" office and disclosed information on which member of the Waters staff was involved, Hill reported.
"This baseless allegation is completely false and a total lie", Waters continued.
"Members of my staff - whose identity, personal data and security have been compromised by this fraud and false allegations - were in no way responsible for this leak.
This baseless accusation is completely false and a total lie".
Waters's statement quickly drew criticism online from many, including former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is angry", Fleischer wrote.
"It says he doesn't have the inclination to be a congressman.
When someone is accused of something they did not do, they do not get angry.
They certainly won't be controversial.
They should not question the complainant's motives.
They must be calm and serene".
Fletcher compared Waters's reaction to the Democrats' criticism of the judge's caveman, who during Thursday's hearing was seen by critics as very angry.
Republican candidate Omar Navarro, who is seeking to oust Waters in the midterm elections, also tweeted his views.
"It's really big", he tweeted.
In his statement, Waters said his office had alerted the appropriate authorities and law enforcement agencies to these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he continued, "and that they are held legally accountable for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to any and all members of my staff".
Johnny English Strikes Again review - the weakest of the Rowan Atkinson spy
It is now traditional to see the Brexit implication in any new film with a British twist, and this seems to apply to the revival of the Johnny English action-comedy spoof franchise - which began with Johnny English in 2003 and came back to life in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will the self-deprecating fact that we are clearly a garbage nation become a new export opportunity?
At any rate, the pop-eyed, rubber-faced disabled Johnny English has a second license to create new things - his name more than anything else suggests that he is a wide-ranging comic creation designed for the non-English language cinema world.
He is certainly a silly secret agent who, despite his eccentric tendencies towards smooth glamour, contributed a note to the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony "Shariots of Fire" theme tune with a dash of Mr Bean and a dollop of chaps.
He was based primarily on the Traveller and international mystery man Atkinson who starred in the once-forgotten Barclaysard TV commercials, spreading chaos in consciousness.
There are one or two great moments in this latest Jay Outing.
I loved watching Johnny English approach a helicopter with his medieval armor and rotor blades hanging from his little helmet.
While Atkinson's gift for physical comedy has been shown, the comedy has been felt to be quite inferior and oddly overblown, especially by "serious" film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible who now confidently offer comedy as an element.
The joke seems to be aimed more at children than adults, and to me, Johnny English's Strange Accidents is not as innovative and focused as Atkinson's silent-film prank on Bean's character.
The topical basis for many years is that Great Britain is in serious trouble.
A cyber hacker infiltrated Britain's top-secret web network of espionage, revealing the identities of all British agents in the field, to frustrate the agent in charge - a small role, sadly, for Kevin Eldon.
This is the last hope of a prime minister who is already suffering from a complete recession of anti-politics, she is a misunderstood and committed personality: Emma Thompson has done her best with this semi-Theresa-May character but there is not much to work on in the script.
His intelligence advisors told him that every active spy had been compromised, so he had to bring someone out of retirement.
And that means talking to Johnny English, who is now employed as a schoolteacher in some P.O.S. institutions, but teaches off the record about how to be a disguised worker: here's some good jokes, since English here offers a rock-type academy of intelligence school.
English returns to the White House for an urgent briefing and is reunited with his long-tolerated ex-Sidekick Bow, played by Ben Miller.
Beau is now a married man, married to a submarine commander, a jolly-hockey-stick role in which Vicky Pepperdine is somewhat wasted.
So Batman and Robin, who made a fatal mistake in Her Majesty's Secret Service, are back in action and face Olga Kurelenko's seductress Ofelia Bullitova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister is falling dangerously under the spell of a charismatic tech billionaire who claims he can solve Britain's computer problems: the sinful Jason Volta, played by Jack Lacey.
English and Beau begin their far-reaching high-zinc bizarre sound: disguised as a waiter, they set fire to a flashy French restaurant; they start a brawl by smuggling Voltaire on a luxury boat; and English creates pure chaos by trying to use the virtual reality headset to familiarize himself with the interior of Voltaire's home.
All the stops are drawn for the final sequence, of course, but as mystical and entertaining as it is, there's quite a bit of children's TV in the whole thing.
It's a very mediocre staff.
And like other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but wonder: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really did justice to his talent?
Labour denies it is planning for Britain to work four days a week but get paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party will consider a master plan that would see Britons working four days a week - but getting paid for five.
The group reportedly wants company owners to share the money saved by giving employees an extra day off through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution.
It will see employees enjoy three days off - but still earn the same salary.
The idea will 'fit' with the party's economic agenda and there are plans to move the country for workers, sources said.
The Trade Union Congress has approved a four-day shift as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
A senior Labour Party source told The Sunday Times: 'A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year.
'It will not happen overnight but four-day workdays is an aspiration that fits with the party's approach to balancing the economy for the workers as well as the overall industrial strategy of the party.'
While the Labour Party is not the first to support such a concept, the Green Party pledged four working days during their 2017 general election campaign.
The aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole, though.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day workday is not party policy and is not being considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used last week's Labour Conference to express his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he is determined to return power to utilities from 'unknown directors' and 'beneficiaries'.
The Shadow Chancellor's plan means that the current shareholders of water companies may not get their full share back because the Labour government may pay some 'backs' due to perceived wrongdoing.
He also confirmed plans to retain staff on the company board to equalise 10 per cent of the employees of private sector companies and to create an inclusive ownership fund, with an annual dividend of $500.
Tell 60 Minutes that the FBI investigation into Kavanaugh might change their minds.
The FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed the final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and the bureau's investigations have raised questions about whether any Republican senators could turn their backs.
In an interview aired Sunday, "60 Minutes" reporter Scott Pelley asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would lead them to change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
"I told you to go to the hearing, I said, I spoke to Judge Kavanagh.
I called him after that, the complaint came out, I said, 'Did you do this?'
He was determined, unambiguous".
Graham's vote, of course, seems irrevocable.
"My mind has been made up about Brett Kavanaugh and a big rather important complaint will be needed to change that", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett has strongly denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
"and they could not verify the name of the one he said.
It's 36 years old.
I don't see any new changes".
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York will be the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a great line-up of star performers and an equally compelling mission: ending poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see thousands of people not only walk the Great Lawn of Central Park to enjoy acts like Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, described in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, a group that promotes the international aspiration to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting.
To get a free ticket to the event (if you're not willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to do multiple tasks or "activities" such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or other meaningful ways to help raise awareness about their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful is Global Citizen in achieving its goal in the 12 years that remain?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real step to get people to call for action, or is it another case of so-called "clicktivism" - where people think they're making a real difference by signing online petitions or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has recorded more than 19 million "actions" from its supporters, moving towards achieving various goals.
It says these actions have helped world leaders announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of 2.22 billion people by 2030.
As of early 2018, the group cited 390 commitments and announcements that have been made since its inception, of which at least $10 billion has already been distributed or funded.
The group estimates that the secured funds have directly impacted around 649 million people worldwide so far.
Some of the key pledges are Power of Nutrition, a partnership of UK-based investors and implementers committed to "helping children reach their full potential", and Global Citizen's pledge to provide Rwanda with $35 million to end malnutrition in the county after receiving more than 4,700 tweets.
"With the help of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can turn the social injustice of malnutrition into a footprint of history", said Tracy Ullman, the Power of Nutrition ambassador, to the public during a power concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 initiatives in the United States to improve maternal and child nutrition, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, that will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition interventions.
Its website answers a frequently asked question: "What do you think we can do to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen responded: "It will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail.
But, like the great civil rights and anti-racism movements before us, we will succeed, because together we are stronger.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Money are among those performing at this year's event in New York, which will be hosted by Deborah-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
US may use navy to "block" Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
Washington could resort to its navy "if necessary" to prevent Russian fuel from entering Middle Eastern countries, US Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as described by Washington Examiner.
Zinck alleges that Russia's involvement in Syria - notably, where it is working at the invitation of the legitimate government - is an excuse to explore new energy markets.
"I believe that the reason for their position in the Middle East is that they want to broker power like Eastern Europe, the southern hub of Europe", he said.
And according to officials, there are ways and means to deal with it.
"Our Navy has the ability of the United States to keep the sea lanes clear and, if necessary, blockade them to ensure their fuel does not go to market", he said.
Zinke was speaking to participants at an event organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a nonprofit group that identifies itself as the "voice of fuel consumers" in the United States.
He was comparing Washington's treatment of Russia and Iran to the same in practice.
"The "holding in the sleeves" of Russia, including a fossil fuel-dependent economy, "concerns the financial alternatives for Iran and Russia, the benefit and substitution of less and more energy", he said.
The comments came as the Trump administration aims to regulate the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe for European consumers at a much cheaper price than Russia.
The influence of this is that Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are repeatedly trying to get Germany out of the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which, according to Trump, is being held captive by Berlin and Moscow".
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters - is a cost-effective project in its entirety.
The Kremlin argues that Washington's strong opposition to the project is nothing more than financial and an example of unfair competition.
"In my opinion, we agree that energy cannot be used as a tool of pressure and that consumers should have the power to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after an interview with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US position has met with a negative reaction from Germany, which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry body, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has urged the United States to stay away from the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
"After a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Dieter Kamff, said that we have a major problem with third-party interference in our energy supply.
Elizabeth Warren will "sweat it out" in her 2020 presidential bid, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would "look away" from running for president after the midterm elections.
Warren confirmed that he was in the race at a town hall in Holyoke, Massachusetts.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government and that includes women in top positions", she said, The Hill reported.
"After November 6th I will be strongly in the presidential race".
During the Warren Town Hall, President Donald Trump spoke out against Trump, saying that Trump was "leading the country in the wrong direction".
"I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been critical of Trump and Trump's Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
A poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's own voters do not think he should run in 2020.
The Saffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll found that "probable" fifty-five percent of Massachusetts voters said they should not run for senator.
Thirty-two percent support the fight.
The poll showed that former Governor Deval Patrick had the most support for a possible fight, with 38 percent supporting a potential fight and 48 percent not.
Other high-profile Democratic names potentially discussed in the 2020 election race include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reported that Biden said he would make a formal decision by January.
Sarah Palin quotes from track Palin's PTSD at the rally for Donald Trump
26-year-old Trek Palin has spent a year in Iraq since enlisting in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged with domestic violence.
"He told an audience at a rally at Donald Trump's in Tulsa, Oklahoma, 'By coming back to what my own son is going through, I can understand other families who understand the consequences of PTSD and the wounds our soldiers are bringing back.'
Pauline called her arrest "the elephant in the room" and said of her son and other war veterans that "they come back a little bit changed, they come back stronger, they come back wondering if the Army and Air Force and other members of the military have any respect for their colleagues for what they have given to the country".
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic violence, carrying a weapon and drug possession against a woman, according to Dan Bennett, a police department spokesman.
18 states, DC support the challenge of the new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia are supporting a legal challenge to a new U.S. policy that denies shelter to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
NBC News reports that in support of an asylum seeker challenging the policy, representatives from 18 states and districts filed a friend-of-the-court brief in court in Washington on Friday.
The full name of the plaintiff in Grace v. Sessions, which the American Civil Liberties Union filed against federal policy in August, was not disclosed.
He said he was bullied by his partner "and his violent gang members boys", but US officials rejected his asylum application on July 20.
He was held in Texas.
Attorneys from the states supporting Grace cited El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala as countries with widespread gang and domestic violence problems, from which large numbers of asylum seekers come to the United States.
The new U.S. asylum policy reverses a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
The Friend-of-the-Court brief states that "this federal law requires that all asylum applications be judged on the basis of specific facts and circumstances, and that such a ban violates the original intent".
In the statement, attorneys further argued that the policy of denying entry to immigrants is hurting the U.S. economy, because they are more likely to be entrepreneurs and they "provide essential labor".
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges in June to stop providing shelter to victims of domestic violence and gang violence.
"Asylum may be granted to those who have fled their country because of persecution or fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his policy announcement on June 11.
Asylum has never been meant to be the solution to all the problems - even the most serious - that people face every day around the world.
The number of dead has doubled and the number of deaths is on the rise amid efforts to rescue the survivors.
The situation was becoming dire for the survivors.
"It was very worrying", said 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, who was at a shelter in Pallu City, to comfort her child who was suffering from fever.
Every minute, the ambulances are bringing bodies.
Clean water is not available.
Residents were seen returning to their destroyed homes in an attempt to find what they could find in the water.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals were overcrowded due to the 7.5 magnitude quake.
Several of the injured, including Dewey Harris, who suffered broken back and shoulder bones, were taken to the outside of the Palo Army Hospital, where they are being treated under the sky due to the strong aftershocks.
He cried to describe the feeling of tremors during the earthquake while staying in a five-story hotel room with his wife and daughter.
I didn't have time to save myself.
I was stuck in the middle of the broken wall, I think, Harris told the press that they were in town for a wedding.
I hear my wife screaming for help, then silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my kids.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador accuses China of "slandering" through propaganda ads
A week after a four-page advertisement in the US Daily, a state-run Chinese newspaper, citing mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the American press to conduct targeted propaganda.
U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday cited a paid supplement to Iowa's largest Chinese daily Des Moines Register and accused China of attempting to interfere in the November 6 U.S. congressional elections, which China denied.
Trump accused Beijing of trying to interfere in the US election, which US officials told Reuters was a new attempt by Washington to pressure China.
It is normal for foreign governments to advertise to promote trade, but Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a trade war that has led to them raising tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and US experts say that China's retaliatory tariffs at the start of the trade war were designed to hurt exporters in states like Iowa who had backed Trump's Republican Party.
U.S. Ambassador to China and former longtime Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has hurt American workers, farmers and businessmen.
Branstad said in an article in the Des Mines Register on Sunday that China "has now doubled down on that barbarism with targeted advertising in our own free press".
"The Chinese government is taking unethical advantage of America's cherished history of freedom of speech and a free press in this propaganda campaign through paid ads on the Des Mines Register", Branstad wrote.
"On the other hand, at the Beijing newsstands on the side of the street you will find limited opposition voices and you will not see a true reflection of the dissent that the Chinese people may have about China's worrying economic path, because the media here is hand-picked by the Chinese Communist Party", he wrote.
He also said that his article was refused to be published by a major Chinese newspaper, although he did not name the newspaper.
Republicans are trying to keep women voters out of the Cavani debate before midterm, analysts warn
Many leading Republicans have sided with Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over multiple allegations of sexual harassment, and analysts have warned that they will see a backlash in the upcoming midterm elections, especially from women.
The mood has been extremely high and it is clear that most Republicans are already openly looking to vote.
"There is no way they can come back", Grant Riher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, told The Hill in an article published Saturday.
Rihaar said there were doubts about whether the last-minute pressure from Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Arizona) for an FBI investigation would calm angry voters.
According to the Washington DC newspaper, Carine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser to the Progressive Movement and national women's spokesperson, said on Friday that women will not forget what happened yesterday - they will not forget it tomorrow and in November.
"November is coming!" was chanted by protesters in the Senate hallway on Friday morning as the Republicans, who controlled the Judiciary Committee, decided to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blazy Ford, Mike said.
"Democratic cheerleading and motivational speaking will be a thing of the past", said independent political analyst Stu Rothenberg to the news site.
People say there is already too much; it's true.
But it may be higher, especially among undervalued suburban female voters and young voters aged 18 to 29, who don't often vote because they don't like the president".
Even before Ford testified publicly about sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that Republicans might react adversely if they moved forward with the approval.
"It's been a difficult issue for the GOP", Michael Steele, former chairman of the Republican National Committee, told NBC News earlier this week.
"It's not just about whether the committee vote or the final vote or Kafanuf will be held back, it's about how the Republicans take it and how they use it", Guy Cecil, director of the Priorities USA group, which supports Democrats in voting, told the news channel.
However, in the context of the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, Americans seem to be somewhat ambivalent about who to believe, with opinions heavily biased towards the latter.
A new survey by Yugov found that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believe Ford's testimony, with 35 percent saying they definitely or probably believe Kavanaugh.
It also found that 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or certainly lied during his testimony, and only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
After Flake's pressure, the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and at least one other complainant, Deborah Ramirez, the Guardian reports.
Ford testified under oath before a Judicial Committee last week that Kavanaugh raped her while she was 17 years old.
Ramirez alleged that the Supreme Court nominee showed her her genitals at a party while she was a student at Yale in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a startup to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of this technology legend, Inrupt, is a company that will create the open source platform Solid by Berners-Lee.
Solid gives users the right to choose where their data is stored and what information people are allowed access to.
In a separate interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the real goal of InRap is "global domination".
"We need to do it now", he said about the start-up.
This is a historic moment.
The app allows anyone to create a P.O.D. or "personal online data store" using Solid's technology.
This may include contact lists, to-do lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify all in the same browser and at the same time.
What is unique about personal online data stores is that it will be entirely up to the user - who can access what type of information.
The company calls this personal empowerment through data.
According to John Bruce, CEO of the company, Inrap's idea will help bring the resources, processes and skills to everyone for solid power.
The company currently consists of a team of on-staff developers and volunteer coders, including Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform acquired by IBM.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to build their own decentralized applications using tools available on the Inrap's website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team "are not talking about launching a complete change with Facebook and Google where all their business models are completely changed overnight".
We don't ask their permission.
In a media post published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrap's "purpose is to provide commercial fuel and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee radically changed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has emerged as a powerful voice in the net neutrality debate.
Even at the time of Inrap's launch, Berners-Lee will remain as the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation, and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this future era of the web", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Van: Victorian Clerk of the First World War
The only Church of England priest to win the Victoria Cross during World War I as a combatant, he celebrated the centenary of the original town.
Lieutenant Colonel The Reverend Bernard Van won the award during the attack on Bellinglis and Lehncote on 29 September 1918.
However, he was killed by a gunman four days later and never knew he had received the highest British military honour.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial to him at a procession in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Van, said it was "incredibly significant" that the monument was being unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's achievement.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Van Oerlen led his battalion through thick fog and heavy field and machine gun fire during the Perrona de Saint-Quentin Canal.
He then rushed to the firing line and led the line with the utmost courage, singing a field song and knocking out three enemies.
Lieutenant Colonel Van was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918 - just a month before the end of the war.
Michael Van, 72, says that his grandfather's work is something I could never do and which I greatly respect.
He and his brother Dr. James Van Kuchkawasch later presented a wreath, led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Van said he was honoured to participate in the parade, adding that the support of the crowd was a true hero's show of courage.
MMA fans stayed up all night to watch 206 Belotto, but instead they got Pepa Pig.
Imagine you stay up all night to watch a great Bellator 206 and the main event is not shown.
The original card from San Jose featured 13 fights, including six, and was shown live all night on Channel 5 in the UK.
In the early hours of the morning, as Gagard Moussaci and Rory McDonald were preparing to face each other, the coverage changed to Peppa Pig, stunning UK viewers.
Especially because of this fight, they stayed up until dawn, so some people are angry.
One fan on Twitter described the changing of children's cartoons as "a kind of dirty joke".
"They had to change the cartoons of the children because the government rules do not allow them to show at 6 a.m"., said Dave Schwarz, senior vice president of Bellatore, in response to a question about the broadcast.
Papa the Pig, yeah.
Scott Coker, president of the Bellatory organisation, said he would work on scheduling in the future with the UK audience in mind.
"In the time of the ripple, we may be able to solve it", said Coker.
"But now it's six o'clock in the morning on Sunday and we can't do it until Sunday, their Monday.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it switched, there were a lot of messages coming in, and they weren't very friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it might be a technical error.
But no, it was a government matter.
I promise it won't happen again.
We're going to reduce it to five fights instead of six -- as we normally do -- in an attempt to give the fans extra.
This is an unfortunate situation.
Tom Daly has suffered sexual humiliation.
Olympic diver Tom Daly says he grew up with sexual stigma - but it inspired him to succeed.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't realize until he went to high school that "not everyone is like me".
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island Disc presented by Lauren LaVerne, he said he spoke about gay rights in giving others hope.
She also said that after the birth of her child, her thoughts about winning the Olympics have diminished.
The long-running show's regular presenter, Christy Young, has taken several months off due to illness.
After appearing as a social outcast at LaVerne's debut, Daly said she felt inferior to everyone else, because "it wasn't socially acceptable to pick boys and girls".
He said, "Today, the feeling of being small and feeling different is still real and has given me the strength and determination to succeed".
She said she wanted to prove herself as "something" so that when everyone found out about her sexuality, they wouldn't be disappointed.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist has become a high-profile LGBT campaigner and used her presence to appeal to more countries to recognize homosexuality at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia.
He said he opened his mouth because he felt lucky to be able to survive in public without complications and wanted to give others "hope".
The three-time world champion talks about falling in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 - who surprised me.
Deli, who married the Oscar winner last year, who is 20 years her senior, said the age gap was not a problem.
"When you have to go through so much at such a young age - he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he said it was hard to find someone his age who had seen so many ups and downs in his life.
The couple gave birth to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley in June, and Daley said his "entire outlook" had changed.
He said that if you asked me last year, I would have said, "I want to win a gold medal". That was my meditation wisdom.
There are bigger things than Olympic gold, to be honest.
Rabi is my Olympic gold medalist.
His son was named after his father Robert, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daly said her father never admitted he was dying and he eventually asked if they had confirmed their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the front row.
"I never could tell you would not be sitting in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand as he stopped breathing and until he took his last breath and died and I didn't admit that he was invincible", he said.
The following year, Daly competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
He said, "This is what I've always dreamed of doing - diving in front of an Olympic audience, and there's nothing better than that".
It also inspired her first song choice - Heather Small's Pride - which resonated with her in the build-up to the Olympics and which still stings in her throat.

Mickelson, who is out of form, will be on the bench for the Ryder Cup on Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record by playing his 47th Ryder Cup match on Sunday, but he will have to get his form back if he doesn't want to make it an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who has played a record 12 times in the biennial event, has been benched for Saturday's foreball and foursome instead of captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of being the center of the action, which he was in the US game, the five-time major winner has spent his days as a cheerleader and fixing his game on the range.
Not always comfortable amongst drivers even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is not suited to the Tight Leaf Golf National course, where the long roughs often get in the way of long shots.
And if the course itself isn't bad enough, Mickelson, in match 9, is facing British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has paired with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, who are four points behind in the first 12 singles matches, can start well, Mickelson's match could prove important.
Furik showed confidence in him, although he didn't have much to say.
He has fully understood his role today, put his hand on my shoulder and said he is ready for tomorrow.
She has a lot of confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer and he's given a lot to this team in the past and this week.
I probably didn't think he'd play two games.
I was hoping for more, but it happened and we thought we'd move on.
He wants to get on the field, like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches in Sunday's match.
It could end a Ryder Cup career that doesn't even match his personal record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses, and seven half-centuries, though Furyk says his presence is a boost to the team.
"He's funny, funny, smart, likes to make people angry, likes to be in the team room and he's a great guy", he said.
I think the new players have enjoyed playing with him, even this week, which is great to see.
He gives more than just play.
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that the big lead could disappear too.
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a senior lead in singles on the final day of the Ryder Cup can create an uncomfortable situation.
Dane's debut came in a 1997 match at Valdarama, where the Savi Ballesteros-led team gained five points from the Americans, but only managed to cross the finish line by the narrowest of margins, winning 141⁄2- 131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we had a big lead in Valderama; we had a big lead in Brooklyn, where we lost, and in Valderama, where we won, but only at nominal intervals", Bjorn said, "You can see him in the picture, both Friday and yesterday, winning 5-3 and 10-6 in the 2018 class at Le Golf National.
History will show me and my team that this is not over.
Get your ass down tomorrow.
Get out there and do the right thing.
It's not over until the score is on the board.
We have one goal, which is to try and win the trophy, and that's where we'll have our bird's eye.
I always say that I look at my 12 players on the team, but we are also very aware of who is on the other side - the best players in the world.
I am happy with the way our players have worked on the tough golf course and I will never be overconfident.
Tomorrow is a different fight.
Tomorrow's performance is coming up, and it's a different story.
It's great to be with a partner when everything is going well, but when you're on the field alone, your skills as a golfer are put to the test.
This message needs to be sent to all the players who have to give their best tomorrow.
Now, you have to leave your partner and move on and make the best of it.
Unlike Bjorn, opponent Jim Furyk will be watching to see if the players play better individually than they did as a team, with the exception of Jordan Speith and Justin Thomas, who picked up three of the four points.
As part of the team that won the "Miracle in Medina" in Europe and in Brooklyn, Furik himself has experienced dramatic post-change in the last days.
Asked how captain Ben Crenshaw had cheered his players up before leaving on the final day of 1999, he said, "I remember every word".
We have 12 important games tomorrow, but you're going to want to avoid starting as fast as Brooklyn and Medina.
When the game is tilted to one side, there is a lot of pressure in the midfield matches.
We're going to line up and we're going to drop the guys just like we thought, but we're actually going to do some magic tomorrow.
Thomas, who will be joined by Paul Casey, Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, will lead the defence against the top-order Europeans, who will face Rory McIlroy in the opening match.
"I've arranged this team in order, because I think it's going to cover everything", Bjorn says of his selection of singles.
The new German battleship is once again suspended
Local media reports that the T was scheduled to be launched in 2014 with the German Navy's newest batch to replace the previous Cold War-era battleship, but due to faulty systems and snowballing costs it will not be until at least next year.
The launch of the first ship of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate, Rhineland-Palatinate, has been postponed until the first half of 2019, the military spokesman was quoted as saying by Die Zeit.
The ship was scheduled to join the Navy in 2014, but the ambitious project has been hampered by post-delivery problems.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They are said to be equipped with powerful cannons, anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as stealth technologies such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signalling.
Other important features include long maintenance duration - it will be possible to deploy new frigates away from the country's ports for a maximum of two years.
However, the continuing delays mean that the state-of-the-art warships - which are supposed to help Germany show off its strength abroad - will be obsolete by the time they land, Die Zeit reports.
The ill-fated F-125 frigate made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to launch the ship and sent it back to the Blum & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This is the first time that a ship has been returned to the shipbuilder after delivery.
Little is known about the reasons behind the return, but German media point to several significant "software and hardware flaws" that would render the ship useless in battle.
The software's goodies are particularly important, as the Baden-Württemberg-class vessels will be operated by a crew of about 120 sailors - half the manpower of the old Bremen-class frigates.
In addition, it was found that the ship was overweight which would reduce its performance and hinder the Navy's future upgrade additions.
The 7,000-tonne Rhineland-Palatinate is thought to be twice as heavy as the same class of ships used by the Germans during World War II.
In addition to defective hardware, the cost of the entire project including staff training is also becoming a problem.
From an initial level of £2.2 billion to a staggering £3.1 billion ($3.6 billion).
The problematic new refrigerators have become even more important in the recent context of warnings of a shrinking German navy.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was "running out of ships suitable for the Motaine".
The official said the problem has grown over time, as no replacement ships have been brought in for the old ones that were scrapped.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class ships had been able to join the Navy.
Sheena's got a secret life in the bat's National Trust.
A new study is being conducted at a Scottish Highland estate to learn how bats use the soil to search for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the behaviour of this unique flying mammal and help in future conservation efforts.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will continue to study common and soprano piperelles and the Debenton butterflies at Inverurie Gardens in West Ross.
Special recorders will be set up at key locations around the area to track the activities of bats throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also conduct ongoing surveys using portable detectors.
The sound of all the recordings will be analyzed by the expert to calculate the vibration of the bat's call and to find out what species are doing.
A landscape map and report will then be produced to create a detailed topographic-scale picture of their behaviour.
NTS conservation consultant Rob Dyer hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat are most important to the bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management, such as grassland creation and how to preserve forest land for bats and other related species.
The population of bats in Scotland and the UK has declined dramatically over the last century.
They are at risk for building and development work which damages their sleeping places and habitat.
Wind-based turbines and lighting can also pose a danger, as can flypapers and some chemicals in building materials, as well as attacks from pet cats.
The bat is not blind.
However, their ear is more effective than their eyes in catching prey due to their nocturnal habits.
They use an advanced echo-location technique to identify hazards and obstacles in the flight path.
NTS, which is responsible for the maintenance of over 270 historic buildings, 38 important parks and 76,000 hectares of land across the country, has given importance to the butterfly.
They have ten trained specialists who regularly conduct surveys, visit sleeping places and sometimes even perform rescue operations.
The organisation has also established Scotland's first and only dedicated bat sanctuary at the Thrive Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten bat species.
The estate manager David Thompson said that the estate is an ideal area for bats.
"There is a good area for three-headed bats", he said.
There are old buildings, lots of old trees and all good housing.
But there's still a lot more to be learned about bats, so what we're doing here and elsewhere will help us better understand what they need to survive".
He stressed the importance of knowing the presence of bats before maintaining property, as this could involuntarily destroy 400 female and infant bats due to the destruction of a maternal habitat, and wipe out the entire local bat population.
It is illegal to kill, harass or disturb bat-protected animals or to destroy their habitat.
Elizabeth Farrell, the Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has urged the public to help.
"We still have a lot to learn about butterflies and how many species live", he says.
Ronaldo denies rape charges and lawyers are going to sue German newspaper
She called the rape allegations against her "fake news" and said people wanted to use her name to promote themselves.
His lawyers are ready to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which has brought the allegation to public.
The Portugal and Juventus forward is accused of raping an American woman named Catherine Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He was accused of paying her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
Speaking to his 142 million followers on his Instagram live video hours after the claim was made public, Ronaldo, 33, called the report "fake news".
No, no, no, no, I'm not going to do this.
What they said today is false news, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner said on camera.
They want to use my name to promote themselves.
It's common.
They want to be known by my name, but it's part of the living.
I am a happy man and everything is going well. " The player added with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the matter of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player should seek compensation for "moral damage in proportion to the gravity of the violation, which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent times".
The alleged incident is said to have occurred in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009.
According to documents filed in Clark County District Court in Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorra visited the player's home after meeting at a nightclub, where he sexually assaulted her.
Mayorca claimed that Ronaldo was unkind after the incident and told him that he was "99 percent" disappointed for "the good guy", "one percent".
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that they had sexual intercourse, but it was consensual.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and had her injuries photographed in the hospital, but later agreed to an out-of-court settlement, because she was "scared of reprisals and afraid of being "publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old said she now wants to bring the settlement back because she is mentally devastated by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was in the midst of a move from Manchester United to Real Madrid at the time of the offence and joined Italian club Juventus this summer for a reported $100 million.
Brexit: UK will forever regret losing its position as car maker
Commerce Secretary Greg Clark said the UK would forever regret losing its position as the world's leading car maker after Brexit.
He also said it was "worrying" that the UK Toyota told the BBC that if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, they would temporarily stop production at their factory in Barnston, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Mr. Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said that a no-deal Brexit could lead to job losses due to delays at the border.
Barnston's plant - which makes Toyota Aris and Avenis - produced about 150,000 cars last year, about 90 percent of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My view is that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we could have production stopped at our factory", said Marvin Cook, managing director of Toyota in Barnston.
Other UK carmakers including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover have expressed concern about leaving the EU without any agreement on how cross-border trade will be managed.
For example, BMW has said that they will close their mini plant in Oxford within a month of Brexit.
The main concern that carmakers are expressing is the risk to the supply chain in a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line runs on a "just-in-time" basis, with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for the ordered vehicle.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on 29 March, there could be disruption at the border, which could lead to delays in parts supplies and a shortage of parts, as the Chamber of Commerce warned.
The company said it was not possible to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at Toyota's Derbyshire plant, which could lead to a halt in production.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Checks Plan for future relations with the EU was well designed to avoid such checks at the border.
We want to make the best deal that will not only sustain success, but also allow us to enjoy the potential for future improvement", he said on BBC Radio 4 today.
"Not only Toyota, but other manufacturers are proving that it is crucial to continue the successful supply chain system that we have".
Toyota cannot say how long the production will be stopped, but they warn that over the long term the overhead will reduce the factory's competitiveness and could result in many jobs being lost.
Peter Suvaleris, who has worked at Barnston for 24 years and is the union organizer for the plant, said his members are increasingly concerned: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they don't come back".
A government spokesman said: "We need to have a precise and credible plan for the future relationship with the EU".
The White House says Trump's meeting with Rosenstein may be delayed further
Amid the backlash over Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, a high-level meeting with Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosstein could be "deferred another week", the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversaw the work of Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump's associates and Russia, and possible presidential obstruction of justice.
There has been a lot of talk in Washington over the past few months about whether Trump will fire the deputy attorney general and whether Mueller's independence will be questioned.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the use of secret microphones to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president through the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
However, he reportedly visited the White House on Monday in the wake of reports that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump was announced on Thursday, when Trump was at the UN headquarters in New York.
Trump said he "wouldn't like" to fire Rosstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, after Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual misconduct, Dr. Christine Blazy Ford, both testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into charges against Kavanaugh, which has further delayed a full Senate vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
Regarding the meeting with Rosenstein, he said: "No date has been set, it could be this week, it could be postponed for another week for all other current Supreme Court matters.
But let's show it, and I always want to tell the media.
Some journalists will dispute this statement. Sanders has not given any more press briefings at the White House since September 10.
Director Chris Wallace asks why.
Sanders said the reason for not keeping the briefing was not because of "the publicity" he felt towards the journalists, although he said: "I don't deny that they did the publicity".
He then suggested increasing direct contact between Trump and the press.
"The current president has more Q&A sessions than any other president before him", he said, without citing any evidence: "We have judged that number".
The briefing will be in the future, Sanders said, "but if the media gets a chance to question the president of the United States directly, it's better than talking to me".
We are very much trying to do this, and you have seen us do this over the last few weeks, and the press briefing is going to be replaced by a direct conversation with the President of the United States".
Trump regularly takes questions when leaving the White House or attending inaugural sessions or press conferences with distinguished guests.
Single press conferences are rare.
In New York this week, the president probably showed why, doing things unplanned and sometimes making strange appearances in front of a press team.
Health Minister NHS writes to EU workers in Scotland about Brexit fears
The Health Minister expressed his gratitude to the EU staff working in the NHS in Scotland and expressed his wish for them to stay in the post-Brexit period.
Jean Freeman, MP, sent a letter less than six months before the UK left the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to meet the settled status application costs for EU citizens to work in the country's public services.
In his letter, Freeman wrote: "Throughout the summer, talks between the UK and the EU on Brexit are ongoing, which are expected to culminate this autumn.
However, the UK government is also preparing for a possible no-deal scenario.
I know you're all going through a very anxious time.
That is why I would like to remind you once again how much I value the contributions of every member of staff, regardless of nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond have brought valuable experience and expertise that has strengthened and improved healthcare and benefited patients and our communities.
Scotland is your home and we want you to stay here.
Christian Ebercrombie undergoes emergency surgery after suffering a head injury
Tennessee State Tigers linebacker Christian Abercrombie has undergone emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, Tennessee's Mike Organ said.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred shortly before halftime.
Reed said he came to the sideline and fainted.
Trainer and medical staff gave Abercrombie oxygen along the sideline and later brought him back for further testing.
A Tennessee state official told WSMV's Chris Harris in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie was out of surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that "no details are yet known about the nature/type of the injury" and Tennessee State is trying to determine the time of the injury.
The red-shirt sophomore is playing his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five total tackles on Saturday before being taken out of the game, with a total of 18 tackles this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when buying property in the UK
Under the Tory scheme, foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy new property in the UK and the extra money will be spent on homelessness support.
This move will mitigate the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The stamp duty increase will apply to those who do not pay taxes in the UK.
The Treasury expects that this will generate revenues of up to £120 million a year to support homelessness.
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty when they buy property in the UK - and the extra money will be spent on helping the homeless, Theresa May will announce today.
The move will mitigate the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters while providing more affordable housing and targeting the high-income earners.
The stamp duty increase will apply to individuals and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will go towards government support for the homeless.
Surcharge - which, in addition to the current stamp duty, is more than three percent of the higher rate imposed on second homes and rental homes two years ago.
The Treasury expects this to generate an increase in revenues of up to £120 million per annum.
An estimated 13 per cent of all newly built properties in London are being bought by residents outside the UK, which has led to higher prices and made things more difficult for first-time home buyers.
Most of the country's elite areas - especially the capital - are becoming "strange cities" with foreign buyers spending most of their time abroad.
The new policy comes weeks after Boris Johnson called for lowering the stamp duty on young people buying their first home.
She accused large construction companies of buying land and raising property prices without using it, and Mrs Mackay called for the abolition of Britain's quota for affordable housing to solve its "housing problem".
Mr. Corbin announced an exciting series of housing reform proposals, including rent controls and an end to "no-fault" evictions.
He wants to give the council more power to build new houses.
Mrs May said: "Last year I said I would dedicate my Prime Ministership to restoring the British dream - that life should be better for everyone in the new generation.
And that means fixing the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to those who want to live, work and make a living here.
However, it is also not right that foreign and foreign private companies who do not live in the UK will buy property as easily as hard-working British residents.
The dream of home ownership has been forgotten by many, and homelessness remains a very real problem.
Jack Ross: My ultimate dream is to take over Scotland.
Sunderland boss Jack Ross has said his "ultimate ambition" is to manage Scotland one day in the future.
The 42-year-old Scot is currently enjoying the challenge of recovering the North-Eastern club, who are now in third place in League One, three points behind the first team.
He returned St. Marys to the Scottish Premiership last season and moved to the Stadium of Light this summer.
I wanted to play for the country as a player.
I got a B cap and so far", Ross told BBC Scotland's SportsSound.
"But I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my dad as a kid and it always pulls me back.
This opportunity will only come if I succeed in running the club.
Ross' predecessors as manager of Sunderland include Dick Advocate, David Moyes, Sam Elardis, Martin O'Neill, Roy Kane, Gus Poyet and Paolo De Cano.
The former Alloa Athletic boss said he was not disappointed to turn down offers from established names such as Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"The measure of success for me at this moment will be 'Can I get this club back into the Premier League?'
The club is definitely worthy of the Premier League because of the structure and facilities", he said.
"It's not easy to get there, but I'll probably see myself as successful if I can get the club back there".
After 15 months as an assistant boss at Dumbarton and on Hearts' coaching staff, Ross's manager life is now just three years old.
He then helped Alouas recover from relegation to the third tier and convert St Mirren from relegation to championship title winner the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable here now than he did at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
He recalled taking over the lighting, "It was probably a real milestone".
"I really believed that management was more suitable for me than sports.
It sounds strange because I did exactly that, made a good living out of it, and enjoyed some success.
But the game is hard.
You have to go through a lot of things every week.
I still feel the same about the workload, but the management seems to be right.
I've always wanted to manage, and now I'm doing it, it's the most comfortable thing I've ever done in my entire adult life".
You can hear the full interview on SportsSound on Sunday 30th September, from 12:00 to 13:00 BST on Radio Scotland.
The poll says Saturday at 5.30 p.m. is the ideal time for a pint.
Summer heat has increased crowds in Britain's smoldering pubs, but it has put pressure on the restaurant chain.
Pubs and bars saw sales rise 2.7 percent in July - but restaurant money collections fell 4.8 percent, the statistics show.
Peter Martin, of CGA's business consultancy firm, who compiled the figures, said: "Continued sunshine and England's unexpectedly long World Cup participation means that July will continue the same trend as last June, when pub sales rose by 2.8 per cent and restaurant sales fell.
The 1.8 percent decline in restaurant business in June worsened in July.
The main drinking pubs and bars have done very well so far and the sales of restaurants have been just as bad.
Major food pubs are also suffering from heat, but their sales have not fallen as much as restaurants.
It's like people are just running out for a drink.
All pubs and bars have seen a 6.6 percent increase in drink sales this month, with food sales down 3 percent".
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "The trend at the end of April is still continuing.
Outdoor market sales are most affected by weather and major social or sporting events.
It is not surprising that restaurant groups will be in a difficult situation, but this 4.8 percent decline in sales year on year will be particularly painful.
Food may not come at a bad time for major operators from the long and hot summer and time will tell if the mild August weather will bring some relief.
In July, total sales growth in pubs and restaurants with new opening was 2.7%, reflecting declining sales in brand roll-outs.
The Coffer Pitch Tracker Industry Sales Monitor for the UK pub, bar and restaurant sector collected and analysed performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 million, and is the established industry benchmark.
One in five children has a secret social media account that they keep hidden from their parents
The survey revealed that one in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts that they keep hidden from their parents and teachers.
A survey of 20,000 high school students revealed an increase in fake Instagram pages
This news has raised concerns that sexual content is being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a "major" account to show their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - are creating a social media account in secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 secondary school students found that Instagram, the photo-sharing site, has a rapidly growing account.
The news also raised concerns that sexual content was being posted.
Twenty percent of students said they had a transparent "main" account to show their parents, with hidden ones.
A mother who visited the hidden site of her 13-year-old daughter saw a teenager calling others to "rape me".
Research by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) found that 40 per cent of 11 to 18-year-olds have two profiles, with half of them admitting to having secret accounts.
"It's alarming that so many teens are tempted to create places online that parents and teachers can't find", said HMC president Mike Buchanan.
Eliud Doyle will be the Voice for Athletes at the Scottish Athletic Board.
Elidhe Doyle has been elected as an Executive Director of the Scottish Athletics Board at the Annual General Meeting of the Governing Body.
Doyle, Scotland's most successful track and field athlete and chairman Ian Beatty, described the move as a great opportunity for sports managers to benefit from his extensive experience at the international level over the past decade.
"Elyth is held in high regard throughout the Scottish, UK and global athletics community and we are confident that bringing her to the Scottish Athletics Board will be of great benefit", Betty said.
Doyle said: "I'm excited to be a voice for the athletes and I hope I can really help Scotland's sport and take it forward".
The American, who won four Olympic golds, including the 200m and 400m in Atlanta in 1996 and is now a regular on the BBC, has stopped walking after a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted: "I had a stroke a month ago.
I couldn't walk.
The doctor said time will tell how much I'll recover.
It was hard work, but now I'm healthy, I've learned to walk again, and I've started exercising again today!
Thank you for the inspiring message!
The internet is more ambiguous than mom and cow in breast pump advertising
A breast pump company has split the Internet with an ad comparing mothers to dairy cows.
To mark the launch of what has been dubbed the "world's first silent wearable breast pump", consumer technology company LV has released a hilarious music video to showcase the freedom the new pump gives modern mothers.
Four real mothers are dancing on a straw-filled cow with a song, the lyrics of which include: "Yes, I'm milking myself, but I don't have a tail" and "If no one sees, these are not animal's legs, these are my breasts".
The chorus goes on: "Pump and pump and pump, I feed the babies, pump and pump, I breastfeed my girlfriends".
However, the ad, which was released on the company's Facebook page, has sparked controversy online.
The video, with 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, has received mixed reactions from viewers, with many saying it highlights the "horrors" of the dairy industry.
"The use of cows in the advertising of this product is a very bad decision.
"They need to get pregnant and give birth like us to produce milk, but their babies are stolen from them within a few days of birth", one wrote.
LV breast pump is nicely installed inside a nursing brother (LV/mother)
Another commented: "Obviously it's disappointing for both mother and child.
But why not use them in breast pump advertisements for mothers who have their babies nearby?
Another said: "Very uncomfortable advertising".
Others stand by the ad, with one woman admitting she found the song "delightful".
I think it's a great idea.
If I was breastfeeding, I'd have one.
I feel like a cow when I'm pumping.
The ad sounded a little crazy, but I took it.
It is an innovative product, writes one.
Another commented: "It's a fun ad that is aimed at mothers who pump (often in their workplace or toilet) and think of themselves as "cows".
The ad does not praise or criticize the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, a group of women tell us that they all danced with the pump hidden in their bras.
The ad is based on the idea that many women feel like cows when they pump their breasts.
Although the LV pump is completely silent, it has no wires or tubes and fits nicely into the nursing bra, which allows women to walk, hold the baby and even go outside during pumping.
Anna Ballarin, Partner at MADAR and ECD, said: "The LV pump is a revolutionary product that should start with boldness and excitement.
By drawing parallels between women and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight breast pumping and all its challenges, in a fun and relatable way, revealing the incredible sense of relief that the new pump will bring.
LV Pump was not the first to make headlines.
At London Fashion Week, a mother of two used the product to walk a catwalk for designer Marta Zakubowski.
Hundreds of migrant children are being smuggled to a tent camp on the Texas border
The number of detained immigrant children has increased, although monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged, as the Trump administration's stringent rules and policies have made it harder to keep children with their sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors fear that they will lose their own chances of staying in the country by claiming undocumented immigrants and children themselves.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their families would have to submit fingerprints, and the information would be shared with immigration authorities.
Last week, a senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, Matthew Alvans, testified before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who applied to sponsor orphans.
The agency later reported that 70 percent of those arrested had no prior criminal history.
"About 80 percent of the sponsor's family members are in the country illegally and a large part of them are foreign criminals.
So we're still looking for them, says Nester Albenz.
In an effort to get the children back into society faster, officials introduced some new rules that include having them appear in court within a month of detention, which was previously 60 days, the shelters said.
Many will appear via video conference call rather than in person during their case for legal status with the immigration judge.
Those deemed unfit for relief will be promptly deported.
According to shelter workers and reports from the system in recent months, the more confined children are, the more likely they are to suffer from anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent incidents or attempted escape.
Supporters say the concerns are even more acute in larger centres like Tornillo, where children are more likely to be worried, neglected, and abandoned because of their size.
They also say that if children are moved to the centre without being mentally prepared or without enough time to say goodbye to friends, many of the trauma may multiply to the extent that they are already suffering.
US, French and Turkish 'occupation forces' asked to withdraw from Syria immediately
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muwalem called for the return of Syrian refugees, despite eight years of war in the country.
Mowaleem, who is also the Deputy Prime Minister of the country, said that foreign forces are illegally on the territory of the country under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that "we will take appropriate action".
"They must leave now unconditionally", he told the council.
Moallem stressed that the "war on terror is almost over" in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have been killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus would continue the war against both terrorists and "illegal foreign presence" until it had cleared all Syrian territory.
The US has about 2,000 troops in Syria, mainly to provide training and advice to both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs against President Bashar al-Assad.
More than 1,000 French troops are stationed in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moalim said that the situation is favorable for their return and he blamed "some Western countries" for "spreading unreasonable fear" that has induced refugees to stay away.
"We call on the international community and humanitarian organizations to assist in this return", he said.
They're making politics about the whole human problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that no reconstruction aid will be given to Syria until a political agreement is reached to end the war between Assad and the opposition.
The recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone at the last major rebel base in Idlib offers an opportunity to move forward through political dialogue, UN diplomats said.
The Russia-Turkey deal has prevented a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces in the area, which is home to three million people.
However, Moalim insisted that the deal has a "clear timeline" and expressed hope that the military action will work against jihadists, including al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front fighters, who will be "neutralized".
UN Ambassador Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon convene the first meeting of a new committee composed of members of the government and opposition to draft a post-war constitution and pave the way for elections.
Moalim stated the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying that the work of the panel should be limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and he warned against undue interference.
Why Trump will win a second term
In this argument, Trump will win re-election in 2020, as many liberals probably expect his presidency to end prematurely due to corruption and scandals.
Which would be "the most dramatic end to any president!"
So far, there is no sign of any change in the audience's opinion.
Since 2014, CNN's prime-time ratings have more than doubled to about 1.05 million, and MSNBC's have nearly tripled to 1.6 million.
Fox News' average prime-time viewership has risen from 1.7 million last year to nearly 2.4 million, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "The Rachel Maddow Show" tops the ratings with about 3.5 million viewers on big news nights.
Regarding a cabinet secretary who became president after the Capitol was destroyed in an attack, director Neil Baer of the ABC drama "Designated Survivor" said, "It's a fire that's attracting people because it's beyond our comprehension".
Another theory is that the author was veteran comedy writer Neal Scovell and "Just the Funny Parts: Some Hard Truths of Hollywood Boys Club".
He recalled a taxi ride before the 2016 election.
The driver asked him if he was voting for Mr. Trump.
Why? he asks.
He says, "Because, funny thing is, Miss Scovell told me".
The chaos has some entertainment value.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the events that emerge from Washington could determine the future of Row Five, whether immigrant families can reunite and what happens to the global economy.
Turning is a luxury that only the most privileged audience can afford.
And yet, it's beyond the understanding of an informed citizen to see a panel of experts debate for six hours the use of "deep background" for Bob Woodward's "Fearless", and Paul Manafort's use of a $15,000 camel-leather bomber jacket (the Washington Post says "thick clothing with hubris") and Mr. Trump's, um, physical details over the provocative speech by Stormy Daniels.
I'll never see Super Mario the same way again.
Regarding the Trump Show's daily rotating cast and daily plot changes (praising Kim Jong-un for his fight with the NFL), Brent Montgomery, chief executive of Wheelhouse Entertainment and the creator of "Pon Stars", said, "Some of what he's doing is like a reality show, every night he's doing some funny snacks".
You can't miss an episode or not watch it.
When I spoke to Mr. Fleiss this week, there were 80 sunny days outside his house on the north shore of Kauai, but he was still sitting at home watching MSNBC and recording CNN.
Brett Kavanaugh's confrontation with the Senate Judiciary Committee and the looming future of the Supreme Court have not helped him out.
"I remember when we were doing all the great shows in the days of signing and people were saying, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Mr. Fleiss told me.
I thought it was a joke, but it's real.

The midterm elections have flooded with outside money
It's no surprise that money is flying in Pennsylvania's 17th election, as two candidates are vying for the same seat courtesy of congressional district redistricting.
The newly redistricted Pittsburgh Suburban District of Pittsburg is bringing Democratic Rep. Conor Lamb - who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring - into the race.
Lamb is running against Republican Keith Rothfuss, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, much of which is part of the new 17th district.
In January, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old districts were unconstitutionally aligned in favor of Republicans, prompting the rearrangement of the map.
The election in the new 17th District has seen a money-laundering contest between the main party's Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Campaign Committee (NRC).
Lamb rose to prominence after winning a narrowly contested special election for Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district in March.
The seat had been held by Republicans for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political pundits are slightly ahead of the Democrats.
U.S. sanctions El Salvador for supporting China, later withdrawn
Diplomats note that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing, slightly behind Washington.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Verrell in June 2017 and also had a hotel in Panama, but the partners later removed the Trump Organization's management team.
"Following the recent decision not to recognise Taiwan", State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month, State Department officials decided to return the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama.
However, only El Salvador was sanctioned, which received about $140 million in US relief in 2017 for drug control, development and economic aid.
The proposed sanctions, which included cutting financial aid and certain visa bans, could have been painful for the Central American country due to its high unemployment and murder rates.
As the internal meeting progressed, North American and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference aimed at security and economic prosperity as a measure to prevent the influx of immigrants to the US like last year.
But by mid-September, top administration officials made it clear they wanted to hold the conference, effectively ending the possibility of El Salvador's punishment.
Diplomats said Vice President Mike Pence will address the conference, scheduled for mid-October, to give the administration a message of import.
And the American ambassadors from the three countries quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any new strong messages or sanctions from Washington.
A White House spokesman for Mr Bolton declined to comment on the statement by three US officials, including two diplomats who agreed to discuss internal affairs on condition of anonymity.
Their statement was confirmed by an outside analyst close to the administration, who also declined to be named.
Read the history
The next inevitable event may be Robert Mueller's special report on Mr. Trump's potential obstruction of justice, which now has ample evidence in the public record.
Mr. Mueller's investigation into whether Mr. Trump had any ties to Russia during the election is reportedly turning around.
If Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will have to take his place, just as he is preparing to go before the voters again and eventually, perhaps, his colleagues and the jury.
There are many ifs and buts, and I'm not saying that the fall of Mr. Trump or his European counterpart is inevitable.
We will have a choice of how long this conflict will last on both sides of the Atlantic.
In 1938, German officials might have "upset" Hitler, unless the West stopped him and sided with the Czechoslovaks in Munich.
We failed, and we missed the chance to avoid years of murder.
The course of history often takes such a turn, and in it the unstoppable pace of democracy is sometimes accelerated, sometimes delayed.
This is a turning point in American history.
What should we do if Mr. Trump dismisses Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who will determine the fate of Mr. Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been in danger since it was reported in the papers last year that he secretly suggested recording the president and speculating about his own incompetence in office.
Mr. Rosenstein said the Times story was false.
"What would be our response if the newly opened FBI investigation against Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair - or if he is found not guilty in the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual assault and perjury?
The big question is, will we elect a midterm Congress that can hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we fail this test, democracy will go into a long hibernation.
But I believe we will not fail, because we have learned from Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazis who once occupied my embassy.
He survived, escaped to America and, 60 years later, sent me to light Sabbath candles on a table with a swastika.
With this history, how can I not be optimistic about the future?
Norman Eisen, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, is chairman of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the author of The Last Palace: Five Lives and a Great House: Centuries of Europe's Troubles.
Graham Dorrance of the Rangers is optimistic before the Vienna Rapid Battle.
Rangers play Rapid Vienna on Thursday, and if they win against the Austrians after a great draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, they will have a good chance of qualifying from Group G of the Europa League.
Midfielder Graham Dorrance played his first game of the season due to a knee injury in a 2-2 draw with Villarreal, but he believes that they can get better based on the result.
"This point is very important because Villarreal is a good team", the 31-year-old said.
We went out with confidence and we took a point.
I could have won in the end, but overall, the draw seems a fair result.
They played well in the first half and we played well in the second half.
Thursday, another important night on the European stage.
Hopefully, we will get three points, but it will be a tough game, because they did well in their last game, but I am sure that with the support of the audience we can get positive results.
Last year didn't go so well, but with my injury and all the changes at the club, there's a good feeling in the current situation.
Our team is also good and the boys are having a great time; they are training well.
I hope that we can move forward and succeed after the last season.
Women are losing sleep over retirement savings
Although the survey participants had ideas on how to cope, very few people talked about it with their family members.
Half of the nationwide survey respondents said they had spoken to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their children about it.
"People want a family member to think about them, but they're not taking action to have that conversation", says Holly Snyder, vice president of life insurance business at Nationwide.
Know where to start.
If you do not make your wishes clear in advance, you will not prepare your family for your ministry.
Work with your counselor and your family to discuss where and how you want to receive care, because your choice of cost is also important.
Talk to your financial advisor: Your advisor can help you find solutions to manage these costs.
Your financing options for long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid cash-value life insurance policy or self-insurance with your own assets to help with these expenses if you have the money.
Solution bar from your legal documents: Try to avoid legal battles.
Get a proper healthcare proxy so that you appoint a trusted person to oversee your medical care and so that the professional will comply with your wishes if you are unable to contact them.
And, keep in mind a power of attorney for your property.
Choose a trusted person to make your financial decisions and make sure that your bills are paid correctly while you are disabled.
Keep things simple: Your elderly parent needs emergency medical attention and is being taken to the hospital.
Are you aware of his allergies and current medication?
Keep these things in a written plan so that you can be prepared.
And not only economically, the doctor said something.
What is the current medication schedule?
Who's gonna take care of the dog?
Keep it all planned.
A man was shot multiple times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
One man was shot multiple times with an air rifle on his way home after a night out.
The victim, Devon, in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
The officials said in a statement that the incident occurred at 02:30 BST.
The victim did not see his attacker.
His injuries are not serious and the police have requested a witness.
Earthquake and Tsunami in Indonesia
At least 384 people have died in the powerful earthquake and tsunami in the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday, officials said, with the death toll likely to rise further.
With communications disrupted, relief workers were unable to report any news in the Dongola Regency area north of Pallu, which is located near the epicentre of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
From Palo, more than 16,000 people have been rescued after the disaster.
Some important facts about the island of Palau and Dongola in Sulawesi:
The capital of Central Sulawesi State is Palu, which is located at the end of a narrow bay on the western coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 in 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Dongola is a regency that extends about 300 km (180 mi) northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is lower in status than the state, had an estimated population of 299,200 in 2017.
The main sources of economy in Central Sulawesi State, especially in the coastal area of Dongola, are fishing and agriculture.
Nickel mining is also important in the state, but most of it is located on the opposite side of the Sulawesi coast, in Morowali.
According to the Indonesian Disaster Management Agency, Palu and Dongola have been hit by several tsunamis in the last 100 years.
A tsunami in 1938 killed about 200 people in Dongola and destroyed hundreds of homes.
Dongola was also hit by a tsunami in 1996, which killed 9 people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific volcanic region and is often hit by earthquakes.
Some major earthquakes and tsunamis that have occurred recently:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in North Sumatra, Indonesia, triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean coastal region, more than half of them in Aceh.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds of people have died on Nias Island off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake hits the south of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, causing a tsunami that washes over the southern coast and kills about 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake hits near the city of Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people died.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter high tsunami that devastated dozens of villages and killed nearly 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake hits the Aceh province of Jaya, sparking devastation and panic by reliving the devastating memories of the 2004 tsunami.
Although there was no tsunami, more than 100 people died as homes collapsed.
2018: A major earthquake hits the Indonesian tourist island of Lambo, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the northern part of the island.
Thousands of homes were destroyed and thousands of tourists were temporarily trapped.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested for domestic violence
The eldest son of Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin has been charged with assault.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers, Pauline, 29, of Alaska, was arrested on charges of domestic violence and attempting to evade arrest.
According to police reports, when an acquaintance went to call the police in the wake of the incident, he took away her phone.
Pauline was placed in the custody of the Mat-Su Pretrial Facility on an unsecured bond of $500, KTUU reported.
He was brought to court on Saturday, where he claimed "absolute innocence", the network reported.
He is charged with a Class A misdemeanor, which carries a penalty of up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $250,000.
And it's a class B felony charge, which carries a maximum penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that Pauline has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, she was charged with assaulting her father, Todd Phillip.
His mother, Sarah Pauline, called the police about the attack.
The case is currently pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, domestic violence and drug use.
His girlfriend accused him of punching him in the face.
The Veterans Group criticized Sarah Palin in 2016 for linking her son's violent behavior to his PTSD service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds of dead
At least 384 people were killed in an earthquake on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5 magnitude quake triggered a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
Power and communications are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The tremor was felt near Central Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
The video of the moment of the incident is circulating on social media.
When the tsunami hit the shore, hundreds of people gathered to attend the beach festival in the city of Palo.
Federal prosecutors seek the death penalty for suspected terrorists in New York
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Saifullo Saipow, the suspect in the New York terror attacks that killed eight people, a rare sentence not carried out since 1953.
It is alleged that 30-year-old Saipov used a Home Depot rental truck to attack the West Side Highway bike path in Lower Manhattan in October, crushing cyclists and pedestrians.
According to the notice filed in the Southern District of New York requesting the death penalty, prosecutors must prove that Saipov "intentionally" killed eight people and "intentionally" inflicted serious injury to them in order to carry out the execution.
Both of these are sufficient to carry out the death penalty, according to court documents.
A week after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including eight counts of murder, which are typically brought in organized crime, along with charges of assault and car vandalism.
Citing the "cruel, brutal and distorted" way in which Saipov carried out the attack, prosecutors said it required "adequate planning and foresight".
Saifullo Habilulaiyevich Saipow, whose family and friends have been hurt, lost and damaged by Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleaves, Anne-Laura Decatt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erliz, Hernán Ferrucci, Hernán Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Mendoza, is notified of the intent.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
The last execution in the Southern District of New York was more than a decade ago.
Defendant Khalid Burns was convicted of the murder of two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last execution in a New York federal case was in 1953, against a married couple named Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, who had been convicted two years earlier of spying for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
The Rosenbergs were both executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a resident of Uzbekistan, has not expressed any remorse, the court report said.
Police said he said he felt happy after the incident.
Saipov told officials that he was inspired to carry out the attack by watching ISIS videos on his home phone, the indictment said.
Police said he also requested that ISIS flags be planted in his hospital room.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, a federal public defender representing Saipov, said they were "clearly disappointed" by the council's decision.
"We think that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than granting a life sentence will prolong the trauma of this incident for everyone involved", Patton said.
Saipov's legal team had previously called for the councillors' death sentences to be lifted.
MP Tory said Nigel Farage should be put in charge of Brexit negotiations.
Nigel Farage pledged to unite the people's forces in the protests at the Tory conference today.
The former UKIP leader said politicians had "a touch of excitement" from Euroscepticism - when Theresa May's own MP said she should be given the task of negotiating with the EU.
Conservative leader Peter Boone told a rally in Birmingham that if Mr Farage had been Brexit secretary, the UK would have 'gone out' of the EU by now.
But Mrs May's efforts to keep her deeply divided officials together became clear once again when the anti-Brexit Tories took part in another anti-Brexit protest in the city.
One of these pro-Brexit is trying to keep the Chequers deal on track amidst the anti-Brexit and EU attacks.
His allies insisted that he should strike a deal with Brussels despite opposition - and force the Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between his package and 'disorder'.
Mr. Sister Solihull told Live Means Live rally that he wanted 'Chuck Checkers'.
He suggested that Mr. Farage should be made a partner and given the task of negotiating with Brussels.
"If he was in charge, we would have gotten out of it", he said.
The Wellinborough MP added: "I will support Brexit, but we need chuck checkers".
Yeu said to his opponents: "We did not fight the world to survive by following the rules.
We want to make our own laws in our own country.
Mr. Bonn has dismissed the possibility of a change in public opinion after the 2016 election. The idea that the British people are changing their minds and want to stay in the EU - it is completely false.
Tory Brexit supporter Andre Jenkins was also at the rally, telling reporters: "All I want to say is: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
The Chequers are the dislike of the general public, the opposition will not vote for it, and the dislike of our party people and activists who have brought us here.
Take the checkers off and try to listen.
In a sharp tone, he said: "The Prime Minister is thinking about his position where he should deliver on his promises.
Mr. Farage told the rally that if the 2016 referendum decision is betrayed, politicians should be forced to realize the "deep state of affairs".
It is now a matter of trust between the people and the politicians, he said.
They are trying to betray Brexit and we will tell them that if they do, we will not let you escape.
Addressing the excited crowd, he added: "I want the politicians who are trying to betray Brexit to face the opposite.
We are driving the people's forces that have brought us victory in Brexit and will not rest until we are an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, anti-Brexit protesters marched for two hours through Birmingham city centre.
A group of workers have been displaying Brexit banners against the Tories since they formed at the end of the week.
Labour leader Adonis mocks the Conservatives at a conference after a security breach on a party app.
"Some people are telling us that they can keep the border uninterrupted, unfettered free trade on the Irish border, Canada Plus Plus and the IT system in order", he added.
It's a whole class joke.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren is considering a 'hard look' at running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would think deeply about running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a town hall in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, who has been a frequent critic of President Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state candidate Geoff Deale, who was the co-chair of Trump's Massachusetts campaign in 2016.
There is talk around him that he could run against Trump in the 2020 election.
The meeting was the 36th since Trump took office, with his organizers at Holyoke Town Hall on Saturday evening.
One participant asked him about running for president.
Warren responded, "It is time to fix our broken government under a woman's leadership".
Arrested for the shooting death of LSU Sims.
Baton Rouge, LA police said Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wade Simms on Friday.
Deaton Simpson, 20, was arrested at 11 a.m., the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
They released a video of a shooting on Friday, asking for the person to be identified.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed on the campus of Southern University on Friday morning.
Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the media that Wade Sims was killed by a gunshot wound to the head, 247Sports reported.
Wade was attacked by Simpson while trying to save his friend.
Simpson was questioned and admitted to being at the scene, to having a gun, and to shooting Wade Simms.
Simpson was immediately arrested and taken into custody by the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-6 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, started 10 games and played in 32 total games last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton moves closer to world title with victory on gift from teammate Sebastian Vettel
This was made clear when on Saturday Valter Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton and said that Mercedes' team order would play a key role in the race.
Bottas started well from the pole, almost ignoring Hamilton, holding his position on the first two wickets and inviting Vettel to attack his own teammates.
Vettel left Hamilton behind the crowd and went into the pit himself, which could have been decisive.
The Mercedes driver pitched the next lap and came behind Vettel, but Hamilton went on after a tense fight, which showed the Ferrari driver making a double-move and leaving the pit empty at the risk of inadvertently missing an opportunity.
Max Verstappen started from the back row on his 21st birthday and was seventh after the first lap.
Then he was ahead for most of the race, then he got the wrong tyre and finished fourth behind Kimi Raikkonen.
He pitched on lap 44, but failed to accelerate for the remaining eight laps, leaving Raccoon in fourth place.
It was a tough day, because Valterie fought well all weekend and acted like a real gentleman.
The team is doing a great job of getting in first place, Hamilton said.
That was terrible body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday for not leaking a letter written by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh alleging sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not address the issue directly, instead saying that what is happening in the Senate is reflecting the "low and ugly and lying" mentality of the people.
"The one thing that could have happened and the beautiful thing that's been going on in the Senate for the last few weeks is, you're going to see anger, when you see low and ugly and lying people", he said.
When they see the leak, they'll say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
Oh, I didn't do that.
Do you remember?
Diane Feinstein, what did you leak?
Remember his answer... did you leak the documents... oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, I know.
I didn't leak.
Hey, wait a minute.
We leaked... no, we didn't, he said, faking the senator.
The letter was sent to Ford Feinstein in July with a description of the charges against Kavanaugh, and the letter was leaked in September - but Feinstein denied that the letter had been leaked from his office.
"I did not hide Dr. Ford's allegations, I did not leak anything", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reports.
He told me to keep it a secret and I kept it a secret as he told me to.
But the president didn't digest it, and he opened up about it at a rally on Saturday night: "I'm telling you what happened, it was very bad body language.
Maybe he didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Speaking in favor of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president said Democrats were using the allegations to their own ends.
They want to regain power at any cost.
"Look at the low mentality, look at the cruelty, don't stop them from hurting anyone, don't stop them from trampling someone to gain power and control", the president said, according to Merme Mediat.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dyer scored twice for the Giants against Dundee.
The Dundee Stars won the return leg in Dundee on Saturday 5-3 after conceding the loss to the Belfast Giants in Friday's Elite League game.
The Giants quickly took a two-goal lead thanks to goals from Patrick Dyer and Francis Bavieri.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Coney tied the game for home and the Giants took the lead with a goal from Deer.
Francois Bouchard scored the equaliser for Dundee and Lucas Lundwalt Nielson scored the winning goal.
It was Adam Keefe's third defeat in the Elite League, as they were relegated to Belfast on Friday night after a 2-1 defeat to Dundee.
The two teams have met four times this season, with the Giants winning the last three.
Dyer's first goal came with the help of Kendall McFaul at 3:35 of the fourth minute of the game, he doubled the lead for Baviary with David Rutherford four minutes later.
Sullivan took the lead early in the game, bringing the hosts back into the game at 13:10 and then at 15:16 with Matt Marquart's help, Coney tied the game.
Dier scored his second goal in the end of the first half to ensure the Giants' lead.
The hosts returned to play and Bouchard returned to tie the game with a power play goal at 27:37.
Connie and Charles Corcoran helped Nelson to take Dundee to the lead for the first time in the game at the end of the second half and eventually held the lead to win the game.
The Giants, who have lost four of their last five games, will play their next home game against Milton Keynes next Friday.
Air traffic controllers have saved hundreds of lives in the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being given a hero status after he died helping a plane carrying more than 100 passengers fly.
More than 800 people died and many are missing on Sulawesi Island on Friday in the tsunami caused by a major earthquake.
The area was shaking repeatedly in the strong aftershocks and people were trapped in the rubble in Pulut.
But despite all his colleagues fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan Palur Mutiara did not leave the horribly hanging control tower of Sis Al Juffrey Airport.
He went to make sure that Battic Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could fly safely.
Then he jumped down in fear of the control tower collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Indonesia Air Navigation spokesman Johannes Sirit said his decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News reports.
We arranged for a helicopter from Balikpapan in Kalimantan to take him to a big hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, he died before the helicopter reached Palouse this morning.
"Our hearts are broken", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could exceed thousands, while the Disaster Management Agency said communications in Dongola, Siigi and Butong cities were limited.
The death toll is believed to be rising as many bodies are trapped under debris that have yet to be reached, said agency spokesman Sotopo Puro Nugroho.
The six-meter high wave destroyed the Pallu where mass graves were to be set up on Sunday.
Relief and assistance is being delivered by military and commercial aircraft.
The 35-year-old mother, Risa Kusuma, told Sky News: "Every minute, the ambulance is bringing in bodies.
There is no clean water.
Small markets have been looted everywhere.
Jean Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross is quickly delivering aid to the survivors, but we don't know what we'll see there.
It's already sad, but it could be worse.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited Palo on Sunday and told the country's military: "I urge you to stay on the ground day and night in the rescue operation.
Are you ready? CNN reports.
Earlier this year, an earthquake hit Lambo, Indonesia, killing more than 550.
Micronesia plane crash: Air New Guinea reports one missing in Laguna plane crash
When a plane of this airline crashed in the Pacific Lagoon in Micronesia, they had previously reported that all 47 passengers and crew were rescued from the sinking plane.
Air New Guinea said in a report on Saturday afternoon that a male passenger was missing.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to track him down.
The airline immediately declined to disclose details such as the age and nationality of the passenger.
Some local boats helped rescue passengers and crew after the plane crashed into the water while trying to land at Chuck Island Airport.
Officials said on Friday that seven people were taken to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still in hospital on Saturday, and they were all in stable condition.
The cause of the accident is not yet clear.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the plane went down before reaching the runway.
Some witnesses thought the plane had crossed the runway.
American passenger Bill Jans said the plane had gone too low.
"Which is a good thing", Jens said.
Jens said he and others reached the emergency doors of the sinking plane by crossing the waist water.
He said the flight crew were screaming in panic and he suffered minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said sailors working on a nearby jet were also helping with the rescue, bringing people ashore in air-filled boats before the plane sank 30 meters (100 feet) into the water.
According to the Aviation Safety Network, 111 people have died on the PNG-registered airline in the past two decades, but no accidents have occurred on Air New Guinea.
Analysts were able to determine the time of the burning of the woman alive
The prosecution is holding a retrial on Saturday of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
U.S. forensic analyst Paul Rowlett has testified for hours as an expert in intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cellphone records to create a stream of events on the night of his death of 29-year-old defendant Quinton Telles and 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers.
Rowlett said he recovered several cell phone records that suggest Telles and Chambers were together on the evening of the death, which is contrary to Telles' previous press release, Clarion Laser's report.
The information indicates that his cell phone was with Chambers at the time, although he insisted he was with his friend Michael Sanford, who police spoke to.
Sanford testified Saturday that he was not in town that night.
When prosecutors questioned whether Telles was telling the truth that he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford replied that it was a lie, because his truck was in Nashville that night.
Another discrepancy is that Telles said he knew Chambers from two weeks before he died.
Cell phone records show they've only known each other for a week.
Raolet said that shortly after Chambers' death, Teles deleted text, call and contact information from his phone.
"He took her out of his life", Haley said.
The final arguments in the case are scheduled for Sunday.
The judge said the case is expected to go to the jury the next day.

Another black?!
A New York nanny sues a couple for firing them after a racist text.
A New York nanny is suing the couple for discriminatory eviction after receiving a misleading text from a mother calling her "another black".
The couple denied the accusations of racism and sought a trial on charges of "bullying".
Lynsey Plasco-Falxman, a mother of two, expressed her disappointment on her first day of work in 2016 when she learned that Giselle Morris, the new baby sitter, was black.
Another black woman, Mrs. Plasco-Falxman, texted her husband.
Anyway, she sent it to Miss Morris instead of her husband, twice.
Later realizing her mistake, the "uncomfortable" Plasco-Falxman fired Ms. Morris, saying that the poor performance of their former nanny, who was African-American, had led her to expect a Filipino, the New York Post reports.
Ms. Morris was given a day off and then Uber sent her home.
Morris is now suing the couple for damages in the eviction case and is seeking compensation in the amount of $350 a day for six months, despite being first hired as a stay-at-home nanny without a contract.
"I want to show them, look, you can't do that", he told the Post on Friday, and added, "I know it's discriminatory".
The couple argued against their claims of racism, saying that it was reasonable to expel Morris for fear that he would not be trusted after the charges were filed against him.
He didn't want to say what my wife sent.
He is not a racist.
We are not a racist couple, husband Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you leave your children in the hands of someone you mistreated, even though it was wrong?
Your newborn?
Tell me what you think.
Regarding the allegations of abuse, Plasco said his wife had given birth only two months ago and was in a "very difficult situation".
Would you want to go up against someone like that?
That's not a good thing to do, said the investment banker.
The couple's behaviour and arguments were strongly condemned on social media by the People's Court in the context of ongoing legal proceedings.
Paddington Publications fears readers may not be able to relate to talking bears, a new paper reveals
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to say what will be in the minds of first-time readers before publication.
It's funny to hear that after the huge success of Paddington.
His father, who worked as a BBC cameraman before being inspired to write a children's book by Little Toy Bear, said he would have been optimistic about rejecting his work. He also said that the 60th anniversary of the book's publication was "a bit of a shock" to him after his death last year.
Regarding Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of our family", she said her father was very proud of her ultimate success.
"He was a quiet man, and not a cocky man", he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, as if your own child had achieved something: you were proud of him, even though you had nothing to do with it.
I think that's how he saw Paddington's success.
Although it was his own creation and imagination, he always credited Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
After landing, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 Hospital in Nice, where doctors tried in vain to save her life.
Nad called regularly and said it was very bad, and she probably wouldn't live, said Mrs. Ednan-Laperoz.
Then I got a call from Ned and found out he was going to die in two minutes, and I had to say goodbye on the phone.
And I do that.
I say, "Tashi, darling, I love you very much.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll come to you.
The drugs that doctors gave her to keep her heart working were slowly stopping working in her body and leaving her body.
He died a short time ago and then it all stopped.
I had no choice but to sit and wait, knowing everything.
I couldn't even scream or cry, because I was surrounded by family and people.
I had to hold on.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperoz, then mourning the death of her daughter, boarded the plane along with the other passengers - she was unmindful of the difficult situation.
"No one knows", he said.
I was down, my eyes were watering.
It's hard to describe, but I was sitting on a plane and I was experiencing Ned's unbearable pain.
That she needs my love and compassion.
I know how much he loved her.
This woman posted a card on the bridge to stop suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide work to stop others from committing suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphries posted cards with inspirational messages at Welsh Bridge and placed phone numbers where people could call for help.
Ms. Davis' son Tyler suffered from depression from the age of 13 and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parents to feel what I do all the time", he said.
Ms Davis, 45, who lives in Lydney, said her son was a promising chef with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
Everyone said that his smile made the house brighter.
However, he quit before he died, because he had really gone into the dark.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, then 11, found her dead.
"I am constantly concerned that this effort will be disrupted", Ms. Davis said.
Ms. Davis made a card to let everyone know that there is someone you can talk to, maybe a friend.
Don't sit silent - we need to talk.
Ms. Humphries, who was Ms. Davis' girlfriend for many years, lost her partner of 15 years, Mark, shortly after her mother's death.
"She never said she was upset or depressed or anything", he said.
I noticed some changes in his behavior two days before Christmas.
She was very unhappy on Christmas Day - she didn't even look at the children when they opened their presents.
She said that her death was a huge emotional blow for them, but it had to be overcome: it created a huge void in the family.
They cut us off.
But we have to fight along the way.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is in question as the FBI investigates.
"I thought, if we could give him something he wanted - because the investigation is limited in time, limited in scope - we might be able to bring some unity", Mr. Flake said Saturday. He added that he feared the committee might be broken up" in the face of this biased stalemate.
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want an FBI investigation?
Their obligations are related to time.
November 6, just five weeks before the midterm elections - if, as expected, the Republicans do poorly, their bid to get the man of the year on the nation's highest court will be very weak.
George W. Bush is calling the Senators and appealing to them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House under Mr. Bush. Through him, Mr. Bush meets his wife, Ashley, who was Mr. Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI filed the report?
A vote will be held in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
It is not yet clear whether Mr. Kavanaugh will get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Vice President Mike Pence to tie him up for the Supreme Court.
North Korean defection has decreased under Kim
North Korea's defection rate has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker has said.
Park Byung-seok, citing South Korea's Unification Ministry, said the number of defections last year was 1,127 - up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the main reason for this is the tight border controls between North Korea and China and the money-laundering of human traffickers.
Pyongyang has not commented publicly.
A large number of North Korean defectors have been granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
Most have fled through China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier than crossing the DMZ between the two Koreas.
China treats these refugees not as refugees, but as illegal immigrants, and often forcibly returns them to their homeland.
Relations between North and South Korea - which are still effectively at war - have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the two leaders met in Pyongyang for talks, with the focus on stalled nuclear disarmament talks.
This comes after a historic meeting in Singapore in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, when they roughly agreed to work towards creating a nuclear-weapon-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security, and in such a situation we will not unilaterally disarm ourselves first", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", saying he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said she is inherently unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi made the remarks in an interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I couldn't help but think that if a woman ever did something like that, she would be called hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.
Kavanaugh has strongly denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blazy when they were both teenagers.
During his opening remarks, Kavanaugh was emotional, screaming and breathless as he talked about his family and high school life.
He blatantly denounced the Democrats in the committee and called the charges against him a "weird and conspiratorial character organized by liberals", alleging that it was done out of anger at Hillary Clinton's loss in the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said he believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves he is not qualified for the Supreme Court, because it shows he is biased against Democrats.
"I think he's proven himself incompetent in the way he's made statements and the way he's impeached Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
When asked if he would impeach Kavanaugh if confirmed and Democrats won a majority in the House, Pelosi expressed dismay.
"I'm going to say this -- if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only unfit for the Supreme Court, but he's unfit for the court he's in right now", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, he is concerned that Kavanaugh will oppose the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, because he is a conservative justice himself.
At his confirmation hearing, Kavanaugh avoided the question of whether he would change some of the Supreme Court's decisions.
"We can't let a hysterical, biased person go to court and tell us it's not great", Pelosi said.
And women should control it.
It's a fair debate, months and years of anger coming out, and he can't stop crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Ms. Steinmeier told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's rare, what do you say?
She also said, "I was helped a lot by a female executive who said that she would cry when she was angry, but she chose to approach her anger and crying by saying to the person she was talking to, 'You might think I'm sad because I'm crying.'
I'm actually pissed off.
Then he would go on.
I thought it was amazing.
Tears serve in part as an expression of anger, because they are primarily a misunderstanding.
One of my fondest memories of my early work, in a male-dominated office, where I once saw myself crying in unbelievable rage, an elderly woman grabbing my scarf -- a terrible manager I'd always been a little afraid of -- dragging me up the stairs.
"Never let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they'll be happy to see you.
Patrick Schroeder, then-Democratic Congressman from Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
When Mr. Hart was caught in the monkey business overseas in 1987 about divorce and dropped out of the race for dirty work, deeply disappointed, Ms. Schroeder felt that there was no reason not to run for president herself.
"It was not a very thoughtful decision", he said with a smile 30 years later.
Seven other candidates are already in the race, and no one wants another candidate.
Someone called it Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.
He was late with fundraising because of the delay in the campaign, and so he vowed not to run until he had raised $2 million.
It was a battle of defeat.
He saw that a man who gave a supporter $1,000 was only getting $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" he said, surprised.
When she announced that she would not run for office, she was overwhelmed with emotion and gratitude for her supporters, frustrated with the system that made fundraising difficult, targeted voters rather than representatives, and sick with anger about gender inequality.
"You might think I'm having a nervous breakdown", Ms. Schroeder recalled the media reaction.
You might think Clinix is my corporate sponsor.
I remember thinking, where are they gonna bury me?
Did he cry?
How can the US-China trade war go in Beijing's favor?
The first phase of the US-China trade war was tumultuous, and while the war is in its final stages, experts say Beijing could benefit in the long run from the conflict between the two countries.
US President Donald Trump first warned earlier this year by raising tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The most significant pass came this week, when new tariffs were imposed on almost half of all imports from China, amounting to about $200 billion (£150 billion).
Beijing has retaliated as it has every time - most recently, it raised tariffs of five to 10 percent on $60 billion of US goods.
China has decided to fight with its eyes closed and the world's second largest economy is not likely to turn a blind eye anytime soon.
To push back Washington means to make a claim, but to bow to the US in public would be extremely insulting to Chinese President Xi Jinping.
Still, experts say that if Beijing can play the dice right, the pressure of the US trade war could help China positively in the long run by reducing interdependence between the two economies.
"Any hasty political decision by Washington or Beijing that could lead to the start of economic collapse in both countries is far more dangerous than the general public imagines", said Abigail Grace, an associate researcher at the Center for a New American Security, a think tank that specializes in Asia.
Syria is ready to take back its refugees, the foreign minister said.
Syria says it is ready to accept the voluntary return of refugees, and calls for the reconstruction of the country devastated by seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muwalem said the situation in the country was improving.
The situation is stable and secure today because of the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is continuing with the rehabilitation efforts to restore normalcy in the areas devastated by terrorists.
The situation is now favorable for the voluntary return of people who have been forced to leave their country due to the disruption of daily life and livelihood due to terrorism and the surrounding economic situation.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
The remaining 6 million people who have fled the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Muwalem said the Syrian government welcomes all assistance in the reconstruction of the country.
However, he also stressed that no conditional aid will be accepted or any help from the country that supports the rebels.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe defeated Team USA in the final score of 16.5-10.5 at Le Golf National outside Paris in France to win the 2018 Ryder Cup.
The USA lost six straight on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup since 1993.
Led by Danish captain Thomas Beuys, Team Europe reached the 14.5 points needed to beat the USA and regain the title.
US star Phil Mickelson, who was not playing well for most of the tournament, hit his T-Shot at the par-3 16th hole, and lost to Francisco Molinari in his match.
Italian golfer Molinari has performed brilliantly in all rounds, becoming one of only four players to score 5-0-0 since the tournament's current format began in 1979.
Jordan Speith, the American, the lowest ranked player on the European team, was eliminated by Thorbjørn Olsen of Denmark, 5 and 4.
The world's top ranked player, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who played what may have been his last Ryder Cup.
The eight-time Ryder Cup veteran, Sergio Garcia of Spain, became the all-time leader in wins in Europe with 25.5 career points.
I don't usually cry, but I couldn't this time.
It's been a bad year.
Thank you Thomas for choosing me and for believing in me.
I'm so happy to have the cup back.
"It's a team achievement, I'm happy that I was able to help", Garcia said, emotional about the European victory.
He handed the reins to his country's John Ram, who defeated US golfer Tiger Woods 2-1 in Sunday's singles.
"I am very proud of Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", said 23-year-old John Ram.
Woods has lost all four of his matches in France, and his record in the Ryder Cup stands at 13-21-3.
That's an unprecedented statistic for one of the greatest players of all time, who has won 14 major titles, second only to Jack Nicklaus, who is at the top.
With the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who performed at a high level, Team USA stumbled all weekend.
U.S. captain Jim Furyk said after his team's disappointing performance, "I'm proud of them, they fought.
We put some pressure on Europe this morning.
We didn't.
Congratulations to Thomas.
He's a good captain.
All 12 of his players have played very well.
We'll turn around, I'll work with the PGA of America and the Ryder Cup Committee and move on.
I love these 12 and am proud to be their captain.
You have to respect them.
We didn't make it in the game.
Red stream updates: the density has decreased in Pinellas, Manati and Sarasota
A brand new report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission shows a general decline in red tide density in the Tampa Bay area.
According to the FWC, pathogen blooms have been observed in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - indicating decreasing concentrations.
The Red Stream Bloom stretches from Pinellas in the north to Lee County in the south for about 130 miles of coastline.
The patch can be seen about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but it's less noticeable than it was last week.
Red currents have also been observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations were reported in Pinellas County on and off the coast, high to low off the coast of Hillsborough County, high to low in Manati County, high in Sarasota County on and off the coast, moderate in Charlotte County, high to low in Lee County on and off the coast, and low in Collier County.
