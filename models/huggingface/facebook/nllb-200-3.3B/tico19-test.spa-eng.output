The following information shall be provided in the case of a new outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) in the European Union or the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom:
The cumulative incidence of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases shows similar trends in the countries of the European Union or European Economic Area and the United Kingdom, confirming that, although at different stages depending on the country, the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in all countries.
Based on the experience of Italy, countries, hospitals and intensive care units need to improve their preparedness for a wave of COVID-19 patients who will require medical care and, in particular, intensive care.
On 31 December 2019, a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown etiology was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that the causative agent was a novel coronavirus now known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Since then, the disease caused by infection with SARS-CoV-2 has been called coronavirus disease (COVID-19).
Evidence to date indicates that 80% of people with COVID-19 have a mild illness, i.e., a respiratory tract infection with or without pneumonia, and that most recover.
In 14% of cases, COVID-19 progresses to a more serious illness requiring hospitalization, while the remaining 6% of cases develop a critical illness requiring intensive care.
The mortality rate in hospitalized patients for COVID-19 is 4%.
In this study, we examined trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 in each country in the European Union or European Economic Area (EU/EEA) and the United Kingdom (UK) and compared them with those in Hubei Province, China.
We also compared the current number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK with that of Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
Cases of COVID-19 in EU/EEA countries and the UK
After China, COVID-19 continued to spread geographically and the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in the rest of the world currently follows that of this country.
On 11 March 2020, the director general of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic.
In the 5 March 2020 edition of Eurosurveillance, Spiteri et al. reported on the first confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Europe according to the WHO case definition.
In the EU/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were recorded in France on 24 January 2020, in people who had returned from Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases had been detected in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the United Kingdom (UK), with 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths reported as of 31 December 2019, of which 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths occurred in Italy alone.
Getting the cumulative amount and cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the counts of reported COVID-19 cases in each country of the world, obtained only from official sources, such as the country's Ministry of Health, national and regional health authorities and the WHO, are updated every day at 8:00 a.m.
These data were used to examine COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA and the UK and to compare them with Italy.
As an indicator of the prevalence of active COVID-19 cases, we calculated the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases truncated to 14 days; thus, we took into account the natural course of COVID-19 in each EU/EEA country and the UK, during the period from 1 January to 15 March 2020.
We also present the cumulative number of cases reported in each country as of 15 March 2020, at 8:00 a.m., compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 trends in the EU/EEA countries and the UK
Trends in cumulative incidence of COVID-19 cases truncated to 14 days in EU/EEA countries and the UK, in general, followed that of Hubei Province (China) (Figure 1).
In the EU/EEA and the UK in general, the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 began to increase around 21 February and then increased considerably around 28 February 2020 (additional material).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of reported cases from Italy, but all other EU/EEA countries and the UK exhibited upward trends of similar cumulative COVID-19 incidence (complementary material).
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU/EEA countries and the UK, compared to Italy for the period 31 January to 15 March 2020.
It highlights that, as of March 15 at 8:00 a.m., 15 other EU/EEA countries and the UK had already registered a total number of cases comparable to that of Italy only 3 weeks earlier or less.
Our results indicate that the number of reported COVID-19 cases is increasing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
The observed trends in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19 suggest that the pandemic is progressing at a similar pace in all countries.
This is despite the different stages countries are at, variations in national public health responses and possibly different case definitions in countries and different protocols for selecting patients to be tested to confirm COVID-19, including delayed testing.
In early March 2020, doctors in the affected regions of Italy described a situation where 10% of COVID-19 patients required intensive care, and media reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these regions had already reached their maximum capacity.
Data on admissions of COVID-19 cases to a hospital or intensive care unit are currently available at EU/EEA level for only 6% and 1% of cases, respectively (data not shown).
However, they should be collected systematically to complement current surveillance data that focus on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths.
A study in 201011 showed a large variation in the availability of intensive care and intermediate care beds in Europe, ranging from 29.2 in Germany to 4.2 beds per 100 000 inhabitants in Portugal.
This means that countries may have more or less resources than Italy (12.5 ICU and intermediate care beds per 100 000 inhabitants in 2010).
Model scenarios regarding health care capacity saturation, with estimates for each EU/EEA and UK country of the prevalence of COVID-19 hospitalizations associated with a >90% risk of exceeding intensive care bed capacity, are provided in the sixth update of the ECDC's rapid COVID-19 risk assessment.
Given that, so far, case clusters have been formed in certain regions of EU/EEA countries and the UK, and that hospitals and intensive care units normally serve a defined regional catchment population, information on cases and intensive care beds should preferably be made available at the level of the Nomenclature of Territorial Statistical Units 2 (NUTS-2).
The experience of Italy and current trends in other countries show that the COVID-19 pandemic is progressing rapidly in the EU/EEA and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units therefore need to prepare for a scenario of sustained community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and an increase in the number of patients with COVID-19 requiring medical care and in particular intensive care, such as is occurring in the affected regions of Italy.
As indicated in the ECDC's rapid risk assessment, a rapid, proactive and comprehensive approach to slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 is essential, with a shift from a containment approach to one of mitigation, given that the expected rapid increase in the number of cases may not give decision-makers and hospitals enough time to understand, accept and adapt their response accordingly if not implemented in advance.
The Rapid Risk Assessment also lists public health measures needed to mitigate the impact of the pandemic.
There is a brief window of opportunity during which countries have the possibility to deepen their control efforts to curb the spread of SARS-CoV-2 and decrease the pressure on the health system.
If this is not done, health systems in other EU/EEA countries are likely to face a wave of patients requiring intensive care in the coming days and weeks.
The 2019 coronavirus disease outbreak (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has so far caused the death of 3000 people and infected over 80 000 in China and other parts of the world, causing a catastrophe for humans.
Similarly to its homologous virus, SARS-CoV, which caused SARS in thousands of people in 2003, SARS-CoV-2 could also be transmitted from bats and cause similar symptoms through a similar mechanism.
However, COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality than SARS, but is much more transmissible and affects older people more than young people and more men than women.
In response to the growing number of publications on the emerging disease, the purpose of this article is to provide a timely and comprehensive analysis of the rapidly developing research topic.
We will cover the basics of epidemiology, etiology, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
While many questions remain unanswered, we hope this analysis will help us understand and eradicate this threatening disease.
The Spring Festival on January 25, 2020 has become an unheard of and unforgettable memory for all Chinese people, who were urged to stay at home for the entire holiday and for several weeks more due to the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus has almost the same name as the coronavirus (CoV) that caused an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; for this reason, on 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named it SARS-CoV-2, and the associated disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
The epidemic began in Wuhan, China and quickly spread across the country and to nearly 50 more countries around the world.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus has resulted in more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, with more than 40,000 patients discharged and more than 3,000 patients deceased.
WHO warns that COVID-19 is the number 1 public enemy and that it is potentially more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 scientific papers on COVID-19, including its virology, epidemiology, etiology, diagnosis and treatment, have been published since the first report on 7 January 2020, which determined the sequence of the virus isolated from multiple patients.
The aim of this analysis is to summarise the research progress on this new and rapidly developing subject.
Where possible, we will attempt to compare COVID-19 with SARS and another disease caused by a CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS, an outbreak in 2012).
We will also examine what is known so far about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some key questions that have yet to be answered.
Coronaviruses have traditionally been considered non-lethal pathogens to humans, primarily causing about 15% of common colds.
However, in this century, we have twice encountered highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, namely SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused an outbreak originally in China in 2003 and Saudi Arabia in 2012, respectively, and soon spread to many other countries with a shocking morbidity and mortality rate.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is the third coronavirus in recorded human history.
As shown in Fig. 1,1, pneumonia conglomerates of unknown origin were first reported on 31 December 2019 from Wuhan to the National Health Commission of China.
Seven days later, the coronavirus sequence was released.
On January 15, 2020, the first fatal case was recorded in Wuhan.
Meanwhile, the epidemic spread rapidly to cities, provinces, and neighboring countries.
On January 20, infection from health care providers was reported, suggesting that human-to-human transmission was possible.
On January 23, the city of Wuhan was placed under quarantine and all public transport was suspended.
On 24 January, the first clinical study of the disease reported that, of the 41 patients with confirmed cases, only 21 had had direct contact with the Wuhan seafood market which was considered the origin of infection from an unknown animal source.
On January 30, the WHO declared the outbreak a global health emergency.
As of the date of this report, the disease has already spread throughout China and nearly 50 other countries worldwide (Fig. (Fig. 2).2).
As the situation is evolving rapidly, the final size and severity of the outbreak cannot yet be determined.
On 11 February 2020, a multicentre study of 8866 patients, including 4021 patients with confirmed COVID-19, presented a more up-to-date illustration of the epidemic described below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 infected people of all ages, but mainly people aged 30 to 65.
Almost half (47.7%) of those infected were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 and only 14 infected people were under 10 years old.
SARS-CoV-2 was more likely to infect men (0.31/100 000) than women (0.27/100 000).
COVID-19 has spread in clusters mostly in Hubei and its surrounding areas.
On average, 5 days (2 to 9) elapsed between the onset and diagnosis of COVID-19.
The average incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2).
The average time from appearance to death was 9.5 days (between 4.8 and 13).
The baseline reproductive number (R0) was 3.77 (95% CI: 3.51-4.05) and the adjusted R0 was 2.23-4.82.
The number of infected people increased exponentially before January 23, 2020, which coincides with the time of mass mobilization before the Spring Festival in China.
The mortality in patients with confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI 1.10-1.86%), and the adjusted mortality in all patients was 3.06% (95% CI 2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 were sex (male), age (≥60) and severe pneumonia.
Coronaviruses are a subfamily of large, coiled viruses that contain a single-stranded RNA.
They can be divided into four genera, namely, alpha, beta, gamma, and delta, of which alphacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses are those that infect humans.
The spike glycoprotein (S) of the envelope binds to its cellular receptors, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively, and then membrane fusion occurs.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after replication of the viral genome, the genomic RNA, along with the glycoproteins of the envelope and the proteins of the nucleocapsid, form vesicles containing virions, which then fuse with the plasma membrane to release the virus.
The first SARS-CoV-2 genome sequence was announced on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 was found to be a new type of betacoronavirus with a genetic identity of over 99.98 percent in 10 sequenced samples taken from the original outbreak site: the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Using a transmission electron microscope, particles of SARS-CoV-2 were found in ultra-thin sections of the human respiratory epithelium.
Human ACE2 was determined to be a receptor for SARS-CoV-2, as well as SARS-CoV.
However, the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to human ACE2 more weakly than that of SARS-CoV, which is consistent with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 causes less severe infection in patients than SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also form a new short protein encoded by orf3b and a secreted protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 orf3b may have a role in viral pathogenicity and inhibition of IFNβ expression; however, orf8 contains no known functional domain or motif.
On 18 February 2020, Zhou, et al., revealed the full-length human ACE2 electron cryomicroscopy structure at resolution 2.9 Å, in complex with the transporter amino acid B0AT1.
They found that the complex, which had open and closed conformations, assembled as a dimer, and that the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can join two S proteins, providing evidence for the recognition and infection of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could become a therapeutic target for studying drugs to suppress SARS-CoV-2 infection.
The origin and the intermediate host
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are known to have originated in bats and transmitted to humans via civets and camels, respectively.
In a phylogenetic comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with other coronaviruses, the bat was considered to be the native host of SARS-CoV-2, as the new virus is identical in 96% to two bat SARS-like coronaviruses called bat-SL-CoVZX45 and bat-SL-CoVZX21.
However, it is still unknown which intermediate host helped the virus cross the species barrier to infect humans, and the route of transmission remains unclear.
Ji, et al., proposed snakes as carriers of the virus from bats to humans, which implied homologous recombination within the S protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, suggested that pangolins (long-nosed mammals that feed on ants and are commonly used in traditional Chinese medicine) are a possible intermediate host of SARS-CoV-2 based on a 99% genetic homology in a coronavirus discovered in pangolins and SARS-CoV-2.
However, a 1% difference spread over the totality of two genomes is still a large difference; therefore, conclusive results are expected to provide concrete evidence (Fig. (Fig. 33).
The physicochemical properties of SARS-CoV-2 are still largely unknown.
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can survive in vitro for 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at below 20 °C with 40-50% humidity.
SARS-CoV-2 may possess similar properties.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and heat at 56 °C for 30 minutes; ether, 75% ethanol, a chlorine disinfectant, perchloric acid, chloroform and other fat solvents, but not chlorhexidine, are effective in deactivating the virus.
The entire human population in general lacks immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and is therefore susceptible to the new coronavirus.
So far, no detailed study on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 has been announced.
Consequently, we can only rely on previous studies with other coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (fig. (fig. 4).4).
Generally, after the virus invades the host, it is first recognized by the innate immune system of the host through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), including type C lectin receptors, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through various pathways, the virus induces the expression of inflammatory factors, the maturation of dendritic cells and the synthesis of type I interferons (IFN) that limit the spread of the virus and accelerate the macrophage phagocytosis of viral antigens.
However, the N protein of SARS-CoV can help the virus escape immune responses.
Soon, the adaptive immune response joins in the fight against the virus.
T lymphocytes, including CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, play an important role in defence.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce virus-specific antibodies, and CD8+ T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
The cooperating T cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines to help the defending cells.
However, coronaviruses can inhibit the functions of T cells by inducing T cell apoptosis.
Humoral immunity, which includes complements such as C3a and C5a and antibodies, is also essential to fight viral infection.
For example, antibodies isolated from a recovered patient neutralized MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, an overreaction of the immune system generates locally a large number of free radicals that can cause serious damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst case, multi-organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by emergence in conglomerates, is more likely to affect older people with comorbidities and pregnant women.
It is common for people who are exposed to a large number of viruses or whose immune functions are compromised to have a higher chance of becoming infected than others.
The estimated average incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is 1 to 14 days, mostly 3 to 7 days, according to a study of the first 425 cases in Wuhan.
However, a study of 1099 cases shows that the incubation period was 3 days on average and ranged from 0 to 24 days.
A more recent study, as described above, demonstrates that the incubation period was 4.8 days (between 3.0 and 7.2) based on the demography of 8866 cases.
It is very important that health authorities adapt the effective quarantine time based on the most accurate incubation period; this way, asymptomatic infected people will be prevented from transmitting the virus to others.
As usual practice, people exposed to the virus or infected should normally stay in quarantine for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
Fever is usually the primary and initial symptom of COVID-19, which may be accompanied by no other symptoms or by other symptoms such as dry cough, dyspnea, muscle pain, dizziness, headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, chest pain, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
Some patients had dyspnoea or hypoxemia one week after onset of illness.
In severe cases, patients progressed rapidly to acute respiratory syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy.
Patients with fever or respiratory symptoms and acute fever, even without pulmonary abnormalities in imaging studies, should be tested for the virus for early diagnosis.
A demographic study from late December 2019 indicated that the symptom percentages were 98% for fever, 76% for dry cough, 55% for dyspnea, and 3% for diarrhea; 8% of patients required respiratory assistance.
Similar findings were reported in two recent studies of a familial conglomerate and a conglomerate caused by transmission from an asymptomatic person.
Comparably, a 2012 demographic study showed that MERS-CoV patients also had fever (98%), dry cough (47%) and dysnea (55%) as their main symptoms.
However, 80% of them required respiratory assistance, much more than patients with COVID-19 and consistent with the higher lethality of MERS compared to COVID-19.
Diarrhoea (26%) and sore throat (21%) were also observed in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, fever (99% - 100%), dry cough (29% - 75%), dyspnoea (40% - 42%), diarrhoea (20% - 25%) and sore throat (13% - 25%), were shown to be the main symptoms and respiratory assistance was required in approximately 14% to 20% of patients.
As of February 14, the COVID-19 mortality rate was 2%, with confirmed cases reaching 66,576 worldwide.
Similarly, the SARS mortality for November 2002 was 10% in 8096 confirmed cases.
For MERS, according to a demographic study from June 2012, the mortality rate was 37% in 2494 confirmed cases.
In a previous study, the R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was reported to be high and stood at 6.47 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 5.71 to 7.23, while the R0 of SARS-CoV only ranged between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARA-CoV in terms of symptoms, mortality and R0 is presented in Table Table 1.1.
The above figures suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has a greater capacity for spread than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but its lethality is lower than the latter two.
Therefore, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is much more difficult to control than the MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV epidemics.
Conglomerate appearance usually occurs within the same family or from the same gathering or vehicle, such as a cruiser.
Patients typically have a history of travel or residence in Wuhan and other affected areas or contact with infected people or patients in the two weeks prior to onset.
However, it has been reported that people can carry the virus without symptoms for more than two weeks and that patients discharged from hospital can contract the virus again, an alarm sign that the time of quarantine should be increased.
Patients have a normal or reduced amount of peripheral white blood cells (especially lymphocytes) in the early stage.
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count of <4×109/l, including a lymphocyte count of <1×109/l, and elevated levels of aspartate aminotransferase were observed in 1099 COVID-19 patients.
Levels of liver and muscle enzymes and myoglobin were elevated in the blood of some patients, and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation were elevated in the blood of most patients.
In patients with severe cases, the level of dimer-D, a product of the breakdown of fibrin in the blood, was elevated, and the lymphocyte count was progressively reduced.
Abnormalities are detected on chest radiographs of most COVID-19 patients, characterized by bilateral shadows or opacities in glazed glass in the lungs.
Patients usually develop atypical pneumonia, acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ADR occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid accumulation, and progressive fibrosis severely affect the gas exchange.
The dysfunction of type I and type II pneumocytes decreases the surfactant level and increases the surface tension, which reduces the ability of the lungs to expand and increases the risk of lung collapse.
Consequently, the worst findings on chest X-rays usually parallel the maximum severity of the disease.
On 18 February 2020, the first pathological analysis of COVID-19 demonstrated the desquamation of pneumocytes, the formation of a hyaline membrane and infiltration of lymphocytes in the interstitium, and multinucleated syncytial cells in the lungs of a patient who died from the disease, which is coincident with the pathology of a viral infection and ARDS, and similar to that of patients with SARS and MERS.
Detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used as the main criterion for the diagnosis of COVID-19.
However, due to the high rate of false negatives, which could accelerate the epidemic, clinical manifestations for diagnosis (no longer based solely on RT-PCR) began to be used in China on 13 February 2020.
A similar situation also occurred with the diagnosis of SARS.
Therefore, a combination of a history of disease, clinical manifestations, laboratory tests and radiological findings is essential and imperative for an effective diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, the Feng Zhang group described a protocol for using the CRISPR-based SHERLOCK technique to detect SARS-CoV-2, which detects synthetic SARS-CoV-2 RNA fragments at between 20 × 10-18 mol/l and 200 × 10-18 mol/l (10-100 copies per microliter of sample) using a graduated rod in less than an hour that does not require complex instruments.
Hopefully, the new technique can dramatically increase sensitivity and convenience if it is verified in clinical samples.
Due to the lack of experience with the new coronavirus, physicians are mostly able to provide supportive care to patients with COVID-19, while trying a variety of therapies that have been used or proposed previously for the treatment of other coronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, and other viral diseases (Table (Table 2).2).
These therapies include current or potential treatments with antiviral drugs, immunosuppressants, steroids, plasma from recovered patients, Chinese medicine, and psychological support.
It was even proposed to use plasma from recovered patients for treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are competing to see who can develop antibodies and vaccines against the virus first.
SARS-CoV-2 primarily attacks the lungs initially and probably also attacks, to a lesser degree, other ACE2-expressing organs such as those in the digestive tract and the kidneys.
However, respiratory dysfunction and failure are the greatest threat to patients and the leading cause of death.
Respiratory assistance is therefore critical to alleviate symptoms and save lives, and includes general oxygen therapy, high-flow oxygen, non-invasive ventilation and invasive mechanical ventilation according to the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms need extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (OMEC) assistance, a modified cardiopulmonary bypass technique used for the treatment of life-threatening heart or respiratory failure.
In addition, maintenance of electrolyte balance, prevention and treatment of secondary infections and septic shock, and protection of vital organ functions are also essential in SARS-CoV-2 patients.
Cytokine storm is known to be the result of an overreaction of the immune system in SARS and MERS patients.
The cytokine storm is a form of systemic inflammatory response characterized by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ, and MCP-1.
These cytokines induce immune cells to release huge amounts of free radicals which are the main cause of ARDS and multi-organ failure.
Immunosuppression is essential for the treatment of cytokine storms, especially in severe patients.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, an IL6 anti-receptor monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine storm.
Other immunosuppressive treatments for cytokine storm are T-cell-directed modulation of the immune response; IFN-γ, IL-1 and TNF blockade; inhibition of JAK; blinatumomab; a suppressor of cytokine signaling pathway 4; and HDAC inhibitors.
Steroids, such as immunosuppressants, were widely used in the treatment of SARS to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
However, steroids in high doses were not beneficial for severe lung injury in patients with SARS and COVID-19.
However, they can cause serious side effects, particularly osteonecrosis, which significantly affects the prognosis.
However, the prudent use of low to moderate doses of corticosteroids for a short period of time has been recommended for critically ill COVID-19 patients.
At the time of this analysis, the efficacy of any antiviral therapy has not been confirmed.
However, the efficacy of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, administered intravenously has been proven in an American patient with COVID-19.
Remdesivir is a new antiviral medicine developed by Gilead initially for the treatment of diseases caused by Ebola and Marburg viruses.
Subsequently, remdesivir also demonstrated the potential to inhibit other single-stranded RNA viruses, such as MERS and SARS viruses.
Based on these, Gilead has provided the compound to China to conduct a pair of trials on people infected with SARS-CoV-2, and there is great expectation for the results.
In addition, baricitinib, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ ritonavir and ribavirin have been suggested as potential therapies for patients with acute respiratory symptoms.
Diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, liver damage and other adverse reactions may occur following combination therapy with lopinavir/ritonavir.
The interaction of these treatments with other medicines used in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody generation
The drawing of blood from patients who have recovered from a contagious disease to treat other patients who contracted the same disease or to protect healthy persons from contracting the disease is not new.
In fact, recovered patients usually have a relatively high level of antibodies against the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are an immunoglobulin (Ig) produced by B lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other foreign objects, and recognize certain molecules in pathogens and neutralize them directly.
Based on this, blood plasma was extracted from a group of patients who recovered from COVID-19 and injected into 10 critically ill patients.
His symptoms improved within 24 hours, accompanied by a reduction in inflammation and viral loads and improved blood oxygen saturation.
However, this needs to be verified and clarified to propose the method for large-scale use until specific therapies are developed.
In addition, given the therapeutic effects, some disadvantages associated with plasma should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can overstimulate the immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, possibly producing fatal toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is normally low, and the demand for plasma is high to treat critically ill patients.
It's difficult to develop and produce specific antibodies fast enough to combat a global pandemic.
Therefore, it is more important and practical to isolate B cells from recovered patients and identify the genetic codes that code for effective antibodies or to look for antibodies that are effective against essential proteins of the virus.
In this way, we can easily increase the production of antibodies.
MCT has been used for thousands of years to treat a variety of diseases in China.
However, its effects depend heavily on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of a disease according to theories of CTC.
Most effective components remain unknown or imprecise, as it is difficult to extract and verify such components or their optimal combinations.
Currently, due to the lack of an effective and specific therapy for COVID-19, MCT has become one of the main alternative treatments for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or for those who have recovered from severe stages.
For example, Shu Feng Jie Du capsules and Lian Hua Qing Wen capsules were found to be effective for the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest recovery rates in treating patients with COVID-19 were observed in several provinces in China that used MCT in 87 percent of their patients, including Gansu (63.7 percent), Ningxia (50 percent) and Hunan (50 percent), while Hubei province, which used MCT in only about 30 percent of its COVID-19 patients, had the lowest recovery rate (13 percent).
However, this is a fairly rough comparison, as many other impact factors, such as the number and severity of patients, should be included in the assessment.
On February 18, 2020, Boli Zhang and colleagues published a study comparing Western medicine treatment (MO) alone with combined MO and MCT treatment.
They found that the time needed for recovery of body temperature, symptom disappearance, and hospitalization was significantly shorter in the MO+MCT group than in the MO-only group.
More surprisingly, the rate of worsening symptoms (mild to severe) was markedly lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO alone group (7.4% versus 46.2%) and mortality was lower in the MO+MCT group than in the MO alone group (8.8% versus 39%).
However, the efficacy and safety of MCT remain to be tested in more well-controlled trials at larger scales and in more centres.
It would also be interesting to characterize the mechanism of actions and to determine the effective components of MCT treatments or their combinations if possible.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are generally very afraid of the highly contagious and even deadly disease, and people in quarantine also experience boredom, loneliness and anger.
In addition, symptoms of infection such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, as well as adverse effects of treatment such as insomnia caused by corticosteroids, can lead to more anxiety and mental distress.
In the early phase of the SARS outbreak, a number of psychiatric conditions were reported, including persistent depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychomotor excitation, psychotic symptoms, delirium and even suicidal tendencies.
Contact tracing and mandatory quarantine, as part of public health responses to the COVID-19 outbreak, can make people feel more nervous and guilty about the effects of contagion, quarantine and stigma on their family and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided to COVID-19 patients, to suspects and people in contact with them, as well as to the general public who need it.
Psychological support should include training multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communications with regular and accurate updates on the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak and treatment plans, and the use of electronic devices and professional applications to avoid close contact between people.
Effective vaccines are essential to interrupt the chain of transmission from infected animal and human reservoirs to susceptible hosts, and often complement antiviral treatment in controlling epidemics caused by emerging viruses.
Efforts have been made to develop vaccines based on protein S to generate potent and long-lasting neutralizing antibodies or immunity that protects against SARS-CoV.
Vaccines with live attenuated viruses have been evaluated in animal models for SARS.
However, the in vivo efficacy of these potential vaccines in the elderly and the models of lethal stimulation and protection against infection with zoonotic virus still need to be determined before a clinical study is initiated.
This is probably because SARS went extinct 17 years ago and no new cases have been reported since.
Instead, there are still sporadic MERS cases and clusters in the Middle East that spread to other regions due to the persistence of zoonotic sources in endemic areas.
Vaccination strategies for MERS have been developed using deactivated viruses, DNA plasmids, viral vectors, nanoparticles, virus-like particles and recombinant protein subunits, and some have been evaluated in animal models.
The development of a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine for non-immune individuals is an urgent and decisive task to control the ongoing pandemic.
However, it is difficult to overcome the difficulties due to the long period (18 months on average) required for the development of a vaccine and the dynamic variations of coronaviruses.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has only recently begun to manifest its full clinical course in thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover gradually without sequelae.
However, as with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 is also associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients with severe cases.
Therefore, creating a disease prognostication model is essential for health agencies to be able to prioritize their services, especially in areas with limited resources.
Based on clinical studies reported to date, the following factors may affect or be associated with the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 (Table (Table 33)):
Age: age was the most important factor for the prognosis of SARS, which is also true for COVID-19.
COVID-19 occurred mostly in people aged 30 to 65 years and 47.7% of those patients were over 50 years in a study of 8866 cases, as described above.
Patients requiring intensive care were more likely to have underlying comorbidities and complications and were considerably older than those who did not require them (with a mean age of 66 versus 51), suggesting that age is a prognostic factor for the evolution of patients with COVID-19.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 has infected more men than women (0.31/100 000 compared to 0.27/100 000), as described above.
Comorbidities and complications: COVID-19 patients requiring intensive care are more likely to suffer from acute cardiac injury and arrhythmia.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive cholangiocytes, which can cause liver dysfunctions in patients with COVID-19.
It should be noted that age and underlying diseases are strongly correlated and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: the level of C-reactive protein (CRP) in the blood reflects the severity of inflammation or tissue injury and has been proposed as a possible prognostic factor for disease, response to therapy and eventual recovery.
The correlation between the level of PCR and the severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been proposed.
In addition, elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may also help predict the patient's course.
These enzymes are highly expressed in various organs, especially the heart and liver, and are released when tissue is damaged.
Therefore, they are traditional markers of cardiac or hepatic dysfunction.
Main clinical symptoms: chest radiography and the temporal progression of clinical symptoms should be considered in conjunction with other symptoms for prediction of clinical outcomes and complications of COVID-19.
Steroid use: as described above, steroids are immunosuppressants that are commonly used as adjunctive therapy for infectious diseases in order to reduce the severity of inflammatory damage.
Since high doses of corticosteroids were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors developed avascular osteonecrosis with permanent disability and poor quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, steroids should be used in low doses and for a short period in patients with COVID-19.
Mental stress: As described above, during the COVID-19 outbreak, many patients have suffered extraordinary stress, as they generally endured long periods in quarantine and extreme uncertainty, and witnessed the death of close family members and other patients.
It is essential to provide psychotherapy and long-term support to these patients to help them recover from stress and return to their normal lives.
According to demographic studies conducted so far, COVID-19 appears to have different epidemiological characteristics from SARS.
In addition to replicating in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate efficiently in the upper respiratory tract and cause mild symptoms or no symptoms in the early phase of infection, as with other coronaviruses that cause common colds.
Therefore, patients infected in the early stage or during the incubation period may produce a large amount of virus during their daily activities, making it extremely difficult to control the epidemic.
However, transmission of SARS-CoV was considered to occur when patients were seriously ill, while transmission was largely not occurring in the early phase.
Therefore, the current COVID-19 outbreak is far more severe and difficult to control than the SARS outbreak.
Great efforts are being made at this time in China, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continuous quarantine of almost the entire population in the hope of disrupting the transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Although these measures have been causing significant damage to the economy and other sectors of the country, the number of new patients is decreasing, indicating the slowdown in the epidemic.
According to the most optimistic forecast, the outbreak will be over by March and the downward phase will last 3 or 4 months.
However, some other experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter, et al., estimated that COVID-19, which appears to be considerably more infectious than SARS, will not conclude in 2020.
Ira Longini, et al., created a model to predict the evolution of the epidemic and suggested that SARS-CoV-2 could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 was detected in both nasal and pharyngeal exudates in patients who had recovered and left the hospital 2 weeks earlier, indicating that the newly identified virus could become a flu-like cyclic episode.
However, promising signs have been seen in China given the decline in the number of new cases, indicating that current strategies may be working.
Originally, Ebola was predicted to cause up to a million cases with half a million deaths.
However, by means of strict quarantine and isolation, the disease has been brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 will weaken in terms of infectivity and eventually become extinct or become a less pathogenic virus that coexists with humans.
A comparison of the COVID-19 epidemic with that of SARS and MERS is given below (fig. (fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible through coughing or sneezing, and possibly also through direct contact with materials contaminated with the virus.
The virus was also detected in the feces, raising a new possibility of fecal-oral transmission.
A recent study of 138 cases reported that 41% of cases were possibly caused by hospital-acquired infections, including 17 patients with other previous illnesses and 40 healthcare providers.
Therefore, precautions must be taken to protect humans, especially health care providers, social workers, family members, colleagues, and even bystanders in contact with patients or infected persons.
The first line of defense that could be used to lower the risk of infection is the use of masks; the use of surgical masks and N95 respirator masks (serial number 1860) helps control the spread of viruses.
Surgical masks prevent droplets of fluid from a potentially infected person from being transmitted through the air or attaching to surfaces, from where they could be transmitted to other people.
However, only N95 masks (serial number 1860) can protect against inhalation of virions as small as 10 to 80 nm, and only 5% of the virions can fully penetrate them; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV in size and both measure around 85 nm.
Since particles can penetrate up to five stacked surgical masks, healthcare providers in direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (serial number 1860) and not surgical masks.
In addition to masks, health care providers should wear tailored isolation gowns to further reduce contact with viruses.
Viruses can also infect a person through the eyes.
On 22 January 2020, a doctor became infected with SARS-CoV-2 despite wearing an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through his inflamed eyes.
Therefore, healthcare providers should also wear protective face masks or clear glasses while working with patients.
For the general public in affected or potentially affected areas, it is strongly suggested that the population wash hands with disinfectant soaps more often than usual, attempt to stay at home in voluntary quarantine, and limit contact with people who may be infected.
Three feet is considered an appropriate distance for people to stay away from a patient.
These measures are effective methods to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-CoV-2 appeared as a new virus to the human world, its high homology to SARS-CoV, as reported on 7 January 2020, should have caused great alarm in China for its experience with the SARS outbreak in 2003.
However, it was not until January 19, 2020 that the director of the Wuhan Center for Disease Control reassured citizens that the new virus had low contagiousness and limited reproductive capacity among humans, and that there would be no problems in preventing and containing the disease.
This message notably eased public alarm, especially at a time when the whole country was preparing for the Spring Festival, and the critical moment to contain the disease on a minimal scale in Wuhan was missed.
China's disease control agencies should learn from this hard lesson and adopt decisive improvements in the future.
For example, these agencies should be (1) more cautious in making public announcements, as every word matters to citizens and can cause them to change their attitude or decisions; (2) more sensitive and reactive to unusual information from clinics, rather than waiting for formal reports from doctors or officials; (3) more restrictive in containing a possible epidemic in its early stages, rather than trying to reassure the public; and (4) more regular in implementing tailored and effective simulacra to increase public awareness of epidemic diseases and to test and improve society's response system on a regular basis.
The COVID-19 outbreak caused by the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 began in late December 2019.
In less than two months, it has spread throughout China and some 50 more countries around the world at the time of this analysis.
Since the virus is very similar to SARS-CoV and there are also many similarities between the symptoms of COVID-19 and SARS, the COVID-19 outbreak has generated the feeling of a SARS reappearance.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are essential to contain the epidemic and treat patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than young people and men more than women, and severity and mortality are also higher in older people than in young people.
SARS has a higher mortality rate than COVID-19 (10.91% compared to 1.44%).
Patients with COVID-19 transmit the virus even though they do not have symptoms, while patients with SARS usually do when they are seriously ill, making it much more difficult to contain the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 spread much more rapidly and widely than SARS-CoV.
The regular RNA test for SARS-CoV-2 may be negative in some patients with COVID-19.
On the other hand, cured patients can test positive for the virus again.
These results dramatically increase the risk of the virus spreading.
Given the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several important questions remain unanswered, including:
Where did SARS-CoV-2 come from?
Although a 96% genetic homology was found between SARS-CoV-2 and two SARS-like bat coronaviruses, it is not yet possible to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal was the intermediate species that transmitted the virus from the original host, say, bats, to humans?
Without knowing the answers to number 1 and 2, it is not possible to effectively stop the transmission, and the outbreak may resurface at any time.
Although molecular modeling and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 binds to ACE2, how exactly does the virus enter the cells of the respiratory tract and cause subsequent pathological changes?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-expressing cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment are not possible.
How long will the epidemic last?
How does the virus evolve genetically as it spreads between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, will it go extinct like SARS, or will it periodically reappear like the flu?
Although it may take some time, it is essential to seek answers to these and many other questions.
However, whatever the cost, we have no choice but to stop the epidemic as soon as possible and return to our normal life.
The zoonotic origins of the human coronaviruses
Mutation and adaptation have driven the co-evolution of coronaviruses and their hosts, including humans, for thousands of years.
Until 2003, two human coronaviruses were known to cause mild illnesses, such as the common cold.
The outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) have flipped the coin by revealing how devastating and deadly a human coronavirus infection can be.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in central China in late 2019 put coronaviruses back in the spotlight and surprised us with a high transmissibility and reduced pathogenicity compared to its sibling, SARS-CoV.
Human coronavirus infection is a zoonosis and it would be useful for us to know the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses.
Most human coronaviruses originate in bats, in which they are not pathogenic.
Intermediate reservoir hosts of some human coronaviruses are also known.
Identifying animal hosts has direct implications for the prevention of disease in humans.
Investigating the interactions between coronaviruses and hosts in animals could also yield important information about the pathogenesis of coronaviruses in humans.
In this analysis, we present a general overview of the knowledge of the seven human coronaviruses, with emphasis on the history of their discovery, as well as their zoonotic origins and inter-species transmission.
Notably, we compared and contrasted different human coronaviruses from the perspective of viral evolution and genome recombination.
The current epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is analyzed in this context.
In addition, the requirements for successful host changes and the implications of virus evolution on disease severity are also highlighted.
Coronaviruses belong to the family Coronaviridae, which comprises a group of envelope-positive monocatenary RNA viruses.
These viruses, which contain the largest genome, 26 to 32 kilobases, among RNA viruses, were named coronavirus because of their morphology, because of the shape of the crown they have under an electronic microscope.
In terms of their structure, coronaviruses have unsegmented genomes that share a similar organization.
Approximately two-thirds of the genome contains two large open reading frames (ORF1a and ORF1b), which are translated into the polyproteins replicase pp1a and pp1ab.
The polyproteins are further processed to generate 16 non-structural proteins, termed nsp1~16.
The remainder of the genome contains ORFs for structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleoprotein (N).
A number of ancestor proteins specific to each lineage are also encoded by different coronavirus lineages.
Based on the difference in protein sequences, coronaviruses are classified into four genera (alphacoronavirus, betacoronavirus, gammacoronavirus, and deltacoronavirus), among which the genus betacoronavirus contains the majority of human coronaviruses and is subdivided into four lineages (A, B, C, and D).
Phylogenetic evidence has shown that bats and rodents are the gene source for most alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, while birds are the main reservoir for gammacoronavirus and deltacoronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have constantly crossed species barriers, and some have emerged as important human pathogens.
To date, seven human coronaviruses are known.
Among them, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63 are alphacoronaviruses.
The other five betacoronaviruses are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as a common cold or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently identified SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic and cause severe lower respiratory tract infection in a relatively larger number of patients, with a higher probability of developing acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and extrapulmonary manifestations.
The first strain of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the nasal secretions of patients with the common cold in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more knowledge has accumulated through extensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, which cause self-limiting symptoms.
In fact, until the SARS outbreak, it was a widely accepted concept that coronavirus infection of humans is generally harmless.
The SARS outbreak that occurred in 2003 is one of the most devastating in recent history and infected over 8,000 people, with a crude lethality of around 10%.
Ten years later, the outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) resulted in a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula with sporadic spread to the rest of the world.
The new human coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), which was subsequently designated SARS-CoV-2, is the causative agent of the ongoing epidemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which has claimed more than 3120 lives and infected more than 91 000 people as of 3 March 2020.
The alarm has been sounding and the world must prepare for the impending SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
The seven human coronaviruses have a zoonotic origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Several lines of evidence support the evolutionary origin of all human coronaviruses in bats, in which viruses are well adapted and not pathogenic, but exhibit great genetic diversity.
The COVID-19 epidemic has posed huge medical, scientific, social and moral challenges in China and the rest of the world.
Tracing the zoonotic origins of human coronaviruses provides a framework for understanding the natural history, driving force, and restraining factors of the species leap.
This could also guide or facilitate the search for the reservoir and intermediate and amplifying animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2, which would have important implications for preventing future spread.
In this analysis, we present an overview of zoonotic origins, interspecies transmission and pathogenesis of human coronaviruses.
In particular, we highlighted and analyzed the common theme that human coronavirus parental viruses are not normally pathogenic in their natural reservoir hosts, but become pathogenic after transmission between species to a new host.
We also examined the evolutionary trend of human coronaviruses, in which increased transmissibility usually leads to decreased pathogenicity.
The evolution of the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 outbreak is also analysed in this context.
Animal coronaviruses have been known since the late 1930s.
Before the HCoV-229E strain B814 was first isolated from the nasal secretion of patients who had contracted a common cold, different coronaviruses had been isolated from different infected animals, such as turkey, mouse, cow, pig, cat and dog.
In the past decades, seven human coronaviruses have been identified.
A brief summary of the history of human coronavirus discoveries in chronological order (Table 1) would be informative and instructive.
The first strain of HCoV-229E was isolated from the respiratory tracts of patients with upper respiratory tract infection in 1966 and subsequently adapted to grow in WI-38 cell lines of the lung.
Patients infected with HCoV-229E had symptoms of the common cold, such as headache, sneeze, general malaise and sore throat, with fever and cough in 10~20% of cases.
Later, in 1967, HCoV-OC43 was isolated from organ culture and subsequent serial passing in brains of lactating mice.
The clinical features of HCoV-OC43 infection appear to be similar to those caused by HCoV-229E, whose symptoms are identical to those of infections with other respiratory tract pathogens, such as influenza A viruses and rhinoviruses.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed worldwide and tend to be transmitted predominantly during the winter season, in temperate climates.
In general, the incubation time of these two viruses is less than a week, followed by a period of illness of about 2 weeks.
According to a study with human volunteers, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E developed a mild common cold.
Only some immunocompromised patients developed a severe infection of the lower respiratory tract.
SARS, also known as atypical pneumonia, caused the first pandemic caused by a well-documented human coronavirus in human history, and the etiological agent is SARS-CoV, the third human coronavirus to be discovered.
The first SARS case was reported in late 2002 in Guangdong province, China.
The SARS epidemic resulted in 8096 reported cases with 774 deaths and spread across many countries and continents.
Aside from superspreaders, it was estimated that each case could cause approximately two secondary cases, with an incubation period of 4 to 7 days and the onset of peak viral load on the tenth day of illness.
Patients infected with SARS-CoV initially experience myalgia, headache, fever, general malaise and chills, followed by dyspnea, cough and breathing difficulty as late symptoms.
Lymphopenia, impaired liver function and elevated creatine kinase levels are common abnormal results in SARS laboratory tests.
Diffuse alveolar damage, epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages are also observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20-30% of patients subsequently require intensive care and mechanical respiratory support.
In addition to the lower respiratory tract, several organs, including the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and kidney, can also become infected in these severe cases, usually accompanied by a cytokine storm, which could be fatal, particularly in immunocompromised patients.
The virus was first isolated from the open-air lung biopsy of a relative of the initial patient who traveled to Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, enormous efforts have been devoted to research on human coronaviruses.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a 7-month-old child in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children, older adults, and immunocompromised patients with respiratory diseases.
The presentation of cholera, conjunctivitis, fever and bronchiolitis is common in the disease caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the isolation of the same virus from a nasal sample taken from an 8-month-old child suffering from pneumonia in the Netherlands.
Although it was identified in the Netherlands, it is actually distributed worldwide.
HCoV-NL63 has been estimated to cause approximately 4.7% of common respiratory diseases, with its peak incidence occurring in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with obstructive laryngitis, also known as crup.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who had been hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchiolitis in Hong Kong.
In addition to community-acquired pneumonia and bronchiolitis, HCoV-HKU1 was reported to be associated with acute exacerbations of asthma.
Like HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 was found worldwide and caused mild respiratory illness.
These four community-acquired human coronaviruses have adapted well to humans and are generally less likely to mutate to cause highly pathogenic diseases, although accidents have occurred due to unknown causes, such as the rare case of a more virulent subtype of HCoV-NL63, which was recently reported to have caused severe lower respiratory tract infection in China.
In general, when these human coronaviruses acquire the ability to transmit efficiently and persist continuously in humans, they also become less virulent or pathogenic.
MERS-CoV was first isolated in 2012 from the lung of a 60-year-old patient who had developed acute pneumonia and renal failure in Saudi Arabia.
Although most laboratory confirmed cases are from the Middle East, imported cases with occasional contagion to close contacts have been reported in several European countries and Tunisia.
Another secondary outbreak occurred in South Korea in 2015 with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS resemble those of SARS, characterized by progressive acute pneumonia.
Unlike SARS, many MERS patients also developed acute renal failure, which so far only occurs with MERS among diseases caused by human coronaviruses.
More than 30% of patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.
As of 14 February 2020, there were over 2500 laboratory-confirmed cases, with a high lethality of 34.4%, making MERS-CoV one of the most devastating viruses to humans known.
From mid-to-late December 2019, clusters of patients with pneumonia were detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, which were retrospectively associated with SARS-CoV-2.
The World Health Organization declared the ongoing outbreak of lower respiratory tract infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern and further named the disease COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 90,053 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with a crude lethality of 3.4%.
Notably, the lethality in Hubei, China, is 4.2%, while outside it is 1.2%.
SARS-CoV-2 causes severe respiratory infection, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which present as fever, cough, and dyspnea.
Diarrhoea has also been observed in some patients.
Pneumonia is one of the most serious symptoms and can rapidly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to a high nucleotide sequence homology of 82%, they are categorized into different branches of the phylogenetic tree.
SARS-CoV-2 is apparently less pathogenic, but more transmissible compared to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Cases of asymptomatic people infected with SARS-CoV-2 have been reported, which could contribute to its rapid spread worldwide.
Comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six human coronaviruses, similarities and differences of great interest are identified.
First, the incubation period and the duration of the course of human coronavirus disease are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV-2 follows the overall trend of the other six human coronaviruses.
Second, the severity of COVID-19 symptoms is between that of SARS-CoV and the four community-acquired human coronaviruses (i.e., HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63).
On the one hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection has features that are more frequently observed in community-acquired human coronavirus infections, including the presentation of nonspecific or mild symptoms or even the absence of symptoms.
On the other hand, a small subgroup of severe cases of COVID-19 is also observed as with SARS-CoV infection, although the relationship is somewhat lower.
Third, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 also shows interesting patterns characteristic of both community-acquired human coronaviruses and SARS-CoV.
On the one hand, the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is at least as high as that of community-acquired human coronaviruses.
On the other hand, it remains to be seen whether the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after human-to-human transmission, as is the case with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Finally, as with other human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 can be detected in fecal samples.
Whether fecal-oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role, as in the case of SARS-CoV, at least in some circumstances, is yet to be elucidated in future studies.
It was also of particular interest to find out whether SARS-CoV-2 could exhibit seasonality, as is the case with community-acquired human coronaviruses.
However, the characteristics of SARS-CoV-2, including its transmissibility, pathogenicity and sustainable spread after human-to-human transmission, will influence the final outcome of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
The four community-acquired human coronaviruses that cause mild symptoms have adapted well to humans.
From another perspective, it might also be true that humans have adapted well to these four human coronaviruses.
In other words, both could be survivors of ancient human coronavirus pandemics.
Human coronaviruses that cause serious disease in humans and humans who developed severe disease from human coronaviruses have been eliminated.
For this to happen, human coronaviruses must replicate in humans to an extent sufficient to allow the accumulation of adaptive mutations that counteract host restriction factors.
In this sense, the longer the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak persists and the more people it infects, the greater the likelihood that it will fully adapt to humans.
If it adapts well, its transmission to humans would be difficult to stop by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, the four community-acquired coronaviruses have circulated in human populations and have caused common colds in immunocompetent people.
These viruses don't need an animal reservoir.
In contrast, highly pathogenic SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have not adapted well to humans and their human-to-human transmission is unsustainable.
They need to maintain and propagate in their zoonotic reservoirs and seek the opportunity to propagate to susceptible human targets, possibly via one or more intermediate hosts and amplifiers.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and to the four community-acquired human coronaviruses.
It's highly transmissible like community-acquired human coronaviruses, at least for now.
However, it is more pathogenic than community-acquired human coronaviruses and less pathogenic than SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and circulate among humans without a reservoir or intermediate animal host.
Before analyzing the animal origins of human coronaviruses, it will be helpful to examine the definitions and characteristics of the evolutionary, natural, reservoir, intermediate, and amplifier hosts of human coronaviruses.
An animal acts as an evolutionary host of a human coronavirus if it harbors a closely related ancestor that shares high homology at the nucleotide sequence level.
The ancestor virus is normally well adapted and is not pathogenic in this host.
Similarly, a reservoir host hosts a human coronavirus continuously and long-term.
In both cases, the hosts naturally become infected and are the natural hosts of the human coronavirus or its parent virus.
In contrast, if the human coronavirus was introduced into the intermediate host just before or almost at the same time of its introduction into humans, it is not well adapted to the new host and is usually pathogenic.
The intermediate host can act as the zoonotic source of infection in humans and fulfill the role of amplifying host by allowing the virus to transiently replicate and then transmit to humans to amplify the scale of infection in humans.
A human coronavirus can cause infection in the terminal host if it cannot sustain transmission in the intermediate host.
Conversely, human coronaviruses can also adapt to the intermediate host and even generate long-term endemicity.
In this case, the intermediate host becomes a natural reservoir host.
Epidemiological data revealed retrospectively that the initial case of SARS had been in contact with game animals.
Subsequent seroprevalence research indicated that animal traders had a higher prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV IgG compared to the general population.
Masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) and a raccoon dog at live animal markets were the first identified carriers of SARS-CoV-like viruses that are almost identical to SARS-CoV.
This was indirectly supported by the fact that no more SARS cases were recorded after killing all the civets in the markets.
However, it was reported that the civets of wild or farmed masked palms without exposure to live animal markets mostly tested negative for SARS-CoV, suggesting that the masked palms civets would only act as an amplifying intermediate host, but not as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV.
Notably, since 80% of the various animals in the markets in Guangzhou have anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the possibility that several species of small mammals also act as intermediate hosts amplifying SARS-CoV cannot be ruled out.
All of them appear to be terminal hosts of SARS-CoV.
Further searches of the natural animal host of SARS-CoV revealed a closely related bat coronavirus, termed SARS-related Rhinolophus bat CoV HKU3 (SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3), which exists in Chinese horseshoe bats.
These bats are positive for anti-SARS-CoV antibodies and the SARSr-Rh-BatCoV HKU3 genome sequence.
This and other bat coronaviruses share 88-92% nucleotide sequence homology with SARS-CoV.
These studies have laid the foundations for the new concept that bats harbour emerging human pathogens.
Several SARS-like coronaviruses (SL-CoV) have also been identified in bats, but none, except one called WIV1, can be isolated as a live virus.
Human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is known to be the receptor of SARS-CoV.
WIV1 obtained from a bat fecal sample was shown to use bat, civet and human ACE2 as a receptor to enter cells.
Amazingly, the serums of convalescent SARS patients were able to neutralize WIV1.
So far, WIV1 represents the most closely related ancestor of SARS-CoV in bats, sharing a 95% nucleotide sequence homology.
Despite the high homology between these two viruses, it is generally believed that WIV1 is not the immediate parental virus of SARS-CoV and that bats are not the immediate reservoir host of SARS-CoV.
According to phylogenetic analysis, MERS-CoV is categorized in the same group as bat CoV-HKU4 and bat CoV-HKU5.
Both bat CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV use the same host receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), for the entry of the virus.
The RNA polymerase-dependent RNA sequences of MERS-CoV phylogenetically closely resemble their beta-coronavirus counterparts from bats identified in Europe and Africa.
So far, no live MERS-CoV has been found in wild bats.
MERS-CoV and its closest relative, bat CoV-HKU25, share a nucleotide sequence homology of only 87%.
Therefore, the bat may not be the immediate reservoir host of MERS-CoV.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that dromedaries are seropositive for MERS-CoV specifically neutralizing antibodies, as are camels native to the Middle East in several African countries.
A live MERS-CoV identical to the virus found in humans was isolated from the nasal exudate of dromedaries, further supporting that camels act as bona fide reservoir hosts of MERS-CoV.
It should also be noted that, in general, mild symptoms but a massive spread of the virus were observed in infected camels for MERS-CoV investigations.
Notably, infected camels spread the viruses not only through respiratory but also through fecal-oral route, which is also the main route of virus propagation by bats.
However, questions remain, as many confirmed cases of MERS have no history of contact with camels prior to the onset of symptoms, which is reasonably attributed to human-to-human transmission or unknown transmission pathways involving unrecognized animal species that harbor MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 shares 96.2% nucleotide homology with a bat coronavirus, RaTG13, isolated from the bat Rhinolophus affinis.
As in the cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is too large to assign a parental relationship.
That is, bats may not be the immediate reservoir hosts of SARS-CoV-2 unless they are found in the virtually identical bat coronavirus of the future.
Presumably, intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 should be among the wild species sold and killed at the Huanan seafood wholesale market, with which many of the initial COVID-19 cases were associated, indicating a likely animal-to-human transmission event.
Several recent studies based on metagenomic sequencing have suggested that a group of endangered small mammals, known as pangolins (Manis javanica), may also harbor ancestral betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of this new pangolin coronavirus share a nucleotide sequence homology of 85-92% with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally closely related to RaTG13, with an identity of about 90% at the nucleotide sequence level.
They are grouped into two SARS-CoV-2-like virus sub-lineages in the phylogenetic tree, one of which shares a receptor binding domain (RBD) most similar to SARS-CoV-2, with a 97.4% amino acid sequence identity.
In stark contrast, the RBDs of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are more divergent, despite a greater degree of sequence homology across the genome.
A previous study in sick pangolins also reported the detection of viral contingions in lung samples, which turned out to be equally related to SARS-CoV-2.
This study used various methods of manual assembly and curing to generate a partial genome sequence comprising about 86.3% of the full length viral genome.
We cannot rule out the possibility that pangolins are one of the intermediate animal hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is currently no evidence to support a direct pangolin origin of SARS-CoV-2 due to sequence divergence between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2.
In addition, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is even smaller than that between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin betacoronaviruses.
The evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, pangolins and other mammals is yet to be established.
Although the highest sequence homology was found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin, SARS-CoV-2-related betacoronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 share the highest complete genome sequence homology.
It is highly speculative that the high degree of similarity between RBDs of pangolin betacoronaviruses related to SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to convergent evolution mediated by selectivity.
A counterproposal defends a recombination between the SARS-CoV-2 related pangolin betacoronavirus and RaTG13 in the third wild animal species.
As a driving force in evolution, recombination is widespread among betacoronaviruses.
A conclusion on the immediate zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been reached.
In addition to highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, the zoonotic origin of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 was also studied.
Phylogenetic evidence indicated that both HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E may have originated from bat coronaviruses, while the parental viruses of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been found in rodents.
A bat coronavirus called ARCoV.2 (Appalachian coronavirus) detected in a North American three-colored bat was reported to be closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCoV-229E was genetically related to another bat coronavirus, named Hipposideros/GhanaKwam/19/2008, which was detected in Ghana, although camelids have also been suspected as intermediate hosts.
For clarity, the current knowledge of animal origins of known human coronaviruses is summarised in Figure 1 and Table 2.
Phylogenetic analysis has provided evidence of coronavirus transmission events from humans to other species in history.
When HCoV-OC43 crossed between species to infect humans from livestock in 1890, a respiratory infection pandemic was recorded.
The antecedents of HCoV-229E's interspecies transmission are not known with such precision.
Bat alphacoronaviruses closely related to HCoV-229E have been found.
Among them is an alpha-coronavirus from alpacas.
Several lines of evidence support the transmission of the virus from bats to humans directly.
First, unlike alpacas, humans may have contact with bats in a shared ecological niche.
Humans, on the other hand, have close contact with alpacas.
Secondly, HCoV-229E-related bat alphacoronaviruses are diverse and non-pathogenic in bats, while alpaca alphacoronaviruses caused an outbreak of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpaca alpha-coronavirus has not been found in wild animals.
Therefore, the possibility that alpacas acquire the HCoV-229E-related alphacoronavirus from humans cannot be ruled out.
In fact, bats are the direct source of pathogenic viruses in humans, such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Nipah virus and Hendra virus.
Therefore, it would not be too surprising if bats transmit HCoV-229E directly to humans.
Alternatively, while bat alphacoronaviruses act as the genetic pool of HCoV-229E, alpacas and dromedaries could act as intermediate hosts that transmit viruses to humans, specifically in the case of MERS-CoV.
MERS-CoV serves as an excellent example of inter-species transmission, from bats to dromedaries, and from dromedaries to humans.
The evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV in bats, discovered with its initial identification, has also been supported by subsequent findings.
It is clear that bats contribute, with a rich stock of virus species, to the inter-species exchange of genetic fragments and to inter-species transmission.
Longevity, densely populated colonies, close social interaction and high flight capacity are all favorable conditions that make bats the ideal "virus spreader".
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been introduced into dromedaries for decades.
It's well adapted to these camels, which have gone from being an intermediate host to being a stable and natural reservoir host.
MERS-CoV causes very mild disease and maintains a relatively low mutation rate in these animals.
Its sporadic transmission to humans is an accident and humans remain a terminal host of MERS-CoV, as transmission is unsustainable.
Compared to the role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV, the role of pangolins, if any, in the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is different.
In particular, pangolin betacoronaviruses are highly pathogenic in pangolins.
They may be terminal hosts of betacoronavirus related to SARS-CoV-2, as civets are in the case of SARS-CoV.
Several possibilities for interspecies transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be confirmed or ruled out in future studies.
First, bats could be the reservoir host of a SARS-CoV-2 related virus, almost identical to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans could share the ecological niche with bats, through slaughter or coal mining.
Second, pangolins could be one of the intermediate amplifying hosts into which a SARS-CoV-2 related virus had recently been introduced.
Humans contract the virus through the slaughter and consumption of game meat.
It is possible that many mammals, including domestic animals, are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
An antibody test in domestic and wild animals is required.
Third, as mentioned earlier, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 could have occurred in a third species that has contact with both bats and pangolins.
The search for the animal origins of SARS-CoV-2 continues.
Apart from the different types of animal hosts, three main factors in viral terms also play an important role in facilitating coronaviruses to cross species barriers.
First, their relatively high mutation rates in RNA replication.
Compared to other monocatenary RNA viruses, the estimated mutation rates of coronaviruses could be considered moderate to high, with an average replacement rate of ~10-4 replacements per year, per site 2, depending on the coronavirus' adaptation phase to new hosts.
Coronaviruses have a reading-check exoribonuclease, the deletion of which results in extremely high mutability and attenuation or even inoperability.
Interestingly, the nucleotide analog remdesivir is known to suppress coronavirus replication by inhibiting this exorribonuclease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase.
Remdesivir is one of the most promising anti-SARS-CoV-2 agents that have been tested in clinical trials.
However, mutation rates of coronaviruses are about a million times higher than those of their hosts.
Furthermore, the mutation rate is usually high when coronaviruses are not well adapted to the host.
Compared to SARS-CoV, which has a high mutation rate, the mutation rate of SARS-CoV-2 is apparently lower, suggesting a higher level of adaptation to humans.
Hopefully, it's already adapted to another host close to humans.
In addition to SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which is well adapted to dromedaries.
In theory, it is unlikely that genetic drift will cause vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 to lose their efficacy rapidly.
Second, the long RNA genome of coronaviruses exerts additional plasticity in genome modification for mutations and recombination and, in this way, increases the likelihood of inter-species coevolution, which favors the emergence of new coronaviruses when the right conditions are given.
This is supported by copious single open reading frames and protein functions encoded towards the 3' direction of the genome.
Third, coronaviruses randomly and frequently change template during RNA replication by a unique copy-choice mechanism.
In a host that acts as a mixing vehicle, chain switching frequently occurs during the transcription of coronavirus RNA.
Full-length RNA and highly homologous subgenomes could be recombined to generate new coronaviruses.
Phylogenetic evidence of natural recombination has been found in HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses, such as bat SL-CoV and bat CoV-HKU9.
Virus-host interaction in relation to transmission
In addition to the three viral factors mentioned above, viral interaction with the host receptor is another key factor influencing transmission between species.
In the present, SARS-CoV recombination is taken as a typical example, which also showed evidence of positive selection in events of interspecies transmission.
Based on comparative analysis between isolated strains of SARS-CoV from humans and civets, it is believed that SARS-CoV undergoes rapid adaptation in different hosts, in particular with mutations in the RBD of the S protein.
In general, the RBD of an S protein of a coronavirus interacts with the cell receptor and is intensely selected by the host antibody response.
In SARS-CoV, RBD is found at amino acids 318 to 510 in the S1 fragment, which binds to human ACE2 and its correceptors for viral entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD is able to recognize ACE2 receptors from several animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing for inter-species transmission of the virus.
In fact, as observed, only 6 amino acid residues were different from the isolated strains of human and civet viruses in the RBD and 4 of them are found in the receptor binding motif for the ACE2 receptor interaction.
The civet SARS-CoV has K479N and S487T mutations in its RBD, which could increase the affinity of the spike protein interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
In other words, these two amino acid substitutions could be fundamental to the virus's adaptation to humans.
It should be noted that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cellular receptor with SARS-CoV.
A 30% difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV in the S1 unit of protein S implies that the binding affinity of protein S to human ACE2 may have been altered.
In fact, an electron cryomicroscopy study points to the 10 to 20 times higher affinity of this link compared to that of human ACE2 and SARS-CoV protein S.
It will also be of interest to determine whether some other correceptor might be necessary for transmission of SARS-CoV-2.
Surprisingly, HCoV-NL63 also binds to ACE2, but with a different part of the S.
There are many other human coronavirus receptors, such as N-aminopeptidase in HCoV-229E and 9-O-acetylated sialic acid in HCoV-OC43.
They may also be responsible for the successful adaptation of these coronaviruses in humans, following interspecies transmission from their animal hosts.
In addition to cellular receptors, the outcome of interspecies transmission of human coronaviruses is also determined by other factors of host dependence and restriction.
The divergence of these host proteins between humans and natural reservoir hosts of human coronaviruses, such as bats, dromedaries and rodents, could constitute a barrier to interspecies transmission.
Human coronaviruses must usurp the host-dependent factors and subvert the host-restrictive factors for successful interspecies transmission.
In this regard, the molecular determinants in this important area of virus-host interaction still need to be identified and characterised.
Objective full genome investigation of host dependence and restriction factors for SARS-CoV-2 using advanced CRISPR technology could be useful.
Emergence of new human coronavirus: starting from scratch
The diversity of bat coronaviruses provides numerous opportunities for the emergence of new human coronaviruses.
In this sense, bat coronaviruses act as the genetic pool of human coronaviruses.
In addition, rapid mutation and genetic recombination also drive the evolution of human coronaviruses and are two important steps in this process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of new protein-coding genes have the potential to drastically alter viral phenotypes.
Among SARS-CoV accessory proteins, ORF8 has been considered important in adaptation to humans, as SARS-CoV related bat viruses were isolated, but were determined to encode divergent ORF8 proteins.
A deletion of 29 characteristic nucleotides of SARS-CoVs was found in isolated strains at the onset of the epidemic in humans.
This deletion splits ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b, and is thought to be an adaptive mutation that promotes host change.
In addition, SARS-CoV has a possible history of recombination with alpha and gammacoronavirus lineages, in which a large number of smaller recombinant regions in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were identified.
Recombination sites were also identified in nsp9, most of nsp10 and parts of nsp14.
Similarly, epidemic MERS-CoV has been shown to undergo recombination events between different lineages, which occurred in dromedaries in Saudi Arabia.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, recombinant events have also been observed in other human coronaviruses, in which coronaviruses from humans recombine with other coronaviruses from animals in their non-structural genes.
It should also be noted that artificial selection may contribute to unwanted changes in viral genomes, most likely resulting from releasing viruses from selection pressures exerted, for example, by the host immune system.
An example of these effects is the loss of a full length ORF4 in the prototype strain of HCoV-229E, due to a deletion of two nucleotides.
Although intact ORF4 was observed in HCoV-229E-related viruses of bats and camels, the alpaca alphacoronavirus has a single nucleotide insertion, causing a frame shift.
Last but not least, the evolution of novel human coronaviruses is also driven by selection pressure in their reservoir hosts.
No symptoms were detected or only mild symptoms were detected when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating mutual adaptation between coronaviruses and bats.
Bats appear to be well-adapted to coronaviruses anatomically and physiologically.
For example, defects in the activation of the proinflammatory response in bats efficiently reduce the pathology caused by coronaviruses.
In addition, the activity of natural killer cells in bats is suppressed due to positive regulation of the inhibitory receptor for natural killer cells NKG2/CD94 and the low level of expression of the class I molecules of the major histocompatibility complex.
In addition, the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated from the high metabolic activity of bats could suppress coronavirus replication and affect exoribonuclease reading screening, providing selection pressure for the generation of highly pathogenic virus strains when introduced into a new host.
More pathogenic strains of coronaviruses could also evolve by recombination, leading to the acquisition of new proteins or protein features for adaptation to the host.
Therefore, it is no coincidence that three new human coronaviruses have appeared in the last two decades.
Coronaviruses are not pathogenic or cause mild symptoms in their reservoir hosts, such as bats and camels.
They replicate vigorously without provoking a strong immune response from the host.
This is where the secrets lie of why there are asymptomatic carriers and what causes severe cases of infection in humans.
Severe symptoms are mainly due to the overactivation of the immune response and the cytokine storm, in which the stronger the immune response, the more severe the lung damage.
In asymptomatic carriers, however, the immune response has been disassociated from the replication of the coronavirus.
The same strategy of disengagement of the immune response could have beneficial effects on anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapy.
The interferon response is particularly strong in bats.
Therefore, administration of type I interferon, at least in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans, should be beneficial.
In addition, the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in bats is defective.
According to this reasoning, NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition with MCC950 could be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.
The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 follows the general line that led to the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.
Although a bat beta-coronavirus has been found that shares a 95% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV, there is also a bat coronavirus that shares a 96% nucleotide homology with SARS-CoV-2.
Although civets and other animals in markets have been found to harbor viruses identical to SARS-CoV, no immediate intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 have been identified.
Pangolin beta-coronavirus has been found to be remarkably homologous to SARS-CoV-2, indicating that pangolins could act as one of the intermediate hosts or that pangolin beta-coronavirus could contribute gene fragments to the final version of SARS-CoV-2.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made, either deliberately or by accident.
Coronaviruses have regained prominence due to the recent SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.
The study of coronaviruses in bats and other animals has profoundly changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic origins and animal reservoirs of coronaviruses from humans in human transmission.
Extensive evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats and are transmitted to humans through intermediate hosts.
Since SARS-CoV infection originates from human-civet contact in markets, closing wet markets and killing the civets in them could have been effective in curbing the SARS epidemic.
Following this same reasoning, pangolins should be withdrawn from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission, in view of the discovery of several pangolin betacoronavirus lineages closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted to humans via pangolins and other mammals remains to be elucidated in future research.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has existed in dromedaries for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation, as well as a major source of meat, milk, leather and wool for the local population.
They are widely distributed across the Middle East and Africa.
Therefore, it is impossible to slaughter all the camels to control MERS, as was done in China with the wild animal markets to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
In order to prevent recurrent MERS outbreaks, a comprehensive approach to develop effective vaccines against MERS-CoV for camels should be adopted, in combination with other infection control measures.
Since we are unable to eliminate these viruses, new genotypes could emerge that cause outbreaks.
A variety of zoonotic coronaviruses, they're circulating in the wild.
In particular, bat coronaviruses with zoonotic potential are highly diverse.
There is a high chance that these zoonotic coronaviruses will evolve and recombine, which would result in the emergence of new coronaviruses that are more transmissible or more lethal to humans in the future.
The culture of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be abandoned to reduce unnecessary contact between humans and animals.
Based on the bad experiences with SARS, MERS and COVID-19, a better preparedness and response plan should be adopted.
In fact, many viruses have been on the planet for a very long time.
They remain in their own natural reservoirs until the opportunity to propagate presents itself.
Although bats have many features that favor the spread of viruses, the opportunities for human contact with bats and other wildlife can be minimized if the population is educated to stay away from them.
Continuous surveillance of mammals is necessary to better understand the ecology of coronaviruses and their natural hosts, which will be useful in preventing animal-to-human transmission and future outbreaks.
In conclusion, the most effective way to prevent viral zoonosis is for humans to stay away from the ecological niches of the natural reservoirs of zoonotic viruses.
Several pieces of the puzzle of the zoonotic origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit an ancestral SARS-CoV-2 virus to pangolins, it will be interesting to analyze under what circumstances bats and pangolins could share the same ecological niche.
Secondly, if bats have a more direct role in transmission to humans, how humans come into contact with bats should be determined.
Third, if a third mammal acts as the true intermediate host, then how it interacts with different species, including humans, bats and pangolins, must be elucidated.
Finally, since many mammals, including domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, surveillance and experimental infection should be carried out.
Whether it's a bat, a pangolin or another mammal, SARS-CoV-2 or its parent viruses that are almost identical are expected to be identified in their natural hosts in the future.
Continued research in this area will elucidate the evolutionary pathway of SARS-CoV-2 in animals, with important implications for the prevention and control of COVID-19 in humans.
Diagnostic criteria for suspected cases and confirmed cases of COVID-19 need to be updated
On 6 February 2020, our team published a rapid advisory guideline for the diagnosis and treatment of infection with the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV), and this guideline included our experience and constitutes a good reference for fighting this pandemic worldwide.
However, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
In this letter, we respond to a comment on our guideline and provide the most recent diagnostic criteria of suspected case and confirmed case according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) caused an outbreak, which is now officially known as the 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) and the virus was named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, WHO classified COVID-19 as a pandemic.
To combat SARS-CoV-2 infection, our team developed a rapid advisory guideline that was published online in Military Medical Research on 06 February 2020.
It's attracted a lot of attention since it was published.
However, it should be noted that COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on the results of ongoing research and experience in clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are also continuously updated.
For example, the Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Committee of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between 16 January 2020 and 3 March 2020, have published a total of seven editions and some contexts have changed considerably.
Now, our director received a comment from Zhou et al., they submitted a simple classification proposal based on their clinical experience.
His work added new evidence to our guideline and also constitutes a valuable reference for this pandemic worldwide.
We support their important work and express our gratitude.
However, their work also needs updating according to the latest Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of COVID-19 (seventh version of the trial) and recent studies.
According to the seventh edition (3 March 2020), to confirm a suspected case it is necessary to combine any point of the epidemiological background characteristics with two points of the clinical manifestations to make a comprehensive analysis, or three points of the clinical manifestations must be met if there is no clear epidemiological background:
Epidemiological history: (1) history of travel or residence in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with infectious cases of SARS-CoV-2 (with positive nucleic acid test); (3) history of contact with patients with fever or respiratory symptoms in Wuhan city and surrounding areas, or other communities where cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with small groups of confirmed cases (≥ 2 cases with fever or respiratory symptoms occurring within 2 weeks in small areas such as home, office, school classroom, etc.).
Clinical manifestations: (1) fever or respiratory symptoms; (2) features on COVID-19 infection imaging; (3) total white blood cell counts showing normal, decreased or reduced lymphocyte counts in the early onset stage.
Diagnosis of a confirmed case should be based on a suspect case with some pathogenic or serologic test characteristic as follows: (1) real-time polymerase chain reaction test positive for SARS-CoV-2; (2) whole viral genome sequencing showing high homogeneity to the known novel coronaviruses; (3) positive result for specific IgM antibody and specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change of specific IgG antibody against SARS-CoV-2 from negative to positive, or ≥4 times higher titer increase in the recovery phase than in the acute phase.
We can see that the polymerase chain reaction test in real time to detect nucleic acid in blood or airway samples was added to the second (18 January 2020) and third (22 January 2020) editions.
Pathogen detection from blood samples was added to the fourth (27 January 2020) and fifth (8 February 2020) editions; and then, serological testing was added to the seventh edition.
{NS}
In addition, there is growing evidence that reminds us to be cautious with asymptomatic and atypical patients.
Therefore, the flow chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they classified the person without clinical symptoms as  low risk.
The scoring system should also be verified in other studies and clinical practices.
In conclusion, we hope that more direct evidence will emerge and we ask readers to send us their comments.
For the diagnosis of suspect case and confirmed case, we recommend that you seek out and follow the latest guidelines from your home countries.
Our team will also update our guideline in a timely manner to offer assistance.
Bangladesh reports five new deaths from COVID-19, the highest number in a single day
Bangladesh yesterday confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 in one day.
That's the highest number of deaths in a day from the virus.
As of yesterday, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) of Bangladesh reported that the number of recorded infected cases included 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases who were staying at home.
A total of 17 deaths have been recorded.
In an online briefing, IEDCR director Dr. Meerjady Sabrina Flora said that the victims were four men and one woman.
According to Dr. Meerjady, two cases were over 60 years old, two were between 51 and 60 years old, and one was between 41 and 50 years old.
He also said that two of the victims were from Dhaka.
On 11 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic, which was later confirmed by the WHO.
A hospital official told Anadolu Agency, a local news outlet, that one of the deceased was Jalal Saifur Rahman, director of the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission, who was being treated at Kuwait Maitree Hospital.
On Saturday, in an online video announcement, Bangladesh's Minister of Road Transport and Bridges, Obaidul Quader, said that public transport would be suspended for longer than initially planned, until this coming Saturday.
This suspension of public transportation had initially started on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Saturday, April 4.
Transport of essential goods, such as medical supplies, fuel and food, was still allowed.
The first recorded cases of COVID-19 infection in Bangladesh occurred on 8 March, involving two men who returned from Italy and the wife of one of them.
By March 19, all three had recovered.
More than one million SARS-CoV-2 infections worldwide
On Thursday, the total number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections exceeded one million worldwide, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths were related to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The milestone took place on the same day that Malawi confirmed its first coronavirus infections and Zambia had its first coronavirus-related death.
North Korea said on Thursday that it was one of the few countries without coronavirus infections.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1 051 635 confirmed cases, including 79 332 cases in the 24 hours prior to 10:00 a.m. Central European Time (UTC-0800) on 4 April.
In the United States, there have been over 244,000 reported cases of coronavirus, linked to at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS News reported, citing data from Johns Hopkins University, that there were more than 1000 deaths in the United States on Wednesday caused by coronavirus infections.
Around the world, countries announced tighter measures to inhibit the spread of the disease.
On Thursday, Sergei Sobyanin, the mayor of Moscow, extended the city's lockdown until May 1.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin declared that Russians would continue to receive their salaries without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese Parliament voted to extend the national state of emergency for 15 days; the vote was passed with 215 votes in favour, 10 abstentions and one vote against.
Saudi Arabia extended curfews in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the entire day; previously, the curfew was only maintained between 3:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10:00 p.m. and 4:00 a.m.
Ohio Governor Mike DeWine announced that the state had extended its stay-at-home order until May 1.
Supermarkets in Australia are lowering the limits of toilet paper per transaction
On Sunday and Saturday afternoon, Australian supermarket chains Woolworths and Coles lowered their toilet paper purchase limits to two and one pack per transaction in all supermarkets in the country, respectively.
On Monday, ALDI also applied the one-pack limit.
These limitations were posted as messages on the boxes and on the chains' Facebook pages.
Consumers were reportedly stocking up for fear of COVID-19 in case people had to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths also limited toilet paper purchases for home delivery to one package per order.
These changes were introduced after the previous restriction of four packages per transaction applied by Woolworths and Coles on 4 and 5 March respectively.
Coles, in his March 8 press release, reported that with the implementation of the four-pack restriction, "many supermarkets are still selling out within an hour of delivery", and said the demand was "unprecedented", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, said it was "unexpected".
Sales were up with a "strong increase" last week, according to a Woolworths spokesman.
The Costco supermarket in Canberra also limited the quantity to two packages last week.
To further alleviate the shortage, Coles requested larger packages from suppliers and increased the frequency of deliveries, Woolworths ordered additional stock, while ALDI made stock available for a planned special offer on Wednesday in advance.
Russell Zimmerman, executive director of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase inventories, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times are making it difficult.
It predicts an increase in production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and fewer supplies.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that, after the early release of stocks, some supermarkets can not make the special offer on Wednesday.
In a report on News.com.au, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that supermarkets stock up every night.
He pointed out that toilet paper is a bulky item, which causes a low quantity of stocks in numbers, and, when it is exhausted, leaves a large empty space on the shelves, which intensifies the feeling of scarcity.
Coles and Woolworths have the idea that if there was an abundant amount of the item on the shelves, if products like toilet paper rolls and disinfectants could be bought and there were large quantities, the panic would probably be minimized, Russell Zimmerman told ABC News.
The recycled toilet paper manufacturer Who Gives a Crap said last Wednesday that they were out of stock.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes Kleenex toilet paper, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, said they were working 24/7 to maintain supplies, according to the report on News.com.au.
Domain.com, a real estate site, reported that some property sellers were offering free toilet paper to the first bidder at auctions in Melbourne, when fewer auctions were held because buyers had time off on the Labor Day long weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, a newspaper printed in Darwin, included an eight-page insert designed to be cut and used as toilet paper.
Supermarkets were initially reluctant to impose restrictions, according to a March 3 report from ABC Australia, saying they had no plans to introduce restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman added that other products are also in high demand, including face masks, disinfectant, dry goods, liquid soap and flour.
Similarly, outside Australia, on Sunday afternoon it was noted that the British online supermarket Ocado limited purchases of Andres toilet paper to two 12-roll packages.
The World Health Organization has declared COVID-19 a pandemic
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, a pandemic.
Although the word "pandemic" only refers to the extent of a disease's spread, not how dangerous the specific cases are, the WHO highlighted the need to push governments to take action:
All countries can still change the course of this pandemic.
If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, identify and mobilize their people in response, said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO.
We are very concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction.
According to Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "unprecedented".
In statements published by CNN in February he stated, "besides influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced from its emergence to continuing worldwide spread".
Ghebreyesus expressed a similar view, saying "we have never before seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus".
"And we have never seen a pandemic that can be controlled at the same time before", he added.
The new pandemic status comes after the WHO's decision in January to declare the outbreak a public health emergency of international importance.
The director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "In conclusion, it's going to get worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there were at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, and more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported in 210 countries and territories, and around 97,000 deaths as a result.
About 364,000 people recovered.
The case fatality rate was estimated to be 4% in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
There is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and supportive therapy. Recommended preventive measures include hand washing, covering the mouth when coughing, keeping distance from other people, and monitoring and self-isolation of people who are suspected to be infected.
Authorities around the world responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, curfews, workplace hazard checks and facility closures.
The pandemic caused severe global socioeconomic disruption, the postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of supplies exacerbated by panic-driven purchases.
Schools and universities closed at the national or local level in 193 countries, affecting approximately 99.4% of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus was spread online, and there were incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese people, other people of East and Southeast Asian descent and appearance, and others from areas with significant virus cases.
Due to the reduction of travel and closures of heavy industry, there was a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
On 31 December 2019, health authorities in Wuhan, China, (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause, and in early January 2020 an investigation was launched.
The cases were mostly related to the Huanan seafood wholesale market, therefore the virus was thought to have a zoonotic origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus closely related to bat coronaviruses, pangolin coronaviruses and SARS-CoV. Subsequently, it was discovered that the first person known to have exhibited symptoms became ill on 1 December 2019, and that person had no visible connections to the last wet market group.
The first group of cases reported in December 2019 was found to have a link to the market.
On 13 March 2020, an unverified report from the South China Morning Post suggested that a case dating back to 17 November 2019, of a 55-year-old from Hubei Province, may have been the first. On 26 February 2020, WHO reported that as new cases reportedly declined in China but increased sharply in Italy, Iran and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China had surpassed, for the first time, the number of new cases within China.
There may be a considerable number of unreported cases, especially among those with milder symptoms.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases had been reported in young people, and those aged 19 and under accounted for 2.4% of cases worldwide.Patrick Vallance, the UK's Chief Scientific Adviser, estimated that 60% of the British population would have to be infected before effective herd immunity could be achieved.
The cases refer to the number of people who underwent COVID-19 testing, and who obtained a confirmed positive result according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and many countries have had official policies of not testing people who only had mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on 16 March revealed that, in China, up to 23 January, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 infections had not been detected, and that these unrecorded infections were the source of infection for 79% of registered cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March estimated that the numbers of infections in Italy were considerably higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the baseline reproductive number (R0) for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that it could be 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who did not, the time from the onset of symptoms to death was between 6 and 41 days, most commonly 14 days.
As of April 10, 2020, approximately 97,000 deaths had been attributed to COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, about 80% of deaths were people over 60 years of age, and 75% had pre-existing conditions, including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Official records of deaths from the COVID-19 pandemic generally refer to people who died after testing positive for COVID, according to official protocols.
It is possible that the actual number of deaths from COVID-19 is much higher, as people who died without testing, for example, at home, in nursing homes, etc., may not be included.
Partial data from Italy revealed that the number of additional deaths during the pandemic exceeded the official record of COVID deaths by a factor of 4 to 5 times.
A spokesperson for the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) admitted "We know that [the number of deaths reported] is an underestimate", a claim corroborated by anecdotal undercounting reports in the United States. This undercounting is common in pandemics, such as in the 2009 H1N1 swine flu pandemic. The first confirmed death occurred in Wuhan on January 9, 2020.
The first death outside mainland China occurred on February 1 in the Philippines, and the first death outside Asia occurred in France on February 14.
As of February 28, outside mainland China, more than a dozen deaths were recorded in each of the countries of Iran, South Korea, and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, on all continents except Antarctica.
These numbers vary by region and over time, and are influenced by the amount of testing, quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, time elapsed since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, and overall health.
According to Johns Hopkins University statistics, the global ratio of deaths to cases is 6.0 % (97 039/1 617 204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, estimates of the case fatality ratio decreased from 17.3% (in those with onset of symptoms on 1-10 January 2020) to 0.7% (in those with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other indicators include case fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who died from a disease, and infection fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of infected (diagnosed and undiagnosed) who died from a disease.
These statistics are not time-bound and consider a specific population from infection to case resolution.
Some academics have tried to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine at the University of Oxford estimates the overall infection mortality rate of the pandemic to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The upper estimate of this range is consistent with the results of the first randomized testing for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of testing on estimates of case fatality rate.
The WHO says the pandemic is manageable.
The peak and final duration of the outbreak are uncertain and may differ by location.
Maciej Boni of Pennsylvania State University noted, "Infectious outbreaks, if not controlled, generally stabilize and then begin to decline when the disease becomes without available hosts.
But at this point, it is almost impossible to make any reasonable prediction of when that will happen".
The chief medical adviser to the Chinese government, Zhong Nanshan, argued that "it could be over in June" if all countries can be mobilized to follow the WHO recommendation on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will remain circulating, possibly for one or two years".
According to the Imperial College study led by Neil Ferguson, physical distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (possibly 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University stated, "I think it is unlikely that this coronavirus, since it is so easily transmitted, will disappear completely" and "could become a seasonal disease, reappearing every year".
The virulence of the reappearance would depend on the herd immunity and the magnitude of the mutation.
Symptoms of COVID-19 may be relatively non-specific and infected people may be asymptomatic.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Less common symptoms include fatigue, production of sputum in the airways (phlegm), loss of sense of smell, shortness of breath, muscle and joint pain, sore throat, headache, chills, vomiting, hemoptysis, diarrhea or cyanosis. The WHO states that approximately one in six people becomes seriously ill and has difficulty breathing.
According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pressure or pain, sudden confusion, difficulty waking up, and bluish color to the face or lips; upon manifestation of these symptoms, immediate medical attention is recommended. Further progression of the disease can result in severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, septic shock, and death.
Some of the infected people may be asymptomatic, not showing clinical symptoms, although test results confirm infection, therefore, the researchers advised to monitor and carefully examine those who have close contact with confirmed infected people in order to rule out infection.
Chinese estimates of the proportion of asymptomatic people range from a few to 44%.
The usual incubation period (the time between infection and the onset of symptoms) ranges from one to 14 days; more frequently it is 5 days. As an example of uncertainty, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who lost their sense of smell at the beginning was 30%, and then decreased to 15%.
Some details of how the disease spreads are still being determined.
The disease is thought to be spread mainly during close contact and through small droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact is considered a distance of 1 to 2 meters (3 to 6 feet).
Studies show that when you cough without a mask, the droplets can travel from 15 feet (4.5 m) to 27 feet (8.2 m).
Some have proposed that the virus can also be transmitted through small droplets that remain in the air for longer periods, which can be generated by speaking.
The droplets can enter the mouth or nose of people nearby or possibly inhale into the lungs.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), can cause aerosolization of respiratory secretions and therefore airborne spread.
It can also be spread when one touches a contaminated surface, including the skin, and then touches the eyes, nose or mouth.
While there is concern that it may be transmitted through feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government denied the possibility of oral fecal transmission of SARS-CoV-2.The virus is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread may be possible before symptoms become manifest and in more advanced stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease up to three days before symptoms appeared, indicating that transmission is possible before significant symptoms develop.
There are only a few reports of asymptomatic cases confirmed by laboratory, but, some countries have identified asymptomatic transmission during contact tracing investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) maintains that, although it is not completely clear how easily the disease is spread, usually one person infects two or three others.
Specifically, it was determined that the virus is detectable for up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 stainless steel, one day on cardboard and up to four hours on copper.
This, however, varies with humidity and temperature. Positive results were obtained in tests for COVID-19 performed on pets and other animals.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although British authorities recommend washing hands after contact with animals, as well as after contact with other surfaces that infected people may have touched.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a new virus, first isolated from three people with pneumonia linked to the cluster of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All features of the new SARS-CoV-2 virus are found in related coronaviruses in nature. Outside the human body, the virus dies upon contact with soap, which dissolves its protective envelope. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
It is believed to be zoonotic in origin.
Genetic analyses revealed that the coronavirus is genetically grouped with the betacoronavirus genus, its subgenus sarbecovirus (lineage B) along with two strains derived from the bat.
At the full genome level, it is 96% identical to other bat coronavirus samples (BatCov RaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers discovered that there is only a difference in amino acids in certain parts of the genome sequences between pangolin viruses and those of humans.
To date, the full genome comparison indicated that pangolin coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 share, at most, 92% of the genetic material, which is not sufficient to prove that pangolins are the intermediate host.
Infection with the virus can be provisionally diagnosed on the basis of symptoms, but ultimately confirmed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected secretions or by computed tomography imaging.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan in which the polymerase chain reaction was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images match the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not using CT scans as a screening method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".
WHO has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses the real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be done on blood or breath samples.
The results are usually available within a few hours or days.
This test is usually done with a nasopharyngeal swab, although a throat swab can also be used. Some laboratories and companies are developing serological tests, which detect antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have proven to be sufficiently accurate to warrant widespread use.
In the US, a serological test developed by Cellex was approved for emergency use by certified laboratories only.
Characteristic features in X-ray and CT images of symptomatic individuals include asymmetric peripheral desultrated glass opacities and absent pleural effusions.
The Italian Society of Radiology is compiling an international online database of the results obtained in images of confirmed cases.
Due to overlap with other infections such as adenovirus, non-confirmatory imaging by polymerase chain reaction has limited specificity in identifying COVID-19.
A large study in China compared the results of CT scans of the chest with those of the polymerase chain reaction and showed that, although imaging is less specific to infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting its consideration as a screening tool in areas affected by the epidemic.
Convolutional neural networks based on artificial intelligence were developed to detect virus features in images, both with X-rays and with CT scans.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining good general personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands, and sneezing or coughing on a disposable handkerchief and throwing the handkerchief directly into a waste container.
It is recommended that those who may already be infected wear a surgical mask in public.
Physical distancing measures are also recommended to prevent transmission.Many governments have restricted or discouraged all non-essential travel to and from countries and areas affected by the outbreak.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in many parts of the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within communities, and some community members do not know where or how they became infected.It is recommended that healthcare providers who are caring for someone who may be infected take standard precautions, contact precautions and wear eye protection.Contact tracing is an important method for health authorities to determine the source of an infection and to prevent further transmission.
The use of mobile phone location data by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, and Amnesty International and more than 100 other organizations issued a statement demanding limits on this type of surveillance.
Several mobile apps have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen think tanks were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
Users then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Misconceptions are circulating about how to prevent infection; for example, nasal washing and mouthwash gargling are not effective.
There is no vaccine against COVID-19, although many organizations are working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands frequently with soap and water for at least twenty seconds, especially after using the toilet or when their hands are visibly dirty; before eating; and after blowing their nose, coughing, or sneezing.
This is because, outside the human body, the virus dies upon contact with soap, which disintegrates its protective bubble.
The CDC also recommended using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol by volume when soap and water are not available.
The WHO recommends that people avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
Surfaces can be decontaminated with various solutions (within one minute after exposure to the disinfectant on a stainless steel surface), including 6271% ethanol, 50100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hypochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.27.5% iodated povidone.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine gluconate, are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID case is suspected or confirmed in a facility, such as an office or daycare, all areas such as offices, bathrooms, common spaces, shared electronic equipment, such as tablets, touch screens, keyboards, remote controls and ATMs that have been used by sick people be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that people cover their mouth and nose with a flexed elbow or a disposable handkerchief for coughing or sneezing and that they discard the handkerchief immediately.
It is recommended that those who may be infected wear surgical masks, as wearing a mask may limit the volume and distance traveled by respiratory droplets that are dispersed by speaking, sneezing, and coughing.
WHO issued instructions on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce [people's] tendency to touch their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene".
WHO has recommended the use of masks by healthy people only if they are at high risk, for example those caring for a person with COVID-19, although it also recognizes that wearing masks can help people avoid touching their faces.
Several countries have begun to encourage the use of face masks by the public.
In the US, the CDC recommends using non-medical masks made from fabric. China specifically recommended the use of disposable medical masks by healthy members of the public, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 feet) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing a surgical mask when taking public transport or being in crowded places.
Health officials in Thailand recommend that people make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia banned going out in public spaces without wearing a mask or covering one's nose and mouth.
On 16 March, Vietnam requested that all people wear a mask when in public spaces to protect themselves and others.
The Government of Austria required the use of masks by all persons entering a supermarket.
Israel requested that all residents wear face masks in public.
Taiwan, which has been manufacturing ten million masks a day since mid-March, on April 1 required the use of masks by passengers on intercity trains and buses.
Panama imposed the mandatory use of masks to go outdoors, while also recommending the manufacture of homemade masks to those who cannot afford to buy them.
Masks have also been widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as physical distancing) includes infection control measures designed to slow the spread of disease by minimizing close contact between people.
Methods include quarantines, travel restrictions, and closure of schools, workplaces, stadiums, theaters, and shopping centers.
Individuals can implement social distancing methods by staying at home, limiting travel, avoiding crowded areas, using non-contact forms of greeting, and physically distancing themselves from other people.
Many governments now require or recommend social distancing in outbreak-affected regions.
The maximum size of meetings recommended by US government agencies and health organizations was quickly reduced from 250 people (if there was no known spread of COVID-19 in a region) to 50 people, and subsequently to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with underlying conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and compromised immune systems are at increased risk of severe illness and complications, and the CDC recommends that they stay at home as much as possible in areas of the community affected by the outbreak. In late March 2020, the WHO and other health agencies began replacing the use of the term "social distancing" with "physical distancing", to clarify that the goal is to reduce physical contact while maintaining social connections, whether virtually or at a distance.
The use of the term "social distancing" has had an impact on the assumption that people should adopt complete social isolation, rather than encouraging them to stay in touch with others through alternative means.Some authorities have published sexual health guidelines to use during the pandemic.
They include recommendations to only have sex with a live-in partner who is neither infected with the virus nor has symptoms of the virus.
Self-isolation at home was recommended for those diagnosed with COVID-19 and those suspected to have been infected.
Health agencies have published detailed instructions on proper self-isolation. Many governments have required or recommended self-quarantine of entire populations in affected areas.
The strictest self-quarantine instructions were issued for those belonging to high-risk groups.
People who may have been in contact with someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with widespread transmission are recommended to self-quarantine for 14 days from the time of last possible exposure.
Strategies for controlling an outbreak are containment or suppression and mitigation.
Containment is carried out in the early stages of the outbreak and is aimed at identifying and isolating infected people, as well as introducing other infection control measures and vaccines to prevent the disease from spreading to the rest of the population.
When the spread of the disease can no longer be controlled, efforts move to the mitigation phase: measures are taken to contain the spread and mitigate its effects on the health system and society.
A combination of containment and mitigation measures may be adopted at the same time.
Suppression requires more extreme measures to be able to reverse the pandemic through reducing the baseline reproduction number to less than 1.Part of controlling an outbreak of an infectious disease involves trying to decrease the epidemic peak, which is known as flattening the epidemic curve.
This reduces the risk of health services collapsing and allows more time for the development of vaccines and treatments.
Non-pharmaceutical interventions that can control the outbreak include personal preventive measures such as hand hygiene, mask use, and self-quarantine; community-led physical distancing measures such as school closures and cancellation of mass attendance events; community commitment to foster acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures and surface cleaning.In China, more drastic measures were taken to contain the outbreak once its severity became apparent, such as the implementation of quarantines in entire cities and the imposition of strict travel bans.
Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus.
South Korea implemented mass screening assessments and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected people.
Singapore provided financial support to infected people who decided to quarantine and imposed large fines on those who did not.
Taiwan increased mask production and sanctioned the accumulation of medical supplies.[citation needed] Simulations in Britain and the United States show that mitigation (which slows the spread of the epidemic but does not stop it) and suppression (which reverses the growth of the pandemic) have major challenges.
Optimal mitigation policies could reduce peak demand for health care by two-thirds and deaths by half, but still generate hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Suppression may be preferred, but should be maintained for as long as the virus circulates in the human population (or until a vaccine is available, if that happens first), as otherwise transmission is rapidly reactivated when measures are relaxed.
Long-term intervention to suppress the pandemic involves social and economic costs.
There are no specific antiviral drugs approved for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop them, including testing existing drugs.
Taking over-the-counter cold medicines, drinking fluids, and resting can help to relieve symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
Steroid use can worsen the results.
Several compounds that were previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
WHO also indicated that some "home and traditional remedies" can alleviate symptoms caused by SARS-CoV-19.
WHO describes increasing capacity and adapting health care to the needs of COVID-19 patients as a fundamental measure of the outbreak response.
The ECDC and WHO Regional Office for Europe have formulated guidelines for hospitals and primary health care services for the redistribution of resources at different levels, including focusing laboratory services on COVID-19 testing, cancelling optional procedures where possible, separating and isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of available respirators and beds.
There are several theories as to where the first case (the so-called patient zero) may have originated.
The first known case of the new coronavirus can be traced back to December 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Over the course of a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mainly linked to the wholesale seafood market in Huanan, which also sold live animals, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, that it has a zoonotic origin.
On December 30, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital warned their colleagues about a "SARS-like coronavirus".
Police admonished eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, for spreading false rumors, and another doctor, Ai Fen, was reprimanded by her superiors for sounding the alarm.
Subsequently, on 31 December, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice and informed WHO.
By early January, enough cases of pneumonia of unknown cause had been reported to health authorities in Wuhan to initiate an investigation.During the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early to mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other Chinese provinces, which was helped by migration over the Chinese New Year and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation hub and a major railway junction.
On January 20, China reported around 140 new cases in one day, including two people in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data show that, as of 20 January 2020, 6174 people had already developed symptoms.[17][18] As of 26 March, the United States has surpassed China and Italy as the country with the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.[19] As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases have been reported worldwide; more than 97 000 people have died and more than 364 000 have recovered.[20]
About 200 countries and territories have had at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area have restricted free movement and established border controls.
National reactions have included containment measures, such as quarantines (known as stay-at-home orders, shelter-in-place orders, or confinement) and curfews. As of 2 April, about 300 million people, or about 90% of the population, are under some form of confinement in the United States, over 50 million people are confined in the Philippines, about 59 million people are confined in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are confined in India.
As of March 26, 1.7 billion people worldwide were under some form of lockdown, which increased to 2.6 billion people two days later, about a third of the world's population.
The first confirmed case of COVID-19 dates back to 1 December 2019 in Wuhan; an unconfirmed report indicates the first case occurred on 17 November.
On December 26, Dr. Zhang Jixian observed a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown cause, and her hospital reported to the Wuhan Jianghan CDC on December 27.
The first genetic tests of patient samples on 27 December 2019 indicated the presence of a SARS-like coronavirus.
On December 31, the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission issued a public notice.
WHO was informed the same day.
While these notifications were being made, the police warned doctors in Wuhan for "spreading rumors" about the outbreak.
The National Health Commission of China initially claimed that there was no "clear evidence" of human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a drastic campaign, later described by Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping as a "people's war", to contain the spread of the virus.
In what was described as "the largest quarantine in human history", a travel ban was announced on 23 January, banning travel in and out of Wuhan, this spread to a total of 15 cities in Hubei, and affected some 57 million people in total.
The use of private vehicles in the city was prohibited.
Chinese New Year celebrations (January 25) were canceled in many places.
The authorities also announced the construction of a temporary hospital, Huoshenshan Hospital, which was completed in 10 days.
Later, another hospital, Leishenshan Hospital, was built to accommodate more patients.
In addition to the newly built hospitals, China also converted 14 other facilities in Wuhan, such as convention centers and stadiums, into temporary hospitals. On 26 January, the Government implemented further measures to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, which included issuing health declarations for travellers and extending the Spring Festival holiday.
Universities and schools across the country were also closed.
The Hong Kong and Macao regions implemented various measures, especially in relation to schools and universities.
Remote work measures have been established in various regions of China.
Travel restrictions were implemented in and out of Hubei.
Public transportation was modified and museums were temporarily closed throughout China.
Public movement control was implemented in several cities, and it has been estimated that around 760 million people (more than half the population) faced some form of outdoor restrictions.After the start of the global phase of the outbreak in March, Chinese authorities adopted strict measures to prevent the "import" of the virus from other countries.
For example, Beijing has imposed a mandatory 14-day quarantine for all international travelers entering the city.As of 23 March, in mainland China only one case had been transmitted nationally in the previous five days, this time through a traveler who returned from Istanbul to Canton.
On 24 March 2020, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang reported that the spread of nationally transmitted cases was basically blocked and the outbreak had been controlled in China.
On the same day, travel restrictions were eased in Hubei, as well as in Wuhan, two months after the lockdown was imposed. On 26 March 2020, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that entry of visa or residence permit holders would be suspended as of 28 March, without specific details of when this policy will end.
Those wishing to enter China must apply for visas at Chinese embassies or consulates.
The Chinese government urged businesses and factories to reopen on March 30 and provided economic stimulus packages for firms.The State Council declared a day of mourning that will begin with a three-minute national silence on April 4 at 10:00 am, coinciding with the Qingming Festival, though the central government asked families to pay their respects online to comply with physical distancing in order to prevent the re-emergence of COVID-19.
On 20 January 2020, it was confirmed that COVID-19 had spread from China to South Korea.
On February 20, the country's health agency reported a significant rise in confirmed cases, attributed mainly to a meeting in Daegu of a new religious movement known as the Shincheonji Church of Jesus.
Shincheonji devotees visiting Daegu from Wuhan are suspected to be the source of the outbreak.
As of 22 February, of the church's 9336 followers, 1261 or about 13% reported symptoms.
On 28 February, more than 2,000 confirmed cases were reported in Korea, which increased to 3,150 on 29 February.
All South Korean military bases were put under quarantine after tests confirmed that three soldiers tested positive for the virus.
Airline schedules were also affected, and therefore modified.South Korea introduced what was considered the world's largest and best organized program to screen the virus in the population and isolate those infected, as well as identify and quarantine those who had been in contact with them.
Detection methods included mandatory self-reporting of symptoms by new arrivals from other countries through a mobile app, drive-thru centres to carry out virus testing with results available the next day, and increased diagnostic capacity to test up to 20,000 people every day.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not adopting quarantining entire cities.
Many Koreans signed petitions demanding Moon's dismissal for what they considered the government's mishandling of the outbreak, or else, praising its response.
On March 23, South Korea was reported to have the lowest one-day total of cases in four weeks.
On 29 March, it was reported that, as of 1 April, all new arrivals from abroad will be required to remain in quarantine for two weeks.
According to media reports, on April 1, South Korea received requests for assistance for the testing of the virus from 121 different countries.
On 19 February, Iran reported its first confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infections in Qom, where, according to the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, two people died later that day.
Early measures announced by the Government included the cancellation of concerts and other cultural events, sporting events and Friday prayers, and the closure of universities, higher education institutions and schools.
Iran has allocated five billion riyals to combat the virus.
On 26 February 2020, President Hassan Rouhani said that there were no plans to quarantine the areas affected by the outbreak, and that only people would be quarantined.
In March, plans were announced to limit travel between the cities, although heavy traffic between the cities as a consequence of the Persian New Year Nowruz continued.
Shiite shrines in Qom remained open to pilgrims until 16 March 2020.
Amid claims of a cover-up of the scale of the outbreak in Iran, more than ten countries had traced their cases to Iran by February 28, indicating that the scale of the outbreak could be more severe than the 388 cases reported by the Iranian government by that date.
The Iranian Parliament was closed, and on 3 March, 23 of its 290 members reported that they tested positive for the virus.
On March 12, Human Rights Watch urged Iranian prison authorities to unconditionally release human rights defenders detained for peaceful dissent, and to also temporarily release all eligible prisoners.
He indicated that there is a greater risk of spread of the virus in closed institutions, such as detention centres, which also lack adequate medical care.
On 15 March, the Iranian government reported 100 deaths in a single day, the highest number recorded in the country since the outbreak began.
As of 17 March, at least 12 ex-politicians or serving politicians in Iran had died from the disease.
As of March 23, Iran was experiencing 50 new cases per hour and one new death every ten minutes due to coronavirus.
According to a WHO official, there may be five times more cases in Iran than are being reported.
It is also suggested that US sanctions on Iran may be affecting the country's financial capacity to respond to the viral outbreak.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has demanded relief from economic sanctions for the countries most affected by the pandemic, including Iran.
On 31 January, the spread of the outbreak to Italy was confirmed, when two Chinese tourists tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in Rome.
Cases began to increase rapidly, prompting the Italian government to suspend all flights to and from China and declare a state of emergency.
Subsequently, a group of unrelated COVID-19 cases was detected, beginning with 16 confirmed cases in Lombardy on 21 February.On 22 February, the Council of Ministers announced a new decree law to contain the outbreak, which included quarantining more than 50 000 people from 11 different municipalities in northern Italy.
Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, "No one will be allowed to enter or leave the areas affected by the outbreak.
Work activities and sporting events have already been ordered to be suspended in those areas". On 4 March, the Italian government ordered the complete closure of schools and universities across the country as Italy reached its 100th death.
All major sporting events, including Serie A football matches, were to be held behind closed doors until April, but, on 9 March, all sporting events were completely suspended for at least a month.
On March 11, Prime Minister Conte ordered the suspension of virtually all commercial activities except supermarkets and pharmacies. On March 6, the Italian College of Anesthesia, Analgesia, Resuscitation and Intensive Care (SIAARTI) published medical ethics recommendations on the triage protocols that could be used.
On 19 March, Italy overtook China as the country with the most coronavirus-related deaths in the world after reporting 3,405 deaths from the pandemic.
On 22 March, it was reported that Russia had sent nine military aircraft with medical equipment to Italy.
As of April 5, there were 128 948 confirmed cases, 15 887 deaths and 21 815 recoveries in Italy, and most of those cases occurred in the Lombardy region.
A CNN report indicated that the combination of Italy's large elderly population and the inability to test all people who have the virus to date could contribute to the high lethality rate.
The UK's response to the virus first emerged as one of the most relaxed affected countries, and until 18 March 2020, the UK Government did not impose any form of social distancing measures or mass quarantine on its citizens.
As a result, the Government received criticism for the apparent lack of speed and intensity in its response to the concerns faced by the public.On 16 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson made an announcement in which he advised against social contact and all non-essential travel, and suggested that people work from home whenever possible and avoid places such as bars, restaurants and theatres.
On 20 March, the Government announced the closure of all leisure establishments, such as bars and gyms, as soon as possible, and promised to pay up to 80% of workers' wages up to a limit of GBP 2,500 per month to prevent unemployment during the crisis.[citation needed] On 23 March, the Prime Minister announced stricter social distancing measures, which banned gatherings of more than two people and restricted travel and outdoor activities to those deemed strictly necessary.
Unlike previous measures, the police could enforce these restrictions through the imposition of fines and the dispersal of meetings.
Most businesses were ordered to close, except for those deemed "essential", including supermarkets, pharmacies, banks, hardware stores, gas stations and workshops.

On January 28, 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Government's primary public health institute, announced that they had developed their own test kit.
Despite doing so, the United States got off to a slow start in testing, which concealed the true scale of the outbreak at the time.
Testing was marred by defective test kits produced by the federal government in February, the federal government's failure to approve non-governmental (academy, company, and hospital) test kits until late February, and the restrictive criteria for people to qualify for a test until early March (then a medical order was required).
As of February 27, the Washington Post reported that fewer than 4,000 tests had been done in the United States.
As of March 13, The Atlantic reported that fewer than 14,000 tests had been performed.
On 22 March, the Associated Press reported: "Many people with symptoms and a medical order have waited hours or days for a test".[22] After the first death in the United States was reported on 29 February in Washington state, Governor Jay Inslee declared a state of emergency, a move that other states soon followed.

Medical tests were done before takeoff, and four South Africans who had signs of coronavirus had to stay behind to mitigate the risk.
Only South Africans who tested negative were repatriated.
The test results authorized all South Africans, including the flight crew, pilots, hotel staff, police and soldiers who participated in the humanitarian mission, who, as a preventive measure, remained under observation and quarantine for a period of 14 days at The Ranch Resort.
On 20 March, the United States began to partially withdraw its troops from Iraq due to the pandemic.

For example, Spain recalled 58,000 coronavirus test kits manufactured in China with an accuracy rate of only 30%, while the Netherlands recalled 600,000 defective Chinese masks.
Belgium recalled 100,000 unusable masks, which were thought to be from China, but were actually from Colombia.
On the other hand, China's aid was well received in parts of Latin America and Africa.On April 2, the World Bank started emergency support operations for developing countries.
WHO praised the efforts of Chinese authorities in controlling and containing the epidemic.
The WHO pointed to the difference between the 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, when Chinese authorities were accused of secrecy that impeded prevention and containment efforts, and the current crisis, in which the central government "has provided periodic updates to avoid panic ahead of the Lunar New Year holidays".
On 23 January, in response to the decision of central authorities to implement a ban on transport in Wuhan, WHO representative Gauden Galea noted that while "it was definitely not a recommendation that WHO made", it was "a very important indication of commitment to contain the epidemic where it is most concentrated" and said that it was "unprecedented in the history of public health".[22] On 30 January, following the confirmation of human-to-human transmission outside China and the increase in the number of cases in other countries, WHO declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), the sixth PHEIC since the measure was first invoked during the 2009 influenza pandemic.
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom said that the HIPC was due to "the risk of global spread, especially to low- and middle-income countries without strong health systems".
In response to the implementation of the travel restrictions, Tedros stated that "there is no reason to take measures that unnecessarily interfere with international trade and travel" and that "WHO does not recommend limiting trade or movement".
On 5 February, WHO appealed to the global community for a contribution of $675 million to fund strategic preparedness in low-income countries, citing the urgency to support those countries "who do not have systems to detect people who have contracted the virus, if they have them".
Tedros also made statements in which he stated that "we are only as strong as our weakest link" and urged the international community to "invest today or pay more in the future". On February 11, the WHO announced at a press conference that COVID-19 was the name of the disease.
On the same day, Tedros claimed that UN Secretary-General António Guterres had agreed to bring the "power of the entire UN system into the response".
As a result, a UN crisis management team was activated, which allowed for the coordination of the all-UN response, which WHO says will allow them to "focus on the health response while the other agencies can bring their expertise to address the broader social, economic and developmental consequences of the outbreak".
On 14 February, a joint WHO-led mission team with China was activated to provide international and WHO experts on the ground in China to assist in national management and assess "the severity and transmissibility of the disease" through organizing workshops and meetings with leading institutions at the national level and to conduct site visits in order to assess the "impact of provincial and county level response activities, including urban and rural environments".[32] On 25 February, WHO stated that "the world must do sooner to prepare for a possible coronavirus pandemic", and noted that, although it was still too early to call it a pandemic, countries should nevertheless be "in a preparedness phase".[33]
In response to a developing outbreak in Iran, the WHO sent a joint mission team there to assess the situation. On 28 February, WHO officials said the global coronavirus threat assessment would rise from "high" to "very high", its highest level of alert and risk assessment.
Mike Ryan, executive director of the WHO's health emergencies program, warned in a statement that "This is a reality check for all governments on the planet: wake up.
This virus may be on its way and we must be prepared", insisting that appropriate response measures could help the world avoid "the worst".
Ryan also said that current data did not warrant public health officials declaring a global pandemic, and noted that such a declaration would mean that "basically we are accepting that every human being on the planet will be exposed to that virus".
On 11 March, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak to be a pandemic.
The director-general said that WHO was "very concerned, both by the alarming levels of spread and severity, and by the alarming levels of inaction".[5] The WHO has received significant criticism for what is considered inadequate handling of the pandemic, including the late declaration of a public health emergency and the classification of the virus as a pandemic.
The backlash included a petition for the resignation of WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, signed by 733,000 people as of 6 April.
On 26 March 2020, dozens of UN human rights experts stressed that the rights of all people should be respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
The group of experts said that everyone has a right to life-saving interventions and that the government has this responsibility.
The group stressed that lack of resources or health insurance should never be used as a justification for discrimination against a specific group.
The experts highlighted that all people have the right to health, including people with disabilities, those belonging to minority groups, older people, internally displaced people, homeless people, those living in conditions of extreme poverty, detainees, as well as refugees and other unspecified groups in need of government support.
International governmental organizations are addressing the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 crisis.
The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development launched a platform to provide comprehensive and timely information on policy responses in countries around the world, as well as insights and advice.
From policies to strengthen health systems and the global economy to addressing the effects of lockdown and travel restrictions, the digital hub includes a country-by-country policy tracker, and is intended to help countries learn from each other and facilitate a coordinated global response to the coronavirus challenge.
The Chinese government has been criticized by the United States, UK Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove, and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's son Eduardo Bolsonaro for its handling of the pandemic, which began in China's Hubei province.
Several provincial-level administrators of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) were fired over their handling of quarantine efforts in central China, a sign of discontent with the political system's response to the outbreak in those regions.
Some commentators believe this measure was taken to protect Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping from public anger over the coronavirus outbreak.
Some Chinese officials, for example Zhao Lijian, dismissed an earlier acknowledgement of the outbreak of coronavirus in Wuhan, in favor of conspiracy theories about the origin of COVID-19 in the US or Italy.
The US administration of Donald Trump has referred to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus" or the "Wuhan virus", and claimed that China's "censorship over-fed a virus that has now become a global pandemic", which, in turn, was pointed out by some critics as racism and "[a] distraction from his administration's failure to contain the disease".
The Daily Beast obtained a telegram from the U.S. government describing a communications ploy apparently originating at the National Security Council, and citing the strategy as "All About China".
We have been told to try to convey this message in any way possible, including press conferences and television appearances. "Media outlets such as Politico, Foreign Policy and Bloomberg have claimed that China's efforts to send aid to countries affected by the virus are part of a propaganda to gain global influence.
The European Union's foreign policy representative, Josep Borrell, warned that "there is a geopolitical component that includes a struggle for influence through propaganda and the politics of generosity".
Borrell also said that "China is aggressively pushing the message that, unlike the United States, it is a responsible and reliable partner".
China also asked the US to lift its sanctions against Syria, Venezuela and Iran, while reportedly sending aid to the latter two countries.
On April 3, U.S. sanctions blocked Jack Ma from donating 100,000 masks to Cuba.
The US authorities were also accused of diverting aid destined for other countries to their own country.
And mask-related disputes have been reported between other countries, such as Germany, Austria and Switzerland; and between the Czech Republic and Italy.
In addition, Turkey seized hundreds of respirators destined for Spain.
In early March, the Italian Government criticized the lack of solidarity of the European Union with Italy, which was affected by the coronavirus.
Maurizio Massari, Italian ambassador to the European Union, said that "Only China responded bilaterally.
This is certainly not a good sign of European solidarity.'
On 22 March, after a telephone call with Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the Russian army to send military doctors, special disinfection vehicles and other medical equipment to Italy.
The Italian newspaper La Stampa quoted an anonymous "high-level political source" as saying that 80 percent of Russian aid was "useless or of little use to Italy".
The source accused Russia of undertaking a "geopolitical and diplomatic" seduction offensive.
The President of Lombardy, Attilio Fontana, and the Italian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Luigi Di Maio, dismissed the news reports and expressed their gratitude.
Russia also sent a cargo plane with medical aid to the United States.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that "in offering help to American colleagues, [Putin] assumes that, when the US manufacturers of medical materials and equipment gain momentum, they will also be able to respond if necessary".
The planned NATO military exercise "Defender 2020" in Germany, Poland and the Baltic States, the largest NATO war exercise since the end of the Cold War, will be conducted on a small scale.
The Secretary General of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, Kate Hudson, criticized the Defender 2020 exercise: "In the current public health crisis, it endangers the lives not only of the troops of the United States and the various European countries that participate, but also of the inhabitants of the countries in which they operate".[34] The Iranian government was heavily affected by the virus, with around two dozen members of Parliament infected, as well as fifteen other current and former political figures.
On 14 March 2020, President of Iran Hassan Rouhani wrote a public letter to world leaders asking for help, and said that his country is having difficulty fighting the outbreak due to lack of access to international markets as a result of US sanctions against Iran. The outbreak prompted demands for the United States to adopt common social policies in other rich countries, such as universal health care, universal child care, paid family leave, and higher levels of public health funding.
Political analysts anticipated that it may negatively affect Donald Trump's re-election chances in the 2020 presidential election.
South Korea criticized Japan's "ambiguous and passive quarantine efforts", after Japan announced that anyone from South Korea would be quarantined for two weeks at government-designated sites.
South Korean society was initially polarized over Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.
Many Koreans signed petitions to demand Moon's removal from office for what they considered the government's mishandling of the outbreak, or to praise its response.
Some commentators have expressed concern that it could allow governments to strengthen their grip on power.
In Hungary, its Parliament voted to allow Prime Minister Viktor Orbán to rule by decree indefinitely, suspend Parliament and elections and sanction those deemed to have spread false information about the virus and the government's handling of the crisis.
The coronavirus outbreak was blamed for several cases of supply shortages, as a result of increased global use of outbreak-fighting equipment, panic-driven purchases and disruptions of logistics and factory operations.
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued warnings about shortages of medicines and medical equipment due to increased consumer demand and supplier disruption.
Various localities also witnessed panic-driven shopping that left shelves empty of essentials such as food, toilet paper and bottled water, leading to shortages of supplies.
The technology sector, in particular, has been warning about delays in shipments of electronic products.
According to WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom, the demand for personal protective equipment increased 100 times.
This demand generated an increase in prices of up to twenty times the normal price and also caused delays of four to six months in the supply of medical items.
It also caused a shortage of personal protective equipment worldwide, and WHO warned that this would put health workers at risk.
In Australia, the pandemic provided a new opportunity for daigou buyers to sell Australian products in China.
The activity has created a shortage of infant formula in some supermarkets and was subsequently banned by the Australian Government.Despite the high prevalence of COVID-19 cases in northern Italy and the Wuhan region, and the subsequent demand for food products, none of these areas were affected by the acute food shortage.
Measures by China and Italy against the hoarding and illicit trade in essential commodities have been successful, and have prevented an acute food shortage that was anticipated in Europe and North America.
Northern Italy, with its large agricultural production, has not seen a significant reduction, but prices could rise, according to industry representatives.
Food shelves were only temporarily empty, even in the city of Wuhan, while Chinese government officials released pork stocks to ensure sufficient food for the population.
In Italy similar laws require food producers to keep reserves for such emergencies.
The damage to the global economy was felt in China: according to a press report on March 16, China's economy was hit hard in the first two months of 2020 due to measures taken by the Government to stop the spread of the virus, and retail sales fell by 20.5%.
As mainland China is a major economic and manufacturing center, the viral outbreak has been considered a considerable destabilizing threat to the global economy.
Agathe Demarais of The Economist's Intelligence Unit has forecast that markets will remain volatile until a clearer picture emerges of the potential consequences.
In January 2020, some analysts estimated that the economic consequences of the epidemic on global growth could exceed those of the 20022004 SARS outbreak.
An estimate by an expert at Washington University in St. Louis indicated an impact of over $300 billion on the world's supply chains that could last up to two years.
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) was reportedly "upset" after a sharp drop in oil prices due to lower demand from China.
On 24 February, global stock markets fell due to a significant increase in the number of COVID-19 cases outside mainland China.
On February 27, due to growing concerns over the coronavirus outbreak, several U.S. stock market indices, including the NASDAQ-100, the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average posted their steepest falls since 2008, with the Dow falling 1191 points, the largest one-day drop since the financial crisis of 2007-08.
All three indices ended the week with losses of more than 10%.
On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH affirmed China's sovereign credit rating but maintained a negative outlook.
Shares fell again on the basis of fears over the coronavirus, the biggest drop occurred on March 16.
Many feel that an economic recession is likely.
Economist Mohamed El-Erian praised the timely emergency measures of the states and central banks.
Central banks are reacting faster than they reacted to the 2008 financial collapse.
Tourism is one of the sectors most affected due to travel bans, the closure of public places including travel attractions and the recommendation by governments not to travel anywhere in the world.
As a result, numerous airlines have canceled flights due to lower demand, including British Airways, China Eastern Airlines and Qantas, while British regional airline Flybe collapsed.
The impact on the cruise line industry reached a level never seen before.
Several railway stations and ferry terminals have also been closed.
The epidemic coincided with Chunyun, an important travel season related to the Chinese New Year holidays.
Various large-crowd events were canceled by national and regional governments, including New Year festivals, while private companies also independently closed their stores and tourist attractions, such as Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Lunar New Year events and tourist attractions have been closed to prevent mass gatherings, including the Forbidden City in Beijing and traditional temple fairs.
In 24 of China's 31 provinces, municipalities and regions, authorities extended the New Year holiday until February 10, and ordered most workplaces not to reopen until then.
These regions account for 80% of the country's GDP and 90% of its exports.
Hong Kong raised its infectious disease response level to the highest and declared an emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled its New Year celebrations.
Visits to retailers in Europe and Latin America declined by 40%.
Retailers in North America and the Middle East experienced a 50 to 60 percent drop.
This also caused a drop of 33 to 43 percent in pedestrian traffic to shopping centers in March compared to February.
Shopping mall operators around the world imposed additional measures, such as increased hygiene, the installation of thermal scanners to monitor the temperature of shoppers, and the cancellation of events.According to an estimate by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, the recession induced by the pandemic could leave between 14 and 22 million more people in extreme poverty in Latin America than would have been left in that situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, around 5 million people in China lost their jobs.
Many of China's nearly 300 million migrant rural workers were stranded in their homes in inland provinces or trapped in Hubei Province.
The coronavirus outbreak could cost 47 million jobs in the United States and the unemployment rate could reach 32%, according to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The lockdown in India has left tens of millions of Indian migrant workers (who receive daily wages) unemployed. According to the Angus Reid Institute survey, 44% of Canadian households experienced some form of unemployment. Around 900,000 workers lost their jobs in Spain since the lockdown began in mid-March 2020.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for temporary unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal credit scheme.
The German short-term work compensation scheme has been adopted by France and Great Britain.
The performing arts and cultural heritage sectors were deeply affected by the pandemic, which impacted the operations of organizations and individuals, both employed and self-employed, around the world.
The cultural and arts sector organisations tried to fulfil their mission (often publicly funded) to provide the community with access to cultural heritage, to keep their staff and the public safe, and to support artists wherever possible.
By March 2020, worldwide and to varying degrees, museums, libraries, performance venues, and other cultural institutions had closed indefinitely, and their exhibitions, events, and performances were cancelled or postponed.
In response, great efforts were made to provide alternative services through digital platforms. Another recent and increasingly fast-paced consequence of the disease is the cancellation of religious services, major sporting events, and other social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film industry also suffered disruptions, with the Vatican announcing the cancellation of Holy Week celebrations in Rome, which take place during the last week of the Christian Lent penitential season.
Many dioceses have recommended that elderly Christians stay at home instead of attending Mass on Sundays; some churches offered religious services via radio, live Internet or television, while others offered car-based prayer spaces.
Following the decision of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rome to close its churches and chapels and with St. Peter's Square empty of Christian pilgrims, other religious bodies also cancelled their services and limited public gatherings in churches, mosques, synagogues, temples and gurdwaras.
Iran's Health Ministry announced the cancellation of Friday prayers in the outbreak-affected areas and then closed the shrines, while Saudi Arabia banned the entry of foreign pilgrims and its residents to the holy places in Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has caused the most significant alteration in the global sports calendar since World War II.
Most major sporting events were cancelled or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2020 UEFA Euro, the 2019-20 NBA season, and the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak disrupted plans for the 2020 Olympic Games, which were originally scheduled to begin in late July; the International Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the event would be "rescheduled to a date later than 2020 but not later than the summer of 2021".[22] Casinos and other gaming venues around the world were closed and online poker tournaments were postponed or cancelled.
This caused many gamblers to turn to the Internet, many online betting sites reported significant increases in their new sign-up rates, the entertainment industry was also affected, several musical groups suspended or cancelled concert tours.
Many large theaters, such as those on Broadway, also suspended all performances.
Some artists have explored ways to continue to produce and share their work via the Internet as an alternative to traditional live performance, such as live broadcasts of concerts or the creation of Internet "festivals" for artists to perform, distribute or publish their work.
Numerous internet memes about the coronavirus have spread online, as many resort to humor and distraction amid uncertainty.
Since the outbreak of COVID-19, there has been an increase in prejudice, xenophobia and racism towards people of Chinese and East Asian descent, and towards people from areas of Europe, the United States and other countries where the situation is critical.
Incidents of fear, suspicion and hostility have been observed in many countries, particularly in Europe, East Asia, North America and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports from February (when most cases were still confined to China) have documented racist sentiments in various groups around the world who expressed that the Chinese deserved the virus or were receiving what they considered to be just retaliation.
Some countries in Africa have also seen an increase in anti-Chinese sentiment.
Many Wuhan and Hubei residents have reported discrimination on the basis of their regional origin.
Chinese and those in the areas affected by the virus have received support, both online and offline.
Following the spread of the outbreak to new countries where the situation is critical, people from Italy, the first country in Europe to experience a severe outbreak of COVID-19, could also be subject to suspicion and xenophobia. Citizens from countries such as Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea initially signed petitions to achieve the ban on the entry of Chinese into their countries in an effort to stop the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #ChineseDontComeToJapan was trending on Twitter.
Chinese, as well as other Asian people in the UK and the US, have reported higher levels of racist slurs, as well as assaults.
US President Donald Trump was criticized for referring to the coronavirus as the "Chinese virus", a term that many critics considered racist and anti-Chinese.
Protesters in Ukraine attacked buses carrying evacuated Ukrainians and foreigners from Wuhan to Novi Sanzhary.
According to reports, students from the northeast of India, which shares a border with China, and who study in major Indian cities, suffered harassment in connection with the coronavirus outbreak.
The state unit chairman of the Bharatiya Janata Party in West Bengal, Dilip Ghosh, said that the Chinese had destroyed nature and "so God took revenge on them".
The Chinese consulate in Calcutta later condemned the comments and said they were "wrongful".[24] In China, xenophobia and racism towards non-Chinese residents increased as a result of the pandemic, and foreigners were described as "foreign garbage" and destined for "waste".
Many newspapers with paywalls removed them for parts or all of their coverage of the coronavirus.
Many scientific publishers published scientific articles related to the outbreak available with open access.
Some scientists chose to share their results quickly on preprint servers like bioRxiv.

Laboratory tests for coronavirus respiratory disease 2019 (COVID-19) and associated SARS-CoV-2 virus include methods that detect the presence of the virus and those that detect antibodies produced in response to infection.
The presence of virus in samples is confirmed through the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test, which detects the coronavirus RNA.
This test is specific and designed to detect only SARS-CoV-2 virus RNA.
It is used to confirm very recent or active infections.
Antibody screening (serology) can be used for both diagnosis and population surveillance.
Antibody tests show how many people have had the disease, including those who had symptoms too mild to report or who were asymptomatic.
From the results of this test, a precise mortality rate from the disease and the level of herd immunity in the population can be determined.
Due to limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the prevalence of the virus in its population.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and there are large variations in the amount of testing done in different countries.
This variability is also likely to be significantly affecting reported case fatality rates, which are likely to be highly overestimated in some countries.
Through real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR), testing can be done on respiratory samples obtained through various methods, including nasopharyngeal swabs or sputum samples.
Results are usually available within a few hours to 2 days.
The reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test performed with pharyngeal swabs is only reliable in the first week of disease.
The virus may then disappear in the throat, but it continues to multiply in the lungs.
In infected individuals tested in the second week, as an alternative, sample material may be obtained from the deep parts of the airways by suction catheter, or material expelled by coughing (sputum) may be used.
One of the first polymerase chain reaction tests was developed at Charité, Berlin, in January 2020, using the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcriptase (rRT-PCR), and formed the basis of the 250,000 kits distributed by the World Health Organization (WHO).
As of 23 January 2020, the United Kingdom had also developed a test. On 28 January 2020, South Korea's Kogenebiotech company developed a SARS-CoV-2 detection kit based on the clinical grade polymerase chain reaction (PowerChek Coronavirus).
It looks for the "E" gene shared by all betacoronaviruses and the SARS-CoV-2 specific RdRp gene. In China, BGI Group was one of the first companies to obtain emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration of China for a polymerase chain reaction-based SARS-CoV-2 detection kit. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is distributing its real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction diagnostic panel for the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) to public health laboratories through the International Reagent Resource.
One in three genetic tests in previous versions of the test kits produced inconclusive results due to faulty reagents, and a testing bottleneck at the CDC in Atlanta; as a result, on average, fewer than 100 samples per day were successfully processed throughout February 2020.
The reliability of tests using two components was not determined until February 28, 2020, and only thereafter were state and local laboratories allowed to begin testing.
The Food and Drug Administration approved the test under an emergency use authorization. Commercial laboratories in the US began testing in early March 2020.
On March 5, 2020, LabCorp announced the nationwide availability of tests for COVID-19 based on the reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction.
Similarly, as of March 9, 2020, Quest Diagnostics made tests for COVID-19 available nationally.
No limits on the quantity were announced; the collection of specimens and processing should be carried out in accordance with the requirements of the CDC.
In Russia, the test for COVID-19 was developed and produced by the State Research Center of Virology and Biotechnology VECTOR.
On 11 February 2020, the test was registered by the Federal Service for Health Care Surveillance.[citation needed] On 12 March 2020, it was reported that Mayo Clinic had developed a test to detect COVID-19 infection.[citation needed] On 13 March 2020, Roche Diagnostics received FDA approval for a test that could be performed within 3.5 hours in large volume, allowing one machine to perform approximately 4128 tests in a 24-hour period.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA issued the emergency use authorization for Abbott Laboratories for a test on Abbott's m2000 system; the FDA had previously issued similar authorizations for Hologic, LabCorp, and Thermo Fisher Scientific.
On March 21, 2020, Cepheid similarly received FDA emergency use authorization for a test that takes approximately 45 minutes.
The FDA has approved a test that uses nucleic acid isothermal amplification technology instead of the polymerase chain reaction.
As this does not require a series of alternating temperature cycles, this method can provide positive results in as little as five minutes and negative results in 13 minutes.
There are currently around 18,000 of these machines in the United States and Abbott plans to increase production to perform 50,000 tests per day.In Taiwan, a test is being developed that uses a monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the nucleocapside protein (N-protein) of the new coronavirus, with the hope that it can provide results within 15 to 20 minutes like a rapid test for influenza.
As of March 2020, the review of publications concluded that "thorax radiographs have little diagnostic value in the early stages, whereas CT [computed tomography] results can be obtained even before the onset of symptoms".
Typical features in CT include bilateral multilobare opacities in de-glassed glass with a peripheral, asymmetrical, and posterior distribution.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain develops, a pattern in embedment and consolidation.
According to a study conducted in Wuhan, the origin of the current pandemic, in which the polymerase chain reaction was compared with computed tomography, computed tomography is much more sensitive than the polymerase chain reaction, although less specific, and many of the features in the images coincide with the processes of other diseases and pneumonias.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends "not to use CT as a screening method or as a first-line test to diagnose COVID-19".[22] As of March 2020, the CDC recommends polymerase chain reaction as the initial test.
Part of the immune system's response to infection is the production of antibodies, including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to detect infection in people from about 7 days after the onset of symptoms, to determine immunity and in population surveillance.
High-performance automated systems in many clinical laboratories will be able to perform these analyses, but their availability will depend on the production rate of each system.
For central laboratory tests, a single peripheral blood sample is generally used, although serial specimens may be used to follow the immune response.
For point-of-care testing, a single blood sample is usually obtained by a skin puncture.
Unlike polymerase chain reaction methods, no extraction step is required before analysis.On March 26, 2020, the FDA named 29 entities that provided notification to the agency as appropriate and thus can now distribute their antibody tests.
As of April 7, 2020, only one test has been approved by the FDA under an emergency use authorization. In late March 2020, Euroimmun Medical Laboratory Diagnostics and Epitope Diagnostics received European approval for their test kits, which can detect IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The testing capacity is several hundred samples within hours and is therefore much faster than the conventional viral RNA polymerase chain reaction test.
Antibodies can usually be detected 14 days after the start of infection. In early April, the UK discovered that none of the antibody test kits it had purchased were good enough to use.
Hong Kong has created a program where suspect patients can stay at home, "emergency department gives patient a tube for specimen", patient spits in tube, sends it and gets a result in no time. British NHS announced it is implementing a pilot program to test suspect cases at home, which eliminates the risk of the patient infecting others if he goes to hospital or the need to disinfect an ambulance if he uses one. In drive-through testing for COVID-19 from suspected cases, a health professional takes the samples taking the proper precautions.
Drive-through centres have helped South Korea to do some of the fastest and most extensive testing of any country.[citation needed] In Germany, the National Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians said on 2 March that it had a capacity for approximately 12,000 tests per day in the outpatient setting and that 10,700 people had been tested the week before.
The health insurance covers the costs when the test is ordered by a doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has an overall capacity to do 160,000 tests per week.
By March 19, tests were offered through the drive-through system in several large cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany was unknown, because only positive results were reported.
A first survey of laboratories revealed that, as of the natural week of 12/2020, at least 483 295 samples had been analyzed in total, up to and including the week of 12/2020, and 33 491 samples (6.9%) returned positive results for SARS-CoV-2. In Israel, researchers from the Technion Institute and Rambam Hospital developed and tested a method to analyze samples from 64 patients simultaneously, which consists of grouping the samples together and only doing further analysis if the combined sample turns out positive.
With construction, which was overseen by BGI founder Wang Jian, and took 5 days, the model showed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the corresponding cost to cope with the quarantine would have doubled without this testing capability.
After the Wuhan lab, Huo-Yan labs were immediately built in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in a total of 12 cities in China.
As of 4 March 2020, the total daily production was 50,000 tests per day. Open source multiplexed designs provided by origami analysis were implemented that allow up to 1122 patient samples to be evaluated for COVID19 using only 93 analyses. These balanced designs can be used in small labs without the need to use liquid handling robots.
By March, shortages and insufficient amounts of reagents affected mass testing in the European Union and the US.
This led some authors to explore sample preparation protocols that involve heating samples to 98 °C (208 °F) for 5 minutes to release RNA genomes for further testing. On 31 March, it was announced that the United Arab Emirates was now doing more coronavirus detection testing per person in its population than any other country, and was on track to increase the level of testing to cover the majority of the population.
This was achieved by combining the drive-through capacity and the purchase of a population-level mass production laboratory from Group 42 and BGI (which was based on their "Huo-Yan" emergency detection laboratories in China).
Built in 14 days, the lab has the capacity to perform tens of thousands of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction tests per day and is the first in the world of this magnitude operating outside China.
Different test formulas addressing different parts of the coronavirus genetic profile were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan and the United States.
The World Health Organization adopted the German formula to manufacture kits that it sent to low-income countries that did not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German formula was published on 17 January 2020; the protocol developed by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was not available until 28 January, which delayed available tests in the United States. China and the United States had problems with the reliability of test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, and these countries and Australia were unable to supply enough kits to meet demand and health experts' recommendations on testing.
In contrast, experts say that South Korea's large availability of tests helped to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.
The South Korean government built its testing capability, mainly in private sector laboratories, over the course of several years.
On March 16, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programs as the best way to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. High demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus caused delays of hundreds of thousands of tests in private US laboratories, and supplies of swabs and chemical reagents were exhausted.
In March 2020, China reported problems with the accuracy of its test kits.
In the United States, the test kits developed by the CDC had "defects"; the government later removed the bureaucratic barriers that had prevented private testing being conducted. Spain bought test kits from the Chinese company Shenzhen Bioeasy Biotechnology Co Ltd, but obtained inaccurate results.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be due to incorrect collection of the samples or incorrect use of the kits.
The Ministry of Spain said it would withdraw the kits that gave incorrect results and replace them with a different test kit provided by Shenzhen Bioeasy.[104] 80% of the test kits the Czech Republic bought from China gave incorrect results.[105] Slovakia bought 1.2 million kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.[106] Slovakia bought 1.2 million test kits from China that turned out to be inaccurate.[107]
Prime Minister Matovič suggested that they be thrown into the Danube. Ateş Kara, of the Turkish Health Ministry, said that the test kits Turkey bought from China had a "high error rate" and did not "put them into use". The UK bought 3.5 million test kits from China, but, in early April 2020, announced that they were not needed.
The conduct of testing, supplemented by quarantine of those who tested positive and identification of people with whom they had had contact who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, resulted in satisfactory results.
Researchers working in the Italian city of Vò, the site of the first COVID-19 death in Italy, conducted two rounds of testing across the population of about 3400, about ten days apart.
Approximately half of those who tested positive had no symptoms, and all detected cases were quarantined.
With the restriction of travel in the municipality, this eliminated new infections completely.
With intensive contact tracing, travel restrictions from abroad, testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore progressed much more slowly than in other developed countries, but which did not implement extreme restrictions, such as the forced closure of restaurants and retail establishments.
Many events were cancelled, and on 28 March Singapore began recommending that residents stay in their homes, but schools reopened on time after the 23 March holiday.
Other countries have also controlled the pandemic with intensive contact tracing, restrictions on travel from overseas, testing and quarantines, but with less stringent lockdowns, such as Iceland and South Korea.
According to a statistical study, countries that have done more testing, relative to the number of deaths, have much lower case fatality rates, probably because these countries have more ability to detect people who have only mild symptoms or who have no symptoms.
WHO recommends that countries that do not have the capacity for testing and that have national laboratories with limited experience in COVID-19 send their first five positive samples and their first ten negative samples for COVID-19 to any of the 16 WHO reference laboratories for confirmatory testing.
Of the 16 reference laboratories, 7 are in Asia, 5 in Europe, 2 in Africa, 1 in North America and 1 in Australia.
In the table below, the column Positive as % of testing is influenced by the country's testing policy.
A country that tests only people who are admitted to hospitals will have a higher positive as a % of tests than a country that tests all citizens, whether they show symptoms or not, all other things being equal.
Hand washing, also known as hand hygiene, is the action of washing hands with the purpose of removing dirt, grease, microorganisms, or other unwanted substances.
Constant hand washing with soap at certain "critical times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, for example, diarrhea and cholera, which are transmitted by the fecal-oral route.
People can also become infected with respiratory diseases, such as influenza or the common cold, for example if they do not wash their hands before touching their eyes, nose or mouth (i.e. mucous membranes).
The five critical times during the day when it is important to wash hands with soap include: before and after defecation, after wiping a child's tail or changing diapers, before feeding a child, before eating, and before and after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
If soap and water are not available, hands can be wiped with ash.
Before, during and after preparing meals.
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing diapers or cleaning up a kid who's used the bathroom.
After blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.
After touching animals, animal feed or animal waste.
Medical hand hygiene refers to hygienic practices related to medical procedures.
Handwashing before administering medicines or medical care can prevent or minimize the spread of disease.
The main medical purpose of hand washing is to remove pathogens (bacteria, viruses, or other microorganisms that can cause disease) and chemicals that can cause damage or disease from the hands.
This is especially important for people who handle food or work in the medical field, but it is also an important practice for the general public.
Handwashing has many health benefits, including minimizing the spread of influenza, coronavirus and other infectious diseases; preventing infectious causes of diarrhea; reducing respiratory infections;
and reduce the infant mortality rate in home births.
A 2013 study showed that improvements in handwashing practices can lead to small improvements in height growth in children under the age of five.
In developing countries, rates of child mortality related to respiratory and diarrheal diseases can be reduced by introducing simple behavioral changes, such as handwashing with soap.
This simple action can reduce the mortality rate from these diseases by almost 50%.
Interventions that encourage hand washing can reduce diarrhea episodes by about a third, and this is similar to providing potable water in low-income areas.
48% of the reductions in diarrhea episodes can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is the most effective and economical way to prevent diarrhea and acute respiratory infections, as an automatic behavior adopted in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Pneumonia, a major acute respiratory disease, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, claiming an estimated 1.8 million lives per year.
Diarrhea and pneumonia together account for nearly 3.5 million child deaths per year.
According to UNICEF, making hand washing with soap before eating and after using the toilet a routine can save more lives than any vaccine or medical intervention, which would reduce deaths from diarrhea by almost half and deaths from acute respiratory infections by a quarter.
Hand washing is usually integrated with other hygiene interventions as part of water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) programmes.
Handwashing also protects against impetigo, which is transmitted through direct physical contact.
A small detrimental effect of hand washing is that frequent hand washing can cause skin damage due to skin dryness.
According to a 2012 Danish study, excessive hand washing can lead to a skin condition that causes itching and makes the skin become scaly known as hand eczema or hand dermatitis, which is especially common in healthcare workers.
Too frequent hand washing is also considered one of the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five critical times during the day when hand washing with soap is important to reduce oral-fecal transmission of disease: after using the bathroom (urinating, defecating), after cleaning a child's tail (changing diapers), before feeding a child, before eating, and before/after preparing a meal or handling raw meat, fish, or poultry.
Other times when a proper handwashing technique should be practiced to prevent the transmission of disease include before and after treating a cut or wound; after sneezing, coughing, or blowing your nose; after touching animal waste or handling animals; and after touching garbage.
In many countries, there is a low rate of handwashing with soap.
A study on handwashing in 54 countries conducted in 2015 concluded that, on average, 38.7% of families practiced handwashing with soap.[1] A 2014 study indicated that Saudi Arabia had the highest rate at 97%, the United States was near the halfway mark at 77%, and China had the lowest rate at 23%.[2] Currently, several methodologies exist for behavior change, to increase the adoption of the habit of handwashing with soap at critical times.[3] Group handwashing of children in school at certain times of the day is an option in developing countries to incorporate handwashing into children's behavior.[4]
The "Essential Health Care Program" implemented by the Philippine Department of Education is an example of a tailor-made action to promote children's health and education.
Deworming twice a year, washing hands with soap every day, brushing your teeth daily with fluoride, are the basis of this national program.
It has also been successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Removal of microorganisms from the skin is improved by adding soaps or detergents to the water.
The main action of soaps and detergents is to reduce the barriers to solution and increase solubility.
Water alone is ineffective in cleansing the skin because fats and proteins, which are components of organic matter, are not easily dissolved in water.
However, a reasonable flow of water facilitates cleaning.
Solid soap, due to its reusable nature, may contain bacteria acquired in previous uses.
Some studies that looked at the transfer of bacteria from contaminated solid soap concluded that transfer is unlikely, as the bacteria are rinsed with the foam.
Still, the CDC states that "liquid soap with dispensing controls that do not involve the use of the hands is preferable".
Antibacterial soaps have been heavily promoted to a health-conscious public.
Currently, there is no evidence to show that using recommended disinfectants or antiseptics preserves naturally antibiotic-resistant organisms.
However, antibacterial soaps contain common antibacterial agents, such as triclosan, which has an extensive list of resistant strains of organisms.
Thus, even if antibacterial soaps do not preserve antibiotic-resistant strains, they may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to the surfactant and skin protecting agent, sophisticated formulas may contain acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as well as pH regulator, benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity, and more skin conditioners (aloe vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts).[citation needed] A comprehensive analysis by the University of Oregon School of Public Health indicated that common soaps are as effective as consumer antibacterial soaps containing triclosan in preventing disease and removing bacteria from the hands.
The nice warm water to wash your hands is not enough to kill the bacteria.
Bacteria grow much faster at body temperature (37 °C).
However, warm soapy water is more effective than cold soapy water at removing the natural oils that hold back soil and bacteria.
However, contrary to popular belief, scientific studies have shown that using warm water has no effect on reducing the microbial load on the hands.
A hand sanitizer or hand antiseptic is a waterless agent for hand hygiene.
In the late 1990s and early part of the 21st century, waterless and rubbing alcohol hand hygiene agents (also known as rubbing alcohol hand solution, rubbing antiseptic hand solution, or hand sanitizers) began to gain popularity.
Most are based on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol formulated with a thickening agent such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) in a gel, or a moisturizer such as glycerin in a liquid, or foam for easy use and to reduce the drying effect of alcohol.
Adding diluted hydrogen peroxide further increases the antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizers containing between 60 and 95 percent alcohol at least effectively kill germs.
Alcohol-based rubbing disinfectants kill bacteria, drug-resistant bacteria (SARMs and ERVs), tuberculosis and some viruses (including HIV, herpes, RSV, rhinovirus, vaccinia, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based rub disinfectants containing 70% alcohol eliminate 99.97% (reduction of 3.5 logarithms, similar to 35 decibel reduction) of bacteria on hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (reduction of 4 to 5 logarithms) of bacteria on hands 1 minute after application. Hand sanitizers are more effective against bacteria and less effective against some viruses.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are largely ineffective against norovirus (or Norwalk) viruses, the most common cause of infectious gastroenteritis. Sufficient antiseptic or rubbing alcohol-based hand solution should be used to moisten or completely cover both hands.
The palm and back of both hands, between the fingers and the ends of all fingers are rubbed for approximately 30 seconds until the liquid, foam or gel has dried.
The fingertips should also be washed thoroughly by rubbing them into both palms.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing before hand sanitizers are rubbed, especially when the hands are visibly dirty.
The increased use of these agents is based on their ease of use and quick micro-organism removal activity; however, they should not be used as a substitute for proper hand washing unless soap and water are not available.
Frequent use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can dry the skin unless emollients or skin moisturizers are added to the formula.
The drying effect of alcohol can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin or other emollients to the formula.
In clinical trials, alcohol-based hand sanitizers containing emollients caused significantly less skin irritation and dryness than soaps or antimicrobial detergents.
Allergic contact dermatitis, contact urticaria syndrome or hypersensitivity to alcohol or additives in alcohol-based hand rubs are very rare.
The lower tendency to cause irritant contact dermatitis was found to be attractive compared to hand washing with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless agents do not remove organic matter from the hands, but simply disinfect them.
For this reason, hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water in preventing the spread of many pathogens, as pathogens still remain on the hands.
The effectiveness of non-alcoholic hand sanitizers is highly dependent on the ingredients and the formula, and has historically been much lower than that of alcohol and alcohol-based rub solutions.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been found to have persistent and cumulative antimicrobial activity after application, unlike alcohol, whose efficacy decreases after repeated use, probably due to progressive adverse skin reactions.
Many people in low-income communities cannot afford to buy soap and instead use ash or earth.
Ashes or earth may be more effective than water alone, but less effective than soap.
One concern is that if soil or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, this may increase the spread of disease rather than decrease it.
Like soap, ash is also a disinfectant, since it forms an alkaline solution when it comes in contact with water.
The WHO recommended using ash or sand as an alternative to soap when soap is unavailable.
The correct hand washing technique recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent the transmission of disease includes the following steps:
Moisten your hands with warm or cold running water.
Plain water is recommended because containers with stagnant water may be contaminated, whereas the water temperature does not seem to make any difference.
Rubbing hands to foam with a generous amount of soap, including the backs of the hands, between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes germs from the skin, and studies indicate that people typically wash their hands more thoroughly when using soap than when using water alone.
Stir for at least 20 seconds.
Scrubbing creates friction, which helps to remove germs from the skin, and scrubbing for longer periods of time removes more germs.
Rinse well with running water.
Rinsing in a container can re-contaminate your hands.
Dry with a clean towel or air-dry.
Wet and damp hands are more likely to become polluted again, and the parts most often forgotten are the thumb, wrist, the areas between the fingers, and under the nails.
Artificial nails and peeled nail polish can harbor microorganisms.
Moisturizing lotion is often recommended to prevent hands from drying out; dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase the risk of infection transmission.
Several cost-effective options can be used to facilitate handwashing when running water or soap is not available, for example, pouring water from a hanging bucket or a pumpkin with appropriate holes or using ash if necessary in developing countries. In situations where there is a limited water supply (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), there are water-saving solutions such as "home taps" and other cost-effective options.
A homemade faucet is a simple technology that uses a jar suspended from a rope and a foot-operated lever to pour a small amount of water over the hands and a bar of soap.
Effective hand drying is an essential part of the hand hygiene process, but there is some debate about the most effective form of drying in public bathrooms.
More and more research indicates that paper towels are much more hygienic than the electric hand dryers found in many bathrooms.
In 2008, the University of Westminster, London, conducted a study, sponsored by the paper towel industry association European Tissue Symposium, to compare the hygiene levels offered by the latest paper towels, hot air hand dryers and air jet hand dryers.
After washing and drying hands with the hot air dryer, the total amount of bacteria was found to be increased, on average, by 194% in the fingertips and 254% in the palms.
Drying with the air-blast dryer resulted in an average increase of 42% in the total amount of bacteria in the fingertips and 15% in the palms.
After washing and drying hands with a paper towel, the total amount of bacteria decreased, on average, by 76% on the fingertips and 77% on the palms.The scientists also performed tests to determine whether there was a possibility of cross-contamination of other bathroom users and the bathroom environment as a result of each type of drying method.
The air jet dryer, which blows air from the unit at speeds claimed to be 180 m/s (650 km/h; 400 mph), succeeded in blowing the microorganisms out of the hands and the unit and potentially contaminating other bathroom users and the bathroom environment up to a distance of 2 meters.
The use of a hot air hand dryer spread the microorganisms up to 0.25 meters away from the dryer.
Paper towels did not show significant spread of microorganisms. In 2005, in a study by TÜV Produkt und Umwelt, different hand drying methods were evaluated.
The following changes in bacterial counts were observed after hand drying:
There are many different manufacturers of hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to paper towel dryers.
Hand washing with hand sanitizer wipes is an alternative during travel, when you do not have water or soap.
Alcoholic hand sanitizer should contain at least 60% alcohol.
Hand washing of doctors became mandatory long after Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) for the prevention of disease in a hospital setting.
There are electronic devices that provide feedback to remind hospital staff members to wash their hands when they forget.
One study found a decrease in infection rates with its use.
Medical hand washing is done for at least 15 seconds, with plenty of water and soap or gel to foam and rub all parts of the hands.
Hands should be rubbed together by interlacing the fingers.
If there is debris under the nails, a brush can be used to remove it.
Since germs can remain in water on hands, it is important to rinse them well and dry them with a clean towel.
After drying, the paper towel should be used to close the water (and open any exit doors if necessary).
This prevents the hands from getting contaminated again by these surfaces.
The purpose of hand washing in the health care setting is to eliminate pathogenic microorganisms ("germs") and prevent their transmission.
According to the New England Journal of Medicine, the lack of handwashing continues to exist at unacceptable levels in most medical settings, where many doctors and nurses routinely forget to wash their hands before touching patients and thus transmitting microorganisms.
One study showed that proper hand washing and other simple procedures can decrease the rate of catheter-related bloodstream infections by 66%.The World Health Organization has published a spreadsheet demonstrating standard hand washing and hand rubbing in health care settings.
The preliminary version of the organisation's hand hygiene guide is also available on its website for public comment.
A relevant review was carried out by Whitby and others.
Commercial devices can measure and verify hand hygiene, if demonstration of compliance is required.
The World Health Organization has a "Five moments" for hand washing:
after exposure to blood or body fluids
before an aseptic work and
The addition of antiseptic chemicals to soap ("medicinal" or "antibacterial" soaps) gives the handwashing agent the possibility of elimination.
This may be necessary before surgery or in environments where antibiotic-resistant organisms are common. To wash hands before surgery, a faucet that can be opened and closed without touching hands, some chlorhexidine or iodine for washing, sterilized towels to dry hands after washing, a sterilized brush to scrub, and another sterilized tool to clean under the nails are necessary.
All jewelry must be removed.
This procedure requires washing hands and forearms up to the elbow, generally for 2 to 6 minutes.
Do not wash for a long time (10 minutes).
When rinsing, the water from the forearms should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing, the hands are dried with a sterilized cloth and a surgical gown is put on.
To reduce the spread of germs, it is best to wash your hands or use hand sanitizer before and after caring for sick people.
For the control of staph infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit from hand washing is in the first 20% of washing and that very little additional benefit is obtained when hand hygiene frequency increases by more than 35%.
Washing with plain soap results in more than triple the incidence of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. Comparing handwashing with an alcohol-based solution with handwashing with an antibacterial soap for an average time of 30 seconds in each case, it was observed that rubbing with alcohol reduced 26 percent more bacterial contamination than antibacterial soap.
However, water and soap are more effective in reducing influenza A H1N1 virus and Clostridium difficile spores from the hands than alcohol-based hand sanitizers. Interventions to improve hand hygiene in health care settings may include training staff on hand washing, increasing availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and written and oral reminders to staff.
More research is needed to determine which of these interventions are most effective in different health care settings.
In developing countries, handwashing with soap is considered an economical and fundamental tool for good health and even good nutrition.
However, the lack of a reliable supply of water, soap or handwashing facilities in homes, schools and workplaces makes it a challenge to achieve universal handwashing behaviors.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, there are very few handwashing taps near public or private toilets, although there are affordable options for building handwashing stations.
However, low hand washing rates may also be the result of ingrained habits and not a lack of soap or water.
Promotion of handwashing with soap can influence political decisions, increase awareness of the benefits of handwashing and lead to long-term behavioural change in the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are necessary.
In a systematic review of 70 studies, it was found that community approaches are effective in increasing handwashing in PRBMs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective.An example of promoting handwashing in schools is the UNICEF "Three Star" approach, which encourages schools to take simple and cost-effective measures to ensure that students wash their hands with soap, among other hygiene requirements.
When the minimum standards are met, schools can move from one to, eventually, three stars.
The construction of handwashing stations can be part of handwashing promotion campaigns that are carried out to reduce childhood illness and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of an awareness campaign that seeks to achieve a change in behavior.
Few studies have considered the overall cost-effectiveness of hand washing in developing countries in relation to avoided AVADs.
However, an analysis indicates that promoting handwashing with soap is considerably more effective than other water and sanitation interventions.
The importance of handwashing for human health, particularly for people in vulnerable circumstances, such as mothers who have just given birth or soldiers in hospitals, was first recognized in the mid-20th century by two pioneers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis, who worked in Vienna, Austria, and Englishwoman Florence Nightingale, the "founder of modern nursing".
At that time, most people still believed that infections were caused by unpleasant odors called miasmas.
In the 1980s, outbreaks of foodborne illness and health care-related infections led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to promote hand hygiene more actively as an important way to prevent the spread of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 led to increased awareness in many countries of the importance of hand washing with soap to protect against these infectious diseases.
For example, in Germany, signs with "correct hand washing techniques" were hung near washbasins in public restrooms and in bathrooms in office buildings and airports.
The phrase "washing hands" is a declaration of not wanting to take charge of something or share in the complicity of something.
It has its origin in the biblical passage from Matthew in which Pontius Pilate washed his hands before deciding to crucify Jesus Christ, but it has become a much more widely used phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth begins to compulsively wash her hands in an attempt to clean an imaginary stain, which represents her guilty conscience over the crimes she had committed and which she had induced her husband to commit.
It has also been found that after remembering or reflecting on unethical actions, people tend to wash their hands more often than others and tend to value handwashing items more.
Furthermore, those people who are allowed to wash their hands after such a reflection are less likely to engage in other compensatory "cleaning" actions, such as volunteering.
Religions recommend hand washing for hygienic and symbolic purposes. Symbolic hand washing, with water but without soap, is part of ritual hand washing in many religions, such as Baha'i, Hindu, Tevila and Netilat yadayim in Judaism, the lavatory in Christianity, and wudu in Islam. Religions also recommend hygienic hand washing, particularly after certain actions.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam require hand washing after using the toilet.
And Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism and Islam require hand washing before and after each meal.
Risk controls at the workplace in the wake of COVID-19
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19 refer to the application of occupational safety and health methodologies in risk controls for the prevention of the disease from coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19).
Appropriate workplace risk controls depend on the workplace and the work task and are based on a risk assessment of the sources of exposure, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors for workers who may be prone to COVID-19.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the lowest exposure jobs have minimal workplace contact with the public and co-workers, for which basic infection prevention measures are advised, including hand washing, advising workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene rules, and maintaining a routine cleaning and disinfection of the work environment.
Medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact with people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19 but who could be infected from current community transmission or international travel.
This includes workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, work environments with high concentration of people and some large retail environments.
Risk controls for this group, in addition to basic infection prevention measures, include ventilation with high-efficiency air filters, protective coverings and personal protective equipment available in the event of a person with COVID-19.
OSHA considers health care and funeral services workers exposed to people known or suspected to have COVID-19 to be at high risk of exposure, which increases to very high risk if they perform procedures that may generate aerosols in people known or suspected to have COVID-19 or take or manipulate samples from these people.
Appropriate risk controls for these workers include engineering controls, such as negative pressure ventilation rooms, and personal protective equipment appropriate to the work activity.
COVID-19 outbreaks can have various consequences in the workplace.
Workers may miss work because of illness, caring for others, or fear of possible exposure.
Trade patterns may change, both in terms of what goods are in demand and the means of acquiring those goods (such as buying at off-peak hours, through home delivery services or through the car window).
Finally, shipments of items from geographically severely affected areas may be disrupted by COVID-19.
The plans address risk levels related to various workplaces and work activities, including sources of exposure, risk factors arising from domestic and community environments, and individual worker risk factors such as old age or chronic medical conditions.
They also describe the controls needed to address those risks and the contingency plans for situations that may arise as a result of the outbreaks.
Infectious disease preparedness and response plans may be subject to national or regional recommendations.
The objectives of outbreak response include reducing transmission between staff members, protecting people who are at greatest risk of adverse health complications, maintaining business operations, and minimizing adverse effects on other entities in their supply chains.
The severity of the disease in the community in which the company is located affects the measures taken.
The hierarchy of risk controls is a framework widely used in occupational health and safety to classify risk controls according to their effectiveness.
If COVID-19 risks cannot be eliminated, the most effective controls are engineering controls, followed by administrative controls and, finally, personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve insulating employees from work-related hazards without resorting to worker behavior and may be the most cost-effective solution to implement.
Administrative controls are changes in workplace policies or procedures that require action by the worker or employer.
Personal protective equipment is considered less effective than engineering and administrative controls, but can help prevent some exposures.
All types of personal protective equipment should be selected for the hazard to the worker, properly fitted (e.g. respirators), used properly and systematically, checked frequently, maintained, replaced if necessary and disposed of, cleaned and stored or disposed of correctly so as not to contaminate.
According to the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), jobs with the lowest risk of exposure have minimal occupational contact with the public and co-workers.
Basic infection prevention measures recommended for all workplaces include deep and frequent hand washing, advising workers to stay home if they are sick, respiratory hygiene rules including covering cough and sneeze, provision of tissue and waste containers, preparation for teleworking or staggered shifts if necessary, discouraging workers from using tools and equipment and maintaining a routine cleaning and disinfecting of the work environment.
The immediate identification and isolation of persons who may be infected is a fundamental measure to protect workers, customers, visitors and others in the workplace.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that employees who have symptoms of acute respiratory illness stay home until they have no fever, signs of fever, or other symptoms for at least 24 hours without taking medication to relieve symptoms or lower fever; that sick leave policies be flexible and allow employees to stay home to care for a sick family member; and that employees be aware of these policies.
According to OSHA, medium exposure risk jobs include those that require frequent or close contact to within six feet (1.8 m) of people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but who may have become infected with SARS-CoV-2 due to community transmission from the time around the company's location, or because the person recently made an international trip to a place with widespread COVID-19 transmission.
These include workers who are in contact with the general public, such as in schools, highly concentrated work environments and some large retail environments. Engineering controls for this group and higher risk groups include installing high-efficiency air filters, increasing ventilation rates, installing physical barriers such as protective clear plastic covers and placing a window for service attention so the customer can order from the car. Administrative controls for this group and higher risk groups include recommending that sick workers stay at home, replacing meetings with virtual presence communications, establishing staggered shifts, suspending non-essential travel to locations with COVID-19 screens, developing emergency communication plans for staff that require an updated handwashing and hand hygiene, and providing workers with a combination of COVID-19 prevention and risk management tools, including training on how to use a workplace safety suit, and providing workers with access to a number of other risk factors, such as the ability to use a workplace safety harness kit, and to use a workplace safety equipment that is capable of preventing, protecting, and preventing COVID-19 from occurring, or promoting workers's exposure to, or other risk factors.
Workers in this risk group should rarely wear respirators.
If a person becomes ill on an airplane, appropriate controls to protect workers and other passengers include separating the sick person from others at a distance of 6 feet, assigning a crew member to attend to the sick person and offering a mask to the sick person, or asking the sick person to cover his or her mouth and nose with paper towels when coughing or sneezing.
Cabin crew should wear disposable surgical gloves to attend to a sick passenger or to touch potentially contaminated bodily fluids or surfaces and perhaps personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a fever, persistent cough, or difficulty breathing.
Gloves and other disposable items should be disposed of in a hazardous biological waste bag and contaminated surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected afterwards. For commercial shipping, such as cruise ships and other passenger-carrying vessels, risk controls include delaying travel for illness, self-isolation, and prompt reporting to the on-board medical center if anyone develops fever or other symptoms while on board.
Ideally, medical screening should be done in the quarantine station of the isolated person.In the case of schools and child care centers, the CDC recommends short-term closure to clean or disinfect if an infected person was in the school building, regardless of community transmission.
When community transmission is minimal or moderate, social distancing strategies can be implemented, such as cancelling outings, assemblies, and other mass gatherings, such as physical education or choir classes or dining room meals, increasing space between desks, staggering entry and exit times, limiting non-essential visits, and using a separate place for the health room for children with flu symptoms.
When there is significant transmission in the local community, in addition to social distancing strategies, extending the school cancellation may be considered. For law enforcement personnel conducting routine daily activities, the CDC considers the immediate health risk to be low.
Police officers who are expected to come into contact with people with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 are advised to follow the same guidelines as emergency medical technicians, including the use of personal protective equipment.
If close contact occurs during an arrest, workers should clean and disinfect their work belt and equipment with a household cleaning spray or wipes before re-use and follow the standard operating procedure for the containment and disposal of personal protective equipment and the containment and washing of clothing.
OSHA considers certain health and morgue workers to be in high or very high exposure risk categories.
Among the high-risk exposures are those of delivery, support, laboratory and medical transport workers who are exposed to patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnoses.
These become very high exposure risk jobs if workers perform aerosol generating procedures on patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnoses or if they take or manipulate samples from these patients.
Some procedures for generating aerosols are intubation, cough induction procedures, bronchoscopy, some dental procedures and examinations, or invasive sampling.
Morgue jobs at high risk of exposure include those where workers are involved in preparing the corpses of people who had COVID-19 or were suspected of having it at the time of death; these become at very high risk of exposure if they perform autopsies. Additional engineering controls for those risk groups include isolation rooms for patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 diagnosis, even when they are given aerosol generation procedures.
Negative pressure specialized ventilation may be appropriate in some health care and morgue settings.
Samples should be handled with Biosafety Level 3 precautions.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that incoming patients be separated into separate waiting rooms depending on whether or not they may have suspected COVID-19. In addition to other types of personal protective equipment, OSHA recommends the use of masks for those working up to 6 feet from patients who have been infected or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 and for those performing aerosol generation procedures.
In the United States, NIOSH-approved N95 respirators with filter masks or above must be used in the context of a written comprehensive respiratory program that includes fit-testing, training and medical examination.
Other types of masks can provide greater protection and improve worker comfort. WHO does not recommend the use of protective monkeys, as COVID-19 is a respiratory disease, not one that is transmitted through body fluids.
WHO only recommends the use of a surgical mask for staff classifying patients entering the hospital.
For those taking respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients, providing care or transporting them without performing aerosol-generating procedures, WHO recommends the use of surgical mask, goggles or face shield, gown and gloves.
If an aerosol-generating procedure is performed, the surgical mask should be replaced by an N95 or FFP2 respirator.
Due to insufficient supply of personal protective equipment, WHO recommends minimizing the need to use them, replacing them with telemedicine, physical barriers such as transparent windows, limiting the permission to enter the room of a COVID-19 patient to only those involved in their direct care, using the same mask without removing it while providing care to several patients with the same diagnosis, monitoring and coordinating the supply chain of personal protective equipment and discouraging the use of masks by asymptomatic persons.

This month, we find ourselves in singular circumstances.
The COVID-19 epidemic highlights our global human interconnectedness and the responsibilities we have for one another.
The challenges it presents are unprecedented, but we know that our best response lies in the empathy, cooperation and global community building that forms the core of this organization.
The camaraderie and concern we've seen among all of our colleagues in emails, calls and conversations is a great validation of how amazing the people we are fortunate enough to work with are.
I couldn't be more grateful and proud to have all of you as my partners.
Last week, someone shared with me the appreciation he felt for our work.
They reminded me how important it is for the world to be able to go to Wikipedia right now and the powerful symbol that is the fact that this critical resource remains online and available to everyone.
Their work makes this possible, whether it's keeping our sites up and running, helping our colleagues get paid or keeping our communities safe.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, today more than ever.
This is a moment where not only what we do but how we do it will have a profound effect on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, starting this coming week, we're going to make some important adjustments to the way we work together.
Adjustments to our work and our schedules
As Robyn mentioned earlier, C-Team met last night to discuss our focus and our timetable for the coming days and months.
In that conversation, we considered what we thought would be the appropriate response to what we're facing and what would be the best way to maintain the sustainability of the organization at this time.
More broadly, we wanted to remove the stress and support our long-term mission.
If you need to slow down, that's fine.
For all staff, contractors and contract workers:
Our daily work expectations will be about 4 hours a day or 20 hours a week, until further notice.
We're not declaring a holiday; if you can work a more normal schedule, this would be very useful for the mission.
However, the world is an unpredictable place today, and whether you have to care for your loved ones, do some shopping, or go to the doctor, our priority is your well-being.
We're not keeping track of your hours.
If you're sick, don't work.
Although it shouldn't be necessary to say it, we do.
There is no need to request sick leave or paid time off; just inform your manager and help your team to review schedules and timetables to ensure that key areas of the work are covered.
(If you receive a positive COVID-19 diagnosis, please notify Bryan, T&C Operations, so T&C can help with support and make sure management is aware of your situation.)
People who work by the hour will get paid in full.
As we have said, we renew our commitment to our contractors and fellow staff who work by the hour.
Everyone will be paid based on their normal hours worked under normal circumstances.
This also applies if you are ill and unable to work.
If you want to work, you have our support.
Many people use work as a way to channel their stress into the world around them.
What we do can be incredibly rewarding, especially in these times.
Again, it's about your personal care.
What we're asking is that you contact your manager so that we know what to expect and can adapt properly.
Certain jobs are considered essential.
There are some things we should keep doing.
The Site Reliability Engineering, Human Resource Operations, Trust and Safety, and Fundraising teams, among others, perform critical work that may require additional support.
We will begin a process with all departments to assess current objectives and modify our approach in order to support what is essential to our mission.
There are enough tasks for all of us; the only difference is that we will all concentrate on the most essential projects.
Slowing down today won't hurt us tomorrow.
We don't plan to "double down on catching up" when the pandemic is over.
I will not be expected to work overtime to meet deadlines that are no longer realistic.
We accept that circumstances have changed and will work to set new targets and timelines when appropriate.
What about the APP, or Annual Planning?
To adjust to our new reality and expectations of daily working hours, we plan to adjust the schedule for the delivery of our 2020-2021 Annual Planning.
Our intention is to propose an extension to our 2019-2020 plan that allocates more time to the budget so that employees can prioritize critical work, personal care and care of loved ones while we adapt to the needs of those who need or want to work a reduced schedule over the next few weeks.
This extension of our schedule greatly reduces the current planning burdens and pressure throughout the organization.
We will present our proposal to the Council next week and will inform the delegates and the teams of the next steps as soon as we have confirmation.
Thank you to the APP team for their leadership in this situation.
Office condition, exposure and cleaning
Last week we learned that one of our colleagues in the San Francisco office may have been exposed to the COVID-19 virus.
However, as a precautionary measure, we hired a virus-cleaning crew to disinfect all surfaces in the San Francisco office.
They used a hospital-grade antiviral solution to disinfect all surfaces, plus the lobby and the elevators that go to our floor.
The building has adopted its own duty of care protocol, using products that support the safety of its occupants.
We feel confident that the office will be well prepared for when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in a WeWork, which has shared its COVID-19 protocol with us and all staff members in the DC offices.
As of last week, our DC office moved its operations to a completely remote environment in accordance with the guidelines shared with San Francisco.
As some of our colleagues in New York City know, we've also been talking about renting a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are still ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our colleagues are working remotely for the first time.
Our colleagues who have worked remotely before know that this modality requires adaptation, so they offer the following suggestions:
Limit the duration of meetings to one or two hours at the most.
If longer sessions are required, consider how to segment them over the course of several days.
Define the meeting clearly with a list of topics and send reading materials in advance.
Adopt video usage by default, using tools like Google Docs and Zoom to facilitate collaboration and live connection.
Designate a leader to moderate each meeting, a person to control the questions in the chat and the list of speakers, and someone to help take notes (or take notes collaboratively).
Send an email to tech support if you need a comfortable headset.
Use the welfare rebate for snacks.
Join the #remoties channel on Slack to talk to your colleagues about distributed work
The HR Operations team is looking at guidelines on web-based ergonomics to support increased distributed work across the Foundation.
This past week we asked all community grant recipients to cancel public events funded by Wikimedia, such as editatons, until the WHO declares the end of the pandemic.
We informed them that we understood that our request for cancellations and other restrictions could make it impossible to fulfil their part of the agreed activities for the grant and that there would be no penalty for having to delay or modify those objectives.
We'll be following up with additional guidelines at Wikimania and other community and regional themed conferences next week.
The overall feeling of the global community seems to be partly sadness at the disruption and partly relief at the clarity and ability to focus on their own communities, both Wikimedia and others.
Going forward, CRT will be working to establish a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a space for the community to monitor the impact and follow our communications with them.
Maintain contact in relation to COVID-19 matters
We'll be sending an invitation through your calendars for next Thursday, 2:00 pm UTC / 7:00 pm Pacific time, for a special staff meeting.
We'll take this opportunity to share additional news, answer your questions and spend time connecting with each other.
We're in this together and we're available to help in any way we can.
In the meantime, you can continue to find the information in this email message and all additional essential COVID-19 related information on Office Wiki.
CRT will keep these pages updated and all the information in one place.
We are also working to maintain regular communications with staff residing in countries that are being affected to a great extent at present.
If you have any questions about travel, events, an important workflow, a coverage issue or anything else you may need help with, feel free to notify CRT and work with them.
We're here to help provide support and act as a liaison when needed.
If you have any confidential or sensitive matters, send an e-mail message to Bryan Judan, Director of Global International Operations at HR HH.
None of these changes should be considered as abandoning our work and our obligations.
Instead, they are an acknowledgement that, at this moment, our work and our obligations are likely to be adapted in a way that has not happened before.
These are the measures we believe are necessary to support each other so that we can continue to work, give our movement the necessary support and provide the world with the service it relies on.
Our planned work will continue there for us when the time comes.
For now, it is time to support each other and make way for the important work that will come in the coming weeks and possibly in the coming months.
We need all of you to make this possible, and for that, we need you to take care of yourself and your families so that they can be in the best possible condition when the need arises.

The Commission has also received comments from the Member States and the European Parliament on the draft Commission communication on the implementation of the European Year of the Environment and the European Year of the Environment.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that attaches to the outer surface (cell membranes) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys and intestines.
ECA2 counteracts the activity of the related angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of angiotensin II and increasing angiotensin (1-7), making it a therapeutic target for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ECA2 also serves as an entry point to cells for some coronaviruses.
The human version of the enzyme is usually called hECA2.
The angiotensin converting enzyme 2 is a zinc-containing metalloenzyme found on the surface of endothelial and other types of cells.
The ECA2 protein contains an N-terminal domain of M2 peptidaase and a C-terminal domain of renal transporter of colectrine amino acids.
ECA2 is a type I unipase membrane protein with its enzymatically active domain exposed on the surface of cells of the lungs and other tissues.
The extracellular domain of ECA2 is cleaved from the transmembrane domain by another enzyme known as shedase and, as a result, the soluble protein is released into the bloodstream and ultimately excreted in the urine.
ECA2 is present in most organs: ECA2 is primarily attached to the cell membrane of the type II alveolar cells of the lungs, to enterocytes of the small intestine, to venous arterial and endothelial cells, and to arterial cells of the smooth muscle of most organs.
ECA2 mRNA expression is also found in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus and brainstem.
The main function of ECA2 is to counteract the AEC.
The ACE cleavage hormone from angiotensin I and forms angiotensin II, which is vasoconstrictor.
In turn, ECA2 splits the carboxyl-terminal amino acid phenylalanine from angiotensin II (Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyzes it to form the vasodilating angiotensin (1-7), (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Ile-His-Pro-OH).
ECA2 can also cleave several other peptides, including [des-Arg9]-bradiquinine, apelin, neurotensin, dinorphine A, and ghrelin.
ECA2 also regulates the membrane trafficking of the neutral amino acid transporter SLC6A19 and has been associated with Hartnup disease.
As a transmembrane protein, ECA2 serves as the main entry point for some coronaviruses, including HCoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (the virus that causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19).
More specifically, binding of the S1 spike protein of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV2 to the ECA2 enzyme domain on the cell surface results in endocytosis and transfer of the virus along with the enzyme to endosomes found within the cells.
This entry process also requires the preparation of protein S by the host's TMPRSS2 serine protease, the inhibition of which is currently being investigated as a possible therapy.
However, various professional associations and regulatory bodies have recommended continuation of standard ACE and BRA inhibitor therapy.
A systematic meta-analysis review published on 11 July 2012 determined that "use of ACE inhibitors was associated with a significant 34% reduction in the risk of pneumonia compared to control cases".
In addition, ' the risk of pneumonia was also reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors and who had an increased risk of pneumonia, in particular those with stroke and heart failure.
The use of ACE inhibitors was also associated with a reduction in pneumonia-related mortality, although the results were not as strong for the overall risk of pneumonia".
Recombinant human ECA2 (rhECA2) appears to be a novel therapy for acute lung injury and appears to improve pulmonary haemodynamics and oxygen saturation in piglets with lipopolysaccharide-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome.
The half-life of rhECA2 in humans is approximately 10 hours and the onset of action is 30 minutes plus the course of effect (duration) of 24 hours.
Several findings suggest that rhECA2 could be a promising drug for those with intolerance to classic inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (ARS inhibitors) or in diseases in which circulating angiotensin II is elevated.
COVID-19 apps are software applications for mobile devices designed to assist with contact tracing in response to the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, i.e. the process of identifying people ("contacts") who may have been in contact with an infected person.
Various applications were developed or proposed with official government backing in some territories and jurisdictions.
Several frameworks have been developed for the creation of contact tracing applications.
Privacy concerns have been raised, in particular, with regard to systems that rely on tracking the geographical location of app users.
There are other less invasive alternatives, such as using Bluetooth signals to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google jointly announced that they would integrate the functionality to support such Bluetooth-based apps directly into their iOS and Android operating systems.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alipay, has implemented an app that allows citizens to check if they have been in contact with people who have COVID-19.
It's already in use in over 200 Chinese cities.
The app was developed by a local IT community, launched as an open source app and will be handed over to the government. "StopKorona!" was launched in North Macedonia, a Bluetooth-based app to track exposure to potentially infected people and provide a quick response to health authorities.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was awaiting approval from the Google Play Store and Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government reported that the contact tracing application was in an advanced stage of development and would be available for implementation in the coming weeks.
Both Australia and New Zealand are considering applications based on the TraceTogether app and Singapore's BlueTrace protocol.Russia is planning to introduce a geoperimetry app for patients living in Moscow who have received a COVID-19 diagnosis, designed to ensure they do not leave their homes.
Ross Anderson, Professor of Security Engineering at the University of Cambridge, exposed several potential practical problems with app-based systems, including false positives and the possible lack of effectiveness if app adoption is limited to only a small portion of the population.
In response to concerns about the spread of deceptive or harmful "coronavirus" apps, Apple limited the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-related apps to its App Store to "official" or trusted organizations only.
Google and Amazon have implemented similar restrictions.
Privacy advocates expressed concern about the consequences of mass surveillance through coronavirus apps and, in particular, whether the infrastructure created to deal with the coronavirus pandemic will be dismantled once the threat passes.
Amnesty International and over 100 other organizations submitted a statement demanding limits to this kind of surveillance.
The organizations set eight conditions for government projects:
surveillance would have to be 'lawful, necessary and proportionate';
Monitoring and surveillance extensions should have extinguishing clauses;
the use of data would have to be limited to COVID-19-related objectives;
Security and anonymity should be protected and there should be evidence of this protection.
digital surveillance should avoid exacerbating discrimination and marginalisation;
any exchange of data with third parties should be defined in the laws;
protections against abuse should be implemented and the rights of citizens to respond to such abuse should be established;
The Chaos Computer Club (CCC) and Reporters Without Borders (Reporter ohne Grenzen, RSF) in Germany also published checklists.
The plan proposed by Google/Apple aims to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the tracking mechanism from their operating systems when it is no longer needed.
In some countries, network-based location tracking was used instead of apps, which eliminated both the need to download an app and the ability to avoid tracking.
In Israel, the network-based tracking was approved.
Network-based solutions that have access to raw location data present significant potential privacy issues.
However, not all systems with central servers need to have access to personal location data; several privacy protection systems have been created that use central servers for intercommunication only (see next section).
In South Korea, a system that is not based on an app was used to conduct contact tracing.
Instead of using a specific app, the system collected tracking information from various sources, including mobile device tracking data and credit card transaction data, and combined it to generate text-based alerts for potentially infected people.
In addition to using this information to alert potential contacts, the government has also made location information available to the public, something that is allowed due to far-reaching changes to information privacy laws following the MERS outbreak in that country.
This information is available to the public through various applications and websites.Some countries, including Germany, have considered using centralised and privacy protection systems.
As of April 6, 2020, details have not yet been released.
Privacy-protected contact tracing is a well-established concept, with a large body of published research dating back to at least 2013.As of April 7, 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on privacy-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to record a user's proximity to other cell phones.
However, PEPP-PT is a coordinated effort containing both centralized and decentralized approaches and is not a single protocol. Decentralized protocols include decentralized proximity tracking for preserving privacy (DP-PPT/DP-3T), temporary contact numbers (TCNs, formerly known as contact event numbers, CEN), and protocols and mechanisms for mobile contact tracing for privacy protection (PACT), among others.
In these protocols, the personal identification data never leaves the device and all matching occurs on the device.
The MIT Media Lab Privacy Group has been developing SafePaths, a platform for using techniques that protect privacy by collecting and using location or route intersection data to track the spread of COVID-19.
It is based on research from the technical report "Apps Out of Control: How to Maintain Personal Privacy During an Epidemic", published in March 2020.[citation needed] Another similar effort is the SafeTrace platform from Enigma MPC, a company that develops privacy technologies that was also originally founded at the MIT Media Lab.
SafeTrace uses secure hardware technologies that allow its users to share sensitive location and health data with other users and officials, without compromising the privacy of that data.
On 5 April 2020, several groups united around what was essentially the same focus and with highly coincident protocols formed the Global TCN Coalition with the aim of reducing fragmentation and enabling the global interoperability of tracking and alerting applications, a key aspect to achieving widespread adoption.
On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had opened the BlueTrace protocol code used by its official government app.
On April 10, 2020, Apple and Google, the companies that control the iOS and Android mobile platforms, announced an initiative for contact tracking that they claimed would protect privacy, which is based on the combination of low-power Bluetooth technology and privacy-protecting cryptography.
They also published the specifications of the main technologies used in the system.
According to Apple and Google, the system is intended to be implemented in three stages:
Implementing tools for governments to create official coronavirus tracking apps that protect privacy
Google and Apple plan to address the adoption and persistent surveillance issues by first distributing the system through OS updates and then removing them in the same manner once the threat has passed.
b'Refiling (also known as repositioning or therapeutic change) is the readaptation of a drug approved for the treatment of a disease other than that for which it was originally developed.
This is in line with the scientific research currently seeking to develop safe and effective treatments for COVID-19.
Other lines of research include the development of a vaccine against COVID-19 and transfusion of convalescent plasma. SARS-CoV-2 has approximately 66 chemomodulable proteins, each of which has multiple binding sites with the ligand.
Analysis of these binding sites provides a reasonable basis for the project to develop an effective antiviral drug against COVID-19 proteins.
The most important target proteins of SARS-CoV-2 include papain-like protease, RNA polymerase directed by RNA, helicase, protein S and ADP ribophosphate.
Hussein A. A. et al. studied several compounds of medical interest which were then optimized and analyzed to identify similarity of their main chain with the most similar approved drugs in order to accelerate the development of a potent drug against SARS-CoV-2 in its preclinical study and recommend it for the design of a clinical study.
Chloroquine is an antimalarial drug that is also used against some autoimmune diseases.
On 18 March, WHO announced that chloroquine and related hydroxychloroquine would be among the four drugs to be studied in the Solidarity clinical trial.
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that New York state trials with chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine would begin on March 24. On March 28, the FDA authorized the use of hydroxychloroquine sulfate and chloroquine phosphate by an emergency use authorization (EUA).
The treatment has not been approved by the FDA clinical trial process and is authorised under the US only as an experimental treatment for emergency use in patients who are hospitalized but cannot receive treatment in a clinical trial.
The CDC said that "the use, dose or duration of hydroxychloroquine for prophylaxis or treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection" is not yet established.
Doctors have said they use the drug when "there is no other option".
A Turkish research team in Istanbul is conducting a small study on the use of chloroquine in combination with zinc, vitamin A, vitamin C and vitamin D.
Large studies are under way at Duke University and Oxford University.
NYU Langone School of Medicine is conducting a trial on the safety and efficacy of the preventive use of hydroxychloroquine.
Chinese clinical trials in Wuhan and Shenzhen claimed to show that favipiravir was "clearly effective".
Thirty-five patients in Shenzhen tested negative in an average of 4 days, while the duration of the illness was 11 days in 45 patients who did not receive it.
In a study in Wuhan of 240 patients with pneumonia, half received favipiravir, while the other half were given umifenovir.
The Italian Medicines Agency reminded the public that the existing evidence supporting the drug is scarce and preliminary.
On 2 April, Germany announced that it would buy the drug from Japan for its reserves and that it would turn to the military to deliver the drug to university hospitals, where it will be used to treat patients with COVID-19.
According to the South China Morning Post, Shinzo Abe has made proposals to the Trump Administration about the purchase of the drug. The drug may be less effective in severe cases of the disease if the virus has already multiplied.
It may not be safe for women who are pregnant or trying to conceive.
A study of lopinavir/ ritonavir (Kaletra), a combination of the antiviral drugs lopinavir and ritonavir, concluded that "no benefit was observed".
The drugs were designed to inhibit HIV replication by binding to the protease.
A team of researchers at the University of Colorado is trying to modify drugs to find a compound that binds to the protease of SARS-CoV-2. In the scientific community, criticism has arisen over the allocation of resources to the readaptation of drugs specifically developed for HIV/AIDS.
The WHO included lopinavir/ritonavir in the international Solidarity trial.
Remdesivir was created and developed by Gilead Sciences as a treatment for Ebola virus disease and Marburg virus infections. Gilead Sciences later discovered that remdesivir had in vitro antiviral activity against multiple filoviruses, pneumoviruses, paramixoviruses, and coronaviruses.
A problem with antiviral treatment is the development of resistance through mutations that can result in more severe disease and transmission.
Some early pre-trial studies suggest that remdesivir may have a high genetic barrier against resistance. Several clinical trials are underway, including two run by Cleveland University hospitals; one for people with moderate disease and another for those with more severe disease.
Three clinical trials of intravenous vitamin C for hospitalized and severely affected people with COVID-19 are underway; two placebo-controlled (China, Canada) and one uncontrolled (Italy).
New York state began trials with the antibiotic azithromycin on March 24, 2020.
The National Center for Global Health and Medicine (NCGM) in Japan is planning a clinical trial with Teijin's Alvesco (cyclosonide), an inhaled corticosteroid for asthma, as a treatment for asymptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus.
A form of angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, a phase II trial is underway and 200 severe hospitalized patients in Denmark, Germany and Austria will be enrolled to determine the effectiveness of the treatment.
Researchers at the Montreal Heart Institute in Canada are currently studying the role of colchicine in decreasing inflammation and pulmonary complications in patients with mild COVID-19 symptoms.
The study, called COLCORONA, is enrolling 6,000 adults aged 40 years and older with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and mild symptoms that do not require hospitalization.
Women who are pregnant, breast-feeding or who do not have an affective contraceptive are not eligible.
Several anticoagulants are being evaluated in Italy.
Low molecular weight heparin is widely used to treat patients, so the Italian Medicines Agency published guidelines on its use.
On 14 April, a multicenter study involving 300 patients investigating the use of enoxaparin sodium in preventive and therapeutic doses was announced in Italy.
Because SARS-CoV-2 is a virus, scientists are devoting much attention to the readaptation of antiviral drugs that were developed for previous outbreaks of SROM, SRAG and West Nile virus.
Ribavirin: ribavirin recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Umifenovir: umifenovir was recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 according to the 7th edition of Chinese guidelines
Here are some treatments that were identified for possible readaptations for the treatment of COVID-19:
Tocilizumab (blocks IL-6 receptor): approved by China.

A COVID-19 vaccine is a hypothetical vaccine against the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are many ongoing attempts to develop such a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) said it did not expect a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease, to be available in less than 18 months.
As of April, five potential vaccines were in phase I safety studies.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2019.
A major outbreak spread across the world in 2020, triggering considerable investment and research activity to develop a vaccine.
Many organizations are using the published genomes to develop possible vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
Established in April, the CEPI initiative's requirements for developing a vaccine are speed, manufacturability, scale implementation and global access.
In April, CEPI scientists reported that 10 different technology platforms were being researched and developed in early 2020 to create an effective COVID-19 vaccine.
Among the main platforms that have passed Phase I safety studies are:
nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) (Phase I developer and possible vaccine: Moderna, mRNA-1273)
The vaccine is a type 5 adenovirus vector developed by CanSino Biologics.
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, in total, 115 potential vaccines are in the early stages of development, 78 of which are confirmed in active projects (79, according to the Milken Institute) and the other 37 are announced, but with little information available (presumed to be being planned or developed).
A phase I or II trial provides preliminary evidence of safety and immunogenicity, is usually randomized, placebo-controlled and performed at several sites, while determining more accurate and effective doses.
Phase III trials typically involve more participants, including a control group, and evaluate the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing the disease, while controlling for adverse effects that occur with the optimal dose.
Of the 79 vaccines in active development (confirmed in early April 2020), 74 were not yet in human evaluation (still in "preclinical" research).
Around 24 January 2020 in Australia, the University of Queensland announced that it was investigating the potential of a molecular-binding vaccine that would genetically modify viral proteins to stimulate immune response.
Around January 24, 2020 in Canada, the International Vaccine Centre (VIDO-InterVac) at the University of Saskatchewan announced the start of work on a vaccine and expects human trials to begin in 2021.
Projects for vaccine development were announced at the China Center for Disease Control and Prevention on 26 January 2020 and at the University of Hong Kong on 28 January.
Around 29 January 2020, Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies, led by Hanneke Schuitemaker, announced that they had started developing a vaccine.
Janssen is co-developing an oral vaccine with his biotech partner, Vaxart.
On March 18, 2020, Emergent BioSolutions announced a manufacturing partnership with Vaxart for the development of the vaccine.
On February 8, 2020, the OncoGen laboratory in Romania published a paper with a design for a vaccine with similar technology to that used in treatment with neoantigene cancer vaccines.
On March 25, the head of the research institute announced that they had completed the synthesis of the vaccine and were beginning testing.
On February 27, 2020, a subsidiary of Generex, NuGenerex Immuno-Oncology, announced that it was starting a project to create a li-key peptide vaccine against COVID-19.
They wanted to produce a possible vaccine that could be tested in humans "within 90 days".
On March 5, 2020, Washington University in St. Louis announced its plans to develop a vaccine.
On March 5, 2020, the United States Army Medical Research and Materiel Command at Fort Detrick and the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, both in western Maryland, announced that they were working on a vaccine.
On or around March 10, 2020, Emergent Biosolutions announced that it had joined Novavax Inc.
In the development and manufacture of a vaccine.
The partners also announced plans for a clinical trial and a phase I clinical trial by July 2020.
On 12 March 2020, the Ministry of Health of India announced that it was working with 11 isolates and that, although it is progressing rapidly, it would take at least one and a half to two years to develop a vaccine.
On March 12, 2020, Medicago, a biotechnology company in Quebec City, Quebec, reported the development of a coronavirus-like particle with partial funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.
The potential vaccine is in the laboratory research stage and human trials are expected to begin in July or August 2020.
Earlier that week, The Guardian reported that U.S. President Donald Trump had offered CureVac "'large sums of money for exclusive access to a COVID-19 vaccine", which the German government complained about.
On 17 March 2020, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer announced a partnership with the German company BioNTech to jointly develop a mRNA-based vaccine.
The potential vaccine based on mRNA BNT162 is currently in preclinical trials and clinical trials are expected to begin in April 2020.
In Italy, on 17 March 2020, Takis Biotech, an Italian biotechnology company, announced that it will have the results of preclinical trials in April 2020 and that human trials of the possible final vaccine could begin in the autumn.
In France, on 19 March 2020, the Coalition for Innovations in Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI) announced an investment of USD 4.9 million in a COVID-19 vaccine research alliance that includes the Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience (Vienna, Austria) and the University of Pittsburgh, bringing the total investment of CEPI for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine to USD 29 million.
The other CEPI partners for the development of a COVID-19 vaccine are Moderna, Curevac, Inovio, Novavax, the University of Hong Kong, the University of Oxford and the University of Queensland.
On March 20, 2020, Russian health officials announced that scientists had begun animal testing of six possible vaccines.
Researchers at Imperial College London announced on 20 March 2020 that they were developing a self-replicating RNA vaccine against COVID-19.
The possible vaccine was developed within 14 days of receiving the Chinese sequence.
In late March, the Canadian government announced funding of CAD 275 million for 96 research projects on medical measures to counter COVID-19, which includes a large number of potential vaccines at Canadian companies and universities, such as the Medicago and University of Saskatchewan initiatives.
At about the same time, the Canadian government announced the use of CAD 192 million specifically to develop a COVID-19 vaccine, with plans to create a "national vaccine bank" with several new vaccines that could be used if another coronavirus outbreak occurs.
On April 2, 2020, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine announced tests of PittCoVacc, a possible COVID-19 vaccine, in mice and said that "SARS-CoV-2 subunit S1 vaccines administered by MNA obtained potent responses from the antigen-specific antibodies (in mice) that were evident two weeks after vaccination".
In Canada, on April 16, 2020, the Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Waterloo announced the design of a possible DNA-based vaccine as a likely nasal spray.
Using bacteriophages, the DNA will be designed to replicate within the human bacterium and produce virus-like, innocuous particles, which can stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
In March 2020, the government, industry and three U.S. universities pooled resources to gain access to IBM's supercomputers, along with cloud computing resources from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft and Google.
Some vaccines have non-specific effects.
That means they can have benefits beyond the disease they prevent.
Another randomized trial in Australia seeks to enroll 4,170 health workers.
Vaccines that are being developed may not be safe or effective.
Initial research to evaluate the efficacy of vaccines with specific animal models of COVID-19, such as the transgenic mouse expressing ECA2, other laboratory animals and non-human primates, highlights the need for biosafety level 3 containment measures for the handling of live viruses and international coordination to ensure standardised safety procedures.
The vaccines against SRAG and MMR have been tested in non-human animal models.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine to protect against SRAG that has been proven safe and effective in humans.
According to research publications from 2005 to 2006, the identification and development of vaccines and new drugs to treat GERD was a priority for governments and public health agencies worldwide.
When MERS became widespread, it was believed that existing research on SRAG could be a useful template for developing vaccines and treatments against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, one MMR vaccine (DNA-based) completed phase I clinical trials in humans, three others were in progress, all of which are viral vector vaccines, two adenoviral vector vaccines (ChAdOx1-MERS, BVRS-GamVac) and one MVA vector vaccine (MVA-MERS-S).
Social media posts promoted a conspiracy theory that the virus causing COVID-19 was known and a vaccine was already in place.
The patents cited by various publications on social media refer to existing patents for genetic sequences and vaccines for other strains of coronavirus, such as the SRAG coronavirus.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms are fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell and abdominal pain.
The time between exposure and onset of symptoms is usually about five days, but may vary from two to 14 days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multiorgan failure.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, with more than 153 000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered. The virus is spread mainly between people during close contact, usually through droplets produced by coughing, sneezing or talking.
While these droplets occur when you exhale, they usually fall to the ground or onto surfaces, rather than being contagious over long distances.
People can also become infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching their eyes, nose, or mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for up to 72 hours.
It is most contagious during the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although spread is also possible before symptoms appear and in late stages of the disease.
The use of face masks is recommended for those suspected of having the virus and their caregivers.
Recommendations on the use of masks for the general public vary; some authorities recommend that they not be used, others recommend that they be used, while others require their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been reported in most countries in the six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms, such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or pressure, confusion, difficulty walking, and bluish face or lips.
Symptoms in the upper respiratory tract, such as sneezing, runny nose and sore throat, are less common.
Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea, have been identified in varying percentages.
Some cases in China initially presented with chest tightness and palpitations.
In some, the disease progressed to pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and death.
This is called the incubation period.
The incubation period of COVID-19 is usually five to six days, but may vary from two to fourteen days.
97.5% of people who have symptoms do so within 11.5 days of infection. Not all infected are reported to have symptoms.
The role of these asymptomatic carriers is not yet fully understood; however, preliminary evidence suggests that they may contribute to the spread of the disease.
The proportion of infected people who do not experience symptoms is currently unknown and is being studied. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reported that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during hospitalization.
The National Health Commission of China began including asymptomatic cases in daily cases on April 1. Of the 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic when the test was performed.
Both sputum and saliva can have large viral loads.
Speaking out loud releases more droplets than speaking at normal volume.
A study in Singapore found that not covering the mouth when coughing can cause the droplets to travel 4.5 meters (15 feet).
Although the virus is not usually airborne, the National Academy of Sciences has suggested that transmission by biological aerosols is possible and explained that air collectors in the hallway outside people's bedrooms tested positive for viral RNA.
Some medical procedures, such as intubation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), may lead to aerosolization of respiratory secretions and, consequently, airborne transmission.
While there are concerns about the possibility of it spreading through feces, the risk is believed to be low. The virus is most contagious when people have symptoms; although spread is possible before the onset of symptoms, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) explains that, although it is not entirely clear how easily it spreads, one person usually infects two or three others. The virus survives on surfaces for hours or days.
Specifically, the virus was detected for one day on cardboard, up to three days on plastic (polypropylene) and stainless steel (AISI 304), and up to four hours on products with 99% copper.
However, this varies according to humidity and temperature.
Soap and detergent are also effective if used in the right way. Soap products degrade the protective lipid layer of the virus and deactivate it, as well as remove it from the skin and other surfaces.
Other solutions, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorohexidine glucanate (a surgical disinfectant), are less effective. In a Hong Kong study, saliva samples were taken on average two days after the start of hospitalization.
In five of six patients, the first sample had the highest viral load.
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first isolated from three people with pneumonia connected to a cluster of acute respiratory disease cases in Wuhan.
All features of the novel virus SARS-CoV-2 are found in related coronaviruses.
Outside the human body, household soap kills the virus, as it bursts its protective bubble. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most affected by COVID-19, because the virus enters the host cells through the angiotensin I type 2 (ECA2) converting enzyme, which is more abundant in the type II alveolar cells of the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface glycoprotein called "spicule" (peplomere) to attach to the ECA2 and enter the host cell.
Acute cardiac injury was identified in 12% of infected people hospitalized in Wuhan, China, which is more common in severe illness.
Rates of cardiovascular symptoms are high, due to systemic inflammatory response and immune system disorders during the course of the disease, but acute myocardial injury may be related to ECA2 receptors in the heart.
ECA2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in its functioning.
A high incidence of thrombosis (31%) and venous thromboembolism (25%) was detected in patients in the ICU with COVID-19 virus infections and may be related to poor prognosis.
Although SARS-COV-2 has tropism by epithelial cells that express the respiratory tract ECA2, patients with severe COVID-19 have symptoms of systemic hyperinflammation.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF secretory T cells were found to be correlated with IL-6 secretory monocyte recruitment and severe pulmonary pathology in COVID-19 patients.
In autopsies, lymphocytic infiltrates were also reported.
The WHO has published several testing protocols to detect the disease.
The standard test method is the polymerase chain reaction with real-time reverse transcription (rRT-PCR).
The test is usually performed on airway samples obtained by nasopharyngeal swab; however, nasal swabs or sputum samples may also be used.
Usually, results are available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can also be used, but two blood samples must be taken two weeks apart and the results have very little immediate value.
Chinese scientists managed to isolate the coronavirus strain and published the genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection with the virus.
As of April 4, 2020, antibody tests (which can detect active infections and whether the person was infected in the past) were being developed, but were not widely used.
Experience in China with testing has shown that the accuracy is only 60 to 70 percent.
The first immediate diagnostic test was approved by the FDA in the United States on March 21, 2020 for use later that month. Diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University suggested methods for detecting infections based on clinical characteristics and epidemiological risk.
Bilateral multilobular glazed opacities with a peripheral, asymmetrical and posterior distribution are common in the early stages of infection.
As the disease progresses, subpleural domain, disordered cobbled pattern (lobular septal thickening with variable alveolar filling) and consolidation may appear.
Little data is available on the microscopic lesions and pathophysiology of COVID-19.
The main pathological findings of the autopsies are the following:
The test is carried out in the following conditions:
Four types of severity of viral pneumonia can be observed:
mild pneumonia: pulmonary oedema, hyperplasia of the pneumocytes, atypically large pneumocytes, interstitial inflammation with infiltration of lymphocytes and formation of giant cells with multiple nuclei
severe pneumonia: diffuse alveolar injury (DAD) with diffuse alveolar exudates.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and severe hypoxemia.
The following table shows the number of patients with pneumonia in the last 12 months:
Blood: disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); leucoerythroblastic reaction
Preventive measures to reduce the chances of infection include staying indoors, avoiding places with many people, washing hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, having good respiratory hygiene and avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth without washing your hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing and, if not wearing handkerchiefs, using the inside of the elbow.
Proper hand hygiene is recommended after coughing or sneezing.
The CDC has recommended the use of cloth face coverings in public places, one reason being to limit transmission by asymptomatic individuals.[citation needed] Social distancing strategies seek to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, restricting travel, and cancelling large public gatherings.
Distancing guidelines also state that people should maintain a distance of 6 feet (1.8 m).
There is no effective medicine to prevent COVID-19.As there is not expected to be a vaccine until 2021 at the earliest, a key part of controlling COVID-19 is trying to prevent the peak epidemic, known as "flattening the curve".
The CDC also recommends frequent hand washing with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, particularly after going to the bathroom or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating, and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing.
They also recommend the use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has a minimum of 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available in a timely manner.For areas where hand sanitizers are not readily available, the WHO provides two formulations for local production.
In these formulations, the antimicrobial activity results from ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; "it is not an active substance for hand antisepsis".
Glycerol is added as a moisturizer.
Patients are given supportive care, which may include rehydration, oxygen therapy and treatment for other vital organs affected.
The CDC recommends that anyone who suspects they have the virus wear a simple face mask.
Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) has been used to address the problem of respiratory failure, but the benefits are still being analyzed.
To improve immunity, personal hygiene and a healthy lifestyle and diet have been recommended.
Supportive treatments may be useful for those with mild symptoms in the early stage of infection. WHO and the National Health Commission of China have published recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Intensive care and pulmonology doctors in the U.S. compiled the recommendations of various agencies into a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19.
For initial treatment of symptoms, some medical professionals recommend parecetamol (acetaminophen), rather than ibuprofen, which is a drug that can be prescribed to treat symptoms of depression.
Precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of virus transmission, especially in health care settings when performing procedures that may generate aerosols, such as intubation or manual ventilation.
The CDC recommends health care professionals caring for people with COVID-19 to place the patient in an airborne infection isolation zone (AIIR), in addition to using standard precautions, contact precautions, and precautions to avoid airborne transmission.
The recommended equipment is PPE, mask, protective eyewear and medical gloves; where available, respirators (instead of masks) are preferred.
N95 masks are approved for industrial environments, but the FDA authorized their use through an emergency use authorization (USA).
They are designed to protect against particles in the air, such as dust, but effectiveness against a specific biological agent not specified in the product information is not guaranteed.
When face masks are not available, the CDC recommends the use of protective masks or, as a last resort, homemade face masks.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require mechanical ventilation or alternatives, but a percentage of cases are.
This type of respiratory support for people hospitalized with COVID-19-related respiratory failure is being actively studied and there is already some evidence that intubation can be avoided with a high-flow nasal cannula or positive bipressure in the airways.
Whether either of these two provide the same benefit to critically ill people is not yet known.
Some physicians prefer to use invasive mechanical ventilation when available because this technique limits the spread of aerosol particles compared to the high-flow nasal cannula.
Many developed countries do not have enough hospital beds per capita, limiting the health system's ability to handle the sudden surge of severe COVID-19 cases requiring hospitalization.
A study in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% needed mechanical ventilation support and 1.4% died.
In China, approximately 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 eventually transfer to the ICU.
Mechanical ventilation becomes more complex when a COVID-19 patient has acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and oxygenation becomes increasingly difficult.
Respirators with different pressure control modes and PPTE are needed to maximize oxygen delivery while minimizing the risk of lung injury associated with the respirator and pneumothorax.
Older respirators may not have high PTSD.
Research on potential treatments began in January 2020 and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Remdesivir seems to be the most promising.
Although the development of new drugs may be delayed until 2021, several drugs being tested are already approved for other uses or are in advanced trials.
Antiviral drugs can be tested in people with severe disease.
The WHO recommends that volunteers participate in trials of the efficacy and safety of potential treatments. The FDA granted a temporary authorization to convalescent plasma as an experimental treatment in cases where the person's life is at serious and immediate risk.
It has not undergone the clinical studies necessary to demonstrate its safety and efficacy for a disease.
In February 2020, China launched a mobile app to deal with the outbreak of the disease.
Users must enter their name and ID number.
The application can detect the 'close contact' and therefore a potential risk of infection by surveillance data.
Each user can also control the status of three other users.
If a potential risk is detected, the app not only recommends self-quarantine, but also alerts local health officials. Big data analysis of cell phone information, facial recognition technology, mobile phone tracking and artificial intelligence are used to track down infected people and those they have been in contact with in South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government allowed security agencies to track the mobile phone data of people suspected of having coronavirus.
The measure was taken to strengthen the quarantine and protect those who may come into contact with infected citizens.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom shared the phone location summaries with the German federal government agency, Robert Koch Institute, in order to investigate and prevent the spread of the virus.
Russia implemented facial recognition technology to detect quarantine violations.
Regional health commissioner Giulio Gallera said that mobile phone operators have informed him that "anyway, 40 percent of people are still on the move".
The German government held a 48-hour weekend hackathon with over 42 000 participants.
In addition, the President of Estonia, Kersti Kaljulaid, made a global appeal for creative solutions against the spread of the coronavirus.
People may feel distress about the quarantine, travel restrictions, and side effects of treatment or fear of infection itself.
The BBC quoted Rory O'Connor as saying: "The increasing social isolation, loneliness, health anxiety, stress and economic problems are a perfect storm for people's mental health and well-being".
The disease may progress mildly with few or no symptoms, so it will resemble other upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold.
Mild cases usually recover within two weeks, while severe or critical cases may take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women may be at risk of severe infection from COVID-19, according to data from other similar viruses, such as SRAG virus and SROM, but data from COVID-19 are insufficient. In some people, COVID-19 can affect the lungs and cause pneumonia.
In more severe cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) causing respiratory failure, septic shock, and multi-organ failure.
Complications associated with COVID-19 include sepsis, impaired clotting, and heart, kidney, and liver damage.
Coagulation disorders, specifically increased prothrombin time, have been reported in 6% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19, while renal function disorders are seen in 4% of this group.
Approximately 20 to 30% of people with CODIV-19 have elevated liver enzymes (aminotransferases).
According to the same report, the average time between the onset of symptoms and death was ten days, with five days of hospitalization.
However, for patients transferred to the ICU, an average of seven days elapsed between hospitalization and death.
In a study of early cases, the mean time from onset of first symptoms to death was 14 days, with a full interval of 6 to 41 days.
In a study by China's National Health Commission (NHC), the mortality rate among men was 2.8% and among women was 1.7%.
Histopathological examinations of postmortem samples from the lungs show diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates in both lungs.
Viral cytopathic changes were observed in the pneumocytes.
The picture of the lungs resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
In 11.8% of deaths reported by the China National Health Commission, heart damage resulted from elevated troponin levels or cardiac arrest.
According to March data from the United States, 89% of people hospitalized had a pre-existing condition.The availability of medical resources and socioeconomic aspects of a region can also affect mortality.
Estimates of mortality from the condition vary due to these regional differences, but also due to methodological difficulties.
The undercount of mild cases may cause the mortality rate to be overestimated.
However, the fact that deaths are the result of past cases may indicate that the current mortality rate is underestimated.
Smokers were 1.4 times more likely to experience severe COVID-19 symptoms and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require intensive care or die compared to non-smokers.
The Hong Kong Hospital Authority found a 20 to 30 percent decrease in lung capacity in some people who recovered from the disease, and lung imaging suggests organ damage.
This can also cause post-rehabilitation intensive care syndrome.
As of March 2020, it was unknown whether previous infections generated effective long-term immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
It appears that immunity is possible, based on the behavior of other coronaviruses, but cases have been reported recovered from COVID-19 that later tested positive for coronaviruses.
These cases are thought to be a worsening of a persistent infection and not a reinfection.
This virus is considered to be natural and of animal origin, through an interspecific infection.
The actual origin is unknown, but by December 2019, the spread of infection was almost entirely due to human-to-human transmission.
A study of the first 41 confirmed cases of COVID-19, published in January 2020 in The Lancet, pointed to December 1, 2019 as the earliest date of onset of symptoms.
Official publications from WHO reported that the first manifestation of symptoms was on December 8, 2019.
In general, several measures are taken to quantify mortality.
These figures vary by region and over time, and are affected by the volume of testing, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the length of time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and general health.
At the end of 2019, WHO assigned the CIE-10 emergency disease codes U07.1 to deaths with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection and U07.2 to deaths with a clinical or epidemiological diagnosis of COVID-19 without laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lethality rate reflects the number of deaths divided by the number of cases diagnosed in a given time interval.
Based on Johns Hopkins University statistics, the overall fatality rate is 6.9 percent (153,822/2 240,191) as of April 17, 2020.
Other measures include the diagnosed patient fatality rate (CFR), which reflects the percentage of diagnosed people who die from a disease, and the infected person fatality rate, which reflects the percentage of infected people (with or without a diagnosis) who die from a disease.
These statistics are not time dependent and follow a specific population from infection to resolution of cases.
While not all infected people produce antibodies, the presence of these can provide information about how many people have been infected.
At the epicenter of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 inhabitants, 80 (1.7%) have already died.
In Gangelt, the disease spread during carnival festivals and affected the youngest, so there was relatively low mortality, and it is possible that not all deaths from COVID-19 have been classified as such.
Moreover, the German health system has not been overtaken.
In the Netherlands, about 3% of the population has antibodies, as determined from blood donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) have been confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the pandemic and the mortality rate are different for men and women.
Mortality is higher among males in studies conducted in China and Italy.
The greatest risk for men is for those in their 50s, and the gap between men and women narrows only at age 90.
In China, the mortality rate was 2.8 for men and 1.7 for women.
The exact reasons for this sex difference are unknown, but it could be due to genetic and behavioral factors.
Sex-based immunological differences, the lower number of women who smoke, and the fact that men have comorbid conditions, such as hypertension, at a younger age may have contributed to the higher mortality rate in men.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were male and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were male.
As of April 2020, the U.S. Government does not track sex information in infections with the COVID-19 virus.
Research shows that viral diseases, such as Ebola, HIV, influenza, and SARS, affect men and women differently.
A higher percentage of healthcare workers, particularly nurses, are women, and they are more likely to be exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on February 11, 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO refers to corona, VI to virus, D to disease and 19 to the date the outbreak was discovered: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid references to a specific geographical location (e.g., China), animal species or group of people, in line with international naming recommendations to prevent stigmatization. The virus that causes COVID-19 is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
WHO also uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.
The term "coronavirus" is commonly used to refer to both the disease and the virus.
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, it was common to refer to the virus and the disease as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, WHO recommended 2019-nCov and 2019-nCoV water respiratory disease as temporary names for the virus and disease, in accordance with the 2015 indication not to use locations in the name of viruses and diseases.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued on 11 February 2020.
Due to capacity limitations in standard supply chains, some digital manufacturers are printing health material, such as nasal swabs and respirator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently needed a respirator valve and the supplier could not deliver it in the required time, a local startup reverse-engineered and printed the 100 needed valves overnight.
After the initial outbreak of COVID-19, conspiracy theories, false information and misinformation about the origin, scale, prevention, treatment and other aspects of the disease emerged and spread rapidly on the Internet.
It seems that humans can transmit the virus to some other animals.
The study found no evidence of viral replication in pigs, ducks or chickens.
There are no approved drugs or vaccines to treat the disease.
Governmental organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers are conducting international research on vaccines and medicines for COVID-19.
In March, the World Health Organization initiated the "SOLIDARITY Trial" to assess the therapeutic effects of the four existing antiviral compounds that show the most promise for efficacy.
There is no vaccine, but several agencies are actively developing possible vaccines.
Previous work on SARS-CoV is being used because SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use the ECA2 receptor to enter human cells.
Three vaccination strategies are being investigated.
First, researchers are looking to develop a complete virus vaccine.
The use of such virus, whether inactive or dead, is aimed at generating a rapid immune response of the human body to a new infection by the COVID-19 virus.
A second strategy, subunit vaccines, seeks to create a vaccine that sensitizes the immune system to certain subunits of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, such research focuses on the S protein that helps the virus to enter the ECA2 receptor.
A third strategy is nucleic acid vaccines (DNA or RNA vaccines, a new technique for creating vaccines).
Experimental vaccines from either of these strategies should be studied to determine their safety and efficacy.On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial of a vaccine with four volunteers began in Seattle.
The vaccine contains an innocuous copy of the genetic code of the virus that causes the disease. It has been suggested that antibody-based enhancement is a potential challenge for the development of SARS-COV-2 vaccines, but this is controversial.
As of April 2020, there are over 300 active clinical trials.
Seven trials evaluated already approved treatments for malaria, including four studies on hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine.
The majority of the Chinese research is on readapted antiviral drugs, including nine phase III trials of remdesivir in several countries, which are due to report by the end of April.
As of April 2020, a dynamic review of clinical developments on vaccine and potential COVID-19 drugs was underway. Several antiviral drugs are being evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19, including the following: remdesivir, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir/ritonavir, and lopinavir/ritonavir in combination with interferon-beta.
As of March 2020, there is tentative evidence on the efficacy of remdesivir.
Clinical improvement was observed in patients treated with remdesivir on compassionate basis.
Phase III clinical trials are underway in the US, China, and Italy.Chloroquine, previously used to treat malaria, was studied in China in February 2020.The results obtained were preliminary.
However, there are requests for peer reviews for research.
Health authorities in Korea and China recommend the use of chloroquine.
However, while the Wuhan Institute of Virology recommends a daily dose of one gram, it notes that twice that dose is very dangerous and could be lethal.
On 28 March 2020, the FDA issued an emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine at the discretion of physicians treating patients with COVID-19. The 7th edition of the Chinese guidelines also includes the use of interferon, ribavirin or umifenovir against COVID-19.
Preliminary data indicate that high doses of ribavirin are needed to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro.
Further in vivo studies of nitazoxanide have been recommended, after determining that low concentrations inhibit SARS-CoV-2. The studies have shown that the initial S protein pruning performed by transmembrane serine protease type 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for SARS-CoV-2 entry via interaction with the receptor ECA2.
Cloroquine and hydroxychloroquine studies with or without azithromycin have important limitations that prevent the medical community from adopting these treatments without further studies. Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine release may be a complication of the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have properties that prevent the release of cytokines.The National Health Commission of China included tocilizumab in the treatment guidelines after the completion of a small study.
It is in a national non-randomised phase II trial in Italy after seeing positive results in people with severe disease.
It is expected that in combination with a serum ferritin blood test to identify cytokine releases, it will counteract these effects, which are thought to cause death in some infected people.
The FDA approved the interleukin-6 receptor antagonist based on past cases for the treatment of steroid-resistant cytokine release syndrome induced by another cause, the treatment of T-CAR T lymphocytes, in 2017.
To date, there is no non-randomized controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
Transfer of purified and concentrated antibodies produced by the immune system of those who have recovered from COVID-19 to people who need them as a method of passive immunization without vaccines is being investigated.
This strategy was tested with the SRAG with inconclusive results.
Viral neutralization is the expected mechanism of action by which passive treatment with antibodies can defend against SARS-CoV-2.
However, other mechanisms are possible, such as antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity or phagocytosis.
Other forms of passive antibody treatment are being developed, for example, using manufactured monoclonal antibodies.
The production of convalescent serum, which consists of the liquid part of the blood of recovered patients and contains specific antibodies against this virus, could be increased to achieve a faster distribution.
Coronavirus diseases, a group of closely related syndromes
