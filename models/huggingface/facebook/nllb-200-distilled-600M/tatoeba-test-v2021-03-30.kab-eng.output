You've got a problem, you've got a problem!
You eat too much.
Tom can't do what Mary is asking him to do.
I'll go and tell him.
Have you ever written an article on Wikipedia?
There was a room in the house.
Why doesn't anyone answer with words?
Tell them.
Please tell Tom to go.
Where did you say it was?
She didn't grow up, she didn't stay.
Do you think I could be visited by a guest?
Slave loves the island.
Tom was fighting with Mary.
We hate each other.
Tom and Mary both should do that today.
Where did all the movies come from?
Is something bothering you?
Are you not Tom's friends?
Can't we translate this word?
Do you want us to sit at the table with you?
Put some oil on the cat that ate the candy, you little pigs; hurry up!
Get your hands off my bike!
Go ahead!
Wash your hands.
Listen carefully.
Where were you on October 20 at 2:30 p.m.?
Sami asked Layla if she had a friend.
Take your angry hands off me.
Are you afraid?
Tom is going to build things.
Tom has already waited three hours.
Will you sell your house to Tom?
I will not accept your mistakes again.
Aren't you ashamed?
Someone else is coming now.
Get out!
I always liked the idea.
I think there was someone in the front room.
He wants to go now.
Everyone loved Tom.
Just look at my new car.
Can you get me something to eat?
Tom lives with his wife in Australia.
What's wrong with her?
It's almost too late, get off the roof!
She sent me a message.
He kissed my arm.
Do you speak Latin?
Do you hear what they say?
Tom asked me about Mary.
They are new.
I'm calling my brother.
Tom felt it was a bad time.
You are done!
Tom knows better.
Get us out of here.
Tom nodded.
She hated him.
There are trees.
Tom and I are in the same heart.
Does Tom believe that?
No one knows what will happen in the future.
I am a writer.
Be a wreck!
Sami didn't know what to say to Layla.
I have never been to Paris.
The truth is true even if they don't believe it.
Don't tell others the truth, let them tell it themselves.
Do you like playing basketball?
He's better off going home now.
I just got back from the bus.
Do what I tell you.
Does he use them?
Part of her story is true.
Tom has until October 20 to complete the report.
She can sing very well.
Do you think a guest can visit me?
Brush your teeth!
What is it?
You are seeing love blindly.
I want you to open the door when you leave.
We want our money.
Tom's wife left him in October.
Tom hasn't seen this since October.
Where will Tom arrive?
You're back.
Tom is afraid of the economy.
I hope you will reply quickly.
Get away from me!
I don't see well.
Tom told me to get up.
Give your friends.
He never stopped talking.
She works day and night.
There's one already here.
There's someone here.
This is a joke.
They all danced.
Tom got a call from someone who wanted to see you.
I waited for you, you didn't come.
I like it now too.
It didn't help.
Get out of here!
Someone else may have been hurt.
Take this.
Since when?
I am glad to have your letter.
They said Mary would come back.
I like apples.
Someone called you.
I only ordered coffee because I wasn't hungry.
A good plant needs a good plant.
I live in the city.
Go ahead!
The stone told the thief, "I'll cut it". He replied, "What am I going to say to us?"
I have a lot of money.
This way.

I'm not coming on Saturday.
What did you think of the presidential meeting?
I hope you learned some of your mistakes.
Are you ready?
Have you read this yet?
I love everything about Tom.
You are all sick.
I don't think the stolen food will repay the bees.
Tom was poor, though he might have been rich.
Come right now.
Can you find him?
It is probably true that the music of Jean-Louis Aubert said, "If you have joy in your heart, it is easy to accept death". Then, the person who is familiar with what is going to happen, will find it unlikely; it will strike him with a thumb. This is what is called the thumb.
Are you free?
Were you surprised to see her?
We are sinners.
I'm not Tom's mother.
Do you know anyone by the name of Mr. Green?
Keep going!
Please do not forget what we have said.
I really love you.
Follow Tom!
Give it to the person who invited you.
Have you rented a house in Australia?
Tom is tall.
We did it.
Please don't tell him.
Sami gave Layla a kiss.
He went to Atami to change his mind.
Are you ready to come to me?
That's right!
I love you so much.
Leave me alone.
His friends scattered him.
Tom met many people while in Australia.
I listen to music.
I wish him a year of peace and prosperity.
Drink the juices with the leaves.
They will live forever.
She started singing.
This boy is a fool.
Why do you want all these things?
Tom went to Mary.
I met Tom in Boston.
I think Tom and Mary had dinner.
Tom said Mary didn't love him.
Put it on the ground.
He likes to ride cars.
Start writing!
They found evidence of Tom on 20 October 2013.
I was hungry.
You are willing to pay.
Look at this.

You and Tom are old.
You are talking.
Call me a little.
You are a woman.
He bought a water bottle.
Did you get a little drunk?
I learned this from you!
Are you reading them?
Let's play some games.
I don't care at all.
Sami's lies stayed in Layla's mind.
So who is it?
Someone approached the door.
Can you talk a little, please?
Who knows why.
Who told you I can't swim?
Dozens of Kabyles fled Algeria due to Algerian civil society and the cultural restrictions imposed by the Algerian government.
He bought it!
Are you confessing?
Tom is fed up with bad food.
I was eating when you called me.
You're tired of working in a place like this.
You are a bitch.
Is Mary rich or not?
You seem too tired now.
I don't know what I'm doing at all.
This is how Tom does it.
Why shouldn't I eat this?
Keep singing!
You can keep working in a place like this.
There was one singing.
What if someone knows him?
Tom works in the library.
Tom was meeting Mary.
Have you ever played a game of chess with Tom?
Are you awake?
What is love?
I need someone to listen to me.
You fool!
Let me out!
Can you get ready for the nightly bus ride?
I can't listen to this anymore.
Take me home.
Stay calm with me.
It was raining.
When are you going to eat?
Just get out now.
Are you not lucky?
Do you read or work?
Take her home.
Sami's car will be parked tomorrow.
Tom bought a lot of buses.
Tom's wedding was on October 20.

I stayed home today.
We need to remember Tom.
Am I not right?
Someone entered the room.
Tom is not the only one who has done this.
What kind of wine do you have that is expensive?
We greet you all.
Spring is coming.
Get them all out.
It's clear!
You're laughing at him.
Can anyone tell me why Tom is angry?
Tom is a tough kid.
Thank you for your kindness.
Did you feel bad when you went to Portugal?
Did anyone see anything?

They don't think I'll ever be rich again.
Tom grabbed the black door.
Tom lives in Australia with his grandparents.
Start now!
Do you doubt we will win?
I wanted to know if I could find out where Tom hid the stolen money.
Tom has no face to say what he really believes.
You are at home.
The word is not considered a proverb.
Are you going to Boston tomorrow?
They have plans.
Listen to me!
Please wash your hands before eating.
I haven't been to Boston at all.
Have you used them?
You're back in your seat.
Where are we going?
The ocean has lost about 30 percent of the CO2 emitted into the atmosphere.

The dog said to the dog who had been bitten by him because he was not tired of the pain: "How come, you are old and I am tired".
She writes beautifully.
Drink some water.
Someone is watching.
Tom doesn't want to help Mary.
The noise, the noise: I've swallowed my pools, I've felt my voice. What is it, what is it? (crying is, it's a rock).

It's fun!
It was Bellad at Elli who introduced the written Kabyle literature.
I hope to be back on October 20.
Tom was having an affair with Mary.
This translation is useless to anyone.
Be confident.
Can you do this for us?
You two should go.
She can read Japanese.
I'm not your type.
They went to the bathroom.
A man is caught in a trap.
There is nothing you can do to help.
The Ka'bi language is American!
Tom is out there, isn't he?
You've got a problem, you've got a problem!
I don't know where Tom lives.
No one knows what tomorrow will bring.
Have you read it?
Tom's family urged him to stay.
I like to sing.
I know who left early.
Where do you not want to go?
Modern Hebrew is simpler than the Old.
Get your feet up here!
It keeps saying that we don't open the same world.
Those are birds.
I thought he would come.
Follow your dreams.
Tom came closer.
Are you a spy?
Someone wants to save you.
Someone tore two pages from this book.
I wasn't told.
Are you from Tibet?
Tom is preparing dinner.
I have to fool you!
It's up.
Give me some time.
I forgot his name.
Tom will go to Australia on Saturday.
Can you stop crying?
The kingdom lives in Celtan, and the poor build it.
He came out of the river.
I need a car of choice.
You should eat now.
Thank you for always helping me.
How many books have you read?
Are you really?
He is a very angry man.
You can't leave me like this.
No one died.
Something is missing.
Thank you for inviting me here.
Are you thinking of anyone?
Who is left?
Will she go?
You are always wrong.
I drank a cup of coffee.
Are you writing a letter?
I shave my hair every month.
Tom needs me.
Let the dogs ride.
You can now consider Layla your daughter.
That's too much!
How many times?
Who else uses Tatoeba in your office?
Tom came to Mary's aid.
I'm tired of your whining.
Tom changed his position.
Tom and I are just attending the wedding.
Oh, my God, no one sees you doing this.
I want to go to Boston in the spring.
Make me a sandwich.
Which do you like more, meat or fish?
Someone might want it.
Who is angry?
Don't I have to work tomorrow?
When did you get back from Boston?
Are you all right?
Now that I'm older, I think about something else.
I want you to close the door when you leave.
I don't know what else to say.
Run!
I don't want to buy.
I will not accept your mistakes again.
Praise him.
How many books do you have?
You have to learn from your mistakes.
Take her home.
Do you watch TV every day?
How's your coffee?
You have a toothpick in your teeth.
I haven't seen him since then.
We're not playing.
I hope to return on October 20.
Rajium is already here.
I wonder where she is.
Tom never returned his money.
I always walk on foot.
Tell me something about him.
Please don't die.
Tom pretended not to hear what Mary said about him.
I think we can help.
My dear...
He is laughing!
Tom stayed.
Someone stole it from me.
Did Tom really say he thought he would stay in Australia?
If I were you, I would go home and rest well.
Some of what you say is disturbing.
Tom and I went to the party together.
So you believe the stories?
He will sit still.
Did your religion come in peace?
Aren't you hungry?
Look at yourself.
Is there anyone here who can help me?
Tom couldn't save Mary.
Tom lives with his mother in Australia.
There is a God.
You obviously lost them all.
Tom lied.
Who will take his place?
You are expecting Tom.
I have my own list.
Tom and Mary help.
Give Tom his freedom!
Someone tried to kill you.
They all agreed.
I told you before that I didn't do it.
I fell into a coma I couldn't bear.
Are you Catholic?
It's not bothering you.
Champagne is hot.
Where are these children?
The world is a small town.
Was there anything else?
You should ask someone else.
I hope no one knows us.
The plants are growing.
Sami plays the role of Farid.
How long are you going to leave?
I hope no one has seen you like this.
I want to know more about your country.
I learned French.
Tom was fired from his job in October.
Oh, my God, no one has seen you.
I wish you hadn't met me.
Tom responded sharply.
Tom will be late again today.
The congregation has ten members.
Do you think Tom loves me?
You are a man, Mom.
Do you like the cold?
Do you want to stay longer?
Has a cow ever been raised?
Tom took the last place.
I will be a cultural hero.
Tom loves you.
I speak Old Greek.
Tom didn't tell the truth about where he was that day.
Tom is upset.
Good morning, sweetie.
There is no reading on October 20.
Are you trying to screw me up?
You have been waiting a long time for him.
You are getting married.
You are part of the problem.
Stop the noise!
Sami was singing to the priesthood of Farid.
Tom didn't answer because he didn't know what to say.
Are you a fool?
I heard something.
What's wrong with you?
Every fisherman is caught by a fish.
I'm lucky to have met you here.
Chopin's one of them.
Call slowly.
I hope Tom is strong.
Be careful.
Do you know him?
Are you shy?
Dan bought a new computer.
Is there anyone else?
Tom doesn't know how to write on a computer.
My month of birth is October.
I was in the mountains.
Stephen is dead.
Do you think Tom will forgive me?
Did you use them?
Please tell him your real name.
I hope no one follows you.
Is there anyone else?
I hope no one remembers you.
Tom was going with Mary.
Let's go and tell the others.
What is wine?
Please hold this.
Nothing wrong with what I did.
Have you seen Tom or not yet?
It's a mother.
Follow the neighborhood.
You have a book and a child.
Tom knows I'm not afraid of anyone.
She's reading it.
Has anyone brought you anything?
I didn't think it was counted.
He took her home.
Everyone hated Tom.
Tom and Mary met at the station.
You've obviously lost them all.
Can I trust you?
Get in!
I want you to go to your room and pack your bags.
Let's see something.
It's all right.
Stop bothering me.
You are our prisoner.
They're not interested in that.
Welcome to your home.
The rabbi is already here.
Will you work tonight?
Stay with me a little.
Please let me pay.
Tom refused to go deep.
I know Tom is Canadian.
Tom has been in Boston since last October.
Tom will be thirty years old in October.
Jim looks like his father.
I need you here.
I think there was one in the front room.
Did you hear?
Have you become a prostitute?
Tom will tell Mary.
Do you write French?
Tom came back without any respect for his wife.
No one knows.
Breathe!
None of Tom's suggestions are very useful.
You still have life ahead of you.
They all fled.
We traveled the country by car.
I'm Chinese.
Did Tom say anything about his accident?
Tom turned his back on Mary.
Are you sick?
Oh, my God, no one has seen you come here.
Tom only sat up for a few hours.
We will all eat.
Sami was talking to his mother.
I let Tom kiss me.
Sami found a turtle in the forest.
Wait for him.
Tom said he wanted to hit him with a stick.
Tom is waiting.
Someone is watching us.
I want to show you some translated texts for publication.
They interrupted the conversation.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
It is a secret.
Construction began in October.
I brought you something to eat.
It's over!
I was a little surprised to see Tom there.
Choose slowly.
Listen to this!
They built it.
You should never forget that.
I can't see her.
He's got them.
Tom thought Mary might have been cursed.
Tom doesn't seem to care about Mary.
Tell me who else will help us.
Tom stopped the race.
You have to pray for them.
Aren't you almost as good as Tom?
Sometimes, just nodding your head can indicate that you are hearing well.
Tom went to a party yesterday.
Ayako, raise your voice a little.
How deep is it?
You're in the wrong!
I was in his room.
You are all created.
I haven't been to Boston since October.
Someone is wearing his umbrella.
Tom doesn't know how to talk to the crowd.
They were all happy.
He went out of the car.
Thank you for your listening.
Can you finish this one?
Be careful! The doors will open now!
There must be someone to stop you.
It doesn't hurt when you're screwing a piece of paper.
He just ran away.
Tom is poor.
There is no more laughter, if the teeth are brushed.
You are breathing.
The last date of the draw will be on October 20.
You kiss my ass.
Tom said he could speak French.
I will do everything I can for you.
Swimming is good for your health.
I am a man of the people.
Tom didn't wake Mary up.
You put your clothes together.
I'm lucky to have met you here.
I was on the road last summer.
Why doesn't anyone speak?
Eat something!
Have you seen the movie or not?
Maybe I should go now.
Tom threw Mary's sunscreen out of the window.
May I speak to you alone?
Who is ready to ask?
I want to make my baguette.
I'm very disappointed in Tom.
We are starving here.
Sami will cry like a child.
Tom and I love each other.
My best friend cheated on me.
We didn't ask Tom for help.
Your eyes are blinking.
Let me out!
How did you find that?
Sami was reading better.
I took a ticket.
She read it.
This is you!
Get out of here!
Tom threw three strikes against Mary.
Don't get too tired of food if you don't want to eat.
Tom was angry with Mary.
Someone stole my money.
That's it, I'm going to drink a little more.
Tom doesn't seem happy.
The computer is new.
He refused it so badly.
Medical patients need medical care.
Tom never asked me.
Are you asleep?
When will we do it?
Tom needs to buy Mary a ticket too.
You are wise.
Is anyone here?
Can I go home now?
She's a woman, not a girl.
Sami told me that you were in a relationship.
You will be hungry.
I continued to work.
Call them.
Someone is following us.
I moved here last October.
Will you come with me?
Tom wants to work.
Tom became Mary's friend while living in Boston.
You have no idea.
Tom is too young for me.
I finally arrived in Boston last October.
We are watching over Tom!
Please let me out.
Tom is not a Pokémon.
Someone called you.
Hurry up!
That is the truth.
I forgot everything that was important to you.
I love you very much.
I know these people.
Everything is fine around you.
I want to walk with you.
Have you read this yet?
Tom didn't think I would do that.
Tom and I went together.
Are you okay?
Take this.
I'm not your friend.
I made coffee.
She teaches English.
Do you think anyone can see me?
Leave it to us.
He sent me a message.
Be yourself!
It makes no sense at all.
Ask for the other one.
I won't let you pay.
I need to sit by myself to think.
Walk with such prudence.
Does Tom believe that?
She sings these songs.
There's a girl who's very fond of you.
He is a genius.
Tom is not expected to be here on October 20.
You all did.
Is there anything that worries you?
Tom ate a spaghetti mug.
Is Tom still crying?
I think it's not true.
Get out of here!
The left is a badge.
The train left them.
They are dead.
he danced
This is my opinion, not yours.
They are armed.
A moment of silence for you!
Tom is an anorexic.
The flowers begin to fall in October.
Hurry up!
Tom was angry at Mary.
Go change your clothes.
The mountain turned it into a rock!
Someone else has done it before.
Tom couldn't help.
Happy new job.
He is a fan of Algerian culture.
Go home.
What is the problem?
He is gone.
Is anyone there?
Can you find her?
You can be a writer.
I saw you in my dreams.
You have tried him.
You do not make mistakes.
Answer them.
Tom seems to be fine.
I learned this from you!
I still like Tom.
Get up!
I don't know how to answer your question.
I made sure Tom didn't read anything to Mary.
It is difficult.
Think again.
Power is in friendship.
Please do as I say.
We are all part of the problem.
Do you understand?
Who is she?
You drank a cup of coffee.
Can you see?
How long have you been reading?
When did you first go to Australia?
Tom is angry with Ken.
Tom took the mask off carefully.
Do you think Tom will forgive me?
You stayed at home.
One question.
Tom smiled.
I remember.
Tom likes to see Mary dance.
I lost.
Someone is watching Tom.
She eats bread.
They answered.
My cousin hurt me.
No matter how tired he is, work awaits him.
You're out of war.
He just plays it to the fans.
"A man's face is a sword". It's like "A man's face is a sword". says a friend.
She died.
He built it.
Come on now.
Have you read it?
Call me tomorrow.
It's snowing.
You'll see Tom soon.
Send this letter by plane.
You'll find Tom acceptable.
Someone is coming.
Cars are expensive.
They were all happy.
The first god of the people's art is their language.
Leave me alone!
Just look at my new car.
Read to us.
Where did you find him?
Tom was sitting under a tree.
You can use my computer if you want.
Don't cry.
Tom got caught.
No one understood.
Please help me with my work.
You shouldn't be sitting here.
Cavaliers love their language.
I have no choice.
Where are you?
Tom has a new record.
You have to pay for Tom's money.
They all listened.
She swims well.
She loves to race.
Tom seems afraid.
I'll tell Tom to say that.
He gave us all what we wanted.
Tom hates Mary.
What will you do if it rains?
Our teacher is ashamed of his students asking him when he is reading.
Just look at my new car.
You are a man!
No one knows.
Tom does everything alone.
He is easily overwhelmed.
Are you from Tibet?
Go with your foot.
Stop not crying.
Have you had dinner or not?
Don't look at her.
Tom seems happy.
She loves you very much.
They have appreciated your writing.
We hope you will be there many times with us.
I met Tom in October.
Are you a Christian?
Go and walk!
Are you at home?
I only met her one way.
His phone is on you.
Do you hear what they are saying?
The Kaboola County is beautiful.
Tom was Mary's high school sweetheart.
Is anyone here?
Just let me in.
Eat the plants - Millions of birds eat them.
Bless the poor!
What are Tom and Mary arguing about?
Hear her.
I want to say hello to Tom.
Tom and Mary are about to leave.
Have you seen the new movie?
I found your ticket.
His beauty enchanted him.
I play Chopin.
You seem to be fine.
He was born a rich man.
Please send me a message with a black box.
I'll call you tomorrow night.
You should try to meet Tom.
I know Tom is a bully.
Tom needs a dozen eggs.
I was told that Tom is still in Australia.
I'm going to eat at a Chinese restaurant this afternoon.
Tom speaks French.
Tom is not talking.
Now that I'm a teacher, I think differently.
Mary likes to buy clothes.
I don't know who killed him.
Sami was six years old.
Stop the student!
You have to tell Tom the truth.
Tom was killed by someone today.
I want you to come back today.
Get out of here!
Grab him!
Has anyone mentioned my name?
You look like a European.
Someone came to our house.
I want you to tell me the truth.
No, thank you. I'm going.
Let me explain.
This boy is tall.
You fool!
The horse steals the goose.
Ask one of the first children you see.
When was the last time you were together?
Someone has gone missing.
Wanting to get a chance to play, Tom went to the ballroom and knocked down some bricks.
Throw this one.
My wife thinks I'm a fool.
He just talks, he doesn't talk.
I look forward to being at your Halloween party.
Help me!
I know this is a long journey.
I was hit by the sea.
Please repeat.
I don't know what you like.
French is not only spoken in France.
Stay still and don't move at all.
Take this table.
She is angry.
Go get warm.
Are you new here or not?
It's a small dog.
What kind of food do you eat?
Someone could stop me.
Keep your eyes open and you will be very happy.
Look again.
Tom or someone else said that.
Rest up.
Tom seems ready to go.
You bitch!
I didn't know you had a brother.
Laugh!
Get up!
No one can beat Tom.
Get off!
Where does Tom live?
Get rid of me!
Have you read this book or have you not yet?
Tom almost killed Mary by accident.
We are a bunch of fish.
You're not tired, are you?
Tom won the Nobel Prize in Physics.
Tom did not stop helping Mary.
Is that French here?
Open the door.
I didn't read it well.
Tom didn't want to get married.
You understand.
Is he dead?
You are our prisoner.
You have a good dream.
You've seen Tom do this, haven't you?
Tom didn't raise his head.
None of my parents can speak French.
There is no alcohol.
Today is the 20th of October.
My little brother was raised by his grandmother.
It's hot.
You are a real monster!
I'll eat it, if you eat it too.
Get tired of it.
It is worth it.
Is that true?
Tom was forced to retire from his job.
Someone else has just called.
Tom is dressed like a girl for Halloween.
Someone called Tom's house last night.
What is your philosophy?
Am I wrong about that?
I won this one.
Where do you live now?
Sami seems to be out of his mind.
Welcome to your home.
I'm tired of writing with you.
The truth is more than anything.
Your philosophy of life is different from mine.
Someone is coming to me.
We picked up our bags and headed straight to the market.
Are you ready?
Tom came in front of Mary.
Sami went back to work.
Don't move.
Are you home too?
You'd think she lived by the lake.
Tom came alone, not Mary.
Keep writing.
Try to find a cure.
You'd better cut your hair.
Yes, please.
I don't go swimming around.
You kissed, you kissed.
Is Jesus really the Son of God?
They said something.
When did you come to Boston?
From now on we will only speak French.
Sami felt as if he knew Layla.
I just got out of the hospital in Ukfadu.
This is my favorite type of food.
I just hope no one has seen you come here.
Is that wrong?
You have rejected me.
Our food is all messed up.
Do good to those who hate you.
As fast as you want to go, you won't get there in time.
Show me exactly where he lives.
To learn a language, you must know the complexity of numbers.
They all died.
I hate to work.
Stand up.
Do you know how far Boston is from Chicago?
As soon as I wanted to buy, my grandson came to me.
Can you finish this one?
Tom wasn't here last week.
Where is your memory?
I believe everything we've been told.
No one laughed.
Let them help you.
We heard the door open.
Are you awake?
Are you sick?
There's someone out there.
Sami and Layla are arguing over the value of a three-dollar bill.
They want something to write about.
We bought these books.
Are these your parents?
We added another cookie.
Tom is a man of temper.
What should we say?
How many pounds did you expect?
French is difficult.
He is careful in his behavior.
I think they'll watch over me.
They're tired.
People are dangerous in Australia.
How strong you are!
Tom likes to do things.
You are a problem.
You are a woman here.
I am always proud of you.
I think you're being fooled.
Hello! How are you?
Tom is used to crying a lot.
Tom said he never planted an apple.
Are you so old now?
Where did you get your clothes?
Be strong!
You should always have a gun in your hand.
Get your clothes on!
I hope you understand.
We left early.
We are our prisoners.
Tom had more money to buy Mary what she wanted.
Tom agreed.
Tom is angry.
Come in!
Sami's car was very good.
We're going to beat you.
Love is alive.
Close your eyes.
Would you like to see anyone?
How should I explain it?
Tom was released on October 20.
Are you hungry?
How much?
I want someone to talk to.
I don't want to enjoy television as much as usual.
Tom and Mary help each other.
Sami was playing with his hand.
I feel a strong desire to do this.
Tom and Mary got married in October 2013.
Stay with me for a while.
Go bathe in cold water.
20th of October 2013 is Arim.
Tom finished.
Shut them down.
You look like a European.
This tree is mentioned by the Italians.
It's the third of October.
He is drunk.
Snow is white, snow is black.
No one cares who you are.
Your writing is scary.
I am very happy.
Someone stole it from me.
I'll wake you up tomorrow morning.
Who is the world's top soccer player?
You have no real fear.
By your strength!
You obviously ate too much.
The plant is a national treasure.
Does anyone in your group speak French?
Are you going to read today?
It's our turn!
We eat meat.
Tom cooks twice as much as Mary.
I want to know who is coming.
Do you want anything else?
Just talk to them.
You can get milk from cows.
Get out of the way!
Just take them together.
She broke up.
My life is in your hands.
I'm looking for one.
I hope no one sees you like that.
The facts!
Tom will always remember Mary.
Tom doesn't know Mary.
Tom walked on foot.
You still don't like Tom, do you?
What do you think of what happened?
I'm taking my clothes off.
I was hit by a car.
I don't like cats, of course.
His father never went abroad.
How many books have you read?
You talk like your mother.
I'm worried about Tom.
Are you a Christian?
It doesn't matter.
You better start now.
Which is the smartest neighborhood in Boston?
I am learning.
When will you eat?
I listen to music.
I'll call you this afternoon.
Someone started the fire.
I'm glad I didn't know.
Someone brought Tom home last night.
Tom didn't raise his head.
I'm not upset today.
Do you like Tom's character?
Tom said he didn't want Mary to win.
Try to get Tom to leave early on this.
Keep the oil on the fire.
Everything will change.
Tom fought Mary in front of everyone.
Get another one.
If you need me, call.
They don't help.
Please don't break my head.
Can you finish this one?
Tom is sleeping.
Tell me exactly where he lives.
I think Tom is pissed.
He was so attached to her, she broke down.
We got married on October 20.
I'm sure they're wrong.
I want to eat the swordfish.
Tom shouldn't know where Mary lives.
Do you like science fiction films?
They speak French.
You better tell the truth.
Close the window!
They eat these.
Tom knows very well.
You are deceiving!
Do you deserve to be so critical of me?
No one knows what the future holds.
Someone has to do it.
Tom gave the teacher an apple.
Are you asleep?
Tom seems strong.
Everyone was happy that Tom was arrested.
Did you learn a lesson or something?
The flowers of the plant are red.
I wonder where they are.
I was afraid.
I wish I was as healthy as I am to do this.
Tom doesn't live in Australia at the moment.
You are at home.
Run fast, hopefully the train will drop you.
I met a man who knew Tom.
Look closely.
I like pop music.
No one said that.
They all were silent.
This guy is a monster.
Do you go to school by train?
Why do people lie?
One day I'll buy the train that makes my grandfather's room.
Do you think we will win?
Check again.
There is no inner wall.
We asked him for a good night.
Tom will stay here.
I think his opinion is a bit of a joke.
Just look at my new car.
Stop the fire!
This table is closed.
Water, please.
This will strengthen you even more.
Sami is quick to post on Facebook.
Somebody broke this dish.
She doesn't like music.
I don't know where he is.
It rained on me.
I know.
What paper do you want?
She is crying.
Does Tom work in Australia?
Go ahead.
I can't write this right.
Your father has a fever.
Tom sat down next to Mary in the shower.
Expressions such as "Muslims love Jesus and Moses,... or the rabbis" are obviously a direct link between these and the growing fear of Russia, the sheep fleeing to the Orthodox and the evangelicals. Until I saw their TRUMP hanging between the Canadians and the Churches I was surprised and I said: That's why they agree, to find our "culture", to make matters worse.
Where is your grandmother?
My sister is a very beautiful girl.
Are you Anna?
Please, find him.
Stay here and wait for Tom to come.
Have you seen your table?
Are you Hungarian?
Look, this kid is going to be a little self-righteous now.
My baby is here.
We are the best in the world.
I've already had one.
Someone is teasing you.
Tom ran.
Tom came to visit Mary.
Who was there?
I don't have any money left in my purse.
The animals are scared of the wind.
Tom is a hero.
You are blinded by love.
Everyone knows her.
Please help me open this door.
Can you be my cup of tea?
Take your hand off me.
You expect too much from him.
I probably shouldn't have asked Tom that question.
Stop whining.
They're building.
Were you expecting someone?
This girl is pregnant.
Stop the fight.
Get in there!
Hurry up.
This happened on October 20.
How old are you?
You are a great writer.
I love my brothers and sisters.
Do not use this train in front of the water.
I hope she always goes through this.
It's very difficult to find out what this is, this dream.
Stay with us.
Tom left them.
I hope it will always be like this.
Get your feet out of here!
I want you to read this letter.
Stop it.
Tom was distraught.
You heard him, didn't you?
You are dead.
I know Tom is a student.
We bought a water bottle.
In your class!
Someone has to do something.
Leave everything.
I can teach you how to read.
He is one of my father's disciples.
I am very hungry.
You should apologize.
Sami had a bad day.
Sami noticed Layla changing her voice there.
Are you eating well?
Did you hear me?
We are tired.
Tom is going to pack everything.
We forgot about him.
Tom will go to Nîmes tomorrow.
Mary wore a Halloween dress for her children.
How long will you stay in Boston?
Why does the Quran say that non-Muslims should die?
You are the love of my life.
I hate him too.
Tom sat next to his daughter.
Do everything you can.
You know? These names I gave are those of the farms in the village of Ysarig.

Stop the tears!
I think about it day and night.
The roof was very damaged. I wish you were there.
Be careful.

Where is your uncle?
You couldn't get her the cup.
You read Rome that you loved.
I'm sure we will.
Bring a guard.
I like machines.

Tom is all over the place.
There is no one in this room.
It is very good.

Jafar is the father of his daughter.
I can't read.
Can you swim?
I don't look with my right eye.
Get everyone in.
I hate work.
I want someone to help me do it.
They are.
You're poisoned by it.
You know I can't.
Someone stole my money.
"Do you like snakes?" "Obviously not".
I need to know someone else.
Stay calm!
Keep it in your mind.
Tom wants to take care of Mary.
I have a guitar.
We'll meet in October.

I haven't seen Tom anywhere.
Go change your clothes.

I played music.
They are not boring.
She came, she came.
Look ahead, please!
Come here.
It's such a lucky day!
Read it.

You are worried.
Tom has done that many times before.
Stay away from me.
There was one there.
I love to tell stories to children.
They went to Boston.
Please get up.
Get out of the way!
There must be someone to stop you.
This book is valuable for many reasons.
Is that all?
Maybe until then.
Give me a randy.
Do this!
Grab him!
Aren't you happy?
Will you let us go now?
Give it to him.
I really love you.
Do you understand?
Have you seen Tom in Australia?
It's been two days.
No, I don't know your brother.
I can't remember your name.
Tomorrow is coming.
I like to swim.
Tom is swimming.
Leave Tom alone.
If you hadn't bought the guitar, I would have bought it.
Tom doesn't know Mary.
What hurts you hurts me too.
Who wrote these books?
Why do you want a car?
You're not following me!
I hope no one sees you.
I'm hungry.
Three days later, Tom died.
Give it to the one who calls you.
Who are you?
Do you want me to open this now?
Take your hat off of us, you little girl: Go dance!
No one understood me.
Take off your clothes!
Drink some tea.

Which French dictionary should I buy?
Will you be ready later?
Did he wash them?
Did you kill Tom?
There he will make his decision on the plot of the novel and the background.
Should I ask you a question that doesn't make sense?
Are you here?
I'm not here to hurt you.
To whom did you give the book?
Go see if anyone can help.
It started to snow.
Tom knows what you're thinking.
Please run!
How long has it been?
I was at your wedding.
I recognize this sound.
I trust you.
We hope it doesn't happen again.
It's true, they were a cat.
Something happened.
Oh, my God, no one has seen you.
No, I don't know your brother.
Tom would cry if Mary went.
We will only hope for good friends.
The truth is telling.
Can you hear at nine?
It will clean up the culture.
Your philosophy of life is different from mine.
Tom visited Mary in Boston in August.
"Bloody wound" is what the elephant calls it.
Where do you live like this?
I can't help you.
She cried.
You deserve it.
You are alone.
I wanted to love Tom.
I can't do this without your help.
Tom is too busy.
I already knew what a joke was... until they asked me.
Tom called you.
I'm not trying to arrest you.
Who are they?
Why don't you do something?
Are you hiding?
There is a lot of heat in Rome.
Take it with you.
Someone was paying.
I invited them to a wedding.
Don't give Tom what he wants.

Do we really have to go backwards?
Get out of here!
Don't give them a hard time.
You know the rules.
I keep singing.
Your hands are covered in blood.
It will snow.

Try to take care of Tom.
Were you there?
It didn't happen!
I was a manager for three years.
I wish him a year of peace and prosperity.
I'm tired of your whistles.
You speak quickly.
A little bit of heat, please.
You are insulting me!
Hurry up!
What did I win?

I can get you something to eat.
You shouldn't wait like that.
You're not crying!
How did you spend your time in Boston?
I forgot all about you.
We are cursing.
What a wind!
I want someone to help me do this.
Put on your coat. It's cold outside.
Get in there, Tom.
I'm drinking milk.
You are part of the problem.
Get away from me!
She always changes her mind.
I don't know how to write.
I know it's Tom's reading.
Open your eyes.
He worked hard.
Open your eyes!
Tom is my secretary.
Like a cloud, I fly over my great country.
Tom came with me to Australia.
After I knocked on all the doors, I fell asleep.
Only Tom will come.
We were slowly moving.

Do what I tell you.
Why don't you want Tom to know?
Tom is always making fun of politics with his friends.

Is that new to you?
Will you do this to me?
Sami was a child who was very fond of acting.
Tom didn't tell me he was married.
I need to buy something to eat.
She passed away.
Someone else was singing.

Go ahead!
For what?
You can change that if you want.
Tom started to get angry with me.
Have you read this?
Be prepared!
Will you have time to eat before the meeting?
Tom lives with his family in Australia.
Go on your own.
They caught him.
Have you reached your goal?

Is anyone sleeping?
Do this!
We are at home.
Whoever is not grown or raised is eaten by what he finds.
Have courage!
Welcome to Canada!
We agreed.
Mr. Sato called but you were gone.
I want someone to talk to.
Come on in!
Put it down.
Are you going to Boston tomorrow?
You are a big girl.
I don't like you on this matter.
Sing for me!
Tom has known Mary since he was a child.
I will not accept your mistakes again.
Have you eaten a pot?
You are crazy, Tom.
We planted flowers.
I haven't even had dinner yet.
They're all crazy.
You have many friends.
Has anyone come?
Please make me acquainted with a beautiful girl.
You can often see Tom swimming.
You are a fool!
Tom said he should spend some money.
Tell me who will help us again.
There was one outside.
Tom is used to not going.
This matter is irrelevant to me.
I think there's something in the box.
You're too smart to say that.
They all shook hands.
Are you awake?
If he tells you to wash, you're fine.
You are too tall!
Tom hated him.
Is that a cat?
She can speak Japanese.
When do I go to Boston?
Come back then!
Where did she go?
Tom went to Mary.
We were hit.
Tom never asked me.
Sami started to realize this.
I think Tom is well.
Someone is reading it now.
We are close to the bottom.
Tom has turned black.
She will.
Sami loved doing that.
The woman is reading.
Is anyone at home?
Tom is a jerk.
Kabylian is a language like any other language.
Oh, my God, no one has seen you do it.
You are a matter.
Why can't we eat here?
He killed the donkey with a bag.
Are you Ukrainians?
There was someone there.
Tom or someone else said that.
They all died.
It's a tough game, isn't it, Tom?
This chicken eats almost everything.
I don't want to get up!
Close the window!
Why don't you pick him up before we get there?
Have you read everything?
The key is to the right!
I can show you how to read.
We are all part of the problem.
I'll be there later.
I didn't expect to read tonight.
Grab your coat!
You can eat a cocktail whenever you want.
Someone is circling.
Tom didn't get the deal right.
Who invited you to the wedding?
So what are you going to talk about?
I don't like her.
I hope Tom is afraid.
Are you married?
Thank you for telling us this.
Who died?
Sami was talking a lot.
She is drinking cold water.
I will stop.
Try this one.
Are these your findings?

I want someone to help me do this.
Go with this.

What are you two?
Tom lied about where he was that day.
Tom is tired.
Find the cat.
Have you had tea?
Is that true?
You are a little bit of a bitch.
What else can you do?
It is not easy because this project requires a lot of money.
You have sent me my god!
Tom doesn't have a ticket.
When I finish my work, I will return.

Who knows?
Something happened.
Red wine, please.
Finish the study.
What's wrong with your sister?
Can you stop screaming?

Eat!
The bottle is red.
Do you like science fiction films?
Have you ever been to Kyoto?
Do you understand or not?
Have you seen this movie?
Stand or die, and they will listen to you until you're completely sober, unless you break your neck.
I can't stay.
Are you new?
I was in the mountain.
Why doesn't anyone trust me?
Please tell me who to stay with.
It's not possible.
You are a doctor.
I will be thirty years old in October.
You can come every day.
At home we call him Tony.
It's not good.
Your problem is that you think you should do something your parents tell you to do.
Sami is gone completely.
Are you waiting for someone?
He is slow in his steps.
Do you think I'm happy?
I was afraid.
When do you want to eat?
I love you very much.
My back hurts a little.
Where is your God now?
Bring me your clothes!
Sami doesn't know what's going on here.
I'm ready.
I think I can count on you.
Believe in yourself.
Prostitution is illegal in many religions.
Please, take this matter.
Go and find someone who can help.
I never thought I'd do that.
He helps us.
Have a good time.
Please read it over the phone.
Is it true that you're going to eat all this?
You're lucky to continue working in a place like this.
Please be gentle.
What?
Kabbalah is your light.
I don't think Tom did it.
Your older sister will greet you.
They're all heavy.
What happened to what we asked for?
I love you for who you are.
Be careful.
Somebody is looking at Tom.
That's it!
He won!
I think I can count on you.
I want to eat now.
If I had told you yes, I would have told you.
See you, Sayoko.
Are you sure that the person you saw was Tom?
Do what you can.
I have nothing to say.
They're yelling at you.
I quit smoking.
Champagne, please.
Who is it?
She laughed.
Rawes is an artistic name, but his real name is Arezki Cebli.
Is there anything you want?
I only know French and English.
The sale of good beer is a business.
Tom defended himself when you tried to do that.
Everyone is changing.

Get up!
It hurts me here.
Let me clean up.
Here is the car.
Can I go home now?
When will we do it?
I think Tom knows him.
I know someone who has spoken to Tom.
Can't we talk about it in the morning?
Look at her.
I feel sorry for Tom.
I'm not tired of writing a book now.
God will protect you.
I was born to love you.
Be brave.
Come early.
I know you.
I was tired.
She didn't expect him to see it.
I've spread your language.
I like her.
Clean your room.

Someone is reading it now.
Mary ran away.
Tom can't cook.
Tom seems small.
We hope you will return to Boston soon.
You are John.
When you have time, read this book.
Women will be married.
Don't think they thought she would get tired of this.
Do you have friends who don't eat rice?
It is the 20th of August.
I like to race.
She is crying.
Get down!
I want someone to help me do this.
Do you know her?
Mary was poor, though she could be wealthy.
You are naked.
Do you think it's helpful to make a moment?
What book are you reading?
You are so beautiful!
Can we see it later?
Tom went to help Mary.
Have you ever played dead-chest with Tom?
Please don't cry.

Have courage!
They want to be rich.
Someone called you.
We don't let anyone burn to the ground.
Have you read "Moby Dick" loudly?
Who is this calling, please?
Stop crying.
Are you afraid?
Have you ever read this book?
Tom didn't do that for that.
Are you foreigners?
Tom said he wanted to do this, but he wouldn't.
I lost my voice.
It's a shame we had Tom working on our son.
When did Tom get back from Boston?
Mary is hiding.
They mocked me at their wedding.
That's true.
Are you German?
We know you lied to Tom.
You are wrong.
Tom is going to be a mess.
Tom can talk about the birds for hours.
Are you singing?
Has the dog returned from Russia or is he still here?
Put a good dictionary next to you.
I understand why Tom did it.
Why isn't Tom helped?
I respect you.
Tom moved to Boston in late October.
Will they speak French?
There was someone staring at Tom.
Jafar turned his back on his sheep.
I am sorry that I cannot learn all the languages of the world.
Gambling is a fool's game.
Please don't leave me.
You are fighting.
That is impossible!

Tom can't wait here alone.
We shouldn't be like this.
The traveler saw a light in the distance and was delighted.
Tom's contract expires on October 20.
Tom is a rock star.
Eat with you as a guest.
I will do my best not to ruin your songs.
When did Tom leave?
It's a good question.
"Do you want to be a millionaire?" "Who's the fool?"
I do this every day.
We had to do something.
I am Irish.
Sami entered the house for lunch.
You are so beautiful!
How did we get to this point?
History has said that they are often seen as dangerous, even if it is never easy.
Slowly.
Tom never talked about you.
I really like playing golf.
Tom will be thirty years old in October.
Why do people lie?
I didn't know Tom had a lot of friends.
You are a fool!
He loves the one who loves him.
Are you new?
What was stolen?
Close your eyes.
Are they good?
Tom wants someone to give him a perspective.
This translation is useless to anyone.
Tom is not.
Tom may know something.
If you just want a good place, there's nothing like a previous attack.
No one answered.

You're going to have your little sister.
I caught three fish this morning.
Tom's room is empty every day.
He was working.
Are you afraid of horror movies?

I know that Tom is a foreigner.
It hasn't even been October yet.
Tom advised me not to buy an old car.
Tom will eat later.
You have to be careful.
What time do you eat at home?
Tom is barking like a dog.
I see that the problem will be solved.
Give it to the person who invited you.
It's a lot of fun, isn't it, Tom?
How are you?
We have to do something.
She is English.
You are our prisoner.
It is raining.
Tom can't go to heaven without light.
You should go home.
I need to talk to someone.
It's over now!
You don't talk to Tom.
With your strength.
Let me know if there are any changes.
Please move forward.
Tom and I think the same thing.
What do they want?
Tom is Mary's husband.
Tom said he would leave the door open.
Are you there?
You'll find a picture of his car in his room.
I was told not to do that.
Tom is a good teacher.
Tom will let Mary do that.
I haven't seen Tom since the Halloween party.
People are afraid of war.
They want to come back.
I love you so much.
Are you talking?

The plant is pollinated by plants.
The soldiers are dead.
Tell them.
Help yourself.

Greet the lovers.
I just want to pay, please.
I don't think like you.

Tom lost.
Help him, please.
Have you tried the chicken?
Someone is watching you.
The girl looks like her mother.
Tom came back in October last year.
We enjoyed these things a lot.
To tell you the truth, I am not a man and a woman.
I want to try something else.
Have you all read it?
Please don't die.
She knew.
You have betrayed your country.
Tom gave Mary something.
Come back ready. I'll show you how to do it.
I haven't been to Boston since October.
Tom has his own cock.
I bought you something to eat.
The test is very effective.
Go and find Tom.
No doubt about it!
Tom tried to hit Mary with a knife.
Tom said he wanted to do it.
Do you think I should do this?
Tom died in Boston at the age of thirty.
Take these.
Tom chose.
Tom seems small.
My dog has a long skirt.
Tom seemed a little drunk when I saw him yesterday.
I went out with a girl who speaks French in high school.
You are Americans.
Tom lost a police officer.
Here we are.
You are my eyeball.
Get the animals out of their prisons.
I'll buy it for you.
Stop apologizing.
I know Tom doesn't want to end up in a situation.
You have translated me!
She went to Boston.
Someone is watching us.
He didn't refuse, he didn't want to.
Tom doesn't know I'm hungry.
Tom will be third on October 20.
I like the park.
I don't think so.
Welcome to the house.
You are beautiful.
Who invited you to the wedding?
Where did you forget your umbrella?
What did you say in her new novel?
The young man is beautiful!
I don't think I need to speak like a native speaker. I just want to be able to talk to a person who is funny.
Yes, two.
You should read this.
Oh, my God, no one sees me that way.
I am dying of darkness.
I can teach you how to sing.
My father is used to walking.
Tom hates Mary.
I am not your servant!
How could a fool like you eat all this?
Have you become a fool?
Thank you for your listening.
Just rent my new car.
Where am I?
They are building.
What paper do you want?
They know where you're wrong.
October is still three months away.
I hope it will always be like this.
See more.
Tom started to weigh.
Stay a while.
You are obviously wrong.
Many houses were destroyed by fire.
Why don't they say anything?
Tom stayed with a few.
I'm afraid we won't arrive early.
My mother's father is my maternal grandfather.
No one knew.
You always stay together.
There was nothing there.
Keep running!
I hope you learned some of your mistakes.
You have to write a novel.
Someone else called you.
I'm up to eight hours a night.
This is Nina, your daughter.
Do you play sports?
You are.
Nothing is wrong with your word.
Are you rich?
Don't forget us!
Are you done?
We finished it.
Above all, be patient and sober.
This is your slave, isn't it?
I was afraid to lose.
Someone has to go first.
Sami got in Layla's car.
I hope you listen to me.
Greetings.
I am on Facebook.
I bought it.
They don't need anything.
Have some.
Tom is angry.
I'm tired of the coughing.
Tom never gave her a coat to anyone else.
Everyone is talking.
Tom knows you lied.
What else?
Did you sleep with them or not?
What can I say!
I'm going to take a bath in October.
You are a mess.
By your strength!
Tom doesn't know I'm here.
"There is no destruction yet", said Titus Livus.
You are the best among them.
You were praying.
It's all clear!
I know you're right.
I'll call you before I go.
I can't go swimming with you today.
She drank a lot of water.
Look at your book.
When someone is in your way, don't bother him.
Why are you crying?
She is reading.
Tom likes Mary.
He's used to getting up early.
His hair grew.
Turn it around.
Tom shot and killed Mary.
You know the way.
What's the problem if I go to Boston with my wife?
He writes in Spanish.
You should ask someone else.
He wasn't a hero.
It's too heavy for me to lift.
Please, it's not good.
The flowers are beautiful!
How can you not know?
The Kabyle people lived in Manitoba even during the Turkish occupation of North Africa.
It seems we should do this.
Listen to me, children!
Stop the noise.
They have a problem.
Cook the apple before eating it.
Tom said he should read French.
Tom is swimming.
They may be sleeping.
We are being told good news at home.
Put your coat down!
I blew something off.
Get out of here!
I want to show you some translated texts for the project.
I don't know him.
Tell her I love you.
Did you hear what they said?
I hope no one saw you.
Mine is more important than yours.
I said what was in my heart.
I like three-pieces of lime.
Turn it off!
I arrived in Boston on October 20.
I'll buy it for you.
Tom was stolen.
Keep running!
Someone will do it.
Go and be late.
This mirror is lowered three times a day.
Tom laughed.
Make it small.
How are you?
Are you thinking of me?
Her eyes are red.
Tom was surprised that Mary didn't do that.
Are you all right?
Tom is angry.
I left my keys in the car!
You're waiting outside.
Does my friend like you?
No one listens.
I feel bad about my hair.
Why doesn't Tom want you here?
The police believe that Tom was stabbed before he cut his throat.
Tom doesn't know what Mary is thinking.
No one remembers.
What is your father's grandmother?
Faith is not a religion. It is a religion that people believe in.
I will not let you go.
As soon as I got home, I went to bed.
These pictures are beautiful.
Can you speak French?
Tom hopes to be in Boston by the end of October.
What are you doing?
Help me.
Tom forgot Mary's phone number.
Did I please you or not?
I speak French better than Tom.
Sami follows me on Snapchat.
I saw someone talking to Tom.
I'm tired of Tom.
We are one of the biggest artists in Japan.
She lied.
Are you sure?
Do not leave the enemy without warning.
Tom is the son of a famous teacher in Boston.
Can we say no?
I bought some new bread.
It's not the people who are the murderers who are the victims.
Why this ridicule?
We are all prisoners.
Are you talking like this now?
She is eating it.
We're not finding it now.
Where did you get this kind of respect?
Do you want me to call him?
I want you to stay in Australia, you who have found the alarm and the alarm.
I hope to see you in October.
I didn't think Tom needed our help.
Tom doesn't know that I know.
It looks good.
Your father has a cold.
Tom was the last to know Mary was a nurse.
Tom lay on the table.
Leave her alone.
That's right.
How I miss you!
Tom knocked on the door again.
Are you guys kittens?
Tom will never change.
Tom ordered someone to eat his food.
He likes to read books.
He went to see her when she was living in London.
Someone is gone.
The cat came back.
How are things going in Australia?
Tom likes to talk about art.
I need you to do something.
Sami didn't talk about Layla.
Let me review what you wrote.
Tom saw her, too.
Leave her alone.
Tom is unmarried.
He was looking for his own.
They understand.
Classes will be held after October 20.
I'm looking forward to having a baby.
I can't see well.
Just shut up.
Good afternoon.
I don't have any money in my pocket.
The heavens are a great wonder to mankind.
They all went.
You have done me wrong.
I hope no one saw you come here.
Oh, my God, no one has seen you come here.
Why didn't we let you do that?
I only have one question.
We don't use drugs as well.
I hope to play guitar.
Grab your hat!
They came with me.
Like Tom and Mary, they don't know how to speak French.
Tom gave Mary a drink.
Read it.
Say hello.
How I hate you!
Someone will pay.
I like to watch Westerns.
Tom hates Mary.
Please keep quiet.
They are pitiful.
Tom has many good ideas.
She worked.
I don't have many friends in Boston.
We have nothing to eat.
Are you ready to go?
Sami went into the store.
Please laugh at her!
I want to travel abroad.
Where do you live now?
Tom said he could come back on October 20.
Run with caution.
Call her if you have any questions.
I'll leave now if I have to.
We're all tired of you.
She may go.
What paper do you need?
Follow Tom!
Oh, my God, no one saw you come here.
Will your father have dinner for you this afternoon?
I left Australia on October 20.
She loves him.
I'm going to go out and get something to eat.
Swear.
The silence of the bell showed me that Tom was doing well.
His father is looking for his apartment.
We must establish laws against discrimination in the workplace, or in the environment, education and culture. This is what our culture and culture is all about.
When will you meet me?
The coronavirus spread by a sudden surge.
Just tell her what she's saying.
That's easy.
I'll go with you.
Are you out of your mind?
Tom was passing in front of Mary.
Just do what I did!
You are wrong.
Tom built a house so fast.
Someone stole my money.
Your writing is scary.
I lied when I said I didn't like Tom.
No one got up.
I will start work on the first of July.
There is much we can do to help these families.
I don't understand anything.
Tom will kill Mary.
Tom took out a card.
Mary's words are easy to understand.
They're yelling at you.
You speak my language.
I'm happy here.
When Tom and I went to Boston, we went after Mary.
Read this book when you have time.
I'll see him tomorrow.
Get the chance to answer me early with words.
Tom is lucky.
What can I say!
Tom asked Mary.
It's a long way.
Try to make him smile.
Are you ready?
Someone is watching us.
You remind me of someone.
Put your bags down.
We want to know you.
Do they all like music?
I was confused.
Let the animals out of their prisons.
Hurry and take off your clothes.
So what do you want?
He got up.
Tom and I despised Mary.
He is good!
They all stayed.
Wait a minute!
Don't you think?
Put your number on.
Hello, what's your name?
Tom and Mary knew they had to do that.
The police are looking for me.
We are close!
Are you a foreigner?
There was a lot of people waiting.
Tom told Mary about the meeting.
Keep your dreams.
I'll show you how it's done.
Tell your friends to say goodbye.
Probably not.
Tom was stunned.
Tom received word that Mary was following him.
It's too late.
She came after Tom.
Read this book.
Tom said he didn't mean to shoot.
They're still stuck with us.
At what time will she be home?
Is anyone hurt?
I hope no one saw you coming here.
Tom is a wimp.
This party is not yours.
You're like the one who built a house with moons and boots.
Everyone knew.
No one wants to be rude.
I brought you some food.
Tom made us sing.
Will you let us go now?
The river is very deep.
Read this book.
I can't take it off like this.
I liked it very much.
I heard what happened.
Sami and Layla have not lived together for six years.
Are you a cross?
Algerian culture is flawed.
I'm looking for rice.
This is my phone.
I can stay in Boston until October.
Do you care what people think of us?
Muhend Belqasem works and I post a Facebook post every Thursday.
Sami is a bad guy.
If you want to go, go now!
We have seen you everywhere.
I think it's a beautiful place.
Tom said he wasn't just talking to you.
You are part of the problem.
Have we met before?
She speaks ten languages.
If you eat it, you will die.
It's a race against time.
That's what we have.
I think I am a fool.
It's a little warm today.
Is that Tom's sister?
Tom is angry.
Tom always thinks about Mary.
Tom isn't worried about you.
What a beautiful dream!
Tom said he never drove a truck.
Has anyone seen anything?
I know Tom is a billionaire.
She is a widow.
That will make you warm.
I hope it is a dream.
You are blinded by love.
You have deceived me!
Who is complaining?
Are you Julius?
Do you have other options?
Tom is not like that.
You'll eat the next one.
Stop screaming.
It is Kabila.
She didn't want to look at him.
Are you human?
All my problems are over.
Oh, my God, no one has seen you come here.
Alice smiled.
Of course, I am not a man and a woman.
Please lock the door.
Save your life!
I don't want to go alone.
The stone told the thief, "I'll cut it". He replied, "What am I going to say to us?"
God will make you like a frog: one will move one.
Someone has to do it.
My son is a man.
Do you mind if I ask a question that is not easy?
Here I am, holding you.
Tom knows.
Have you read?
I lost.
I recently remembered a beautiful poem he wrote about his mother's death.
Open your faces!
They came.
Tom is a better singer than Mary.
Did you learn a lesson or something?
Tom loves to play football.
Sami still has his guitar.
They all love you.
Tom and I can't be right.
Where are you?
Get out of here!
They all sang.
If you translate from your second language into your mother tongue rather than another language, you will be more likely to avoid making mistakes.
Have you done all this?
Let them help you.
Are you helping him?
They didn't ask for help, either, like Tom or Mary.
There is no prosperity where there is no democracy.
The one who wears the broken cloths wears the broken cloths.
Tom and Mary are the same size.
Has anyone died?
No one cares.
Tom beat her up.
Are you lying?
I don't think it will rain tomorrow.
I'm doing the right thing.
Sami read Layla's message.
I want you to get up.
You are willing to pay.
Tom continued the course.
Are you waking up?
Tom liked Mary.
You have to do this job.
I think you did it against your will.
She is learning English.
You know me.
Are you crazy?
They all shook hands.
Tom and Mary are John and Alice.
They are gone.
You need to talk to Tom.
Who ran?
Tom's birthday is on October 20.
She's going to kill him.
A small speed makes a big noise.
Tom is shocked.
I saw a dog.
I am very afraid.
You helped me.
The festival will begin in October.
You also told me who would help us.
I can't leave you here like this.
Sami doesn't know who this mother is.
What is this fruit called?
Please take me home.
I hope no one saw you do it.
I love the way you treat me.
Have you finished your work?
What is the language?
You are a student of the mind.
Is that art?
You'll find someone left him here.
Who are they?
Are you ashamed?
Tom has a lot of good ideas.
Go for it!
Tom and I followed Mary.
Don't eat the hungry. It's easy.
Why does Tom need a knife?
Tom is sleeping.
Come with us!
If you don't want to read, stop.
Did you make it?
I bought a bag of chicken.
We moved there.
Let's dance first.
Please.
Someone has to do something.
They fell.
Are you finished?
Is this guy your friend?
Mary knows that we believe her.
Change your clothes!
We wanted to hear.
Aren't you happy that she's rich?
Look at this and this. What do you see?
Tell me everything you need to know, I don't believe you.
Your philosophy of life is different from mine.
Sami was out that night.
Take this one.
They all are cheerful.
Tom thinks no one has seen him.
What makes your dog eat it?
I am not your love.
Sami went to the game.
Tom moved to Boston in October.
The moon is still bright.
Thank you for calling.
I know one.
Thank you for inviting us to dinner.
Tom waited for his turn.
Tom said he would never smoke again.
You have ruined me!
Kurt Cobain died on April 5, 1994 in Seattle.
I will be back in October.
I have a daughter.
Tom felt uncomfortable.
The king is a soldier.
It's raining well.
I will pay by cheque.
The bus is over.
Can you please call Tom?
Tom bought this for us.
I don't want to go to the party.
I like to read.
Tom was angry and he hated Mary.
Give me a kilo of tomatoes, please.
Take your strength.
Sami felt the matter was close to her heart.
He is a wimp.
You need to eat something.
Are we done yet?
Take me there.
Why did you write this book?
Tom wants Mary.
Stop reading!
There was no one inside.
Say hello to the light.
You can't stop us.
Grandpa who is still in the same old fashioned way is always concerned about how the week is now.
This is for you.
Don't forget to tell Tom to do this today.
He is gone!
Did you know that Zindin Zidan is a captain?
Please feed the dog every day.
I have to go after Tom.
You are a fool to me.
Just let me in.
Are you Canadian?
You're talking about me.
I still visit Tom.
The music will be held until 20 October.
Please.
You are right.
I have to go to Australia next week.
Is there anyone you'd like to read to?
He is gone!
I can kill you.
Are you ready for a sandwich?
Tom told me that he loves you very much.
Clean up everything.
Have a nice tea, please.
I feel good about myself.
Keep the animals out of the frying pan.
They said Tom would be back.
It was nice of you to read me.
Shut up!
Sami and Layla were kissing.
You look like a Japanese.
Go to school!
I am sick.
Sami taught Layla how to play guitar.
He's made your mind up.
I brought you coffee.
Tom was betrayed many times.
Tom brought something to Mary.
She is very alert.
This is happening.
Mary told me she was lucky.
Does Tom care too much about you?
You're fucking with me!
There is no problem.
You are laughing.
We have to go again.
Someone knows something.
I regret that I kissed Tom.
You are smoking.
I just sold my new car.
I am happy.
You have a fever.
We agreed.
Who won?
Read this!
Tom will miss.
I don't know if I have time.
Is the suit you found Tom's?
Sami published his Youth.
She understood it.
Tom said he wanted you to speak French.
There is someone at home.
Tom is involved.
Put them down.
Listen to all of you!
Go through the path you like.
We are all fools.
Just follow him.
Tom looked me in the eye.
She might come.
I need someone to help me.
What does Tom need me for?
You've made me angry!
Will you really send me a Japanese bag?
Sami sees Layla once a year.
Come to us!
You don't have to do that at all.
Somebody is surrounding Tom.
So, how's it going?
He died!
Say goodbye to your friends.
They are going to be all the way to the bed.
I did this without anyone's help.
Stop breaking my head.
Tom never thought he would do that.
Sami doesn't need that.
I can come to your house tomorrow.
I'm not going to swim today.
Your word is meaningless.
Tom seems happy.
I was born in this hospital.
Are you a Quranic?
I need you to do something.
You told me the truth.
Tom has been in Boston since last October.
You have a toothpick in your teeth.
Give it to the person who invited you.
Do you have many friends who don't eat meat?
Do you have time for food?
They hurt everyone.
Tom asked us to be quiet.
She died of thirst.
You didn't tell me anything I didn't know.
Who raised him?
Marie has to start.
It is true.
Leave me alone!
You do not make mistakes.
Bees are making a meal.
I know.
Cut it out!
Have you read them?
We are human.
I saved my life.
They all are fasting.
You came to me right away.
They are very smart.
Call them.
Is Tom joking?
Meet me there.
There must be someone to stop us.
There is someone who is watching Tom.
Stop crying.
Tell him.
I was scared.
Tom was working with Mary.
Tom is a mess.
She was the only one who was drunk at the wedding.
Do you know me? - No, I don't think so.
Tom can understand Mary.
Good luck to everyone.
God is terrible!
I hope Tom leaves me alone.
Your ass is broken, my friend.
Do you know how this works?
Follow your sister's path.
I was worried about him.
I've got them all out.
Tom and Mary are different just as black and white are different.
Tom never forgot how to read or write.
This will make you stronger.
It's your dad Tom.
He was very happy.
Why don't you want to go to Tom's house?
You look nice this afternoon.
Tom is now gone.
Tom died in October.
The work is going fast.
Tom was right about Mary.
We all hate him.
They bought a water bottle.
You were expected to do it yesterday.
What is love?
Is there anything you don't like to eat?
Someone fixed my car.
I haven't read it.
Tom will be angry with us.
The Lebanese woman and her friends have written a book.
Tom already plans to leave early.
Do it now.
Tom left the country on October 20.
How are we going to get British farmers?
She needs to rest.
You've already paid.
Tom said it was hard to do.
I've already written in Kabyle on Tatoeba; a long time ago.
Who were you waiting for to win?
Tom likes to eat.
The dance is popular among Japanese teachers.
The stone told the thief, "I'll cut it". He replied, "What am I going to say to us?"
I'll show you how it's done.
You know Tom tried to do that, didn't he?
You are a fool.
There was water for two days.
Do you have cats?
Tom wanted to help Mary.
Tom is a very confused boy.
Don't you read this book?
You can't speak French, can you?
You are wrong.
She will stay with him.
When is the next flight to Boston?
I hear you don't eat meat.
I have a word.
Tom closed his blog in October.
Did you eat all this?
You're not really a kid.
Are you Americans?
Give me a different one.
I thought you couldn't read.
They have enjoyed your writing very much.
Tom is about to die.
The chicken is dying, and the chicken is hurt by its fever.
Stop them!
Tom only slept for a few hours.
Why are you watching Tom?
You screamed more.
I didn't think Tom would get so tired.
Come whenever you want.
You can use my dictionary.
Tom still wants to go out with you.
Get this right now.
Tom snapped it.
Did you swim yesterday?
Start here!
When was the last time you went to Boston?
Tom told her that he wrote the poem two years later.
He's been here a while.
I'm afraid of you.
Have you read this?
I was sleeping.
You are afraid.
You can go home now.
You are a dog.
Some children are swimming in the river.
How many sandwiches are left?
Thank you all.
Tom is alone.
You've been very disappointing to me for being here.
One went to his friend's house; when he came back, the girl was hugged. Her mother smiled and said to her: "Is it true, it's all right?" He replied: "Oh, I just ate the pot, I said yes!" "Lessons, then... Your father will be happy, anyway!"
There was a snail eating.
What a person does, whether as an artist, musician, artist, or whatever, always comes out as self-righteousness.
Good afternoon.
I like to walk.
Where is your grandmother?
Why don't you pay attention to what the teacher says?
How do you want your eggs?
Tom said he wanted to be buried in Australia.
There is a piano in the room.
How I got wet in the snow when I was a kid.
Tom and I are now married.
Someone stole my food.
You are driving.
What are you looking for, man?
Els.
What is your room number?
I told the truth.
Do you have any friends?
Tom doesn't love me anymore.
Tom is better than Mary in singing.
I'd say you love your job.
These notebooks are not mine.
I made you coffee.
Tom was fired from his job in October.
The room is full of noise.
Clean your room.
Why don't you go and see Tom?
Tom told me that he loved me.
Your philosophy of life is different from mine.
I am an old friend of Tom's father.
You're surprised by this, aren't you?
Has there been no change?
The game is too long.
The snow hasn't stopped since early in the morning.
Freedom comes with forgiveness.
Richard Dawkins is a very good writer.
Where is your God now?
Are you serious or not?
I wrote you a note.
They all danced.
Did you use it?
This is their last film.
You're a little shy.
Are you hungry?
Tom doesn't know how to explain it exactly.
Can I go home now?
You are lying.
You have nothing to gain by being a hypocrite.
Tom insisted that he would not come.
So poetry is medicine.
Go ahead and do it again.
Sami started with this man.
Go to the toilet!
What do you like better, meat or fish?
Get out of here.
I brought you lunch today.
Tom won't be back until October.
Can you be a door for me?
Someone came near the door.
Tom wanted to forget Mary.
Tom ran over to see what was going on.
Here you are!
You don't have any real pain.
He can do that.
They sing.
I'm afraid it's going to rain this afternoon.
She has kept her word.
The computer is down.
If you have any problems, call.
They are dead.
Are you at home?
I want to look rich.
You have sold me my god!
How I miss you!
We are waiting for guests this afternoon.
We both hated her.
Don't forget the first day.
I speak French.
I'm not telling anyone, don't worry.
Someone stole my passport.
Will you be coming to Montreal this weekend?
Who is he?
I will come to help you.
You're welcome to continue working in a place like this.
It is a crime.
Two for one, two for one.
Tom is heartbroken by the stigma of the gangrene.
It seemed to me that Tom had put me between his eyes.
This matter is irrelevant to me.
Snow is making a difference in the environment.
They kissed her.
He's going to be all right!
I forgot already.
Someone has to stop you.
Tom was afraid of Mary.
Sami is checking my things.
You should be with Tom.
Write it in French.
Something happened.
Stay down.
He spoke quietly.
Tom doesn't like to wait until they find her to do something.
I talked to Tom.
Tom was killed.
Remember that!
Please don't die.
Tom will be third on October 20.
Sami is a very good man.
Are you listening to me now?
Breathe!
You didn't listen to the birds.
I think Tom has courage.
You have a very beautiful smile.
Who is this book for?
I'm pretty sure Tom loves Mary.
Call her.
This car is new.
Your day has come!
They're yelling at you.
Look ahead.
What happened then?
She stopped talking.
I want you to stay with Tom.
The child was suffering from diarrhea and was being closely watched by doctors.
What does he say?
Say what you want, I don't believe you.
There is no life without water.
How beautiful you are.
Have you won?
We love to learn music.
Get out of here!
My father doesn't know her.
People speak French here.
Get a weapon.
Tom hopes to return from here by the end of October.
Can you leave the door open?
The devil!
Be careful how you walk.
Tom is a professional, isn't he?
You were laughing.
Somebody told Tom something.
I hope no one has seen you come here.
He speaks English well.
Tom is completely out of his mind.
We are all cats.
Are you crying?
Thank you for your thought.
Is it wine?
Watch yourself.
We need to think about the worst that can happen.
Are you rich?
Tom fell asleep.
I went to school with him.
I want you to work with them.
Spread it.
You lied to me!
Tom and Mary went to her house.
He's a good writer.
Where is your head?
Tom asked for a big carpet.
She is blind.
I close my eyes.
There's no one inside.
I feel lonely these days.
I wish you light and flowers with a smile.
He was proud of me.
I'll bet that's not true.
Stay with me.
Which group do you all like?
He was drunk.
So what?
I will dream of you.
Give examples.
We can be seen by anyone.
What do you give your baby to eat?
Look at what you're eating.
We read English.
I'm tired.
My computer is down.
Just take me home.
You'll let me go, or I'll say the oil!
Look closely!
She laughs at the same kind of lies.
Tom and I want to leave.
Thank you for your kindness.
Get on his side.
Tom said no one was there.
She got up.
He's home today.
Please read it again.
Do you mind if I ask a question that is not easy?
Tom started talking.
Can you please wait a minute?
Let me remind you of one thing.
I probably won't try to do that again.
Can you help me?
Can you wait now?
I'll tell you a secret.
I can teach you how to read.
You're too self-deprecating!
Somebody has to do something.
Tom is preparing for the wedding.
Sami did not receive the last message.
Are you here?
Take a break if you've spoken to me before.
The poor think they are the only ones who are right.
Have you read this?
I'll read you on Monday.
No, I don't know your brother.
I'm not running.
What's going on now?
Is this it?
Are you laughing at me?
I'm not washing your car.
I was born in Boston.
Dinner is ready.
I released the animals from their prisons.
I must know them.
Would you like a drink?
You are all happy.
If you ask me, it's just a waste of time.
Tom told Mary to do that.
He who fights can lose, but he who does not fight already loses.
We are Americans.
Someone is here.
You're welcome to this.
You keep fighting.
It is snowing.
Are you going to read today?
You refuse to pay.
Did he wash it?
I haven't said anything yet.
We were friends.
I wrote you a letter.
I'll meet you downstairs.
There is a word.
Someone is watching you.
Look ahead.
I love reading books.
I'm glad you won.
It's a good day.
How much do you need?
Come back to us!
I like to walk.
Tom and I were real friends.
Surf me. Where are the eggs?
Stay inside.
Tom comes to Boston every weekend to see Mary.
Tom did a good job.
Are you ashamed?
Tom put his feet on the ground.
Thank you very much.
You can't go in like that.
How beautiful you are!
They were looking for me.
I just want to get married.
I like to race.
Write it in French.
Will you do this for me?
I heard Tom's call.
Tom lives by the beach, but he doesn't know how to swim.
I don't know how much he'll drink.
Make another noise.
Your desire is not over.
My friend doesn't know.
Are you not from here?
Is there anyone waiting?
Tom is being watched by someone.
Tom went to Mary.
Please read this book.
We will wait for you here.
Tom is angry.
Tom doesn't understand very well.
I said the truth.
Do you have a dog?
Are you working?
Are you looking for food?
Stop the other one!
Tom can't trust Mary.
Someone should have seen you.
We read.
The case is closed!
Everyone has fooled you.
Give me a word.
Tom takes off his clothes.
We have to save him from there.
We'll sell the other one.
You obviously eat too much.
I'm waiting to find another plan.
How much chocolate have you eaten?
How is Tom?
This has to stop.
Tom is sick.
Did Tom get hit by anyone?
Tom was interested in Mary.
What are you all afraid of?
I've already had one.
Get some food.
Which writer do you like?
The dog is a dog.
Are you waiting for Tom?
I wish them a year of peace and prosperity.
She stopped talking.
He nodded again.
You are lucky.
You can change that if you want.
Stop trusting me.
Tom only wanted a cup of tea.
Try to seduce Tom.
Forgive me!
How much I miss you!
You just have to call Jean.
I think you are wrong.
Stop screaming!
You have to tell someone else.
Tom hated Mary.
Have you read this?
I am very pleased with your invitations.
I hurt Tom.
I hope nothing happened to him.
Follow your path.
A word like "family" has three meanings.
You are in Boston.
I'll call you tomorrow night.
I have something to give you.
Do two things.
He likes to be quiet.
Tom can rest as he pleases.
Sami was reading a message to Layla.
His shoe was a scarf.
I know I can count on you.
Who are you?
Shut up Tom!
Welcome to Canada!
A bird only passes by once.
They live there.
Someone was talking.
I should have been there early.
I will come to help you.
They're all out there.
You should be so attentive to this.
Leave her alone.
Did you eat well?
You are monsters.
I know you're here, Tom.
She hides her secret.
Why are you afraid?
It's not hard to do.
Help me with Tom.
What are you going to do?
If you change, you will be notified of the next meeting.
Watch your step.
Someone is wrong.
I didn't put your foot on a stick.
Two beers, please.
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
I hate to see you.
Stop laughing.
I have to buy something to eat.
Tom will also attend the wedding.
I went to my room.
Tom did not return.
Do you remember?
Be careful not to fight.
Tom always wants to go out with you.
Talk to me!
Tom wants Mary.
Tom is a painter.
Tom is tired.
I haven't seen Tom in three days.
Are you brothers?
I'm tired of talking.
I don't love you anymore.
You don't spend a lot of money on Tom.
I want to know who will come with us.
The senior officers met the dreaded rock.
Have you ever been up?
Tom was living with his parents in Australia.
She sent me a new one, didn't she?
Where is your aunt?
Someone is harassing you.
Show me your real face.
He is good.
I was in his room.
Keep fishing.
Tom is angry.
You'll have my car.
Tom bathed in cold water.
He was terrified, and his attacks continued.
What do they call you?
Have you read everything?
Sami spoke with his hands.
I believe everything they tell us.
Tom has told us a lot about you.
Tom just kept quiet.
Tom is all mine.
Will you leave me?
Are you brushing your teeth?
I think he is crazy.
Do you want eggs?
Please do not forget to say hello to your family.
Tom didn't leave Mary.
Can I see what's in it, please?
Do you like dogs?
Stay away from that place.
The ground was filled with blood.
I know I can count on you.
He is a captain.
Tom can't go today.
Where will we eat?
Your day will come.
Mr. White was appointed director.
You are too tall for him.
You are moving fast.
They are funny.
He has to do something else.
What is your philosophy?
Get your coat. It's cold outside.
Who is running my computer?
You are witnesses.
I really love you.
You will be encouraged to work.
I don't want to leave you here alone.
It is easier for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God than for a fool to go through the eye of a needle.
Tom didn't go to the school Mary went to.
Tom has no choice but to sit down.
Brush your teeth before you brush!
Find me!
Please hold it.
Tom is motivated to go alone.
I am starting a new life.
The meeting took place on 20 October 2013.
Aren't you hungry?
I think it is a beautiful park.
I need to know something.
Were you a crusader?
Tom reads carefully.
Please give me your car.
Did they release them?
She sat there in silence.
She deserves to do it.
Are you Swedish?
I live in Australia.
I think Tom is a genius.
You are crying.
Can you speak English?
I've been in Boston for three weeks.
He doesn't talk about it.
I just need some help.
The dead girl is a disgrace.
The car stopped.
Choose carefully.
Tom was released from prison in October.
I know about that.
I understand your reasons.
Why are you crying?
We want to know you.
You should eat.
They are wearing flowers and flowers.
They were all sick.
Have you ever read it?
Do you want me to come with you?
I never saw him again.
Is Tom from Australia?
Have you ever ridden a bicycle to school?
Tom must have been up to something.
Stop the noise!
Don't cry.
Is he the son of Japu?
This meeting was good.
When will you consider me your friend?
Will anyone help me?
What do you want from Tom?
Call her on the phone.
How long was she?
How old were you when you moved to Boston.
I hope no one saw you coming here.
What is Tom upset about?
Are you well?
Come and eat now.
I don't know if I love you (you, you, you).
Have some luck!
We left on the 20th of August.
I told her you would recognize Tom.
Call her by her name.
You were on time.
Don't worry about me.
I did this.
Tom and the other students prayed for rain.
They all love you.
Tom is not our son.
He found you lying.
Someone has to stop you.
It is the 20th of August.
Tom was the one who told me the story.
Are you ready?
Put paper in the bag.
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
Tom told me he saw someone who gave Mary a coat.
Stop crying!
I was a little out of luck.
You are taller than me.
My mother made me a new dress.
Are you lucky?
I'm out of my mind.
They know the truth.
I hope you're ready.
I read ten books this month.
I know that I forgot something.
We built it.
Tom shook his hand.
Did you hear anything?
She cleans well.
They were surprised.
Did Moses really hear God speak?
You are dead.
No one is helping us.
Go now.
You eat a lot.
Grab your coat!
You're wearing this.
Tom thinks better than everyone else.
We're getting married in October.
Tom called me.
You should eat.
Tom is not dead.
Someone was killed.
His idea is better than yours.
Does he have a sister?
Don't get close.
Watch your ears.
Is there a bath outside?
Please be close.
You look like you like this.
I've been thinking about this all day.
He is a mess.
Are you from Tibet?
Get up, get up!
She is walking.
I haven't studied French in over thirteen years.
You shouldn't call at this hour.
Do you live here?
Do you know what you did?
I trust you.
Look at your book.
Why don't you sit down? The place is empty.
They look very much like me.
Stop the student!
This place is crowded.
Have you eaten your meals?
Go slowly.
My life is in your hands.
The training will begin on October 20.
Do you still eat meat?
Just talk to them.
They all spoke French.
I miss you so much.
Tom tried to beat Mary.
Tom told me you didn't rape.
I am your father.
What do these people do?
If you had listened to me, this would not have happened.
Put me in arms.
What's new?
Are you tired?
Look at this.
It's too much!
So why are you here?
Tom was nearly lost.
No one knows what tomorrow will be.
I couldn't have done this without your help.
I love life.
Have you seen anyone here?
What plan have we prepared?
There are demons.
You told the dog to stay, didn't you?
Reading and writing in Kabyle became our standard.
You are a liar.
The time is very difficult.
You seem to be in a hurry.
Like Tom and Mary, they don't speak French well.
I'm going to ask for some more vegetables.
There was one that deserved it.
They all danced.
I want red wine, please.
He's finished with it.
Tom can't eat for himself.
Tom wanted help from us.
I was in my sleep.
I sold computers.
Lying can be very different in languages.
I'm going to Boston with Tom and Mary.
I don't like Tom like that.
They were all wrong.
Do you need some help, friend?
Three brothers.
They are tired.
I'm not your friend.
Tom can show Mary.
Tom is a lawyer.
Tom said he wanted to know French.
You can withdraw your money if you want.
They left early.
Keep listening!
Tom was being raised by Mary.
Mary woke up.
Are you home?
Tell me when you can call me.
I love you for who you are.
Excuse me, who are you?
Are you crazy?
Anyone can get hurt.
None of these books are useful.
Why are you crying?
Someone is waiting for you.
Tom prefers Mary to play the violin.
Tom is saying he found himself.
He turned them down.
It continues.
You are a liar.
Do you think I will survive?
Tom took off his shirt.
It's not the same as before.
You can eat so much today that you're happy.
Will they come again?
We played for a while.
See you behind you.
I'm here for you.
I don't want to hurt you. I want to help you.
Sami has a lunch break.
Do you think anyone can see me?
I have nothing to say.
It's been an hour since Tom made fun of me on the phone.
You are beautiful.
Tom got angry as he smelled the potatoes.
I was disappointed in Tom.
No one looked.
Tom told me you wouldn't go there alone.
What do you want to do?
Come and see me.
You should read this.
Are you guys nice?
Sami was singing.
Tom and Mary are farmers.
Please buy it.
I don't like eating where people smoke.
I don't think Tom needs help.
Write to me!
You killed me.
He runs.
Have you spoken to your wife?
Why is everyone so afraid?
I'm still in Australia, but I'll be home tomorrow.
Tom opened a beer jar.
I like Australia.
Tell him.
I have to go.
Tom has killed himself.
They stopped.
You are alone.
The children will go back to school tomorrow.
He didn't come in, he didn't come out.
Tom died on 20 October 2013.
Is anyone there?
There is no reason to be ashamed.
Somebody was staring at Tom.
Tom and Mary separated last week.
You'd rather cut your hair.
Who do you think stole your car?
I've been taken with all this information.
I like to read books.
Woe to you, bitch!
Please call if you have any questions.
You are stupid!
I always stay inside the building.
You are a problem.
I called.
Each one for himself.
You are the losers!
I'm going to Boston in October.
Did you eat well?
Stay with me.
His work is better than mine.
She repeats the story.
My beer will be drunk.
Take a shower if you hit me early.
I ate the cookies.
The dish is good.
Have you been drunk?
Does Tom care too much about you?
Is that the end?
Do you think I should do that?
Do you like the cold?
It's a race against time.
I have a fever.
You asked them if they had any.
We have achieved some success.
I was disappointed in their marriage.
Birds eat water.
He bought us to play a game.
I don't think Tom would like Boston.
I didn't know what I was waiting for.
Please turn around.
You are successful.
I'm surprised to see you.
Don't forget your money.
Has everyone heard this?
Things are going bad.
Tom didn't walk much anymore.
Thank you for being a friend.
Why do you wash your hands?
I'll take some very expensive ones.
We both lost it.
Tom told Mary that he planned to stay in Boston until October.
Listen to this!
Do you know when the movie "Star Trek" will start?
Sami got lost in the woods.
I did nothing.
Stay calm and not move.
Use some of your power.
Find another one.
I understand your reasons.
Sami learned his trade.
They're worried about you.
Tom became a fool.
Tom is a good writer.
Don't take him for granted.
He came back at six.
This is a bird.
We went down the stairs.
Tell him tomorrow.
They helped us.
Does Tom work for you too much?
I feel like I'm becoming a shark.
Are you teachers?
I'm afraid we have a problem.
Tom and Mary do this themselves.
Someone opened the door.
Get up on your ass!
I want to go swimming tomorrow.
Tom danced.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to!
He's not there.
Bring me some milk, too.
The moon is already bright.
What a mess!
Could you please wait a minute?
The problem is solved.
Your turn has come!
Do this.
Stop them.
I think you've been mistaken.
They have a lot of money.
Tell me the truth.
I speak Old Greek.
You went to school yesterday.
Do you have a home in Australia?
Tom went to share with Mary.
Tom is a tough guy, isn't he?
Why didn't you read to anyone else?
Someone stole my suitcase.
Someone is watching you.
Tom sent me a message with a note.
Take this.
I think we're all here.
We have not abandoned you.
Was everyone complaining?
Tom is there.
I love French.
I am going.
They fly birds.
Breathe!
Your work is well done.
Tom called Mary to make up for his loss.
Let the water flow.
Sami doesn't like Layla like that.
Tell me about the Turks in Germany.
Tom started the conversation.
I didn't know Tom was dead.
I'm listening to music.
What did you call your dog?
Our dog is black.
Tom is watching.
Who are you talking about?
I have two Canadian friends.
I want to know who read it.
That's it!
It's just a joke.
Tom has been in Australia since October.
Can you find him?
I saw a bear.
Tom was worried.
Would you like to try it?
Yom died on October 20 in Boston.
Stay here.
I thought someone died.
I'm going to Boston in October.
I think Tom and Mary are together.
What did you see in Boston?
We are worried about you.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
A cat, please.
Someone took my place.
You are all clearly wrong.
Let's look at this in detail.
Tom has told us a lot about you.
I don't like to eat pork, so I don't always eat it.
Have you ever been to Kyoto?
Did something happen?
It is a lie.
I found someone to help me do this.
Just talk to them.
Look behind you.
You are a problem.
We were reading.
Please call her.
Are you drinking?
Tom understands French and English, which is why he has a problem with his language.
I know the way.
Somebody will see us.
Are we done yet?
That too!
Are you a Christian?
He refused to believe her.
This is Tom's wife.
To school.
They left for Boston on October 20.
Why did you come to me?
So what?
I don't eat much fruit.
You are my friend, Sami.
He's not wrong! His day will come!
Tom said the word many times.
Are you happy?
He doesn't feed the hungry.
Who will pay for this?
We're here to try something.
I never forgot you.
Are you finished?
I want to marry her, but I haven't made that decision yet.
I'm sure I'll be happy with it.
You are welcome.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
You are all being sent.
The spirit is upon you.
Do you want to be alone for the rest of your life?
Put your books away!
I spoke French.
He is as strong as a horse.
Clean your room.
Who doesn't agree?
My mother is dead.
I like this one. I'll take it.
Stop complaining!
No one was hurt.
Turn left!
I don't want you to understand.
I hope you're happy.
Don't be afraid of mistakes.
We hope you come a lot.
Religion has no future.
He spoke French.
Tom is in Australia.
Sometimes their wife doesn't get another one.
Has anyone died?
Do you have any answers?
Have you read this book?
Tom's room is not very big.
Tom wanted to leave Mary.
Stop laughing.
Get me out of here!
Are you ready?
Oh, I forgot my keys.
Please stay away.
There was someone talking.
Someone has already done it.
Jim kept himself from eating.
Get out of here!
This gift is for you and me.
Tom and Mary danced.
Let me see what you wrote.
Tom may speak French.
They are birds.
I love your son.
Ddayxa is in love with Akli.
No one needs to stop Tom.
Did you arrange the concert that Tom held?
Bless the tears.
Tom is like Mary.
Is it hot?
Please don't die.
They have a lot of money.
The dog has created languages that humans cannot all learn.
Sami's car didn't stop here.
How many Canadians work here?
Please talk a little.
How good!
I can say something.
Hundreds of people eat here every day.
Look behind you.
Do you remember what Tom said?
We are!
Tom seems to be worried.
I don't want to leave you.
We met on October 20 last year.
Will she sing?
I have climbed my father's and grandfather's ass into the deffier!
I heard someone screaming.
Continue writing.
Tom came into my house.
Are you Russian?
I never liked biology.
I am getting tired.
Who swam?
I am not a student.
Get out of here!
I like math.
Why does Tom want me to help him?
Is there anything else here?
It's a tough game, isn't it, Tom?
Tom ate loudly.
Someone tried to kill you.
What time did Tom leave?
Do you write French?
Tom has to stay, he has no other choice.
So what do you want?
I'm glad to be back.
Tom said he wanted to learn French.
How long have you worked with them?
I want you to work with them.
Yesterday, he went to bed early.
I wonder why the song says, "You are a stranger, we make him a thief".
Nothing has changed.
If you need help, call me.
Get ready to scream.
Tom read.
It is difficult to choose between a bribe and a robbery.
You are a dog.
Tom cooked potatoes.
He went back to the Kabab mountains.
They called.
It is beautiful!
Someone wants to get you ready.
Where were you in October?
What happened then?
Tom tried to call Mary.
Did someone call you yesterday?
Not all well.
"I've done everything", Tom said, "but I'm not doing it at all".
He still has no money to pay.
Are you Chinese?
Which do you like better, meat or fish?
Would it be okay if I came to you today?
My parents had just arrived at the station.
Someone stole my suitcase.
Where is your sister?
Are you drinking?
Put it on the ground.
The birds sing.
Why does Tom want to stop?
Help me to work.
I'm going to go swimming tomorrow.
Do you remember anything?
He's already here.
Have you read it yet?
Are you worried about something?
I hear people speaking French in the bus.
There is no god.
Someone has searched my room.
Sami's car didn't start.
Help me out.
I wonder.
Can you stop this?
Someone was missing.
She was sick.
Nothing will change.
I left Australia to dry this and never returned.
Get rid of the problem!
You are crazy.
I need you here.
Someone has to do something.
My life is in your hands.
Do it.
Are you a virgin?
We need someone else.
Listen, please.
Won't you come to me?
Do you like my friend?
There is not enough milk in the bowl.
We won so badly.
I saw some kind of friendship with Tom.
I'll stay home when she comes again.
I am proud of your success.
Is there anyone else you'd like to see?
So, God, the green eggs you have hatched should not have been hatched! He should have hatched like a rabbit!
I don't know Tom very well.
You should go home.
He's not there.
She is now or has been here before.
Children learn by example.
Tom seems very nice.
Are you going to swim this afternoon?
We arrived in Osaka yesterday.
Please don't go and read what this creature is reading!
They were all happy.
I want a lot of money.
Do you know where he was born?
I'm glad to see you too.
What are you reading?
Tom ordered someone to make him eat.
Tom is a liar.
Tom loves to sing.
Have a good time.
I'm finished.
He played.
Tom is lucky Mary is not there with him.
Laundry is my job.
This web site contains a brief introduction in kabyle with easy and easy to read lessons.
I love working on it.
Tom told you to go back to the city where you were born.
You are an American.
Are you all right?
Did anyone hit Tom?
Clean the mirror.
What did you do today?
Tom and I talked about many different things.
What are you doing?
There you go.
We want to play this game.
Why didn't you call me back?
Are they new?
It didn't help.
Go on!
He wants to add a cup of coffee.
He threw a stick in his neck.
Tom will speak.
I seem to have arrived too early.
If you come back soon, your father will be happy.
You'll find someone left it here.
There's someone outside.
Someone may hear you.
Is it true?
Tom hopes to see you in October.
I was hoping you would show me how to do that.
Do you speak Latin?
I think there was someone in the front room.
Please turn around.
Please do not forget to accept the letter.
Are you an artist?
I've spread your language.
I will never forgive you.
Why do you want all this?
Tom always seems to win.
I've already been hit by someone.
She was silent.
Your time has come!
You lied to me.
Mr. West called when you were away.
I haven't changed. You have.
Not at all?
By day, they are screeching; by night they are screaming. What is it, what is it? It's the front of the door.
All the English love it.
How have you been spending your weekend so far?
Tom danced.
Let's dance together.
I worked about a week's work in one afternoon.
Where did the money go?
They all came to me!
I need to talk to someone.
I want someone to talk to.
I'm from Japan.
You are beautiful.
I don't think you should do that.
I miss Tom.
Tom helped Mary.
See you again, Tom.
I can't go swimming with you tomorrow.
You're not the only one who's been fooled by Tom.
Tom turned his attention to Mary.
You can eat now.
You rushed to Tom.
Someone was already here.
What are you doing?
Take this.
It's been a nice day.
Tom is angry with Mary.
Would you like me to read it to you?
Sami likes to do that.
I know we're hungry for this.
There is something different.
She takes medicine every hour.
I hope Tom doesn't tell me to do that.
I will never forget it.
She doesn't laugh at me anymore.
Tom is talking.

Can I?

Why does Tom need my help?
I don't have to say hello to Tom.
You didn't help me.
I'm not eating at home this afternoon.
Look at her.
You are happy.
You still don't like Boston, do you?
He raised his egg and headed straight to the market.
Grab this.
How long are you going to leave?

See you, Ian.
Don't waste your money.
Stop them.

Get ready!
Are you blind?
Eat whatever you want.
How long will we wait?

It's really bad.
I need someone to talk to.
He said 'ahhh'.
I don't like Tom.
Let me see what you wrote.
Keep laughing.

Tom and I haven't met in a long time.
I hate fighting.
Tom continued the course.
I didn't say Tom wasn't crying.
They all found themselves.
Stalin is dead, and all the Algerians are crying.
What Tom said was meaningless.
Mary wore a wedding dress.
Do you like us better?
Are you German?
Maybe Tom asked him to do that, too.
She kissed me.
Someone is coming.
Tom is the one who said Mary didn't love him.
They have wine.
We can!
Are you dying?
She dies in a hurry.
Wash here.
Do you have any answers?
Tom is angry about Mary.
Do you know anything about your family?
They all slept.

No one knows why.
Will there be people who will be compassionate?

Tom never forgets.
Tom closed the door in anger.
We are a light to the vision.
He wrote her a message.
Do everything.
You know exactly how things happened.
Did anyone ask Tom what he did?
Tom heard.
Look at me!
I heard differently.
This bill was approved last October.
Tom didn't say that sooner.
Tom and Mary were sitting in the back.
Is it Friday?
Keep going.
Drink coffee.
They agreed.
Don't you feel ashamed of yourself?

Coffee is bad for your stomach.
You have to come to the bathroom.
Will anyone feel sorry for me?
I came back to talk to you again.
Someone stole my money.
Did you know Mary before she joined the band?
The room is yours.
Ask around.
I dreamed like I was dead today.
Keep on laughing.

To change the subject.
My parents are Kabyles.
This letter was sent by plane.
My tooth hurt above the left margin.
We learned French.
How do you spend your time in Boston?
Tom is drunk.
We have until October to do that.
Why don't you come back to me?
Tom hasn't seen them since October.
You're going to eat!
Do you have anything hot to drink?
I'm glad you won.
Are you guys knuckles?
Tom was right.
Sami arrived in Egypt.
You seem surprised.
They should meet each other after we've done this and that.
She never bothered me again.
They are white, as bright as snow in the sun.
Tom can wait.
That's not true either.
It's a crime.
I have to tell someone.
I'm here because of you.
Tom heard the rumors of a hunger strike.
Mary never kissed her husband in public.
Look ahead.
Listen to this!

Come in.
Eat.

Shops are closed on Sunday.
Read the article.
I am in Tel Aviv.
I want you to lock the door when you leave.
This is a very small town. It is a reminder of our long life, and it is more than a ghost town!
Thank you for your kindness.
Meet him with Tom.
Give it to Tom!
Let me go!
As soon as you finish eating, brush your teeth.
Don't complain about me.
Are you Japanese?
Give me a shot.
All people have no respect for them.
We're not going to walk after the rain.
Somebody is watching Tom.
Are they new?
Do you understand?
He looks like a wimp.
I'm tired of you.
It is a lie.
I am not your slave.
With his pyjamas at home, Brian sat down to read in the morning.

Do you understand?
Take her home.
Why do you want me to help you?
We were scared.
How are you?

I can't do that to you now.
Enter my room.
I can't tell you the truth.
I asked Tom to forgive me for what I did.

He bought with me.
What a shame!
Leave me alone!
Tom and I were having a good time.
Who ordered a ticket?
How can I find him?
Have you read?
The hardest things have already passed.
I shouldn't have done that.
Turn off the TV.
I have changed.
Do the same thing.
You have killed my god!
I'm a little shy.
I read books.
How many are there?
Are you crazy?
She laughed at her.
Why do you want all this?
I followed her.
Are you eating?
Sami and Layla were neighbors.
Do you have a bicycle?
They will find them.
Tom must have walked.
It will snow to the bottom of the waterways.
People love freedom.
She has no friends.
This needs attention.
Who is this talking?
Ddin is a war hero.
By your strength!
This medicine will cure you.
I like to eat snacks.
He was a mess.
Keep going.
Are you a drunk again?
His shoe was in a bathtub.
Maybe it is better.
Look at something!
You look like you're a businessman.
What time did you get here?
Who is it like?
Tom was dating Mary.
It is expensive.
He knows how to play with conversation.
Call me when you're done.
You are a fool.
Tom wanted to go back to his home in Boston.
Your sister is a fool.
They don't talk about sugar.
Tom died in Boston on 20 October 2013.

I stayed at home.
Someone is watching you.

No one cares who you are.
I've told them all this before.
Will you do this to me?
Stop singing.
I need someone to talk to.
Are you afraid?
You kissed Tom.

Boston was a mess.
I sleep like this in the middle of the night.

Go ahead!

Should I eat this chicken?
No one laughed.
Tom seems to be a completely different person when he speaks French.
Answer my questions.
They are clearing the beach.
I will return to Australia on 20 October.
I hope no one sees you that way.
Say something!
Oh, my God!
Tom and Mary always fight.
Did you learn to play or something?
I was born a second time.
Stop worrying.
Bring us two egg sandwiches, two cups of coffee, three percent apples, please.
I don't want him to feel angry.
I grew up in Australia.
I want to start a family.

They are sorry.
Come on!
I'll call you every morning.
Please read this book.
Can you handle this?
Are you awake?
My brothers!
You can change that if you want.
How long have you been calling them?
Wait a minute.
Try to get Tom to do this.
Eat something!
I hope you don't mind.
Grandpa doesn't know what a witch is.
There must be someone who does it.
I was so shocked when I opened the door!
Oh, my God, no one has seen you come here.
It is raining.
Who wrote these stories?
You are free.
I'm wearing a dress, I'm wearing a dress; how am I supposed to do that, God?
It's not me who's lying. It's you.
Please say hello to your parents.
Where is your key?
They look very much like me.
Marie doesn't like this game.
Does Tom help you in the kitchen?
You feel in the mirror.
Nothing has changed.
Answer him.
Tom spent more money than Mary.
Can you please him?
Are you Japanese?
Swimming at night and in the morning.
Stop apologizing.
What did he say?
Your dreams are not dreamy.
Tom and I were not friends.
Tom hates that we do this.
Tom stood up like a racehorse.
Tom doesn't want to do that to Mary.
Life is good.
Be yourself.
France is my second country.
I can read it.
Please, call Tom in.
How long have you been crying?
Perhaps she'd better come with us.
Sami's friend was proud of you.
I know everything about them.
Get this.
You don't have a heart.
We'll wait for you here.
I am not your servant.
I want to go see a movie.
Open your eyes.
Will you come?
A face that looks like a tikki.
Tom is waiting.
As if Tom knew that Mary had done this.
You are alone.
Can you turn this off?
Is there one you want to read?
Just take me home.
I was bitten by a snake.
Do you know how to swim?
Keep your head up!
I'll ask you something.
Do you speak French?
We know.
I want my language to be fluent in French.
We met a writer.
You can buy and read the right book when you want.
Are you listening?
Does what I say make sense?
Who answered?
Have you seen him?
Someone stole my watch.
Your son is a handsome young man.
I betrayed him.
Let's try something.
I hope no one saw you doing that.
Someone has been singing about the Yuki.
Our parents are not Japanese.
I am not your slave.
Give it to me.
I know Tom is a teacher.
It rained in the water.
He is asleep.
Tom was against Mary.
Tom likes being with Mary.
"There is no destruction yet", said Titus Livus.
Find me Mary.
I want to know.
Tom knows Mary is following him.
Can you prepare the dish?
Everything is fine around you.
Even if I ask a question that is pointless?
Can you take me to see the list, please?
Did you sleep with them or not?
Someone grabbed me in the arm.
I'll give you my car.
Get out of here!
Sami started telling the story.
Tom is always in my thoughts.
Are you talking?
You are a little proud!
Tom may have seen something.
Tom and Mary were drunk.
Don't complain to the bus!
Tom opened the door and told Mary John that he was not home.
Nothing happened.
It's just a little bit of a shock.
Someone is wrong.
I am learning Latin because it is my favorite language.
She heard one.
Tom seems very happy.
Why are you reading that?
I'm drinking a glass of rosé.
What kind of music do you like?
Can you read this?
Tom went to Boston last week.
I'm busy on Monday.
Are you stupid?
Are you German?
I'll find a way.
Tom didn't eat pizza yesterday.
What time do you eat?
Turn left!
Tom is in Boston, but Mary is not.
Someone called the security forces.
Sit in the back.
Can't she hear us?
He seems to be out of control.
Everyone was talking.
Open the door.
That's when I got your letter.
I don't want to eat cigarettes.
Her suitcase is too heavy.
I have something to give you.
What will you drink?
Run again!
Tom is standing.
I can kill you.
Everything went well.
They were sleeping.
You are a liar.
They want to be monsters.
Stop them!
Have you read this book or not yet?
This is your slave, isn't it?
I'll talk about the poems.
Do you see what I want to say?
It's the same as last time.
Do you think I should do that?
We are on Thursday.
Be so blessed.
It's going to snow today.
He is a child in his own right.
Tom is not well.
Tom's face has turned red.
Tom asked who would turn him.
She takes this medicine every four hours.
I am truly very happy to be back in Australia.
Sami knows who he is.
She just wants to have fun.
How beautiful this city is!
Tom doesn't tell the truth every day.
Someone entered the room.
The snow stopped.
I'm very tired of you.
I need to know something.
Tom and I got married.
Stop crying!
Try to get Tom to breathe sooner than that.
She likes Chinese.
Tom knows something.
Could you please wait a minute?
Can I take a picture of you with us?
This is the one you're looking for.
Did my answer sound good?
Time is running out.
Who told you Tom didn't win?
What will Tom do tomorrow?
Tom and Mary got married in October.
Are you yelling at me?
I want a coffee, please.
You don't like Boston yet, do you?
Tom seems to want to go with you.
The farmer came back.
Go home.
He's playing here.
Go and get some sleep.
He is angry, Tom.
Did I ever get to not like Tom?
Are you helping him?
Just talk to them.
I hope no one saw you come here.
I don't understand art.
Please help me!
Try to find out.
We are ready to go.
Please help me.
Are you blind?
I'm ready, are you?
You speak English well.
Why didn't you call Tom to remind him?
She dreams of spring!
This is Mary's husband.
Tom is a writer.
Bring me a cup of coffee, please.
I bought a water bottle.
Mary told Tom that she didn't like her job.
It's a bad life! It's a bad world!
This shop is open on Mondays.
Tom is very awake.
Do you have any other questions to ask?
You can call me tonight.
Only for adults.
You'd better not talk to Tom.
Bring Tom.
We were talking.
What was in the room?
Tom knew something.
I voted for Ken.
Everyone is sleeping.
I can forgive Tom.
Can anyone tell me why Tom is angry?
This is for you.
Take off your sandals.
I have found a place where we can be alone.
I could kill you.
I apologize.
The snow is melting.
He just hit the ground running.
Tom will always love Mary.
Spring has arrived.
No one will believe us.
Be careful.
I was in a hurry to get home.
Tom doesn't want to talk to us.
Someone called you.
Your mother is a vegetarian.
Arise, you who are old, for you have been found naked?
Why don't you tell the truth?
It's a tough game, isn't it, Tom?
It was a bad day.
Say "ah".
Tom passed in front of Mary.
Someone stole my money.
Look at the water!
What a mess, Tom!
You spoke quickly.
I'm not used to working outside.
Don't you have friends, do you?
They all were laughing.
She's been busy since yesterday.
Eventually, the guests left, and you stayed quietly at home.
I could kill you.
We'll go one after another, one after another, and get our rights.
They came to me.
Where does your grandmother live?
Tom let his dogs go.
Tell them I'm here.
You fools!
Are you deaf?
What are you reading?
You swim my ass.
Tom killed a dog with his own weapon.
Is your friend's name?
I shot them.
Children love Halloween.
Is French difficult?
Tom said he wanted to learn French.
Is there anything we can do about it?
That takes a week.
We are teachers.
Tom almost hurt Mary.
His name is Tom.
You are hot.
We had good times in Boston.
You jumped!
Don't look at me.
Tom is happy.
Chuck Norris was born in the house he built.
I have a hard Internet connection.
It's just getting dark.
I'll buy you something to eat.
Get ready for the south.
What time did you get here?
You all sing.
Get up!
Can you pass me the salt, please?
I miss you.
Nothing stays forever. Coffee is dark. Smoke is clear. Time passes with people changing.
You are so smart!
Did you eat a little?
I don't feel hungry at all.
Am I wrong?
Do you like to spend time?
Do you understand?
Tom wants to get back to work.
It's going to rain tonight.
I just got out of school.
I don't like you on this matter.
Are they the best?
Who helped?
Stay up late!
Hello, my name is Tom. What's your name?
Do you want to stay longer?
I plan to stay in Boston until October.
Tom felt himself.
Tom doesn't care who looks at him.
Tom can rest as much as he wants.
Go to the living room!
Change your clothes!
You should know that.
Stay where he lives!
I can't read without a bookshelf.
I don't like to swim in this river.
Are you listening to me now?
Oh, my God, no one knows us.
You don't sleep enough.
We are waiting to help you.
You know Tom loves beer.
I'm glad you were there.
Where are you going today?
You look Japanese.
Tom told me he left his keys at home.
Did you arrest Tom?
No one was a threat.
What are you complaining about, Tom?
Put your clothes down!
I want to try.
I'll tell you how it's done.
My choice of words gives my wife.
If I were you, I would go home and rest well.
I didn't teach your dog.
Tom doesn't seem to eat much.
They were not in doubt.
You are all with him.
Sami got lost and wanted to ask where he was going.
You are laughing.
You all are.
Your parents love me very much.
Are you from Kyoto?
Don't get too high here.
Are you thinking of someone?
Did you ever play with Tom?
I didn't know you didn't know how to do it.
Tom just needs to know this.
No one can stop them!
I love Paris very much.
I wish I could live in Australia.
I have to learn to protect myself.
We hate them all.
Have you ever eaten a snack?
It hadn't been long since he died.
What are you going to do on Halloween?
Stop moving!
This is your slave, isn't it?
When did this start?
She followed him.
Let me explain this to him.
I can't decide for myself whether to walk or stay.
Mary knows exactly what she wants.
Try to get a dog, a cat or a cat.
I know you're here, Tom.
The Ethiopian revolution is the basis of the struggle for freedom and human rights.
I came to see you.
Do you really want to go to Germany?
Sami is sick.
Tom is guarding one.
Tom made something for Mary.
I love you so much.
Even if I ask a question that is pointless?
Where is my computer?
I am not your servant!
Tom can speak French too.
Follow your sister's example.
You know I can't.
I thought I'd talk to you again.
They live outside the city.
Food is here.
Why are you wearing a jacket?
God is.
No one is watching you.
Tom told Mary to sleep.
How do I get to the train station?
I will come to your aid.
You should read this.
Why doesn't anyone believe me?
Whose is this?
I'll buy it for you.
Tom took his brother.
I will be back tomorrow.
We saw them.
Are you hurt?
We have to do something.
You speak German well.
Talk to the other person.
Let me know if there is any change.
They danced.
Stop apologizing.
Who is wrong?
Tom wrote me from Australia.
Tom held his hand when he knocked on the door.
How long are you going to leave?
What can you do for me?
I have another option.
It's work.
Who is talking?
What hurts you hurts me too.
He wants more.
Tom has lost his team.
Thank you, I don't drink coffee.
These are my books.
Tom went around.
Someone has come.
Can't we talk about it in the morning?
No need to smoke!
Come on!
I give you a lot of money every month.
We've got them all covered.
Run home.
She helps him.
Get ready!
I hope no one saw you do it.
Tom was killed by someone.
Tom and Mary shouldn't go to Boston.
Tom bought drinks for everyone in the building.
Why do you want all these?
Tom is not a good writer.
No one can forgive them.
Call me about your job.
Find someone else.
Is he dead?
Who is the author?
You're going to dance!
Tom doesn't like it.
Tom is not very good.
Someone was killed.
I like the macaroni.
Tom wants to be rich with Mary.
So what are you talking about?
Someone took my place.
Sami pulled a spark from his throat.
Do you remember what Tom said?
The time.
Tom married for money.
What did you see?
Tom's brother is a lawyer.
Have you ever driven in Australia?
Tom did not meet Mary.
I know Tom is a comedian.
Is that what you are?
Who is missing?
Your hands are covered in blood.
Is there one?
There is no talk in the window.
Tell him tomorrow.
I heard someone screaming.
Who is sick?
He was getting up early.
Tell me how I can help you.
Tom's pride will now come.
Tom knows what you're thinking.
São Paulo is the largest city in Brazil.
What was your father called?
No one sees him as a hypocrite.
I miss someone.
Tom and Mary had nothing to eat.
He's playing there.
What brings you here?
They all are hungry.
Can you tell me what Tom did?
I want to know who is invited.
Please say hello to your parents.
I'm not afraid of death.
Thank you for your help.
Don't you know how to break it?
She tells him: "Even if I'm cold, I'm cold".
My mother had been crying for two days.
Tom is hiding something.
Divide so that you can control.
Would you like me to tell you what I did this past summer in Boston?
The bank has proposed a negative approach to the future of the business.
Mary built it.
Get up here.
Good afternoon, sir!
Do you have a home in Australia?
You see yourself in the mirror.
He kissed me from the car.
I'm not all Boston.
The heroes of the war were John Lennon.
Don't comply with Tom's request.
One of them was missing.
I don't think Tom will accept that.
How long have you thought you'd go?
Are you talking?
I gave him my car.
You are waking up.
I want more money.
Keep going!
I'm glad to know you.
Someone started the fire.
Sami has made a new friend.
Will anyone find us?
I can run.
Can you see?
They are far away.
If you eat it, you will die.
I want someone to talk to.
Someone else is watching us.
I know you don't have to talk about what happened.
I have not forgotten you at all.
I want you to punish me for everything I said.
You don't like Tom's dog, do you?
Tom, Mary and John are all here.
They ran.
Tom plans to return on October 20.
I heard someone else crying.
Tom hasn't seen Mary since October.
Tom is angry with Mary.
No one went there.
We were both tired.
Can you split my sandwich in two?
I was ashamed.
The dog is dying.
You are beautiful.
Don't move!
I know you're very eager to do that.
Your word is your word.
Have you called him yet?
The one who has suffered the most is the one who has died.
Someone is watching you.
Have you ever been back?
Tom came.
Answer my questions.
You were invited by someone.
Tom told me that he waited thirty minutes.
I'll try again.
The dog said to the dog who had been bitten by him because he was not tired of the pain: "How come, you are old and I am tired".
Tom bought her for Mary.
I was dreaming of them.
I like to swim.
Someone tried to kill you.
Who said that?
He won, I won't repeat it.
This is Tom's idea.
Oh, my God, no one sees you doing this.
A poor country is always on the loose on Wednesdays.
How much do you wear in shoes?
They killed a man.
Just go there.
This girl is pregnant.
I want to hold your hand.
Get out!
Stop the conversation.
This is a job.
Where is the nearest metro station?
I'll be home this afternoon.
We will never stop a student.
This is a gift for you.
Get on your back!
Sami followed Layla when she was her friend.
Tom and Mary's parents are friends.
She won.
I have no other choice.
They didn't come back.
He walks with a horse.
I like this movie.
Read this now.
Snow fell and snow fell.
Get out of your way.
Don't you have a problem?
Beer, please.
I trust you.
Who stopped?
Just let me go.
I work for Tom.
You have killed me!
Sami is fighting a lot.
I never thought I'd wait that long.
Someone else set the fire.
Tom has to go to school.
It's still good up there.
Someone would have seen us.
No one ate the cake.
I am reading.
Did you work better with him?
He doesn't want to go.
Tom said he could cry.
They all danced.
Please call me tonight.
Sami and Farid were in prison together.
We did this on 20 October.
Help Tom to get up.
Tom knows he trusts you.
They are cold.
I was thinking Tom was an artist.
He can speak French.
Take this.
How much do you have?
I'm very busy.
Look at me!
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
It is difficult.
I'm just sorry.
I will be in Australia until 20 October.
Are you going to Copacabana today?
Please.
I saw Tom sitting in his desk, reading a book.
Tell them I'm here.
My new jacket is yellow.
It is not in our hands.
Get out of the way.
You children should be ashamed of yourselves.
Jim looks like his father.
Franz Kafka, in "When Gone", or perhaps Woody Allen, said simply, "Help, long... especially to the end".
How excited I was when I opened the door!
A glass of tea, please.
I'll call you before I come.
I look forward to seeing your Halloween dress.
Can Tom do that, can't he?
Leave it to us.
Tom would have been better off in October last year.
What was your father's attitude?
Sami saw him again.
I want to stay in the middle.
So, is Tom a tough guy?
I'm not a tall woman.
You have to be careful when you cross the border.
Tell him soon.
It's a good day today.
At first my father didn't care.
Can I ask a simple question?
The dream is good for you.
I'll tell you how to do it.
Have you seen the movie or not?
Peace in the world.
I want someone to help me do this.
It is never!
Tom will be going to Boston next month.
Did you go to New York earlier?
This is not happening.
Tom said I couldn't come in.
Do you want white or red crab?
One of them was wearing an umbrella.
Can you stop the noise?
Are you home?
Don't call my back.
What kind of movies do you like to see?
Try this one.
The size is very long.
I have wronged you.
Eat all you want.
Tom is upset.
I was in Boston when the incident happened.
Did you read that?
You're behind Tom.
You'd call it snow.
Make it there.
I think I would like to do that.
You and I love to play.
I wanted to marry Tom.
Men like to eat.
I haven't been there since October.
How did you find me?
Mr. Jones has come to see you.
I like to learn languages.
Everyone doesn't know how to pronounce Tom's name.
She lied.
I think you did this without paying attention.
Can you pass the tea with me, please?
It's Monday.
Tom, Mary, John and Alice were born on 20 March 2013.
Sami broke Laila's house down.
You too.
Read to the others.
Sami had been here for five or six months.
Are you crazy?
Tom and I had lunch.
Someone broke my wallet.
You've got it again.
Clean your room.
They complain about others every day.
Tom came to believe Mary.
She died.
They never said anything about that.
Tom and Mary hoped no one would see them.
"Tom said to you"... "I'm not guilty of what Tom said".
You got up early.
Are you from Tibet?
I know Tom is not dead.
Tom wants to buy books.
You are talking.
For what?
Tom asked for a smile on Mary's face.
I was reading a book.
He told me you had me out.
I want you to come right now.
Shed your tears.
Rima is a student.
How did you get rid of your anger?
Thank you for your thought.
I saw one.
Why are you reading this?
We are talking to Tom.
Can I have it?
There is no hope left.
I know you're hungry for this.
Anza is the sound of a person who is roaming at night, in houses where people are killed or killed deliberately.
Tom may know something.
I make coffee with milk.
I hope no one saw you.
You still don't like Tom, do you?
Tom seems to be telling the truth.
I know you're going to Boston on Tuesday.
I'm wearing my clothes.
Why hasn't he sent me a message?
I love you very much.
Are you so sure you know what needs to be done?
Tom speaks French.
Tom kept crying.
Can you eat?
There's someone there.
How many pounds did you add?
How stupid!
Please, stop.
A red wine, please.
The lion said, "They've seen us sick!"
Someone else has made a mistake.
Tom is not from Australia.
We know you didn't kill Tom.
Tom and Mary left about an hour ago.
I have done a lot of things wrong in my life.
Read it!
Tom understood.
When will you come?
The milk is a cheese.
He is good!
Tom went to Boston to look for work.
You have to honor your father.
We waited for more than two years.
I'm glad to see you, too.
Why did you make fun of us, Tom?
Do Tom and Mary learn French?
Why do you keep all these dogs?
They came after me.
I'm learning French.
These dogs will heal.
You won.
Hurry up!
They're dead!
Excuse me, where are you from?
What do you give your dog to eat?
The song "Isabelle Adjani" is in Kabyle.
Tom grew up in Australia.
I hope Tom doesn't tell me to do that.
Which one do you like best?
Look at this!
Tom met many other artists while in Boston.
Tom drove his car this morning.
I went to a Halloween party dressed as a vampire.
He stayed here for a while.
Leave Tom alone.
Tom wants to call Mary.
I can't see her.
I see the world differently now.
I see a book.
Have you read this?
I don't understand how much you are.
He's already here.
I don't have a sister under me.
Tom and Mary wondered why they were there.
You have two faces.
I studied art history.
Stop there!
Maybe we should tell someone.
He was never ashamed of the man who met him.
I'll write you when I cry.
I'm late.
We know you lied to Tom.
You'll depend on that.
He is good.
How many cats are there in Hend?
Tom couldn't find Mary.
Tom writes wisely.
You asked me!
Tom kissed me.
Did anyone see anything?
Believe me!
You are not tempted.
Can you help me translate this into French?
I want to walk with you.
We stayed until the next class.
Sami called his mother.
Someone is trying to kill me.
Tom started marrying Mary.
Someone stole my bed.
Did he say anything to you about this matter?
Can you help me translate this into French?
Tom is starting.
I'm going to go swimming with you.
Please speak up.
Please come in!
Tom wanted to kiss Mary.
Tom sent you something.
We apologized.
I'm ready to do better than that.
I was learning French when you read it yesterday.
Get out of here now.
She read.
You don't seem to be a genius.
He really fucked my ass.
There is no internet connection.
This car is gone.
You can come in.
Tom helped.
Look at me.
One of them died.
Are you all such a bunch of jokes?
Give it to me.
I need to talk to someone.
I have something to give you.
Someone fed them poison.
Do you wish?
Tom was lost in them.
You didn't come into my room without a ladder.
I am glad to have your letter.
I'll show you how it's done.
If you want to go, go now!
Thank you, I understand so far.
It's a lot of fun, Tom.
You are not Japanese.
If she can, if she can, if she knows.
Stop singing.
Don't wait.
Read it.
Choose your favorite flowers.
Follow me.
One day, someone else will win.
Are you helpful?
Is your food new?
Mary would have helped us if she had been here.
Read it.
Where did I leave my mother and their mother?
Have a good day!
Tom doesn't seem to be good.
Are you tired?
I can't do what I want.
I can't help you.
Sami's friend died.
Why did you buy it?
Please bring me some sugar.
Smoke the milk.
We were waiting for them.
We wrote to them.
Keep going.
I need someone to talk to.
You are moving fast!
We got three shots.
He was afraid of him.
Tom swore to Mary that he hadn't stolen her phone.
I bet you a lot.
Tom never told Mary that he was a criminal.
You are not talking!
Tom is in the seventh heaven.
They did a lot of things to me.
You better not spend a lot of money on this.
It's close!
Where is the safe?
I'll tell them about this one.
Tom knows that Mary is following him.
Hurry up!
This is not Australia.
We have yet to find a suitable solution.
I don't hate the train.
I was sad when I didn't tell Tom the truth.
Yes, please.
He is gone.
Keep working.
You have ruined your country.
Sami drank Layla's beans.
Are you hungry?
I need to talk to someone else.
They're eating.
Tom was doing nothing.
No one was hurt.
Follow my advice.
They all sing.
What else would you like to buy?
I'm not your friend.
I think Tom is ready.
Take some rest.
Tom really loves you.
They want you dead.
I am a Muslim who believes in Jesus. Is there a problem?
You should always have a gun in your hand.
You want to talk to me, don't you?
Be brave with your mother.
I can run.
I know who this book is for.
There are some bumps on the top of the chart.
Have you thought about what to give Tom for his birthday?
You look sweet.
He is quick to move.
Are there any questions?
I told them they wouldn't tell you.
Something is blowing.
Follow your sister's path.
I have worked hard.
Stop looking at me!
Tom's room is clean every day.
Keep singing!
You have turned my back on me!
I will be in Australia until 20 October.
Listen to this!
We can work on this already.
Prepare yourself loudly.
I need to eat now.
I'm not breaking anything.
Tom gave me some books.
I'm sorry you were disappointed.
It's going to rain.
Put them away.
There's someone watching you.
It's a pity you can't come.
Give him a hand.
Tom paid Mary $300.
I don't know who can swim and who can't.
They left yesterday.
Tom said he had never heard Mary sing.
Nothing has changed.
Let him live as he pleases.
Please give me your car.
I did that.
Put it down if you can.
How did they find out about Tom?
My uncle called me every three days.
Tom did not kiss Mary.
Try to get him to calm down.
Do we really have to go back?
The road is clear.
The other day I was alone.
Tom must have bought Mary flowers.
Tom followed Mary to the house.
Tom will be buried on October 20.
Tom won't let you go.
He has everything in his pocket.
Why is the public so excited about movies?
Why won't you listen to me?
I bought an old car.
It hurts!
No one understood me.
Shu Tom!
Are you an artist?
Are you eating?
Tom came.
Tom has come out of his dream.
Nothing happened.
Go where no one knows you.
I don't like big dogs.
Is there anyone you want to know?
I don't use the computer every day.
Tom can steal food.
Play!
I want to be a writer.
Get him out!
Tom tried to resurrect Mary from the dead.
Tom is a hero.
If you don't eat too much, it's better.
I am a captain.
There was one at home.
I am not a student.
Tom said he wanted to quit smoking.
Someone just called.
Tom didn't see him.
What are you waiting for?
I want someone to help me do this.
Tom and his wife left.
The beast is a hero.
I like to watch Westerns.
I can't see enough.
He will come to you tomorrow.
Tom is here.
Are you in Australia?
I hope no one remembers you.
Don't you feel ashamed?
Who are we?
Shut up!
Tom always speaks French to me.
I'm too young to write it.
I know some of the kids.
Do you mind if I take a break?
He didn't expect her to see it.
I don't agree with you on this matter.
Smile, please!
I will pay.
Tom tried to swim across the river.
Are you laughing?
Go home.
He needs magic to become a teacher!
Why did they answer you?
What do they call you?
I'm going to do that today.
All my problems are over.
I sent her home.
I like it.
I heard someone crying.
I want you to close the door when you leave.
Where is Wagadugu?
Someone is watching you.
You don't want Tom to win, do you?
Did you make it up to Tom?
How is your hair?
Why didn't you call Tom to remind him?
Someone told Tom.
Please tell Tom to come in.
They all love you.
Can I ask you a question that is not easy?
According to science, man comes from the brick.
Tom is not a reliable witness.
He didn't stop me from talking.
Tom was met by Mary.
Do something!
The books gave me a prize.
She went to swim in the river.
I think you should read this book.
What are you afraid of?
This one is new.
Can anyone help me?
Someone is watching us.
You're welcome to continue working in a place like this.
Tom is not dead yet.
So, we're going to build a mountain by a mountain.
Somebody read it to Tom.
Who is this neighbor?
I'm going to eat now.
Tom bought me a license.
Tom is angry again.
Give me a different one.
She was a bitch.
You didn't tell me you were going to Australia.
You are talking.
Did they fire them?
I'm with my dog.
I saw someone kissing Tom.
Maybe we should tell someone else.
The youth of today are very difficult.
Please don't be angry with me.
You have been invited.
He doesn't know what to do now.
Do you have any questions?
Get out of here!
Please stay away.
Shut up!
What is it?
I should have been.
Don't eat it.
What do you give your dog to eat?
Tom has until October 20 to vote on her.
I'm out of work.
Take me home.
You should see his film.
You all are.
It's a pain.
Tom was the tallest in his class.
How are they all doing?
She is brilliant.
You may have done this with us.
Eat your own food, John!
Tom doesn't tell the truth every day.
You're just trying to take my shirt off.
I left Australia on October 12.
I wonder how anyone would want to get involved in this.
Tom said he wanted to be buried in Australia.
You're fine if you keep working in a place like this.
My money was stolen.
I know Tom is very busy.
They are gone.
What can you give us, Tom?
I remember doing it again.
I'm late to come.
No one can swim.
I'm watching her.
Drink water.
Will anyone help?
Listen carefully.
That, son, is what is written.
I wonder if Tom has a mountain maple or not.
Tom still wants to go out with you.
Tom said he didn't want to sing.
I like it very much.
You're lucky you cleaned my house.
I wish I could be happy again.
Give me more work while I'm cold.
What did you say in her new novel?
Someone could stop me.
Are you Russian?
Tom said he had never eaten Thai food.
Tom said he had a day off.
Friedrich Nietsche was a German philosopher.
Can you sing?
You are all equal.
When did Tom come?
What did you put in the box?
He became very popular.
I called the police.
You were dancing.
Tom hurt Mary.
This house is small.
We're not ready to ask now.
Get out of here!
Who came up with this idea?
I gave him a snack.
Drink coffee.
I hope you understand.
How did you find me?
I saw that it would solve a problem.
"Where will our Kabila be?" "It will be easy for this one!"
She recorded the computers.
I'm not afraid of anything.
I'm not trying to stop you.
I want to know all you have done.
Did something happen?
I felt something.
Are you sick?
Can you speak clearly, please?
Someone wants to talk to you.
Grab him!
Are you here?
Tom is lying.
Tom and Mary are not in Australia right now.
I am not ashamed of myself as I am of them!
Tom said he wasn't alone.
This water is too much.
Thank you!
There is someone watching over Tom.
I love the light of cups.
Do you like Italian?
Have you got your letters?
I don't love you anymore.
I saw a dog.
What did they call this fruit?
What is my child?
I won't forget that at all.
I just hope no one has seen you come here.
I'm sorry...
When did you start doing this?
I'm going to stop working.
He is dead.
Tom said I have to speak French.
He can't finish his dinner.
You went back.
Tom told me that Mary wasn't pregnant.
Tom wrote a letter to Mary.
I just can't take it anymore.
Thank you for being sensitive.
A glass of tea, please.
Do you speak French?
Let me know if anything changes.
Keep an eye on me!
Have you seen Tom or not yet?
They're playing football tomorrow.
This is John.
How strong you are!
Tom is angry.
Go ahead!
Word two is the cause of something unforeseen.
You don't like Tom's dog, do you?
Monday comes after Sunday.
You will be in Boston in October.
Do you see the smile?
Will you remember me?
You are right.
You speak quickly.
Are you hungry?
Has anyone gone?
I'm going over here.
The man drank to the point of being drunk yesterday.
I'm tired of my job.
Tom loves art.
There was someone around.
You never told me you knew Tom.
Monday comes after Sunday.
I am not your servant!
Why doesn't Tom want to stay?
What's your name on Skype?
Someone broke this hat.
Play!
Go with your feet!
Food is cheap in this restaurant.
I'm almost dead.
I hate to waste.
Shut it up.
You are sick.
You have to write a novel.
The bird is dying.
I was.
Who went with you?
They are as well-known as citizens.
Do this.
Help me out.
You'd rather cut your hair.
Tom bought Mary some cocaine.
We hit a lemon outside.
You are sure you have learned what to do.
I'm going to stay in Australia now.
Tom went home with Mary.
My toilet floor is flat.
You lied.
Tom and Mary are coming back now.
I wonder if I like you very much or if I just love you here.
The city is going to be snowed in.
Give me all the money.
We found him alive.
Where are you?
The one who attacked my wife blinded my eyes.
Someone wants to write a letter.
Did you see his face?
I want you to come.
You'll find another one.
You are a bitch.
I was preparing them.
Have you fooled Tom?
You can drive if you want.
They are joking.
Read it!
I found a knife.
He has to do something else.
I want to eat something.
Tom is used to drinking beer.
It smells bad.
Did you eat anything last night?
Don't leave your shop here.
Tom needs someone to help him.
You are back.
Tom said he had never eaten sushi.
Someone is singing.
Will she come?
There must be someone to stop us.
You were stoned.
I will teach Esperanto in my country.
Someone can see us.
I don't miss Boston at all.
Are these books yours or mine?
Tom didn't think Mary liked him at all.
That's what you need.
Bring me my shoes.
It's over!
Hold that.
Tom just texted me.
Move away slowly.
You can go home now.
He's following me.
I forgot not to eat my dog.
You're a mess in the kitchen.
It's scary!
I live in Yerevan.
There's nothing here.
I know you will find a way to do it.
Tom can swim.
Don't be afraid to dance.
They agreed.
Stop crying!
There was someone watching Tom.
Put your clothes down!
I miss my hand.
Do you go swimming in the winter?
Tom will never forget Mary.
Please do not forget to say hello to your family.
You are lying.
They broke their hand.
Tom missed Mary.
They died.
You can read this book.
I asked him to come with me, and he agreed.
Are you afraid?
I let Tom kiss me.
Let the water flow.
Are you Americans?
You don't know what true love is.
They're worried about you.
Go back and forth.
Get up!
Tom plays the guitar.
The idea of a mosquito is both enjoyable and frightening.
There was someone listening.
Have you seen the new movie?
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
It's far away!
Are you wearing these?
Would anyone catch us?
That's all.
Are you lying?
Tom is thinking.
Business is growing rapidly.
Maybe you should stop.
Did you go to New York early?
Tom said Mary seemed afraid.
She found us.
What do you think, will the speed be better?
Give me some help.
Is there anything that can't be done?
Tom is not as good as his brother.
You look behind you.
Open the box with this key.
I didn't leave her alone.
What is a computer?
Why do you want a horse?
Is he known?
Did you know Mary before she joined the band?
Get to know yourself!
Somebody broke this hat.
No one went there.
Tom and I are just friends.
Are you lying to me?
A book cannot read itself.
Please teach me how to write in French.
I already told Tom I didn't want to do that.
Tom and I will always be friends.
Is it French?
She is sick.
How sweet!
Would you like some food?
I really love you.
You are a fool.
Try to make it better.
One for you for me.
Tom has told me a lot about you.
I'm tired of reading.
How many books have you read?
That's the story.
Tom is angry.
How long?
Someone is singing.
Open your mouth!
How do you spend your time in Boston?
Where did you leave them?
It's a six-second.
Do you need food?
Stay at home.
Tom can't remember where he hid the card.
Be warmed up.
She woke up quietly in the woods.
I can eat when I want.
Tom and I were born on the same day.
Mr. Tanaka is reading when you're not here.
Are your parents still alive?
I just can't sleep.
He is a fool.
They all hurt.
We are talking.
Tom kissed Mary.
I made a big mistake.
Tom was sitting next to Mary.
I'm going to have a little bit of a nightmare.
He knows ten languages.
Sami has never played this game.
Tom built a big house.
Tom thinks he's the best of them all.
I've always been proud of you.
I can't speak another language.
Tom never had a problem with his own humor.
Good luck to everyone.
Tom doesn't know that Mary did it.
He is a boy with many dreams.
Tom is angry.
He just cried.
Why aren't you paying attention?
All the students in the class laughed at Tom's newfound sensibility.
Sami doesn't know how to walk with people.
Call me when you get here.
Why wouldn't Tom ask someone else to do that?
I have plenty of food.
The snow will bring fruit.
Tom has changed.
Tom's face is black.
You're not yet married.
Become yourselves!
The day is coming soon.
Holidays
Your cake is thick.
How have you been spending your weekend so far?
Have another one.
Tom met Mary at a Halloween party.
Get up!
I want to see your sister.
Tom bought it for Mary.
Tom died on 20 October 2013.
Tom has me ready.
Tom fled to Australia.
Can you give me some money?
You're a good writer.
They are in the dark.
Julia is singing.
The key is to the right!
Is anyone there?
Sami was living in a small town.
Tom didn't do what he wanted to do.
Someone saw you.
You are very different from us.
He loves me!
Get back!
The one who plants a tree does not grow.
Mr. Sakaki came to see you.
Tom started the race then.
Is there a problem?
Tom was against this.
Do you watch TV every day?
I like to argue.
Please be gentle.
Can you come?
I will do everything I can.
If you are a man, you must carry your own hair, your own clothes, your own clothes, and your own clothes. If anyone wants to carry your clothes, let him carry his own clothes.
I'm reading the book.
I need you to do something.
Will you leave me?
Tom said he had to spend money.
Get up now.
Tom told me that I was lucky.
You are at home.
You went in them.
So who is it?
Can I have a cup of coffee, please?
Please answer.
This room can accommodate 5,000 people.
The rock cut the road.
Tom's father left his family.
Has anyone come to see you?
Is it a windy day or not?
I didn't think I would wait that long.
I'm lucky to have met you here.
Tom won't go to Boston until October.
Have you ever been back?
Are you crying?
I already told Tom that he should do it.
May I say something?
We may need them.
What is the truth?
Someone else was missing.
Can you make a sandwich for him?
What kind of a man do you see?
Can anyone help me?
I gave him some of the money I had.
Get off of me!
There is someone watching over Tom.
A sheep is a poor cow.
Do you like Italian?
I wish I could see you otherwise.
Go to the fishery.
Look again!
The other side is the other, as the first said.
The house was on fire.
I told Tom why I wasn't there.
Tom looked at Mary.
Today is the second meeting in Tuber.
Tom said he could help us do this.
Which one do you like best?
When did you fly to Boston?
Did Tom tell you why he didn't come to the wedding?
I came alone.
Did Tom tell you why he didn't come to the party?
Are these new?
You are my only hope.
Don't move!
Beware of yourself.
Tom said Mary wasn't very good.
They made French bread.
I never needed that much money.
They waited.
You should be with Tom.
Tom went back to the garden and started from there.
Tom cried out to say he wouldn't come.
I need to talk to someone.
Are you joking?
You're satisfied to continue working in a place like this.
Are you Russian?
I will return to Boston on October 20.
You're too tall for me.
I felt happy.
When did she get her car?
Keep it up.
Tom is crazy.
What was your friend's name?
How did Tom get to Australia?
Tell me who you liked about the movie "Ain't it?"
Tom and I were on the same train.
I love my white dress.
Is there one?
Can you speak French too?
You are running.
Tom is a good writer.
Tom plays the piano every day.
Tom doesn't need to go to school today.
Because you're a girl.

Tom moved to Australia.
Tom is a man of character.
Tom was laughing at Mary.
You're going to dance!
I'm afraid, we have to go if we want to be home before dark.
They are still tracking us.
Be careful!
We all greet you.
You can go home now.
Glory to God.
This is my opinion, not yours.
I'll get you out of there.
Everyone has come from Australia.
They found all the lighting that had a light, so that the light would be turned on after the child.
Someone is eating.
I thought someone died.
What is a day?
No one ever listened.
Who is the one who is crying?
Tom greeted Mary.
Do you want to lose weight?
Tom was hurt.
He told me to arrive early.
You fools!
It took me many hours to do this.
He must be gone by now.
Put the gun down!
Stay here and wait for Tom to come.
Tom is a good man.
Please don't leave me here with Tom.
You don't know who we're going to meet.
Do you remember what Tom said?
Bring me your clothes!
How many days did you stay in Boston?
There was someone outside.
I don't think I like Boston.
My doctor is very patient.
I told Tom why I went to the hospital.
Go and get some sleep.
I like the flowers.
Someone is watching.
I'm glad to see you again.
Naomi moved her bag from one bag to another.
You're getting closer.
I'm a friend of his brother's.

Why did you come to me?
I wish you all the best.
I'm not different.
Is this your book?
We are happy.
They broke up.
Tom is a smoker.
They still have bread. Do you want something?
You're the one who's been blaming me.
Tom's opening for the studio will be on October 20.
The plants plant flowers in the spring.
Someone is wearing his umbrella.
Follow this car.

Don't talk to me about it.
Has anything changed?

Can art change the world?
Tom felt tired.
Tom is riding his horse.
The pigs went straight to the market.
I will never forget the day I met Tom.

What do you want to know about my work?
You are alone.

Please add some milk to my coffee.
He believes everything I say.
She wants it.
When will you eat?
Are you married?
I guess I'm just tired.
Kem is a good student.
Please read it again.
Tom bought drinks for everyone in the building.
Good morning, sweetie.
Go in your own way.
Have you seen your sister?
Did anyone tell him?
I want someone to talk to.
Why are you telling me these nonsense words?
It's better red.
You can take your money back if you want.
You have great courage.
Don't throw on two glasses.
I was about thirty years old when I moved to Boston.
Somebody is waiting for Tom.
Throw this away.
Yes, they did.
I promised myself I would never go back.
What do you see that is wrong?
She may have hurt someone else.
Sami repeated his story.
We need someone.
You are the ones lying. It wasn't me.
The book is expensive.
Where is your son?
Tom is expected to return in October.
Tom was being abused by Mary.
Tom needs someone to help him.
Have you seen the Queen?
This book is not Tom's.
I don't know which one you want to know.
Follow your dreams.
Tom spoke to Mary last night.
There may be other reasons.
Someone stole my food.
Leave me alone!
They all agreed.
Be strong!
My new car just ran out.
It's still hot.
My son went to Japan.
Have you ever spoken to Tom in French?
Will you give this to Tom?
They complain about others every day.
Where is your God now?
Sami started to lose his mind.
Tom loves to race.
The house!
Tom is worried about Mary.
Tom and Mary are not in Australia right now.
He read it to his sister.
God knows.
We talked.
Are you Tom?
No one has hurt you.
Tom likes to sing.
I hope the guard does that now.
Tom might be able to help you on Christmas Day.
My horse is asleep.
You have to eat your food.
All my friends have one.
However, this virus that may have infected the COVID-19 virus, because we did not build on it, has passed through us.
We bought this from Australia.
Just get out.
She looked at the road.
You told them a story.
Can you talk or not?
Do you know anyone by the name of Mr. Green?
Turn around!
Tom bought something from Mary.
No one understood the error of Eomer.
Did you read that?
You found them.
Call me tomorrow.
A flying bird is not capable of flying.
Put it on.
Choose wisely.
Is he white?
Does God really call Muslims to kill non-Muslims?
She has a wedding card for a Greek.
Tom may have seen something.
Who ran?
Tom seems very scared.
Tom is a liar.
Where were you this morning?
Did you get to see it?
Lidia, can you cook some food for Magdalena, Ania, Piotr and Lech?
Tom killed one.
It's not me who's lying. It's you.
Did you get a little wet?
I love art.
I'm not your love.
Be a good man!
I'll serve you some friends who speak German.
Pay attention to your behavior.
I am very pleased with your invitations.
They all spoke Roman.
Get to know each other!
My garden is small.
He found them by the doorknob.
This is not enough.
You came to Tom's door.
She doesn't care.
Peter has a girlfriend.
What were you saying?
Are you from Tibet?
What did you say to Tom?
Tom wore his Halloween dress to school.
They all died.
Is there anyone waiting?
Someone is circling.
The woman said to him, "Leave me alone, forest, I've left you a story".
This goat was born in prisons.
Tom started work on October 20.
We were waiting for them.
Don't read to anyone.
You are talking.
Someone set a fire.
Open your books!
I think I'll start with a beer.
Tom knows that Mary has moved to Boston.
Get your clothes on!
There's nothing in his pocket.
It is empty.
Come by tomorrow.
Thank you very much.
I don't think Tom speaks French every day.
Take care of yourself.
Get up early and you'll find your place.
What are you talking about?
Someone has done it before.
Do it now.
Have you had lunch?
Do you remember what Tom said?
I look forward to seeing your Halloween dress.
I won't break anything.
You are too tall for him.
Thank you for your support.
To learn a language, you must know the complexity of numbers.
He is alive!
Who heard?
Mary and Tom couldn't afford to stay together.
Someone stole my money.
I'm surprised to see you.
She helped him.
Tom is angry.
Stay with me.
Please turn around.
Every morning I tell myself why.
I'm turning off the TV...
She must have done something.
Have you finished your work?
Could you please leave us alone for a minute?
She got up.
His head is full of problems.
He is neither right nor left. I am a bird.
She already knows the answer.
Why do you like him? Why don't you?
Which one is yours?
Where are we going? What did you see?
Where is your nephew?
Tom will kill Mary.
So what!
You need to find a cure.
Leave me alone!
Tom is already on the bus.
You don't seem to be a genius.
Can I go home now?
Tom shaved his head.
When will you come to Algeria?
I heard him talk about his brother when he was a kid.
You lied.
Tom won't believe me at all anymore.
What is considered beautiful in one language may not be so beautiful in another.
Has anyone been hurt?
It's going to snow.
I like to eat outdoors.
Someone stole my passport.
Tom is back.
We found Mary.
Who is the author of this book?
Italian is a beautiful language, which makes music beautiful.
Is this Tom's car?
Tom thinks a lot about Mary.
Are you sure you want to leave without saying goodbye?
Tofu is very similar to sake.
Why would you think that?
Tom invited Mary to join the church of Satan.
Tom is a jerk.
She may be gone.
How do you kiss a girl who is innocent?
Water came from the water.
Do you think I'm happy?
Someone stole my food.
Sami sat in a chair.
Tom and I split up.
Have courage!
I wish I could be alone.
I'm not washing your car.
She's always thought he was beautiful.
You can change that if you want.
He lied to me.
Is Muhammad a true prophet or not?
Who's there?
Have you become crazy?
Tom's happiness did not last long.
Tom lost everything.
Water, please.
I need someone to talk to.
Tom knows how to talk to people.
I was just joking with her.
I don't like playing baseball.
I'll be out of work in October.
They have enough money.
Tell everyone.
Do you have a problem?
Tom is dying.
Tom was seen on October 20 in Boston.
Tom is a good man.
I'm glad to see you again.
It's too cold.
You and I love to play.
I felt like someone was mistaken for me.
She loves him.
I'm sure your father is proud of you.
Someone told Tom the truth.
I can teach you how to swim.
Where did you eat?
Tom has to take it back to the others.
Tom is my true friend.
It was snowing.
Mary was a bitch.
Alice sleeps in her room.
Tom called.
Stop it!
Is this dress good?
He is a liar.
You are.
Is there anyone else here?
Tom fooled Mary.
Call her in your favor.
Sami and Layla were all fighting.
Would you like to read something?
I had a door for Tom.
Is there one you want to read?
Tom is wearing a Halloween dress.
I held her until she got out.
I need to learn how to defend myself.
We all know how to speak French.
He plays the guitar well.
Do you want your wife to speak Spanish?
He bought his sister.
Someone is coming for us.
There's always someone there.
Can you get him to her?
I left you some messages.
Who owns this truck?
I'm up to tomorrow today.
You can't drive.
Someone is doing something here.
You've already paid.
Australia is one of the only countries I've seen last year.
It's really amazing.
Tom sent you something.
Is there anything you want?
Show me your clothes!
Go change your clothes.
Is it already August?
You little pigs!
We are brothers.
Be kind to people.
Please, who can open the door?
I live in Azerbaijan.
What did you do today?
Is that what you're doing?
I'm crazy about you.
My uncle has been cheating on me every three days.
This book is heavy.
Do you think I'm happy?
Are you dead?
Tom said we should wait here.
Leave her to us.
He was sorry that he wasn't tested.
I am very pleased with your invitation.
Tom went to Mary.
Choose one.
Your time has come!
She is talking.
Are you Canadian?
You guys! You never tried to make a mistake! I didn't see!
Mary helped Tom.
No one can beat you!
Some plants are rapidly cooling.
I sing for a few days.
I spend the day by the sea.
You can have what you want.
She came!
Be obedient to your teachers.
Tom is a man of honor.
Everyone should leave their own opinion.
I know Tom's secret.
Are you right?
Art is dead.
Aren't you friends of Tom?
He smiled.
This is for you.
Are you human?
Are you happy with this?
I called for help.
You like to dance.
Tom believes Mary.
It's clear.
A hospital is a hospital for a patient who is sick or ill, and it means that we are awake.
That's what I think.
You'd be surprised what Tom drinks and drinks when he gets out.
Are you waiting for someone?
Are you upset?
Please, forget this matter.
Tom seems busy this morning.
Follow me.
Tom, you're getting a little crazy.
I want you to try this.
Someone stole it from me.
Are you ready to eat it all?
Tom died on 20 October 2013.
Sami nodded again.
Look at that!
Are you going to swim?
Someone stole my food.
She is eating it.
Will you sell your house to Tom?
I love games.
I don't want to tell Tom what happened.
Look out there.
Tom fled to Australia.
Tom's response surprised Mary.
She knows the truth.
I didn't recognize him.
I'll do that too.
Tom was named after Mary.
Is the cheese good?
Come and kill me.
No one sent me a letter.
I have an idea for that.
I can't keep you.
Is he sick or still ill?
Who went with you?
Tom wants to make a lot of money by running.
Nothing has changed.
I need to meet Tom.
He did something.
I'm going to take Tom's place.
Is this paper?
I'm at home.
You can also go home now.
Where did he send you?
Honestly, I don't do what Tom says I'm going to do.
Today, she was a total mess!
Everyone paid for themselves.
Read it again.
Someone went to pay.
Keep writing.
I don't need your dog.
Have children ever eaten?
He cries.
Why do you need a sword?
Tom currently lives in Australia.
I am a nurse.
It's the wind.
Tom and Mary are competing.
Tom is up.
How can you be proud of a man like that?
You're the one who's been blaming me.
Tom is deaf.
Are the Serbs deported to Australia?
Someone will pay.
Tom forgot how beautiful she is.
We need to find someone who can help us.
He got out of the way of the crowd.
He is tired.
She likes to fish.
Somebody is staring at Tom.
I'm tired of buying.
We were both tired.
Spring is coming.
Is there anyone you want to see?
Tom took Mary's car keys because she was drunk.
You can't drink here.
He has a car!
Sami and Layla have been together for years.
Both of them kissed him.
I agreed.
His idea is more than yours.
Go to bed!
I hate computers.
Tom gave Mary a cup of coffee.
It was their idea.
They're worried about Sofia.
Are you finished?
She stopped him.
Where is the answer?
Help us.
Sami never looked at me.
We have a guest.
Whoa! Whoa!
Where did Tom learn French?
He was sitting there reading a book.
There was someone eating.
Can you give me a minute with Tom?
Layla was moving around as a bad kid.
You can't prove anything.
Mary came in.
Don't worry about it!
Tom can't solve a problem on his own.
Sami doesn't know who Layla is.
How many books do you have?
You are right.
Nothing happened.
He is a fool.
Keep reading.
He went to Spain.
We asked for 40 seconds ago.
Where is your son?
Tom complained.
They said nothing.
Someone has a problem.
Shut up in your hope!
You need to eat something.
This is a famine, not a famine.
I read books.
Tom forgot!
You are better than Tom.
I ate it.
Come home.
Ask Alex.
I love to swim.
Protect me!
I will not accept your mistakes again.
Tom went with Mary.
How much can you pay for that?
What are you afraid of?
You are ready to go.
Mary has the same age as Tom.
Wash my room.
I have to do this now.
Let the water flow.
It is spring.
Agatu will die on the 20th of October.
Did you use it?
Dad, give me a little bowl!
You helped us.
I'm surprised to see you.
You said it.
Does Australia have six tropics?
I don't think Tom said it.
Tom took the wind away.
It's old.
I left Australia on 20 October.
Have you eaten your meals?
I see how you read.
Tom is afraid of his father.
Give me a ride!
Hello, this is Nancy.
I went away.
I'm going to Paris tomorrow.
I'll get my clothes off tomorrow.
They don't know how to pronounce Tom's name anyway.
Get out of here!
I'm not used to arriving in Boston in October.
Sami did not stop.
Fear.
You are a matter.
He was very happy.
Has anyone seen anything?
Someone called you.
I need someone to help me.
Be patient, little girl, he will soon be right.
Are you Chinese?
The two met in August in Boston.
Uli Rohde, a beautiful German woman, sings a love song in Kabyle in the Caribbean.
Do you want everything inside?
Someone has to do it.
Latin is a dead language.
Tom just needs to be taught this.
The money is yours.
How do you feel about yourself?
You look sick.
I will do that, of course.
Tom and Mary seem to be close friends.
It is never.
You want to talk to me, don't you?
I have money.
I love her, she loves me.
Sami and Layla finally went to the wedding together.
You are blinded by love.
You are very lucky!
We know.
I know her.
Tom was stolen.
A black cat eats a white cat.
I'm going.
Get your clothes off!
Someone screamed.
She bought a water bottle.
They greeted.
We'll ask him for something else.
Are you feeling well?
Which group do you all like?
Follow the example of your sister.
It's close to my mouth.
You still don't understand.
The food!
I asked Tom to leave right away.
Tom can't reach Mary.
Can you show me a picture, please?
Sami left his guard there.
Are you kidding me?
Is he Japanese?
Do you know anything?
I need you here tomorrow.
Mary is waiting.
Tom seems sad.
Tom is proud of his sister.
It is God.
Tom has returned from Australia.
Tom forgot.
We were talking about Australia.
Tom said he couldn't eat anymore.
He is not a boy.
Someone has done it before.
I don't want to live with you.
I speak a little French.
Tom told Mary that he had escaped.
I have visited many Asian countries.
My garden is small.
I'm going to die for you.
Your work is done with just one penny.
Tom is dead.
Your work is done with just one penny.
By Uber.
These books are not Tom's.
I want to eat with you.
Take some rest.
Give it to whoever you want.
Can you take Tom?
What did your mother say?
Tom's wife is Canadian.
I'm going to eat a banana.
You're not laughing.
Tom wants to marry me.
I didn't sleep until the sun went down.
Tom thinks that one day the crocodile will protect him from the ants.
She knows how to live.
I was very worried in October.
Can you help me, please?
The wind is blowing.
Sami is a very difficult person.
The teacher is in my corner.
Please, I want this book.
I like funny stories.
I am a human being.
Our turn has come!
Can this happen in Australia?
Call Tom.
October is just three months away.
You are happy.
It is a mistake.
Don't mess with me, Tom.
I'm not a fool to be a fool.
I was in your marriage.
What's in it if anyone else sees it?
Whoever is looking to find.
There's nothing you can do to help.
Sami knows his limits.
Just let me see it.
I don't know why I'm laughing.
It looks good.
I am not your servant!
Do you drink too much?
Someone came.
Word, this is emotion, this is the subject.
Are you still in school?
We are all part of the problem.
Someone wants to get you ready.
We will discuss this problem in the third section.
My name is Jack.
You're here to help us.
I hope Tom can't run away.
Tom wants to make a lot of money by helping.
The doors are closed.
I'd better tell him.
If you don't want to do it, you don't have to!
The child was suffering from diarrhea and was being closely watched by doctors.
What a mess!
I like to write texts in my own language.
I hate to work.
Give it to you!
Be careful!
No one can find him.
Don't you have to work tomorrow?
There is no Nobel Prize in mathematics.
Please be a fool!
I want to know all you have done.
Help me fix the garage.
Did you see your table?
Tom said he would leave tomorrow.
I am proud of your success.
I'll see you in October.
He was angry that I had a brother.
I'll pick this place if I break something down.
Be yourself.
I forgot your number.
Are you sleeping?
I am starting a new life.
I've been thinking about you.
I like to eat pizza.
He who can break mountains will be able to break.
Tom was talking about Mary.
No one knows why.
We just finished eating.
Are you laughing?
Don't go!
Be careful.
Someone is living here.
You'll find Tom is crazy.
We did it only once.
I speak French.
You have a fever.
Are you happy this year?
You don't have to worry that much.
Someone called you.
I want to surprise everyone.
Did you find Tom's suit?
Read your book.
See you later, Mom.
Tom said he had a day off.
You bitch!
You are a good student.
Someone broke this dish.
I thought I'd talk to you again.
I'm not alone.
Look for another.
Tom started laughing.
Which writer do you like?
I already know Tom.
Let her go.
He built it.
Do you want to tell him?
Who is this neighbor?
I will try to help you.
No one is listening.
I want to learn Spanish.
Please help me.
No one came.
When am I speaking?
I'll take care of Tom.
Brothers and sisters!
I want a new shirt.
Tom likes good times.
This is from Australia.
Tom stopped smoking.
Somebody needs to stop Tom.
Friendship.
What kind of girls do you like?
Your day has come!
Try to keep Tom in touch.
Why didn't you take her home?
She is angry.
Did you give Tom a birthday present?
Construction should begin in October.
Tom is a little shy sometimes.
Can you hear?
Are you sick?
Learn!
He doesn't talk!
I see you as well.
There is none.
Has anyone ever been involved with a bad person?
The day is getting better.
Do you have rice?
He loves himself.
Tom asked himself why Mary hadn't done that the other time.
Tom is crazy.
Tom gets to know Mary a little bit.
How much bread did you eat?
This boy is clean.
You're a good French teacher.
I think there was someone in the front room.
Finally, the snow is falling.
He refused to believe her.
Who is this neighbor?
You're married to a chicken.
I am very pleased with you.
I need the truth.
This house is very small.
Don't forget your money.
Take your rest days off.
Tom is a hero.
There was one looking.
Keep him down.
It could be true.
Every question has an answer.
Tom will show you how to do it if you ask him.
Stop the car!
How many of us will be there?
A friend of mine called me last night.
Tom ran outside to see what had happened.
I saw someone kissing Tom.
You can read this book.
Tom loves you.
You need to make your move.
Someone is now or has been here before.
Are you here alone?
Close your eyes.
Who said that?
It's good for you.
We served with what we had.
They don't want me to buy them anything to eat.
I haven't said anything yet.
My job is to teach English.
Tell them I'm here.
I think he ate his own cock.
I need someone to help me.
I intend to tell the truth.
Layla heard the noise outside.
When he was young, he would forget Sami.
Do Mary and Tom understand French?
Are you home?
Where did you come from?
Somebody is waiting for Tom.
They will do as I tell them.
I don't want Tom to stay.
Who said that?
Is this the neighborhood?
You are alone.
My wife has a lot of work to do.
I don't have to say anything.
There is no need to smoke.
You have a very beautiful smile.
Do not say anything.
Tom is not like that.
The old man who won't go home?
I want her to be the one to talk to.
I did nothing.
Sami saw the video.
I went to the right.
Remember last year.
Tom bled.
Let's dance.
Someone has to do it.
To your health and better days!
You can have what you need.
Take care of yourself!
I love you very much.
Tom is working on Mary.
This is a gift for both of you.
Just take me home.
I think Tom deserves that.
Tom Jackson is my favorite writer.
I wanted to kill you.
No one knows who killed Tom.
Ask him!
She speaks English.
Tom collects old things.
No one heard the noise.
I'll take this one.
You've already paid.
Tom missed you.
Look at yourself.
I'm afraid he didn't tell Tom the truth.
Mine is bigger than yours.
It's a great car!
I know Tom is a comedian.
Eat all you want.
What sport would you rather play?
Please don't forget to say hello to your family.
Tom was afraid of Mary.
May I ask who you are?
She loves me.
Teachers should explain everything in detail, not just tell students to go home and read their books.
Tom didn't drive his car today.
Who is last?
Are you ready?
Are you humans?
What we don't give up makes us stronger.
Are you a witch?
Most Hollywood movies have a happy ending.
That's all for now.
Who is this truck?
We're almost there.
Has anyone called the security forces?
We need to talk to Tom.
Do you watch TV every day?
We are waiting for guests this afternoon.
Get out of here!
I don't know what to tell Tom.
If we want to, we can, if we don't want to.
I could ask you to go for a walk.
The person who did something will be returned, they said.
Tom is drunk.
The train!
Are you sure?
Have you been drunk?
"Unless we become different, we know who we are", said the pro-American writer Mulud Farrah, who joined the OAS in 1962.
I need someone to help me.
He's going to learn French.
I think it's a beautiful place.
I came here.
I think Tom and Mary are tired.
We didn't hold on to Tom.
How long?
Sami doesn't need that.
The path to our destination is the one to go straight ahead.
I hope Tom is in a good mood.
He didn't help his father.
I hurried home.
Human religion is more open than God's religion.
I have not heard of any complaint.
Don't go!
I don't eat fish that we don't have.
She eats and drinks.
I thought you would recognize Tom.
Stop that.
Leave everything.
I'm not a girl.
Do you like dogs?
Do you like football?
Champagne, please.
I want you to work with them.
Sami didn't like that.
She tried to cheat me on my ass.
Tom and Mary are not friends.
Who are you waiting for?
I want to know who will come with us.
No one should stop you.
Tom cried out for Mary.
I just want to tell you that I love you.
Who is your brother?
Were you here alone?
Sami has known Layla for many years.
Go to the bathroom!
Mine is better than yours.
You can kill the guard.
Beauty is bright.
I don't understand what the teacher said.
I can't believe Tom kissed me.
He spent a few months in Scotland.
I'm going to eat a lot of beer.
We are waiting.
Your day has come!
Why?
There was no idea.
Have you read the book "The Last Spring of Reason" by Tair Yaout?
You fool!
Please, call Tom in.
Will you be in Boston next week again?
Has anyone called you?
She can't love you.
Tom lives in Australia.
Tom spoke many words.
Tom's hair is black.
Don't forget your phone.
It's not a problem at all!
A snake gives you a coat!
Have you seen your sister?
How do I fix the Kabyle typing errors in LibreOffice?
Why are you sitting alone?
The Muslim god only understands Arabic; but one can pray to other gods in the language that suits you.
Your father has a fever.
You need a good wife.
Something was missing.
Show me your car is running.
Some stars began to appear in the night sky.
Add another cookie.
What will you have for lunch?
What happened in Boston?
I know Tom is from Australia.
Call her tomorrow.
He refused to let me sleep.
Why don't you do all this?
Let Tom go.
Tom gave it to Mary.
Mistakes were made.
She must have done something.
He is laughing!
Just talk to them.
I want to see your sister.
What would they know?
I'm going to learn English now.
We'll do it again.
I didn't speak French when I got there.
You're asleep if you keep working in a place like this.
What do you want to eat?
Thank you, that's all there is to it.
Tom is getting married in October.
Don't you know you can solve this problem yourself?
Is there anything you'd like to see?
Sami was trying to get better.
Sami was young.
Both of my parents lived in Boston.
He asked his friend.
The whole room was empty.
Tom couldn't get into Harvard University.
I don't think you spoke to me.
The government was out of control of the people.
Grandpa likes to eat.
I want to see my son.
Tom loves his job.
Sami is not going to be happy.
What did your uncle say?
Open your eyes.
I am a wimp.
Do you understand?
You deafened me!
He knows how to play with words.
I want you to lock the door when you leave.
Close your windows!
He will arrive tonight.
Tom seems tired.
You come to me sometimes, don't you?
He is foolish!
Are you Japanese?
I'm getting close.
How I have cursed you!
I loved her.
Tom is blind.
Can you do more than that?
Tom took his daughter to school.
It's clear!
They were screaming.
Please be gentle.
Start the song.
Tom was born on October 20.
Tell me what to do then.
This is for you.
Mary said that Tom did it.
Did you hear?
Show yourself!
Tom loves us both.
I want to make her happy.
My father is a doctor.
Tom is pissed.
He drove his car north to the station.
He can talk.
You are all well.
Why do you want to cry?
We would have preferred not to.
