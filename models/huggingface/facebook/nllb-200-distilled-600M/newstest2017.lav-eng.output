San Francisco police announced that her death was ruled a homicide and an investigation is currently underway.
Upura's brother Luiss Galicia tells San Francisco raid station ABC KGO, that Frenks had previously worked for a Boston pavāru, but that six months ago he was working at the "Sons & Daughters" restaurant in San Francisco.
A representative of the restaurant Sons & Daughters informs that the news of her death shocked a satire.
"We are a male team, and if he works as a family member, he is very friendly with us", the representative said.
During this difficult time, Franka and I are still together as a family.

"He was in a new apartment with a girl", Luiss tells KGO radio station.
Luiss Galicia claims, by no means, who would want to hurt his younger brother.
He was a lab man with a heart of gold.
"He always polluted his family, paying for his garšīgu maltīti un gatavojot lunch", said Luiss Galicia.
He never wanted to be involved in strides.
He was a tas brazil, who adapted to others.

Jauno doctors strike: calls for a new protest
Representatives of the Jauno doctors are urging their aristocracy to start a protest strīdā for the new contract.
The British Medical Association's (LMA) Yellow Doctors Committee (JAK) is about to ask the government to back the plašākus protest in early September.
JAK considers that the ministers and the public have to agree to the terms of the contract.
In July, a new medical student was offered a contract by the LMA.
The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded 58% of all the candidates who took part in the vote.
In a tweet posted on Thursday evening, JAK board member Elena Makkorta points out that the government continues to remain silent on this issue and therefore the contract offer is not accepted.
She said: "Taking into account that as a result of the JAK vote, the contract offer was fully rejected and a decision was taken to request new formal negotiations to discuss more important issues".
In response to the government's closure, JAK today formally requested the signing of the LMA padomi, to authorize the development of a new contract, which would come into force in September.
As a result of the strikes, young doctors took part in six strikes, including, for the first time in NHS history, a work stoppage.
After the vote, the LMA offered the terms of the contract, as recommended by the BMA, but the LMA resigned the new medical representative, Dr. Johans Malawana.
Before enrolling 54,000 new doctors and medical students, he was a member of the BMA Board of Directors, offering labs and projects.
Following the vote, Health Secretary Jeremy Hants informed that the contract would be concluded with the British media.
Russia un Turkey: Atstumto alliance?
Žests, as a means of ending the crisis.
The leaders of the Russian un-Turkey side of the border said they would announce an economic sanction at the end of the eight-month period.
But Vladimir Putin, who is also the Turkish leader, is reluctant to accept the partnership and Ankara needs it more.
However, the situation was not stable.
Vladimir Putin smaids looked like a samākslots un un neizresīja siltas emociones, not given his previous behavior.
Turpretī redžeps Tajjips Erdogans at least five times nodded to Putin for their "dārgo draugu", a message of peace.
Man is the number one player.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only improve to the pre-crisis level, but would become even stronger.
The next day, a newspaper reported that Erdoğan's own actions would have been unnoticed.
I think her enthusiasms are causing the pretrunny izjutas.
But no Putin's ancient accounts suggest that Russian leaders were not a part of the agenda.
The first time he was competing in his own race, Russian planes were flying near the Syrian border.
This time, Moscow reacted with pity.
Putin accused Ankaru of being a "masculine" and then a "masculine" in Moscow.
The transition was even more painful, considering the work of the friend.
It will be very difficult to maintain loyalty to others, perhaps even if I don't hope so.
Since November, Russia's public nostalgia has changed.
For several months, government-controlled television broadcast aggressive abuses against Ankaru.
Suddenly, like, in the foot of the visa were vain Turks.
The most pressing charges were that the Erdoğan family had lost profits from the illegal oil trade and the Islamic State-controlled part of Syria.
He pats to, of course, the light.
But the main message of the Sanktpēterburgas' founding is that the time for paganism has come to an end.
After all, this meeting only happened because Putin received a response from President Erdogan.
Russia could see it as a victory.
Ankaras advantages are not the result of the obviousness of the situation.
First, Erdogan and his potential friends need to be seen after the unfortunate turn of events last month, in which he was tried by the Gazets.
Also, the terrorist has been used to satirize his positions.
So are economic motives.
Russian sanctions have caused substantial losses, especially the imposition of sanctions, which usually provide several million Russian tourists with the Turkish citizenship every year.
The number of tourists decreased by almost 90%.
Russian tour operators and charter companies are also facilitating the use of the site, as they will update the regular services.
They are taking a break from playing in Vidusjūrā at the end of the season.
As early as this week, state TV predicted a decline in the price of fruits and vegetables, and Turkey's imports of fruits and vegetables would be restored.
Kā citē vietnische laikraksts Vedemosti: "Tūristus viņiem, tomatoes mums".
But the visit also had other political motives on the part of the Maskovas.
Ankara is hostile to the West, as they see it, as a weak reaction to the attempted coup.
The EU also agreed to negotiate a peace agreement with Turkey and with the West, but Putin was willing to take advantage of the situation.
Russia's leaders undoubtedly gained the additional point Ankaras acīs, which is the support of its elected government after an attempted coup.
Note, as the masks understand, that the country's current and deeply entrenched ballets and regimes are changing.
Samits, which took place in this grey piejūras pilī, gave Russia the opportunity to present to Turkey, as was the case with some analytics, "atstumto alliances", two countries, as jutas atstumtas no Westeros, combine forces.
But despite the publicly demonstrated unity, there are still significant differences of opinion between the two countries.
Galvenās nesaskaņas skar Sīriju, where Russia presents itself as a miera nesē, but in fact Russia un Turkey supports the other side.
After more than three hours of initial discussions, not wanting to disclose information, the two presidents announced at a press conference that they had discussed the issue.
The Turkish president deliberately avoided questions about the two-state differences, while President Putin wanted to emphasize them.
There is clear consensus that the Abbasids could find common ground on Syria.
But after months of long hostile relations, a potential disaster was revealed, when NATO member Turkey notrieca the Russian air force, the situation improved, and both leaders at least rescinded the sarunas.
The Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland.
Zīmolam SKB will continue to be a supporting role, the bank's executive directors announced.
The Skotijas SKB will no longer be available.
Ross Makevans tells BBC Scotland that SKB's brands were associated with ambitious banks on a global scale.
She refused to pursue these ambitions, as eight years ago the bank nearly went bankrupt and needed financial assistance.
Experts in trademark strategy have used SKB's trademark to disregard other consumer financial trademarks.
Banka received millions of marks from international sports sponsors, starting with the Six Nations rugby union team and finally the Vimbldonas tennis champion Endiju Mureju.
But now they are not allowed to put forward other national stamps.
The Skotijas Karaliskā Banaka will be available to the customers of Skotijas, but the netiks are initialized.
In England, un Velsā visas SKB references, outside the head office of an official stock exchange, will be designated as NatWest.
The Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland have already issued a series of stamps for The Ulster Bank.
Now, more private financial brands are also being considered, such as Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond, and Holt's Military Bank.
Makevans had interviews with clients during their visit with an employee at Invernesšīru.
He pointed to BBC Scotland's channel: "SKB will become our investor brand and our employees will work, and now we are becoming more of a bank brand".
In time, the bank became a global brand and SKB became a global brand.
Now that we no longer have global ambitions, we have to stop ambitions.
The four of these brands represent a unique brand in their industry and our employees work with clients under these brands.
SKB has already announced that it will not sponsor the "Six Nations" and will participate in various sports sponsorship events.
"It is high time to become a branded bank, and we have already asked ourselves the question, how can we become a bank to our customers?" the executives say.
It would have been very cynical years ago, and we announced that we would become a great bank for our customers and develop these stamps.
But thanks to my focus on customer needs rather than our own, we have obviously made a lot of changes.
We can re-create these seals, so I think now is the time.
Frenkijs Detori scored the 3000th victory, taking first place in the New York City Predilection.
Detori atkorøe won the championship, winning his 3000th victory twice by finishing the first race of the New York Cycling Tour.

The three-time champion of the sport, Jokes Detori, who had earlier won the Ghayyar Circuit, said: "Tas ir kaut kas specials".
I was very upset, and my family and I were here.
I was very helpful, so I took a bag to Newmarket, where I have lived for 30 years.
This great race, called the Karaliska Askot, is a huge one, with a capacity of 20,000 people on Friday evenings.
It is a relief to be very grateful.
After the victory of Detori un Predilection, they were sagaidīti or applaudem un gavilēm.
Two jokers and a record holder in both races and obstacles - champion Richard Johnson and former 20-time champion Sers Antonijs Makkojs, who set several records in his career, with more than 4,300 wins.
Lesters Pigots, the seven-time Derby winner, has 4493 career wins.
Frenkijs came to be known as the greatest modern-day joker, and he had no surprises, as he had achieved successes that only retais could achieve.
He is stylish and strong, but his tactics make him stand out from other jokers.
He is a fantastic representative of the sport, his enthusiasm for the sport has been a huge part of the sport's history for years.
A few weeks ago Epsomas was racing for Frenkijam, who would have won 6,000 races and not only raced during the Christmas week in a major race.
But by running seriously, and patiently, the Frenchmen have been regularly winning United Karalistes races for 30 years.
He is a lively, brilliant British racer, and he excels at jokes.
Frenks Detori noted this achievement as his signature brand.
Not at the speed of the finish line until I decided to go, Frenkijs Detori had been British for twenty years.

Un he could participate in the races for a while longer - Detori in advance and expects, willingly to continue to race at least until age 50.
Russian President Putin has attacked the head of the Russian administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Russian President Vladimir Putin denied the alleged atlaidis of the head of the Russian administration, Sergei Ivanov.
Ivanovs have for many years been attracting Putin's attention to human beings.
Now 63 years old, the politician is elected as a special representative of the United Nations in transportation matters.
The Kremlin's statement points out that Putin "will release Ivanov and the head of the Russian presidential administration from their duties", and there are no reasons.
Ivanova was replaced by amatā iecelts Antons Vaino, who had been her Vietnamese since 2012.
44 years old Vaino is a diplomat.
Vaino was born in 1972 in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute of International Relations (MVSAI) and later worked at the Embassy of Tokyo.
According to the Kremlin website, he later published the Presidential Protocol on the Administration of Government Employees.
After his appointment, he said to Putin: "Paldies for your loyalty".
I think the main job of the administration is to support your work as the national president, developing a likumus and controlling the execution of your decision.
Putin's Friday speech was similar to the Russian raid, with Ivanov's party voting to approve the recommendation of Vaino as his replacement.
What is your opinion?
This solis samulsināja Maskavu.
Sergei Ivanovs and his allies Vladimir Putin, like Putin, are now working for the security service VDK in Padomju.
In this capacity he was one of the most influential men in Russia.
In a televised meeting, the husband announced that Ivanovs would step down and start on his own initiative.
But despite the cameras watching smaidiem, reti and such paskaidrojums convince, especially before parliamentary elections.
Vai tas ir iznākums, which is related to the struggle for varu?
To no one with a name.
But official claims that the virus, which was supposed to be a possible president, suddenly wanted to become the leader of Russia's political life, were met with great skepticism.
In a note published on the Kremlin website, Ivanovs told Putin: "As a matter of fact, at the beginning of 2012, you asked me to entrust this complicated, if I may say, problematic, amatu, four years.
Israādās, I have been working in this job for four years and eight months.
Ivanov's amate was terminated in December 2011.
Previously he was Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and a former VDK National Security Service employee, as is Putin.
At the end of the 1990s, Putin left the Federal Security Service, as the VDK had been in power, Ivanovs took his Vietnamese lover.
Putin's actions were not unusual, and he called Ivanov the most popular.
At the end of Putin's second term, Ivanovs were considered a potential candidate for Russian president, and Putin's re-election to a third term would be unconstitutional.
But then, as president, Putin's allies - Dmitrijs Medvedev - became one of the most powerful.
Putin became prime minister, and after three or four years he resigned as president.

Kynsferijas crostojums: the tilts are now and the links are Faifu.
The 1.35 billion-marillion project is currently scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Engineers have connected the northern part of the Kvīnsferijas krustostuma to a viaduct, meaning tilts now and connections now to Faifu.
The first of the four connecting parts was completed, meaning that the construction of the bridge had to be completed.
The façade tilted construction was 600 meters long and weighed 30,000 tons.
The bag consists of 10,000 tons of steel, 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 support cables.
The 1.35 billion-marillion project is currently scheduled to be completed in May 2017.
Economic Secretary Keits Brauns was today at the construction site and was the first person to climb the bridge.
He said: "This is symbolic of a historical moment when Kvinnsferijas tilta in construction".
In this project we see an unprecedented engineering feat, where only these parts were used in the construction of more than 30,000 tons of cement and steel.
Although the tilting of a viaduct is not a size, the tilting of a viaduct is an extremely delicate process that requires precision.
In the end, more than 79% of the people have already received a last posms, as the United States will receive a visa today, meaning that they will receive visas for the last portion of the time.
Maikls Martins, project director for bridge connections, said: "The first connection is a very important point in any bridge construction".
In this fantastic project, the first connection demonstrates the highest level of engineering.
After the last posma road installation and the connection or support of the north tower, we can connect the north portion of the posma road or the land part of the viaduct.
When the task is completed, the left side of the viaduct is divided into 700 millimetres.
It was a very delicate operation at the same time.
Milzīga, with viaducts and 222 meters of garš, weighs about 6000 tons and needs to be paved with about 3%.
Delicate, pielaide and two-way, or teamwork, was only a few millimeters.
In the end, it was a bit of a break.

She was able to return home to Spring, Texas without a silver medal.

Towards the end of the race, Bailsa defended his championship title, but still had to go.
She set a new record of 15,433 on the ball and cemented her relationship with 15,933 free throws.
Raismane looked at her while she waited for results, which were just formalities and her dreams were fulfilled, as she had once written in her notebook.
Raismanes' result was a four-year-old victory in four consecutive events, when she took third place to Mustafini, but lost the fight for the bronze medal.
This time, the 22-year-old team captain, whom Americans call "the hero", stood out in a convincing battle.

Why do we need Simon, Gabija and Laurija?
Es to saucu par gada Sieviešu Olimpijskie Vieglatlētu Komandu for several reasons.
First, I've been to every Summer Olympics since 1984, and since then, a US team has never been a tick-labe.
Second, in this team there are three vieglatlētes, Simona Bailsa, Gabija Duglasa un Laurija Hernandeza, whose everymeasures are many young girls from the origin.
The people of this team include Alija Raismane, Kur and Jews, and Catholics.
Visbeidzot, this team is not representing America.
It also confirmed the participation of a Latin American athlete in this sport.
For the past four years, she has been the best selling African-American woman.
Last year, Simona un Gabija took first and second place.
Tie and the results are impressive.
In previous Olympic Games, Gabija Duglasa became an Olympic champion, an American lyksmot.
Now the passage has seen the final vengeance, performed by the world champion Simona Bailsa, Duglasa un Laurija Hernandeza, veicot nepieredzētus, bet the most noble vengeance.

After Jeremy Hanta's rejection of the offer, the new doctors plan to strike more strikes.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute, to reach an agreement on changes to the contract with representatives of the British Medical Association, but this was rejected by 58 per cent against 37,000 new doctors who took part in the vote.
In July, Hants announced that the contract had been signed, stating that the NHS was in a volatile state and that the delay was only due to the staff of a patient.
Many new doctors have already signed a new contract, which provides for changes to working conditions overnight and on weekends, in order to improve working conditions during non-standard working hours.
Yesterday, BMA's new physician representative Dr. Elena Makourta announced that new doctors are still seriously surprised by the contract offer, in particular, that the labour crisis will be exacerbated and that equal conditions will not be provided for all doctors.
It is twenty-eight weeks until the first group of new doctors sign a new contract, so progress must be made, and there is much to be done.
BMA officials address the problem of a lack of accountability or the government's unwillingness to engage in occasional cluttering.
Tas noticis despite the fact that even last month Jeremy Hants had been out of the game, and his durvis had always been open.
Jeremy Hantam will take immediate action to stop the unemployment and work with the new doctors.
And he won't, as new doctors and young people are taking part in the protest actions.
During the last strike at the end of April, more than 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 visits were carried out, while the majority of consultants tried to substitute a doctor, who had been turned in a picetā.
The ministers hoped to end the dispute, and to reach an agreement on changes to the agreement with representatives of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants to raise the minimum wage for work weekends to 54,000 new doctors, with whom it will sign new contracts.
The NHS's chief employment officer Daniels Mortimers called for jaunos ārstus nedoties streikos.
Mortimera kungs clear, no strikes nor untraining, but only increasing the pressure on our employees and employees untrauced, stressful advice untracking patients, caregivers and their families.
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the new physicians committee and, together with the Ministry of Health and other institutions, we have answered positively to their questions about whistleblowers and whistleblowers.
Employers, in particular, in active cooperation on such important issues as employee recruitment, flexible training, additional training for them, returning after a career break, training costs, mutual recognition of training programmes, studying for a one-time payment inequality in medicine - show that employers, England's health education institutions and the Ministry of Health are keen to implement the agreement, which was concluded on the BME in November, February and May.
Drugs of 2 markers a day can reduce the risk of heart disease.
Thousands of patients with a heart attack could be treated with drugs at 2 marks a day, and officials recommend using them for more people and longer periods of time.
The prescription drug Ticagrelor is also known to increase the risk of heart attack in people with heart disease.
These medications are already prescribed for use 12 months after heart attack, reducing the risk of recurrent heart attacks.
NHS representative NICE recommended using this preparation four years after heart failure, to further reduce the risk of heart failure in people with heart and blood vessel problems.
However, at present, the NHS has recommended that NICE use this preparation 4 years after heart attack, in order to further reduce the risk of heart and blood vessel attacks.
Every four years, about 140,000 people in England experience a heart attack and a quarter of them experience repeated heart attacks or insults.
A stroke causes a buildup of fat in the heart, forming a series of spasms.
The aizsprostojums then protrude, creating a tube, blocking the flow of blood to the heart and causing a heart attack.
On the other hand, if thrombs are absent from the blood vessels, they must reach further into the bloodstream and prevent blood from reaching the lungs, causing a heart attack.
People who have had a heart attack are at greater risk of having a repeated heart attack.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British firm AstraZeneca, is a brand of tirgo called Brilique, which is similar to the risk of developing a tube.
The NICE guidelines, published today, recommend that people take 90 mg of Ticagrelor for 12 months and another 3 years at 60 mg twice daily along with aspirin.
NICE's director of health technology, Professor Kerola Longsona, explains: "Despite the availability of medicines to prevent recurrent heart attacks, more than a quarter of people who have had a heart attack experience another stroke or stroke, which often leads to serious side effects".
Bailes no repeated sirdstriekas var leave a negative impression on the quality of human life.
Evidence suggests that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin effectively re-inhibits recurrent heart attacks and heart attack risk in people who have experienced them.
Provisionally, we are not able to treat Ticagrelor, we are willing to expand the treatment options to thousands of people, thus benefiting them.

The culture of political correctness promotes the crackdown on Muslim copyrights during elections.
According to the management report, former Tauerhamletas mayor Lutfurs Rahmans was given a no-starter with corruption charges.
The reports of the authorities revealed that as a result of cultural political correction, pievērtas acis uz plaša mēroga has become a crop of Muslim copies.
Former government minister Sers Erik Pikls criticized the police, the election and the city council for ignoring the signs of a breakdown in the election process, saying they "did not have ethnic and religious interests".
The former secretary of the Copenu, who has now become the head of a corruption-fighting organisation, therefore, if voter libel for religious reasons is widespread, the police should allow the izvietot sargus pie to the polling stations, in order to protect the libel of the voters.
He also recommends that voters should present identification documents when they vote to prove their identity.
Currently, voters only need to provide a name and address.
He also recommended that the voters should be marked with a special ink to avoid a double vote.
The scientists also need to be better protected, says Sers Erik.
He believes that the press should have greater access to the council's documents and decisions, which have been approved by an unofficial committee working group.
He said: "The goal is not only to prevent election fraud, but also to prevent local governments from corrupting a corrupt culture, as is the case with the current election".
The report was commissioned by Dauningstrīta after a scandal surrounding the Tauerhamletas municipal election.
Last year, a special election court ruled to suspend the city's Lutfuru Rahmanu post office and the city's post office began to corrupt due to illegal activity.
The court found that Rahman's "Chinese sacredness" to his Muslims, his copy of religious taxation, and his criticism were closely linked to the accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
"Rahmans has called off his election campaign ar nostādni, to the religious obligations of the Muslims and to the ballot by them".
About 300 balsis were forged or scraped, and one person was voted out several times.
Similarly, Sers Eriks points out that scams are being seen throughout the country.
He pointed out that, in particular, the satrapoosa and scandal in the vote for the post, the Muslims who copy the oldest bidders, are being led astray by other candidates.
Sers Eriksen is committed to taking measures to improve the electoral system, including the presentation of identity documents, to identify individuals.
Her reports read: "Research shows that vulnerable ethnic minorities in a number of countries, especially women and young people, are being honestly voted out by a majority of the selected candidates, especially Bangladesh and Pakistan".
"It is always surprising that the apgabalu authorities do not pay attention to these problems because of political correctness, which could undermine ethnic and religious interests".
Sers Erik presented 50 recommendations for improving the electoral system, including a ban on political activists working with ballots, as well as postal notes, to prevent "bals collection".
The report, by Terēza Meja, also called for a thorough registration check to prevent the use of voter lists to defraud immigration and benefits.
Consider the possibility of asking voters to present their identity documents before voting.
The electorate was not given a special ballot, to avoid a double vote.
Systematically check the identity of the person to make sure that the person has voting rights.

I'm not allowed to photograph the election in the circus.
It is stipulated that the elections in the parishes should be conducted in English only (except in Velsā).
To provide training, the district employees provide, voters submit their ballots to the polls individually.
Sers Erik also criticized the Metropolitan Police, while not expressing it, for the Tauerhamletas case and the allegations made against them.
He recalls: "The Veleshana court merely disqualified Lufturu Rahman and his representative for acts related to corruption and embezzlement".
He asserted that the standard evidence of criminal truth was invalid, based on irrefutable evidence.
He also criticizes the ineffective voter registration of city council voters in the constituencies.
Sers Erik notes: "The court decision taken last year was a travesty of conscience.
Our land is known as the Parliament of the Century, but satraucošā un covert election fraud spreading un institutional corruption, so that corruption is not a threat to our reputation.

Canadian channel CBC had spiests atvainoties, with no commentators commenting on it, that the 14-year-old Chinese pelted girl no contest was "out of the race, no nosmirdēja vien" and "nobeigusies kā cūka".
Commentator Bairons Makdonalds, whose microphones were turned off, said that the women's 4x200m freestyle relay team had expressed their personal views at the end of the final.
Makdonalds, who was included in the CBC commentary team, said: "She's a fourteen-year-old girl and the Chinese can't keep up".

Liels paldies!
14 years ago, Kīniešu peldētājas Ai Yanhana's result in the second leg was 1:57.79, which was 1.61 seconds slower than the Canadian Teilores Ruckas' result, allowing the Canadian team to beat China.
Viewers across Canada immediately reacted to the internet, shocked to hear such a tone un izteicienus.
Emets Makfarlains wrote on Twitter: "I heard a CBC commentator say, 'Tis like 14 grieving pledgers in China who are 'nobeidzās kā cūka'????".
Idiots were ignorant, so they were still in the ether.
Ai Yanha no Chinese 4x200m freestyle final women's was nicknamed by "fourteen-year-old Chinese no, don't take it with you".
Criticism of Baironu Makdonaldu's pret quickly took hold, and many demanded clarification.
Twitter users were unable to notice, hearing Bairona MacDonalda's comments.

We are very sorry that such comments were made in a manner that was not in the public domain.
Yesterday we immediately reacted to an act of aggression against all tiešraides viewers and followers on social media.
The scarcity of evidence must be sought, as Bairona's comments were expressed through the snow of the plaintiff, rather than addressed to her personally.
But in any case it was unprofessionally a poorly chosen expression, a very regrettable one.
On Thursday afternoon, McDonalds personally acted in a quiet manner and tried to pass the time, as he did not hesitate, so his comments would be left as personal utterances.

I am talking about the snow of the peldetas, not about them personally.

Tanja Skeldona and her partner Šons Trebilkoks were not present at the property of Saltašā Kornvolā, and they filed several complaints.
When they walked through the property, shocked housing officials found that the property had been completely demolished.
Grīdās un sienās bija nāsti holes, visur bija izmētāti waste un sienas bija noklātas ar graffiti.

Donna Makevoja, a caretaker for the Kornvolas Mājokļu service, was surprised that the housing would not be possible to restore.
She tells of people who lived here, who were extremely difficult to find, and people who could not live.
In this case, several factors must be considered, and in the future this property will not have a good reputation.
This family is Slavic and their name is well known.
I had three sons, who periodically stayed in the property of a police officer so that their terror could be spared as violence, street gangs and baseball games, local mobbing, drug use, drug trafficking, and a rampage.
The 47-year-old Skeldonei, whose name has been "Species", in June piespriests sods for antisocial behavior.
Many of the demolished homes are now being left behind and disposed of as waste.
Mājā, where previously possible, sold drugs, and also exchanged several grids of goods.
They were so, so they regularly crawled on the streets and constantly being sacked by the police.
Kornvolas Mājokļu dienests were forced to leave the property on foot, as they had 11 weeks to leave, without being able to leave the house voluntarily.
The exiled Kaimińs were very happy with their escape, and their life was absolutely her.
Viens said, "They didn't care about the other residents".
We lived next door to them for 20 years, the bag was always a trace.
Neticami, how often we have seen the police here.
We were not able to talk.
We pamodāmies, who were here a little bit too much - we were not pieraduši!
Now that they're finally going to the prom, it's going to be amazing here.
Adams Fitzpatriks, who was the head of the Kornvolas Mājokļu service's neighbourhood protection, said his family did not cooperate with local security authorities.
The family has lived here for 20 years and the police regularly call here.
In the garden, you can find a variety of objects and small objects.
He also said: "It is very unfortunate that the residents have not taken any responsibility for their performance, and the abandonment of the house is always the last resort, as Kornvolas Mājokļu dienests consider".
This was a very complicated matter, as their performance was extreme and the neighbors were very happy to enjoy their performance.
I appreciated the work that the visa mana team, the Devonas un Kornvolas police and community members, who were courageously cooperating with us, had done to provide the necessary information.
Es ceru, if this event facilitates the life of the neighborhood, it will be shown, if antisocial behavior is not acceptable.
Fitzpatrix said that the three sons of the vision here lived in different periods of time, but the vision is about 20 years old.

After the excavations it became known that they were currently leasing some private property in Plimutā.
Many of the houses were marked with graffiti.
Police say they continue to keep their rentals, as they violate their rental agreements.
Police spokeswoman for Devonas un Kornvolas, Andjela Krova, points out that this disregard is clearly a warning to other insurgents, who continue to violate the rules.
She also said, "This is a warning to those who think that there will be no such thing as a free lunch".

The presidents who died were Gustavam Zemgalam - 145.
On Friday, 12 August, 145 years ago, since the birth of the Latvian President Gustavs Zemgals.
The Zemgals proclaimed the Latvian state, bet nepelnīti ir palicis widely described as the first Latvian president Jāņa Čakstes and the last president of the first period, Kārļa Ulmaņa ēnā.
None of our national heroes have ever been so fiercely committed to democracy as the Zemgals, ten years ago in the famous book written by Arnold Auziņš, published by Gustavam Zemgalam.
Sarunā ar portal "Delfi" Auziņš emphasizes, that Zemgals are coming to the networks of high-ranking politicians who have been out of humour.
The other sticks are always very correct.
He taught that there should be no such thing, and today's tas may be similar to that of Raimonds Vējonis.
"There was a guy who was a big fan", says Auziņš.
Modern politicians have a history of their own, they refer to Karli Ulmani as the leader of the two, but they know who he is, how negants he has been.
The only person sitting in the throne, on whose throne he is not a client, was General Balodis.
Pat and bildēs he ir laipns an smaidīgs, naturally he was hysterics.
"Zemgals are their humor is a democratic expression that directly represents the pretēju iespaidu", says Auziņš.
The professors of the Latvian University of Letters and Philosophy Faculty Aivars Stranga spoke with "Delfi" and agreed to Auziņa's assessment of Zemgalu as a measure of a no-holds-barred national hero.
He also noted that the Zemgals excēlies ar ar honour pret minorities, regularly summoning Jewish representatives to the presidential pillar.
"At that time it was not a common practice, but after the Zemgala presidency, Alberts Kviesis took over this tradition", says the historian.
He was such a cluss a nosvērts man, and he wanted to be president first.
He is after his netiecās, simply nealka slavas.
He also criticized himself, as he did not speak French, but felt that the president should be respected.
"During the presidency, French language pamatus gan learned", explains Stranga.
Zemgals did not want to be re-elected, he was not allowed to run again.
In this respect he is a very respectable personage in Latvian history, even before the appointment of the president pilī was a serious amatā - he was a highly sought-after notary.
Similarly, Zemgals had married Slaveno Zemgala kasi Suvorova ulice 3, where he founded a krajamatnieku a krājaizdeju association, in which the government practically negotiated the establishment of the Latvian state.
He was always progressive.
Nebija is a great Ulmaņa centurion, but publicly he is also not a big fan.
"Privātās sarunās gan times and times, so that Ulman's actions are truly uncomfortable with him", Stranga points out.
He lived a peaceful life, with no guilt for wrongdoing or corruption.
What is the current state of the earth?
He is, however, mostly associated with some of the leading figures in Riga.
He was an absolute democrat, while Uzskati was a centrist.
"There was no satire or satire during his time, on the contrary, he could be associated with such as to establish a stable presidency", Stranga summarized.
During Gustav Zemgala's presidency, from 1927 to 1930, the Latvian state visit to Sweden also took place, which in Latvia or during the netieši period meant the full recognition of the kaimiņvalstī and the integration of the democratic northern European nation into the family.
On 28 May 1929, Zemgals made their first national visit to Stockholm.
King Gustav V of Sweden paid a visit to Latvia on 29 June 1929.
The second Latvian president was born in 1871 and died in January 1939.

Aggression - is a physical activity, as directed against another person, usually manifested, when hostile.
When we, adults, are angry, satractic - usually we know, as if we are going through a difficult time.
We can express, obscure, conceal, keep secret, tell stories to our friends or other teenagers, we can spend time in the kitchen, smoke cigarettes (that's the best way to do it!), or eat a dog, eat a meal, or do other things we don't normally do.
We do not show our aggression towards others, but we do know different ways to deal with these emotions.
Children, when they are faced with adversity, they know that what is happening to them is not going to happen to them.
They would say: "Ej prom!", "Tu esi muļķis", "Sliktā mamma", "Neierzu you", "Es ar ar te nedrunēēshēshēshēshē" - and very rarely, when they can say: "Es uz uz uz dusmojos".
Children live in a burt sense, they are fully located right here, at this moment, they spontaneously and patiently demonstrate their virtue, and often also are in the midst of various emotions.
It is very important that parents do not forbid their child to show juices, including dusmas, not to be confused with un un unrrates, but rather - to help the child.
Do you need a break in a relationship?
It's a busy day, where you're getting your way, or just getting your mood up - and there are so many reasons why you'd want to get your "closures" and world visas.
Is it possible to get acquainted with relationships for a while and have a little fun?
Or does it still suggest that each partner has a saving path?
In your opinion, there are different kinds of things.
Jānis (23) is a kodolīgs: "When in taxation, and in relationships, you need a break, then you don't get along with real people".
Eduards (30) has discovered a pattern, a cure, perhaps, for someone to help.
And yes, when a partner starts to get nervous about each of his or her new friends, then definitely - tas ir īstais brīdis, when he or she should be able to see the other friends, lai saprastu, vai tev hennes pietrūkst, vai specially for them nedomā vai pat at all negribas to see them anymore.
So the answer is yes, pausing can help you save time and understand how important it is to have a healthy body.
Kaspars (29) reveals his theory.
I think that in relationships, one must pause for one another every day, and at any time of the day, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to stride and avoid conflict.
To cause a tas, to pamani every second, when otrs dara, un tas secz krist uz nerviem.
People start to feel anxious, especially now, and they no longer have a place to talk, just because of what they've done for the day.
I don't have any personal experience, so I've also been in a relationship for a few months.
And if you think about it for a moment, why would this woman, when you were together, have a girlfriend who would ask about it, if you were a girl in a garden and a garden of paradise?
Dominant is already in the middle of the night.
Yes, now, now.
"Man is, therefore a little bit nosodu tos, kam nav". said Edmunds (46).
Karlim (33) is a completely different opinion.
Man liekas, everyone needs a moment of help.
You never see each day, every morning, every night, until the morning, and you never see a light that comes from the sun.
Attopies!
We have a lot of things to do - friends, work, balls.
Visam ir savs time.
Of course, even to the girlfriends, however, and to the family life of another world, there is no difference between the two, tad tā var nodzīvot līdz pat o malai.
That's all there is to it.
Mārtiņš (27) says: "It is difficult to say - whether necessary or not, whether not to take a break, but it is clear - it is difficult to say as to the originator of the relationship, as to the destination, as to the destination".
And this question is raised, and we will then calculate, whether there will be any changes in the near future - on the left or the right, depending on whether or not.
I mean, while they're still young, they're always taking a break - they're always taking time off, but when they're serious, a relationship goes to a whole new level, and then they're not even really human.
You guys are so excited to spend the night together!
"Now you have to deal with another society once a day, and you need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, then you will need help, and then you will need help, and then you will need help".

Vācu researchers discuss the number of "Berlīnes mūra upuru".
According to a new study, the number of casualties in the former Austro-Hungarian border may be much higher than previously thought, but doubts about the number of casualties are still being reduced.
According to the data, on Wednesday after the opening of the Berlin Wall Museum, Checkpoint Charlie, between 1945 and 1989, in the western border areas of the Soviet Union, the communist authorities arrested 1,841 people who tried to escape from their controlled territories.
Museums and museums have been correcting a number of cases of robbery for years.
Šogad sarakstam added 11 more posts, including among the upuriem included also some six-year-old zēnu, kas noslīka, to his family trying to reach the West through the touring Czechoslovakia un Hungary.
Starp also started the new Berlin murals and the Soviet army of deserters.
"The extent of the damage done by the dualistic communism and socialism is not yet fully documented", acknowledges Aleksandra Hildebrante, director of the museum.
"Our task is to ensure that the capture of persons, the destruction of civilians, the preservation of communist-controlled countries, and the consolidation of the unity of the state", Hildebrantes emphasized in the statement.
But other researchers have already shrunk the new numbers.
"Skaitlis 1841 is not clear", in an interview with Süddeutsche Zeitung newspaper, claims the history of the Austrian University of Berlin expert Johens Štāts.
He and other researchers at the Free University of Berlin are currently reviewing possible mysterious deaths within the borders, but so far they have only been able to confirm 260 cases.
Previously, researchers had only been able to find 138 people in Berlin by the communist regime.
Given the number of people who have died, been killed, or have been killed in the Baltic Sea or have reached the West through the territory of neighbouring countries, according to the State Department, the number of Uprus could reach about a thousand.
However, the number of Viennese is significantly lower than in 1841.
For reasons of the different number of bits, different methodologies could be used.
Checkpoint Charlie museums also list all Australian border homicides regardless of whether they were directly related to their service.
Museums also include cases of violence, as well as those related to the subject.
"If seniors are between 70 and 80 years old after the completion of border controls mira no sirdstriekas", there must be these "slavkvajniecki boundaries" secams, Hildebrante considers.
But the State is convinced that no-series should be made between the old people, who may have been displaced by their experience of dating, and their deaths caused by prolonged waiting during the hot busiest times at the border.
Regardless of the number of records being kept, and the communist Austrian government's administrative agencies not using such statistical data, researchers need to extract documents from various archives, states Štāts.
However, the State Group has recently issued jaunus documents, and therefore it may soon come up with a new number of additional figures.

Similarly, Pone criticized Jakubovski himself, saying that before the London Olympics, when Ribakova's match was confirmed among the participants, he complained to the International Indoor Sports Federation (FINA) and urged Latvia not to send any athletes.
Pone gan could not explain why he competed in the Olympics and received the accreditation of a coach, a curator, visticamāk, and a Jakubovsky.
"Biju pieteikts kā federation president ("team leader"), but for different reasons I have received the coach accreditation un tagad nekur netieku interno".
The situation changed every day, the number of accreditations available.
Until the last minute I thought about the Germans, who had no information.

The situation would become out of control.

Viljamsam Vezi opened it in December 2013.
The trio agreed, as Viljams was able to begin the recovery procedure in 2014, at the beginning of the intersection and reduce the length of the break to a minimum, and so on.

After the victory, the first home was immediately won by Viljamsu, who was very satrauced in his face and ran more than usual.

The problem will be solved, and we will decide what to do next.

She just wants to enjoy the mirror.
I don't want to say that this was the last race.

This time it took about four minutes.

Koļegovu VID leaders are "virgins to the last".
According to him, now Minister President Mārim Kučinskim (Zaļo un zemnieku savienība) and Minister of Finance Danai Reizniecei-Ozolai (Zaļo un zemnieku savienība) are "principally important", so that the VID leaders can approve the finance ministers' nominations for Koļegovu.
Rajevskis won, Kahan Kučinsky won, and Reizniecei-Ozolai won in this ruling the approval of the VID leader and "first great decision", which could affect their future as politicians.
And now the VID director will start to change his mindset about the candidate he chooses, which will negatively affect his image in the state administration.
The Cabinet's next week's agenda includes a question about the VVD leaders Koļegovas' transfer from the VID to the Director-General's office, according to the government's agenda.
Koļegovu VID heads were appointed by the then finance minister Reizniece-Ozola after the resignation of Ināra Pētersone un Kad management of the company, and the contest for the VID Director-General ended in a draw.
The leaders began the interview with the duty-bearer Dace Pelēkā on Thursday, August 11, in a poll conducted by Latvijas Radio - and offered her to run for the office of the chairman, so she could be a part of VID.
The Finance Minister later announced that he would not consider other candidates for the position of head of the VID.
The head of the National Union's Saeima faction, Raivis Dzintars, also said that the NA was still supporting Koļegov in the VID campaign.
In Spain, the possibility of reducing the budget deficit threatens the inability to form a government.
On 12 July, the European Commission (EC) adopted an opinion on the implementation of sufficiently comprehensive measures by Spain and Portugal to reduce the budget deficit level to the euro area's 3% of gross domestic product (GDP).
Estimates show that despite the implementation of the fiscal measures, Portugal's budget deficit at the end of last year was 4.4% of GDP, while Spain's - 5.1%.
The European Commission, however, has decided to impose economic sanctions on these countries, while also pursuing fiscal objectives for the foreseeable future.
Here are some reasons why the EC has not yet imposed sanctions on these countries, and the growing Euroskepticism in many European Union countries.
The sanctions will only expose such a negative attitude.
Critics point out that the EC's decisions are consistent, but initially agreed upon by uniform rules and then unable to apply them to life.
For example, the president of the German Bundesbank, Jenss Veidmanns, pointed out that Europe thus lost confidence in the interests of its citizens, in the rules of the European Union and recommended rather than recommended.
Now the EC has proposed a visa and the Member States have approved the payment of the budget deficit by the end of this year to Portugal and by 2018 to Spain.
The European Commission alone will examine the progress made by both countries within a few months, while also indicating that Spain and Portugal should be ready to implement additional measures to combat poverty and improve conditions.
Initial forecasts suggest that Portugal's set goal of achieving the budget deficit within a given time frame could be reached, and that this year the budget deficit could drop to 2.5% of GDP.
In other words, under the Stability Programme, the government of this country should implement a reduction of 0.25% of GDP this year.
These measures should be included in this year's budget, with additional attention paid to controlling the cost of purchasing goods and services.
In Spain, the situation is much more complicated.
The budget deficit should be reduced to 4.6%, next year - to 3.1% in 2018. - to 2.2% in terms of GDP.
In addition, consolidation measures should be set at 0.5% of GDP in the next two years.
Especially complicated in achieving this goal is the fact that after eight months of negotiations between the Spanish political parties and the government, Spain has become increasingly likely to hold early parliamentary elections for the third time in a year.
But the public domas aptaujas suggest that the third election policy in the country would have changed significantly.
The most popular party still remains the People's Party, led by current Prime Minister Mariano Rahoja, which won the election again with less than 33% of the vote.
Its popularity was somewhat undermined by socialists alone, while the popularity of the party "Podemos" or "Kopā mēs varam" or "Ciudadanos" or "Pilsoņi" was somewhat diminished.
The Tautas Party wants to get the socialist Ciudadanos to take office this month, otherwise it will not be able to adopt a proposal until October to submit the draft budget for 2017 to the European Commission for approval.
Rafaels Hernando, representative of the Tautas Party's parliamentary faction, announced that the government would not be able to hold a parliamentary election, but that Spain would be granted a visa to the European Union.
Pludmaļu tīrība Rīgas jūras līcī is criticized.
Five years after the beaches were cleared, activists concluded, unfortunately the number of garbage dumps is increasing, and here most of the visitors are peldvietu.
Vispiesārņotākās peldvietas and directly to Riga.
Galvasztä domē transparent, to the peldvietas ik dag tiekot covered, but to fight against the unpolluted visitors is quite difficult.
In addition, the sausage can be used to remove waste during use, thus improving its quality.
Apart from the beaches of Liepājas and a few places in Kurzemē, the beaches are not considered as a city in Latvia.
This week, the "Mana jūra" campaign was distributed by volunteers.
Five years ago, the city of Riga was hit by a deadly storm, activists said, and the population of the city grew by hundreds of meters.
Unfortunately, this year there is a lot of criticism and evaluation.
"I see that by the end of this year, when the number of garbage on the beaches is 100 meters, it is likely that the number will exceed 200 units", says Jānis Ulme, representative of the Mana jūra expedition.
Latvian Radio sazvanīts, he foundās Tūjas pludmalē, where he continued his volunteer gajiens gar Rīgas mors līci.
Showed among different waste dumps a picnic left by activists and then there were daily lightning strikes, as well as sea smiltis.
The participants of the event, organizers Ulme teic, are directly the residents of the area.
"Galvenais avots are the same beach visitors, more than half of the total waste is plastic, various waste, starting with corn, plastic gabaliem, as it is already in the end stage, because it is no longer possible to identify, un issmēķiem, pudelēm, korķiem", Ulme explains.
The cleanest beaches and beaches in Riga are also very popular.
For example, Daugavpils is used to store almost 800 units of waste per meter, which is a critical amount.
Campaign organizers are also clear, as they are also not smoking and are not issuing a warning or banning of the mark.
"The living numbers for all the Riga peldvietām trim combined - Daugavpils, Vakarbuļļiem un Vecāķiem - unfortunately sanāk lieli un tālu exceeds the desired jeb goal, uz kuru it kā Latvija virzās, by 2020.gadam reduce the number of waste units to 135 units", said Secina vides aizstāvis.
The cleaning of the floor of Riga is not done every day, the summer heat is done twice, said Uģis Vidauskis, representative of the dome.
However, the fight against the unpolluted visitors is quite intense.
We are returning to this question of people's culture.
"Use them, like gambling, drinking alcohol, smoking and giving visas for things you shouldn't do, even special signs that don't work", Vidauskis points out.
Vidauskis therefore urges visitors to the peldvietu to report the puppeteers to the police.
Sock the police, point out these violations and fight everyone in this way.
Perhaps there were some younger warnings, but, as it turns out, ten or so things will change radically.
"We should all just be ruthless with such offenders", he emphasizes.
Tikmēr water quality measurements have been carried out for the fourth time since the Health Inspection, which imposed a ban on official peldvietas.
Šogad gan, like other years, water quality it visur esot laba un apmierinoša.
The situation is currently the same, with over 56 peldvietas of water quality at all times having been subject to no pelting restrictions.
"We will take the analysis at the end of August for the last time", said Normunds Kadiķis, the inspection's senior health expert.
During the period of stipru lietusgāžu using sausage atstātie waste could get ice-cold.
This, in turn, can affect its quality, according to experts in the field.
The rotation of the Russian elite continues - the main leader in the Putin administration.
Pats pameta amatu?
Vladimir Putin announced to the Russian media that Sergei Ivanov would be elected as the next president's special representative on matters of nature protection, ecology and transportation.
In announcing the changes, Putin spoke to Ivanov in front of the television camera with the words of appreciation: "Dear Sergei Borisovič, we have worked together for many years and we have been successful".
I am satisfied that you are doing the duties entrusted to you.
Es labi atceros by our agreement and not to dismantle you in this office of the head of the presidential administration amatā for more than four years.
Therefore, it is important to understand your desire to change the field of operations.
Un es ceru, ka also jaunajā amatā you will fully use your knowledge and experience.
However, despite the fact that the presidential administration was overthrown and the very important measures taken made Ivanov one of the most influential people in the country.
Given that elections to the State Duma, which are due in Russia, have been called in, this solis is related to the struggle for power in the Russian political elite.
Ivanovs also said that Putin may be a deputy president, so the allegations that he wanted to take the president's representative on matters of nature protection and transportation were dubious.
As the Lsm.lv archive, Ivanovs and the VDK of the Federal Security Service general pulkvedis shows.
Ivanovs have been a sense of unity with Russian President Vladimir Putin's allies.
He started his own gaitas specdienestos in 1975, where he met Putin.
Later, Putinam became the head of the Federal Security Service, Ivanovs became his deputy.
The first Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, was appointed by the secretary of the Russian Security Council during the reign of the Russian president.
In 2000, after Putin's arrival, Ivanova's elaborate "Doctrine of Information Security" was approved, which included the reintroduction of a state censorship mechanism in Russia.
In 2001, Sergei Ivanovs became the Russian Defense Minister, but in 2005 - Prime Minister Mihaila Fradkova became the one responsible for the development of Russian defense industry companies and arms exports.
Now, after the head of the presidential administration was inaugurated, Ivanovs will also retain his seat in the Russian National Security Council, where he will also serve as head of the presidential administration Vaino.
Vaino comes from a family of Soviet party elites.
The head of the presidential administration, Amatu Vaino, is recommended to Ivanovs.
We have known Antonu Eduardović since we met.
Back then, when we were working in your household, we were working in the government.
For the past almost five years we have sazināmies practically every day.
"I am therefore convinced that after all the professional characteristics, he is capable of a hundred times more", Ivanovs said.
The Vaino came from families belonging to the elite of the Soviet Party.
Karls her vectēvs took augustus amatus in the Communist Party of Estonia, including ten years until 1988.
Internet publications "Meduza" are a reference to the book "Igaunijas autoteikése un independență" raksta, in which Karls Vaino's late 1980s esoteric lūdzis Maskavu dot permission pielietot fuerza pret demonstrator participants.
However, he refused and soon lost his love.
Afterwards, Vaino moved to Moscow.
Antons Vaino is a graduate of the International Relations Institute in Maskavas, which manages the Japanese language.
However, he left the diplomatic service to work for the President's protocol management.
It has been reported that in recent weeks Russia has satirized several high-ranking officials for the removal of a pat aresti, including the appointment of several deputy governors and federal representatives.
According to political scientists, President Vladimir Putin has overhauled the elite's position ahead of the upcoming 2018 elections.
Vienna has its main landmarks - increasingly representing leading amatiem and power structures.
Judo wrestler Nikiforenko also lost the Olympic Games in the first match.
This was the first round of the fight, and a Latvian judo wrestler finished his Olympic career in 17th place.
Coach Oļegs Baskins told Latvian Television yesterday that Nikiforenko's rise was very uncertain, a fact that was already clear before the race.
He also revealed that a judo wrestler in combat was suffering from a knee injury.
In order to compete in the Olympic Games, Nikiforenko was forced to start in a different weight category than pierasts - in contrast, in the weight category up to 100 kg.
The Azerbaijani wrestler was 25 kilograms taller.
It has been reported that in the fight of Jevgeņijs Borodavko in the weight category up to 100 kg pret Rjunosuki noturējās divarpus minutes, until pretiniekam issued tīras victas worthy metiens.
Till ar to Latvia judo competition Rio and the conclusion.
Dreams of the Rio smiltīs.
On Thursday, the Jewish activists Jevgeņijs Borodavko were introduced.
Yes, he had titletax pretinieks before him, but ambition can sometimes be a surprise.
He is not working.
Artūram Nikiforenko's tasks were even more complex, with experience more than pretinieks and respectable.
Iznākums is similar, although his father was noturē teju and a half minute earlier than Borodavko.
Unfortunately, lately, the Latvian Jews are the most lacking in ambition.
The Federation's leadership was led by Gunārs Ķirsons and his financial adviser Vladimirs Šestakovs, and Latvian advisor Aleksandrs Jackevičs, who no longer used the term "Golden Score", meaning "judeo development rit pa lejupslīdošu līkni".
Jackevičam, as here consultē Kazahstānas džudistus, un Vsevoldam Zeļonijam mantiniekus and its members.
Bet, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
The United Nations is a federation of prerogatives.
Therefore, as no galactic quotes "Rīta panorāmā" scanned the pledge of the President of the Latvian Judo Federation to Rio to win medals.
Lidoums are not reality.
The last time I was in the carelessness of a beach volleyball match was Samoilovs/Šmēdiņš - Evandru/Pedru Solbergs.
Intriga kā jau "nāves" group - the losers are in the final game.
The Latvian duet was a little out of reach - they could also lose, but not more than four points per set.
Saspringumu even increased in the previous game.
Neviens negribēja mirt - this sajūta virs vējainā short virmoja visa mača along the way.
The players were given additional complications by the Brahminas.
At first, it might be our - as well as our - allies.
Bet you were there.
Pret Latvijas duetu to play here was quite easy.
Servē tik uz Samoilovu un gaidi, when he will plīsīsīs.
Pret Kanādu ieplīsa, pret Kubu saplīsa first set at the end of a third at the beginning, with slodze bija ne pa jokam.
Smudders could then make, and once there was maz, bet, kad bija, paveica to godam.
Brazilian Samoilovs ar Šmēdiņu were able to win the two sets, the first one took the bet at 16:15, however at 16 they also won, also outscoring the losing limit.
Bet could also lose 0:2, with the second set deficit being -4, however, thanks to the wind, it managed to win.
The third had already been arrested by Evandru servju zīmē.
The chaedīte - the non-aligned take on the serve, the second piece of the red red red too thiv tīklam un Samoilovam palika completely its variants resultīvam uzbrukumam.
And before the Cubs, there was a little bit of Samoilovs, but this time he was more successful, and the loss of the Sašu novelt would be unprofessional.
Kreilis also made a mistake, a bit symbolically, to make the last block of trieca directly to him.
Zaudē commands.
This time, there are definitely also actions - in the third set, the Divine Evandru almost slips out of the court, but the bomb nevertheless crosses the line.
The divisions were next to the line.
The video for the controversial episode was also made by the pretiniek.
Evandru was very active in the first two games, but they were very productive for us.
They all lost in the round table.
Now we need to gently isolate the causes of the accident.
Perhaps it was necessary for many to live next to my stadium, rather than together with the Olympic delegation.
Divarpus spent hours on the road.
Perhaps a little self-confidence in the seven-game series.
Perhaps Klaugenfurtē should not have played, but faster hierarchies here will better acclimatize.
Perhaps it was a mistake or a sporting form of attracting headgear.
We wait for more questions than answers.
Our bikers are playing games.

Congress announces that military officials have sanctioned reports by the Islamic State.
In a statement released on Thursday, the House of Representatives said that representatives of the US Central Intelligence Agency had sanctioned the report, portraying the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria much more optimistic than it actually was.
The Central Intelligence Agency analysts noted a general lack of compliance by the Bruņoto Force Committee, the Intelligence Committee, the Defense Finance Subcommittee, and the Republican delegation's temporary report on the task force, stating that their conduct controlled the report on American achievements in the fight against Islamic State.
Central Command, as it is known as Centcom, is a military base in Tampā, Florida, which oversees the US military operations in the Far East and Central Asia.
The latest news about this report, the latest news, and the latest news reports, confirmed by the top Centcom executives, reflect the U.S. fight against terrorism more positively than they actually do, and the facts are regularly discussed, reflecting better performance, than the analysis of the report shows.
California Republican Rep. Kens Kalverts explains: "Centcom's actions are unacceptable - our actions are unfair, and our policy makers receive a report that is unfair".
Centcom management errors are often sought in the highest levels of organizations.
These 10 reports detail even existing problems in the Central Lighthouse reflection of an analysis by the American intelligence agency prepared by Iraqi forces in 2014. un 2015.
Lai gan tas does not provide conclusive evidence that senior officials in the Obama administration would have been willing to accept the report, however tas indicate that Centcom vadība ir has put some pressure on analysts to portray an optimistic view of the Islamic State (also known as ISIS or ISIL) as a radical group.
The report stated that in the first half of 2015, the Central Administration's press release, a notice to Congress, showed a situation that was significantly more positive than it actually was.
For example, Centcom representatives publicly announced that the Mosul recovery operation could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul is Iraq's second largest city, which is still under the control of the Islamic State.
Kansas Republican Party representative Maiks Pompeo said in his report: "A few months of uncertainty has been cleared by an investigation".
No. From mid-2014 to 2015, the US Central Administration's chief officials released a report depicting the Islamic State threat Iraq and the Levant, rather than what it actually was.
The Republican Party has set up a working group, the official, analysts and no-bazzījusies, to provide information on the Islamic State and the sacred.
To investigate the allegations, a report published on Thursday found new findings in the case.
The Ministry of Defence's Inspector General conducts an investigation into the activities of Centcom's intelligence service.
The Democratic Party's Intelligence Management Committee on Thursday published its own report, in which it agreed with the conclusions of some Republican Party working groups.
Representative Adams B. Šifs, a Democrat, said in his report that from 2014 to 2015, Centcom too limited the preparation of its assessment report on ISIS and the Iraq Security Specifications.
Shifa kungs plainly said that this process "encouraged the spread of information", disliked analysts' work ethic and "imposed unreliable facts on the truth".
Bet Šifs un Demokrat Parti bieri piebilda, including evidence that the Baltic Nams had put pressure on the Centcom analytiķiem to produce reports, in accordance with "pre-determined or political nostājai".
The Daily Beast published the provisional results of the congressional investigation on Thursday.
The New York Times reported that the Pentagon's inspector general had opened an investigation following complaints from Centcom analysts.
Pentagon deputy lieutenant commander Patriks Evans announced that the Pentagon would not comment on the congressional report while the investigation continues.
He also urged, that experts at times interpret complex data in different ways, a Defense Ministry and intelligence agency call for constructive dialogue on vital national security issues.
The investigation does not merely address the question of whether the US-led bombing campaign in Iraq un Syria was successful (apgalvojums, which increasingly targeted representatives of the Ministry of Defense).
But last year's accusations were not enough, and President Obama was completely unconvinced by reports from the Central Administration about military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan and other places.
Criticism of the Islamic State spyware recalls more than a decade ago, when Centcom intelligence analyst Gregorijs Hūkers published a study, claiming that the George V. Bush administration had begun the Afghan war, too often questioning the possible consequences.
Hūkers also played a significant role in uncovering the Islamic State's intelligence issues.
Last year, officials reported that the Hūkera team had discovered, in a press release, that the rise of the Islamic State oil refineries had significantly impaired the financial status of the terrorist group, which had built temporary refineries to sell oil on the black market.
The Times reported in September that this discovery did not occur outside the scope of the Central Administration.
At that time Centcom commander General Loids Ostins III received criticism, which many lawmakers considered too positive, for reports describing the situation.
In April, General Austin resigned and was succeeded by General Joseph L. Votels.

Bet his name, the American result at the Olympics was 4:0, while they were undefeated in their group by Great Britain, as the quarter-final after a 2-0 victory over Japan was still uncharted.
Britain and the USA were tied for the lead on Saturday, with the last match played in the first round.

But 2012 was not a good year for her and her team.
The following year, by means of selection coaches, the English Kregs Parhams won the match on both fours.
They are described as "cultures, mentality and physical changes".
In London we did not borrow as much work as we do now.
We've completely changed our faces.
In the Wednesday game, Bama revealed the result, getting the first half of the game and finishing the match with no extra distances.
India started the game without a win on their own, but their standings were very poor and they scored a minimal score of 0:1 until the end of the third period, when Bama repeatedly took the over.

The most nomācošš ēdiens of the Depression period were the "Sātīgā maltīte".
In March 1933, shortly after the election of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, he sat in the oval office, leaving the Maltese.
President Rūzveltam garšoja such smalkas kulinarie delicateses kā zosu aknu pastēte jeb fuagrā un Merilendas bruņurupuču soup.
But today her maltīte was crisper and more peticicīgīg: full-bodied tomatoes in a measure, potatoes biezputra un desertā - plūmju pudiņš.
"The way I was able to show solidarity with people in cooking was very tasty", says Jane Ziegelmane.
Andrjū Kou, the Vietnamese author of the virus, said: "This is also a message to Americans that they should eat".

In his last book, "The Sound of the Night", he describes Chinese virtue in America, while in his book, "97 habits", Ziegelmane describes life through the food īres namā of Manhattan's east lejasdaļā.
Viņu jauna is the author of the groundbreaking work "Sātīgā maltīte", which was published by Harper's, and stories about American food during the Great Depression.
Known for their cooking solidarity, they ran a joint Maltese restaurant with the reporter "Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop", a simple restaurant in the Flatironas region, which operated from 1929 until the Great Depression.
54 years old Ziegelmans kundze ordered sviestmaizi ar kausēto sieru un sakapātām olivim, while 57 years old Koucais ordered tītaru, potatoes biezputru and vegetable salads.
Kad reportereris ordered a few of the food items, a couple of atzina, so she chose the most appropriate sarunai for the meal.
Ziegelmanes kundze told me, the viltotais zaķis were very popular.

Tie the ingredients to the basic ingredients and other ingredients, which enriched the maltīti.
Iedomājies, kā tas ir - apēst so many earthly crops, that they would be in the place of food.
Kou kungs were newly discovered.
"Droši vien likās, ka vēders ir pilns ar svinu", he said.
In the years before the Depression, American lunch guilds resembled swedish guilds, especially rural regions.
Sievietes gatavoja eat their husbands-strādnikom a brokastīs, in the afternoon a vakariņas tika pasniegti svaigi pagatavoti sacepumi.
During World War I, it was the Americans who sent food to Europeans. "Sātīgā maltīte" is described as the American adaptation to the conditions, when America suddenly ceased to be a land mass.
"Tolaik ēdiens became the everyday object of the popular galvanic expertise of the American people", Kou kungs, a paskaidrojot, tells the story, "why he and his sieva wanted to write directly on this subject.
New budget diets became important: such unknown ediens as viltotais zaķis un sautējumi became icdukai, sautējumi were "lielisks as a way to use overpalikumus", noted Ziegelmanes kundze, whose pavāri could hide unwholesome ingredients in creamy scales.
The Svaigo augulus is replaced by the latti žāvētie augulus.

Many homemade recipes are applied to the gritty season.
There was a household economist, Luīze Stenlija, director of the Federal Bureau of Economic Affairs for Housing from 1923 to 1943, who noted a national eating paradigm, which had not been experienced before or after the Great Depression.
By publishing a typical recipe in a newspaper or a magazine, they encourage households to become "economists" and to accept such challenges as turning macaroni into a burkanu mixli garšīgā maltītē.
"Sātīgā Maltīte" is a historical gardumu mielasts.
Particularly interesting are the reports about the government's attitude towards its outgoing citizens, such as President Herberta Hūvera's "let's eat cake".
In public, he told of his simple childhood as a foodie Aiova, in fact he ate as small millionaires, by which he had become.
Kou kungs tells: "We are going to try some European virtue, like zivs ar gurkuchi".
He ate almost apzeltītā viesistaā, wearing a lunch jacket.
He was completely out of touch with reality.
President Roosevelt would have made the same mistake, and his mistress Eleanor would not have advised him to set an example by his eating paradigms.
The book tells of how, when Rūzvelts and his housekeepers, who had never learned to eat, until the Baltic Nams became places "where not only were pasniegts come to the most visnegarshest edifices in Washington, but also visliktāk pagatavotē ēdieniem".
As soon as the national economy recovered, most of the depressions and culinary eras parachuted.
But we continue to focus on calories as a nutritional value, as well as, as pielietot sciencie culinaria, piebilda Ziegelmanes kundze.
Paris tells us, when, writing a book, they gained a greater understanding of Ziegelmans kundzes' mother's eating paradigms, such as why she could not digest food.

Gilead will be reimbursed for legal costs in the fight against Merck's Hepatitis C patent.
The court ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. had the right to recover legal expenses incurred in the Hepatitis C patent infringement case against the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead filed a lawsuit for 200 million marcs of soda money for two Merck patent infringements, which were banned in connection with the effective Sovaldi un Harvoni tablets, when the US federal judiciary found violations of Merk's business, such as soliciting after a citation for an unethical act.
In a hearing Thursday, US District Attorney Bets Labsons Frīmens pointed out that Gilead has the right to claim compensation for legal expenses, as there are no defendants in this case.
Merck is trying to gain a market position before Gilead, as it dominates the market and new hepatitis C infections, as it is effective in 90% of cases of acne.
The trial began in 2013, when Gilead and Merck filed a lawsuit against each other, trying to obtain ownership of the active ingredient sofosbuvir, which is the main ingredient in Gilead's drug.

Federal tax rates are a key issue in this presidential election.
Klintone, backing the proposal of billionaire Varena Bafeta, popularized the idea that anyone earning more than $1 million a year should be taxed at least 30 percent.
This proposal is also supported by President Barack Obama.
Last week, during Clinton's departure from Omaha, Nebraska, where his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerates are also located, Bafets urged Trump to look into tax returns.

Jewish film directors criticized the Berlin Hotel for its Israelite appeal and its closure at an Arab request - RT Ziņas
French film directors of Jewish origin have been using social media to reveal that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has access to Israeli language codes.
Klods Lancmans, a documentary about Holocaust "Shoah" directors, hid his unworthiness in Berlin's Kempinski Bristol Hotel and addressed an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During their visit, Lancmans tried to find the Israeli equivalent of a hotel on the list of hotels offered.
However, this country was not included in the list of countries, to which it was not directly assigned a hotel number.
How is it possible that in 2016 in Berlin, the new German capital, Israel will be enslaved and destroyed?

Instead, the Kempinski Bristol Hotel offers to visit the state through its central business district.
The directors demanded a passing-room and hotel staff.

Portland's future causes became unclear, and the contract was terminated.
Aluminio has unfortunately made a number of uncertain mistakes regarding the future of its employees in Portland, Victoria, and its main customer energy company has announced a breakdown of its cooperation.
This announcement is based on the Victoria government's plans to stop subsidizing the energy company, which is vitally important, so that the company can continue its work.
The 20-year-old subsidies will be discontinued in November.
To date, more than 2,000 Alkoas Portland factory jobs are at risk.
The number of jobs that could be at risk could be up to 2,000, if not more.
In addition, there will also be unprecedented blackout effects, which will cause the country to consume about 10 percent of its electricity without a visa.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry power station, as the newly established Anglesea power station ceased operations.
Alkoas Portland's cause of death is a work-in-progress loss that could be closed.
This event sparked years of speculation about the value of the Australian dollar and the cost of producing a factory.
The power plant suppliers AGL, who supply energy to their own Loy Yang A power stations Latroubes Ielejā, therefore, visticamāk also the other three owners will terminate their contracts.
Most power stations are owned by the Alcoa Corporation, in addition to the company's shares are owned by Chinese holding companies, Citic and Marubeni Corp.
"AGL is looking forward to continuing the operations of the Portland plant, which would mean further energy supply", said its spokesman.
The AGL has agreed to a contract and to a "risk-restricted contract" which is scheduled to enter into force on November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month validity period, so they will be valid until 2017.
AGL plans to receive revenue from these contracts in the 2017 fiscal year as well", a company representative said.
Starting in 2018, the potential impact of fiscal flows on profits limited favourable market forecasts for future wholesale electricity prices.
AGL claims that, according to its forecasts, it has already calculated losses of $187 million, predicting that these contracts will be terminated.
Alcoa reports, that the decision to terminate the contract with the company will not allow Alcoa to continue the operation of the supply or energy plants.
The US company said in 2010 that it had signed a 20-year contract with Lloyd Yang, but that the deal would be terminated in November.The company did not provide any explanation as to why it would terminate the cooperation.
Analysts and analysts are puzzled by the possible closure of Portland's factories in Victoria, the closure of Tomago's nearby factories in Newcastle, and the poor economy of the sector.
AGL executive directors Stevens Mikelsons said last week that, according to analytical reports, 600 megawatts of power were consumed during the Portlenda bridge and 900 megawatts of power were consumed during the Tomago bridge.
If these factories were not in the energy market, the demand for energy would have decreased significantly.
A bag would not be a mouth.
The Community Legal Centre receives 160,000 visitors each year.
Four years later, more than 160,000 people's demands were met, and despite budgetary constraints, the situation could deteriorate.
There are three types of people in Kvīnslendā - mostly pensioners, immigrants, vulnerable workers, the labour force, the upuri un tie, the money supply, the fight against illegal extortion, and the refusal of free legal assistance to the representative office.
The Community legal centre, which is already overlooking the financial crisis, warns that the situation will only get worse.
As of next June, these legal centers will receive 30% more funding than they did before.
Queensland Legal Centre Director James Farels said in the latest reports from the National Legal Centre Association that legal aid is currently being denied to thousands of people where needed.
Ms Farels pointed out, and this decision was not a good one, that the situation would only get worse.
He also said: "The Queensland Legal Centre is continuously receiving insufficient funding, in a sense, to help and deny assistance to thousands of people, where needed".
People who try to break off violent relationships, people who are crazy about paradise, families who are going through divorce, workers, the most abusive atlaiž - all these people and legal problems of a legal nature these reports indicate that they are not getting the necessary help.
No. In June 2017, the federal government reduced funding by 30 percent, meaning that several thousand more Queenslanders would have to solve their complex legal problems without assistance.

Trump's campaign officials announced that, while the media were using his words in context, he had never used violence.

After ten years of slaughter, this time it was nolemts, so that the festival of Ezra would be no more.
Mr. Lappus is not a man of the people.
Diena started competing in sports.
This time the competitions were not traditional veidos and were taken too seriously, for example, the shoutrinas were to be measured in a round goal, the lidoja zábaks, the human kreiso roku mests, the "bumbulashing" was not in the new Olympic Games.
However, each participant could show how strong, bold, and uncompromising he was.
After the sports games, the festivals began in the village.
At that time there were also "bērnu stūrītis", where the masses could enter the attractions and acquire a new look.
A tradition, however, may also be the bija braucamrīku parade, in which devās gan tractors, gan motorcycles.
Visus uzrunāja Inga Kadiķe-Skadiņa, the head of the department of Ķūļciema, who watched the yellow atpūt a sauce for a while, lietus gan nevertheless uzlija, but tas couldn't disturb anyone much.

Britain is going to win the Olympic Games and will be be beating Hītrova.
Hītrova will not only promote prosperity and growth in local regions in London, but also throughout the country.
I think that Padara Hītrovu is very pious, just like in London in 2012, where we invested a lot of work, so that the national regions would be the winners of the Olympic Games.
Stratforda un Īstenda has won an incredible amount of money at the Olympics.
We will pave the way again, providing local residents with a business opportunity through Hītrovas.
We sold copies of the video and we opened 10,000 new business opportunities, 40,000 new jobs and finally added a spot of youth unemployment in the Hītrovas area.
As at the London 2012 Olympics, there will be people who will consider this challenge too big and the expansion of Hītrovas too ambitious.
People said at the time, if Britain never did the preparations for the Olympics, it would be a world-class event.
Skeptics were wrong about 2012. in the case of Hītrovas, they would not be right.
Always there are obstacles, but you have to overcome them, but Hītrova has overcome them.
As with the Olympic Games, the Hītrova and infrastructure projects, no kura labumu needs to be a corporate visa, not individual ones.
The expansion is likely to create up to 180,000 new jobs, economic growth of 211 billion, job growth, and experience in this area across the UK.
Hītrovā works with a great team, which has developed an infrastructure investment programme worth 11 billion marts, including a budget starting with terminal 5, which has been in place for five years, and the best-known terminal in the world, which is terminal 2, which is built between two of the world's most heavily used terminals.
Now they are planning to set up a third shelter, which will be financed by private investment of 16 billion marcs.
The London 2012 Olympics were a great success, and I'm sure that will be the case with the expansion of Hītrovas.
It is time to expand the Olympic Walls, ensuring our trading future and a radically new employment landscape, and that Britain could be a great success.
Lords Pols Deitons and Hītrovas are board members and former Economics Ministries trade secretaries.
A Swiss woman screamed at her cell phone, attempting suicide.
In the middle of the night, Cietusī was thrown into a cell.
Police were trying to locate the liecinekus and the negatives, when Thursday morning they ran her through several machines in the cell.
The crash occurred on Thursday shortly after midnight on the A1 motorway near the town of Vo kantonā in Morges.
According to a Canton police report, with various attempts to commit suicide, a woman was shot in the head on the road, where several machines were sawing her.
Nepārprotami tried sevi nonāvēt, upuri, 49 years old swiss, sabrauca several machines, including the tastā machine.
Her death took place at the scene.
More and more drivers involved in the crash have been involved in the crash, but others have not yet been identified, so the police, who call for a recall, have called for the driver involved in the crash to be arrested.
He also began a criminal investigation, in which case he was logically solist, published in Le Tribune de Genève by the jurists Gilles Hofstellers.
However, it is not yet known whether any of the involved motorists will be put to death.
Could it have been possible to avoid sadursmes?
Hofstellers concludes: "To clear the prosecutors".
Two similar surveys, such as the Kas ir notikuši in the last 5 years, show that none of the drivers are responsible.
In most cases, the driver had gone to the wheelchair in the middle of the night, so the driver could not predict that the driver would be found in the middle of the night.
Last year a police officer was arrested for non-compliance, and in August 2014 she was found to have a virus that was found in the middle of the night on the A1 road near Paijernes.
It turns out that a 22-year-old man who was a teenager later fell asleep on the road.
The court concluded that if the policeman, who was on his way to the scene, had travelled in a manner appropriate to the circumstances of the incident, the man walking on the road had been "cruelly unprepared for an extraordinary incident".
If you have any information about Thursday's news and events via Morges, please contact the police at 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.

"We were expecting medals and we were expecting a service, but after that there were no differences - 25.vieta or fourth", said Samoilovs, who predicted that the duets would continue to play together in the future.
I wonder if we'll continue to play together, and this is just one tournament.
Samoilovam Riodežaneiro was already playing his third Olympic Games in his career, and in 2008 in Beijing he started with Mārtiņu Pļaviņu, but four years ago in London he played with Ruslanu Sorokinu.

Now Dmitrijam is going to look for a place to live - a radiem, a friendship, a hotel or even rent a new apartment.
Bet we would lose the censuses to no kaimiņa civilties, as it would take a lot of time.
Due to the construction of the apartments, it is currently forbidden to stay in apartments until the building is closed, un to var nākties wait for three weeks.
The losses of the couple will be paid to the owner of the apartment, in which they will not be repaired.
The owner of this apartment therefore, taking into account the conditions of the construction, also prohibits imprisonment for a period of up to six months.

The former Kemeru sanatoriums, which were converted into five-star hotels, cost 22 million euros.
The cost of the newly renovated Ķemeru sanatoriums by the five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" is 22 million euros, the leading hotel managers of SIA "Park Hotel Ķemeri" representative Gita Želve told LETA.
Hotel construction and the first posms of restoration of former sanatoriums in the country.
Otrais posms will be a "wellness" or clinic, which is scheduled to open in 2022, while the opening of the hotels is scheduled for May 2018.
Želve noted that the exact cost of the clinic is not yet known.
But she points out that there will be the former Khomeru Kovarorta polyclinic ēkā, whose flat area is about 12,000 square meters.
The clinic will be three stories high.
Park Hotel Ķemeri is a certified clinical owner and the international fund G Capital Europe, which invests in European assets.
The owners of G Capital Europe and several investors, who invest in this fund, notes Želve.
As George Jones, CEO of G Capital Europe, said earlier, the former CEO of G Capital Europe plans to invest 12 to 15 million euros in the creation of the new polyclinic, with an overall investment of more than 30 million euros.
In the past, with the renovation of a cultural and historical park of more than 42 hectares in the plain, the construction of a pedestrian street in the posmu area, the construction of an interactive natural tourist attraction, the construction of a car park in Emīla Dārziņa Street, which will promote the socio-economic development of Jūrmalas city and the growth of tourist numbers, Jūrmalas dome plans to attract 14.5 million euros from the European Union funds, co-financing three to four million euros.
Till 2017.gada vidum is planned for design walls, bet būvdarbi un sakārtošanas walls sāksies nākamā gada rudenī.
According to reports, the historical sanatorium complex "Ķemeri" is planning to build a five-star hotel "Park Hotel Ķemeri" and a "wellness" jeb labsajūtas clinic.
However, the reconstruction was not completed.
In 2010, the report also stated that "Ominasis" regularly communicates with the hotel operator "Kempinski", who continues to provide daily technical controls in the "Ķemeri" sanatorium, and in 2011 determined to "restore the existing "Ķemeri" hotel" and immediately begin preparations for the opening of the "Kempinski" hotel chain.
In October 2014, it sold its right to buy the bankrupt "Ominasis Latvia" company Ķemeru sanatorijas mantas kopumu, which was sold out as "Park Hotel Ķemeri", but a month later the sale was recognized by a notarization, as the winner had not paid in the specified time by purchase.
The sale price was set according to the latest figures in the initial price - 2.86 million euros.
The LETA informed the representative of the city councils Ieva Aile, the municipality, signed the protocol, confirming that the European Union's structural funds would co-finance the infrastructure - the historic Ķemeru Park, the interactive nature tourism facilities, the sacred streets and the autostāvvietas.

Bijušā NATO commander Brīdlova e-pastu hacked into Russian hackers.
The hacker, who according to the US Democratic National Committee (DNC) datus, may have committed several other cyber-attacks, including the breach of NATO's European Forces former commander Filippa Brīdlova e-mail un Džordža Sorosa instituta "Atvērtā sabiedrība" serverus, the business news agency Bloomberg reported on Thursday.
The hackers published the information on "DCLeaks.com".
In between the quotes and the memoirs Brīdlova also wrote a diary about Sorosa instituta.
The hacker instituta datori were available for a long time.
Atbilstoši "Bloomberg" knows these cyber-uzbrukumus veikuši themselves and hackers associated with the Russian specdienestiem, as well as the DNC e-pastus.
The Wall Street Journal reports that the administration of US President Barack Obama is currently considering the issue of imposing new sanctions on Russia, in response to the DNC data breach.
If sanctions are imposed, the administration will be officially blamed for the cyber-attack on the part of the Democratic Party and on the hackers supported by Russia or Russian institutions.
According to reports, WikiLeaks published about 20,000 emails in July, which were obtained from the DNC's datorsystems and which noprotams, the Democratic Party leaders, had attempted to disrupt the party's candidate Hillary Clinton's former Senate candidate Vermontas Senator Bjarnia Sanders' campaign for the Democratic nomination at the start of the presidential election.
According to a US press release, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating a Democratic server hacking, as well as other US experts believe that Russia's involvement in cybercrime is not a threat.
Makartnijs: The presence of Joko Ono endangered "The Beatles".
Pols Makartnijs has said that the presence of Joko Ono has lifted the feeling of danger posed by the legendary group The Beatles.
The 74-year-old rock star currently maintains a "old" relationship with fellow rapper Jonah Lennon, but during the time when her band was recording in the studio, Makartniju offered her a job, and Ono was the only female member of the group - Jorge Harisona, Ringo Stāra, Lenona un Makartnija - among them.
When asked about his relationship with Abu, he replied to Rolling Stone magazine: "Tās ir patiesi is outside".
We tolaik jutāmies are endangered.
While we were recording, she was sitting on the amplifiers.
Most of the group were the most peaceful.
We had spoken, but not quite successfully, and we were very surprised.
We were sexists, but girls usually didn't come to the recording studio, and they let us do jobs.
Kad Jones started satictions at Joko, she didn't sit on the control panel, but rather in the middle of the four of us.
The authors of the recording "Yellow Submarine" also acknowledged that the band, now regularly signed to the band's former band, Ringo, occasionally confirmed recordings from the studio "Apple" darba planous, but otherwise "The Beatles" and "beiguši darboties".
Jautāts, or he is still satiekas ar another the only still living legendary rock band of the same name, Makartnijs' Rolling Stone magazine said: "Bieži nē".
We sat together at social events un ballītēs.
But with meetings, there are some limitations.
It's not the "Apple" I left behind during a tough divorce.
Instead of having meetings, I sent John Īstmenu un teicu: "Atstāsti man, ko visi saka, jo es nevaru ciest sitting pie tā galda".
It was too painful to see my pet dying.
The undertakings now work, as it is only a nuisance of all the writings.
I am not part of the approval process.
NASA climate modelis: Venus was once a planetary life.
In addition to NASA's latest climate models, Venus was once a living planet.
Scientists at NASA's Godarda Institute for Space Studies have developed models to study the history of Venus using a rigid algorithm, which is also used by climate scientists.
Models have been developed, to determine whether Venus, whose surface is karst, whose water is shallow and whose atmosphere is composed almost exclusively of carbon, once having conditions similar to those of Earth.
Scientists have already excavated the mines in advance, as the velocities of the Venus flying are explained by the atmosphere.
But recent simulations suggest that since Venus was once flat, Zemei has an atmosphere similar to that of a gray planet.
Modelis also explores the agrēras topography of Venus.
On the planets there was more sausa apgabala than on Earth, but on them there was enough water and geographical diversity, so that life could be created unnecessarily exhausted.
Agrīnās Venus laikos Saul was about 30 percent spožžaki.
In a simulation of the GISS model, Venus's Greek models reveal, every day, a bright part of it for at least 2 months, a press release from GISS researcher Antonijs Del Genio.
This process of silda planet surface un causes the lutus, which in turn forms some male slāns, which act as lietussargs, passing past planet no Saules karstuma.
The result is a measured climate temperature, which is actually a much higher temperature than the temperature on Earth today.
The model depicts the history of Venus, similar to the theory of evolution, developed by scientists in their own hypotheses.
Once upon a time, during the course of several billion years, Venus was subjected to too little heat and ultraviolet radiation.
Their oceans are swirling, and they are still emitting old ultraviolet radiation.
When completely exhausted, only the flat carbon dioxide left in the atmosphere and the greenhouse gases that are emitted - Venus, which we see today.
The researchers published the results of the new Venus climate model in the journal Geophysical Research Letters.
Patriks Rojs has been relieved of his "Avalanche" coaching duties.
On Thursday, Colorado "Avalanche" coaches of a hockey operation, Vice President Patriks Rojs, presented his insight, as a reason, and the team's influence in decision-making.
Colorado vice president and general manager Joe Sakiks confirmed this message to the media, saying the clubs would immediately begin looking for a new coach.
"For the past three years, I have been energetic, diligent and purposefully fulfilling my duties as head coach and vice president of Colorado club hockey operations", 50-year-old Royce said in a statement.
During this summer, I have asked a lot about how to improve team performance, but not the necessary amount of effort to achieve higher levels of results.
In order to achieve this, the head coach of a hockey operation, Vice President of Vision, must fully sanctify the organization's vision.
He must also be able to influence decisions regarding team performance.
At present, these conditions are met.
Sakiks, who hired Roju on May 23, 2013, thanked Rojam for his contribution to the team.
Sakiks said that Patriks informed him of his decision today.
We appreciate the fact that he has given his best to the organization and we want to see him continue to do so.
In his first season with the Avalanche team in 2013-14, Rojs was recognized as the league's best coach and received the Jeka Adamsa Award.
He helped the club reach 112 points and a first place finish in the Central Division, and the Colorado team beat the Minnesota Hockey League in the first round of the playoffs.
The Avalanche finished the 2015-16 season with a 39-39-4 record, a pivotal point behind the Wild teams, and were not able to secure another special invitation from the Rietumu Conferences organisers.
The Roses won four Stanley Cups in their career - two against the Montreal Canadiens and two against the Avalanche.
Workers of North Korean oil rigs are on strike for waste.
Darbinieku strikes by the workers of the North Korean oil platform are planned to be carried out, and the parties involved in the strike have resumed the strike, the leaders of the strike said.
Periodically, the oil processing company Wood Group also staged strikes on North Korean oil platforms, where the company Royal Dutch Shell operates.
In the joint statement, the aim is to ensure that the Wood Group, a United States-based organization, and the RMMT, are committed to securing the benefits of the strike.
Several full-day meetings are planned over the course of each week, starting early next week with the aim of reviewing problematic issues.
The company announced that it would be taking measures, organized after a 25-year break, to reduce wages by 30 percent.
Due to negative market pressure, the Wood Group reduced the wages of workers in Northern Ireland by 9 percent this year.
In 2014, the company reduced the wages of workers in the land by 10 percent.
The company is clear, with additional wage cuts allowing companies to overcome market upsets.
Shell has already cut wages to several thousand people and announced plans to halt oil and gas operations in 10 countries to optimize its work, in preparation for a large-scale merger with British energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from the rise in oil prices, and the situation is more complicated by Britain's decision to withdraw from the European Union.
Earlier this week, Scottish Parliament MP Deivs Andersons met with workers' representatives to discuss one of the most important issues - the North-Jurassic strike plan.
He said that North Georgia is a vital economic region.
In his report, he made clear that Northern Georgia as a state needs an economy as a whole, not a vision of its own interests, rather than individual ones.
In 2016, new Northern Jurassic projects are expected to invest nearly $1.4 billion, compared with $7 billion invested over the past five years.
Keplers measured the rate of gravitational pull of stars in the Pleiades star.
The mission of the Jaunākā Keplera telescope and helped astronomers to compile a more detailed catalogue by the speed of star movement in the Plejādes constellation.
The data from this study helps astronomers understand why stars in this star are moving at different speeds, as well as how the speed of star movement can be attributed to planetary formation.
"Mēs ceram, by comparing our results with other stars, we obtain more intimate information about the relationship between the masses of stars, the age and the history of their solar system", said Luisa Rebula, a scientist at the Pasadenas Caltech Infrasarkano Process un Center Analytical.
The Plejadas stars are located 445 light-years away from Earth.
Many stars in this star are just beginning to rise, reaching a length of about 125 million years.
They are moving at their maximum speed.
Rising at their maximum speed, these rising stars emit large amounts of stellar wind.
They reach the magnetic field of the stars, which brakes the stars.
Zvaigznēm novecojot, to grešanās velocities decreased.
Keplers measure the rate of star retreat and the time between the atpazinst stars, such as the plankumu saules, appearing.
Catalogs of the youngest stars and the fastest star-growing stars show that larger stars are slowly moving than smaller stars.
Rebels compare stars to deities, and larger augum makers perform piruetes less than male augum makers.
Rebuls tell us, in Plejadas "ballet" views, that the more rotating objects are larger and more massive, while the faster-rotating objects are very massive stars.
In fact, the Plejādes's starry area is located in the tik tuvu, tas kalpo kā the great cosmological laboratory, where we can compare the characteristics of the stars and the velocities of their movement.
Rebels tells us that Plejadas' stars help to develop theoretical models for the rotation of stars in two directions, the older and the younger.
We still have a lot to learn, and why the acceleration of the burning stars is slowing down.
Rebuls and his colleagues presented in detail the analysis of the speed of the Plejadas stars' drift in three new publications, which will soon be published in Astronomijas Žurnal.
