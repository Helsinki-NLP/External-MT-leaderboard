Welsh members of the National Assembly fear not to be taken seriously
Several members of the National Assembly were recently alarmed by a proposal to change their name from assembly member or AM (assembly member) to member of the Welsh Parliament or MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
The reaction came because of plans to change the name of the national assembly to the Welsh Parliament.
Members of several political parties are concerned that they may be ridiculed.
A Labour MP said his group was concerned about the MWP rhymes on Twp and Pwp
For readers outside Wales: In Welsh, twp means foolish and pwp means crass.
A member of the Plaid party said that the ikkje group is "numb" and has proposed alternatives.
A Welsh Conservative member said that his group has an "open mind" when it comes to the name change, but added that MWP is not far from the word "muppet".
In this context, the Welsh letter w is pronounced not unlike the English Yorkshire dialect's pronunciation of the letter u.
The National Assembly's delegation, which is now writing a bill to introduce the name change, said: "The final decision on what the members of the National Assembly shall be called will of course be up to the members themselves".
A 2017 Welsh official decision gave the national assembly the power to change its name.
In June, the delegation published the results of a public hearing on the name proposal, which showed strong support for calling the assembly the Welsh Parliament.
In the case of the title of national assembly member, the delegation prefers the position of a Welsh parliament member or WMP, while the MWP election received the most support during the public hearing.
The National Assembly members have apparently come up with other proposals, but the struggle to remain united has given the leader of the delegation, Elin Jones, headwork, who will deliver the bill in a couple of weeks.
The reforms contained other changes to how the delegation should function, including rules on disqualification of congregation members and the design of a committee system.
The members of the Assembly will be able to vote on what they will be called when debating the bill.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
Voters will vote on Sunday to change the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
The referendum was decided to resolve a conflict that had been ongoing for decades with the neighbouring country of Greece, which has its own province named Macedonia.
Athens has long insisted that the name of the neighbouring country in the north represents a claim to the territory and has had numerous objections to Macedonia's membership applications to the EU and NATO.
The Macedonian president Gjorge Ivanov, an opponent of the referendum on the name change, said he would ignore the result.
Those who support the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the name change is simply the price of membership in the EU and NATO.
The bells of St. Martin's are ringing while the churches of Harlem, New York, are struggling
"The old lady I talked to said that in the old days there was a bar and a church on every corner", said Adams.
None of the parts are extant today.
He said he understood why the bars disappear.
"People are socializing in other ways nowadays", he said.
Children are no longer the usual places in the neighborhood.
As for the churches, he is concerned that the money from the sale of the properties will not last as long as the leaders think, and sooner or later they will be back where they started.
He added that churches could be replaced by apartments filled with the kind of people who don't care about helping the historic places in the neighborhood.
"The vast majority of people who buy condos in these buildings are white", he said. "And so the day comes when all the churches are closed, because it's unlikely that these people who move into the condos are going to become members of those churches.
Both churches were built of white cotton before Harlem became a black borough - Metropolitan Community in 1870, and Saint Martin's Church a decade later.
The traditional white Methodist congregation moved out in the 1930s.
A black soothsayer who had been preaching in the vicinity moved into the building.
Saint Martin was taken over by a black vigilante led by pastor John Howard Johnson, who also led the boycott of the shops on 125th street, a main shopping street in Harlem where owners were opposed to the establishment or promotion of blacks.
The building was badly damaged in a fire in 1939, but when the followers of pastor Johnson planned to rebuild it, they also ordered a new clock.
Pastor David Johnson, son of Johnson senior and successor of Saint Martin, was proud to call the bell game the "clock of the poor".
The expert who played the July clock called it something else: "A cultural treasure and an irreplaceable historical instrument".
The expert, Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan, also commented that it was the first bell in the world to be played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who left the church to play the larger bell in the Riverside church 18 years ago.
Merriweather said that Saint Martin did not find a replacement for him.
What has happened in Saint Martin in recent months has become a complicated tale of architects and building workers, some of them employed by the leaders of the lay people of the church, and others by the episcopal bishopric.
The sacristy, which leads the congregation and consists of the leaders of the lay people, wrote to the bishop in July with concerns that the bishop would ask the sacristy to pay, even though the sacristy was not involved in the bishop's appointment of architects and building workers.
Some of the members of the congregation have complained about the lack of openness from the bishopric.
13-year-old injured by shark under lobster dive in California
Authorities report that a 13-year-old boy was attacked by a shark on Saturday while diving for lobsters in California on the opening day of the lobster season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been diving with friends for about half an hour on Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help, paddled off to the boy with a group and pulled him out of the water.
Hammel said that at first he thought the boy was just excited to catch a lobster, until he realized that the boy was shouting "Noko bite me!"
Something bit me!
"His whole collarbone was torn off", Hammel said, "and he observed when he reached the boy".
I shouted that everyone had to get out of the water: There's a shark in the water!
Guten was picked up by an air ambulance and taken to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, and his condition is critical.
It's unclear what type of shark attacked the boy.
Badewatt captain Larry Giles said in a press conference that a shark had been observed in the area a few weeks earlier, but that the shark was not a dangerous black shark.
Giles added that the boy suffered serious injuries to his upper body.
Authorities shut down access to water from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swamis in Ecinitas for 48 hours to investigate and secure the area.
Giles commented that there are more than 135 different species of sharks in the area, but most are not believed to be dangerous.
The Sainsbury's boutique focuses on beauty products
The British chain Sainsbury's will compete with Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams beauty products and offer department store services in the store.
As part of an investment in the UK's £2.8bn beauty market, which continues to grow while fashion and interior sales are declining, Sainsbury's will test their beauty products in 11 stores next year, and more if successful.
The investment in beauty products comes at a time when the shelves that used to be filled with TVs, microwave ovens and interiors are now empty.
Sainbury's said they will double the number of beauty products to 3000 products and offer the brands Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
They will give L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees more space and have separate areas for each brand as in the Boots-butikken.
The store will also relaunch its own boutique makeup line and make most of its products vegan, which will attract more young customers.
In addition, the perfume retailer Fragrance Shop will test sales of its perfumes in two of its Sainsbury's stores, the first opening in Croydon, London, last week, and the second opening in Selly Oak, Birmingham, later this year.
Online shopping and a shift towards buying small amounts of food every day from local small shops means that large chain stores must find new ways to reach customers.
Mike Coupe, the managing director of Sainsbury's, has commented that the stores will look more and more like the department store, while the chain is trying to fight the low-price Aldi and Lidl stores with more services and non-food items.
Sainsbury's has partnered with interior chain Argos in hundreds of stores and introduced several Habitat stores since they bought both chains two years ago, claiming that this has increased food sales and thus protected the acquisition.
The chain's earlier attempts to renew its beauty and pharmacy departments were not a success.
Sainsbury's's partnership with Boots ended in the early 2000s, when the parties failed to agree on how to share the profits from the pharmacy in the stores.
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury's sold its 281-unit pharmacy Celesio, which owned Lloyds, for £125 million three years ago.
They added that Lloyds still has a role to play and will offer an extensive luxury range of skin products, including the La Roche-Posay and Vichy brands, in four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, Sainsbury's commercial director, commented: "We have changed the way beauty shelters look and feel to improve the environment for our customers.
We also have hired colleagues with special skills who will be able to offer beauty services.
Our brands are designed to fit every need, while the attractive environment and the practical locations mean that we are now an attractive beauty destination that challenges the old way of shopping.
Peter Jones after Holly Willoghby withdrew from £11 million deal
The star of the television programme Dragons Den, Peter Jones, is stunned after TV host Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11 million deal with his lifestyle brand to focus on his new contracts with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby has no time to promote their interior and accessories brand Truly.
The pair's collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning made the newcomer famous on Instagram.
Holly Willoughby has left Dragons Den star Peter Jones in the midst of developing their new lifestyle brand collaboration to focus on her own contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources report that Jones was "astonished" when the golden Holly admitted during an intense meeting on Tuesday in Jones's headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that Holly's new contracts - worth up to £1.5 million - meant she no longer had time to collaborate on the interior and accessories brand Truly.
The collaboration has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand and was believed to double Willoughby's estimated fortune of £11 million.
Willoughby, 37, used Instagram to announce that she would not be working with Truly, while Jones fled the UK to calm down in one of her holiday homes.
A source said: "Truly was definitely on top of Holly's priorities.
It was to be her long-term plan for the future, and it was to last for many decades.
Her decision to withdraw has surprised everyone involved.
No one believed their own ears on Tuesday, Truly was so close to launching.
There's a warehouse in Marlow full of goods ready for sale.
Experts believe the decision by the This Morning host, one of the richest stars in the UK, could cost the company millions due to hefty investments in products, from pillows to candles to clothing and interiors, and could cause delays with the launch.
And it could mean the end of a long friendship.
Willoughby, who is the mother of three, and her husband, Dan Baldwin, have been close friends of Jones and his wife, Tara Capp, for ten years.
Willoughby created the brand Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
The couple are on holiday together and Jones owns 40 percent of Baldwin's television production company.
Willoughby will become brand ambassador for M&S and will replace Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's Im A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night, "We don't comment on his business".
Tough conversations and we fell in love
He blamed the criticism he came to receive from the media for coming up with a comment that some might perceive as "uppresidential" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
Why has President Trump given up so much?
Said Trump in his dumb, news-reader voice.
I haven't given up on anything.
He commented that Kim is interested in a new meeting after their first meeting in Singapore in June, which Trump called a major step toward the disarmament of North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
But the nuclear talks have stopped.
More than three months after the June meeting in Singapore, North Korea's top diplomat Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea has not received a "corresponding response" from the United States regarding North Korea's early disarmament.
Instead, he added, the US continued with sanctions to pressure North Korea.
Trump was much more optimistic in his speech.
"It's going great with us and North Korea", he said.
We were going to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people would be killed.
Now we have a great relationship.
He added that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results - the end of the missile test, aid to the release of hostages and the return of the remains of American soldiers.
He defended his unusual approach to Kim's relationship.
"It's so easy to be president, but instead of having 10,000 people outside trying to get in, we'd have about 200 people standing right there", Trump said, pointing to the group standing in front of him.
Tsunami and earthquake in Indonesia devastate island and kill hundreds
After the Lombok earthquake, foreign aid organizations were told that they were no longer needed.
Although more than 10 percent of the inhabitants of Lombok had to flee, no one declared a national crisis state, which is necessary to get international emergency aid.
"Unfortunately, in many cases they have been very clear that they don't want international help, so it's a bit challenging", Sumbung said.
While Redd Barna set up a team to travel to Palu, it is still not certain whether employees with foreign passports will be allowed to work in the field.
Sutopo, the spokesman for the Bureau for National Crises in Indonesia, said authorities are assessing the situation in Palu to see if international organizations are allowed to offer emergency assistance.
Although Indonesia is often subject to earthquakes, it is not particularly prepared for natural disasters.
In Aceh, they have built tsunami shelters, but they are not common in the rest of the country.
Despite tsunami warnings in Palu, there was no alarm, which most likely led to more casualties.
Traveling between the Indonesian islands is usually quite challenging.
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated.
A hospital ship that was at the Lombok dock to treat those injured in the earthquake is now on its way to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the new disaster.
President Joko Widodo focused on improving infrastructure in Indonesia during the presidential election, and has spent a lot of money on new roads and railways.
But lack of funding has made it difficult for the administration of President Joko, and next year there are elections again.
President Joko is also under pressure when it comes to sectarian tensions in Indonesia, while members of the Muslim majority have welcomed his conservative faith.
More than 1,000 people were killed and tens of thousands fled as Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets using machetes, arrows, bows, and other primitive weapons.
Watch: Daniel Sturridge saves Liverpool against Chelsea in the final
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from a Premier League defeat to Chelsea by scoring in the 89th minute on Saturday at Stamford Bridge, London.
Sturridge got the ball from Xherdan Shaqiri about 30 metres from Chelsea's goal while the score was 1-0.
He pushed the ball to the left before kicking it up and towards the goal.
The attempt sailed high over the straffe field and fauceted towards the right upper corner of the target.
Finally, the ball fell over a jumping Kepa Arrizabalaga and into goal.
"I was just trying to get into that position to get the ball, and I knew that players like Shaq try to get as far as possible, so I just tried to give myself as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante come and lose the ball once without thinking about it, and then I shot the ball.
Chelsea led 1-0 after the break after the 25th minute scoring by Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Before the goal, Hazard passed the ball to Mateo Kovacic before he spanned off near the midfield and into the Liverpool half.
Kovacic quickly took the ball on the midfield.
Then he shot it nicely and led Hazard into the penalty area.
Hazard ran faster than Liverpool's defence and scored with his left foot right past keeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will play Napoli in the group stage of the Champions League at 15 o'clock on Wednesday at Stadio San Paolo in Napoli, Italy.
Chelsea are set to face Videoton in the UEFA Europa League at 15pm on Thursday in London.
The number of victims in Indonesia-tsunami rises to 832
The number of victims of the Indonesia earthquake and tsunami has risen to 832, the country's crisis bureau reported early Sunday.
Many people were caught in the ruins of buildings that collapsed in the earthquake, which occurred on Friday and had a strength of 7.5 followed by 6 meter high waves, the crisis bureau's spokesman, Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, reported in a press conference.
The city of Palu, which has more than 380,000 inhabitants, is now covered with collapsed buildings.
British police arrest man, 32, suspected of murder after woman was stabbed to death
A murder investigation has begun after a woman was found murdered in Birkenhead, Merseyside, early today.
The 44-year-old woman was found knifed at 07:55 in Grayson Mews in John Street, while a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police have sought tips from local residents about the incident.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is still in an early stage, but I would urge anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who saw or heard anything suspicious to contact us".
I also encourage everyone, including taxi drivers, who can record on the dashboard camera, to contact us if they have any important information.
A police official confirmed that the woman was from Birkenhead, and that she was found in a home.
This afternoon, friends who think they know the woman came to the area to ask where she was found this morning.
Investigation is ongoing and police have announced that they are in the process of informing the victim's family.
A taxi driver living in Grayson Mews has tried to enter his own apartment, but has been told by the police that no one is allowed to enter or exit the building.
He didn't know what to say when he found out what had happened.
Residents have been told not to enter their homes for several hours.
Someone overheard a police officer saying to a man that the whole area is a mess.
A woman came to the scene crying.
She keeps saying, "It's so terrible".
At 14 one could see two police cars inside the police band and finally one police car outside the band.
A number of policemen stood within the police band and observed a block of apartments.
If anyone has any information, they can send a DM to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crimestoppers anonymously by calling +44 (0) 800 555 111 with the reference log 247 from 30.09.
Parliament statue of Cromwell becomes last victim of the rewrite of history
The removal of the statue would be the karma of Cromwell and the Taliban-like destruction of several cultural and religious objects in England that his puritans did during the civil war of the 16th century.
However, the Cromwell Association described Crick's proposal for the statue's removal as tøys and eit attempt to write about history.
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Association, said: "It was inevitable in the current debate about the removal of statues that the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace should become a target.
The iconoclasm of the English Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Perhaps Cromwell's mistake would have been the victim of the actions of his ancestor, Thomas, in the previous century.
Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft's excellent representation of Cromwell is evidence of public opinion in the 19th century, and is part of the historiography of a figure that many still consider worthy of celebration.
Goldsmith told The Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell was in the 1800s, and is still today, seen as a defender of Parliament against external pressure, and in his case it was of course against the monarchy.
Whether this representation is correct or not is still a topic of historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict of the mid-17th century has shaped the development of our nation, and Cromwell was an individual that we know represented one side of that divide.
What he achieved as Lord Protector is also worthy of celebration and remembrance.
Murder pigs attack and kill Chinese farmer
A farmer was attacked and killed by a pig at a market in southwest China, according to local media reports.
The man, surnamed Yuan, was found dead, with his pulse cut and covered in blood, near a pig's belly at the market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig-eating pig is reported to have given pigs vaccines on a farm on May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He had recently traveled with his cousin from the neighbouring province of Yunnan on Wednesday to sell 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning he found his cousin dead, and discovered that the door of one of the pig-houses was open.
He said that in the binge there was a big male with blood around the mouth.
The autopsy showed that a 250-kilogram pig had killed the farmer, according to the report.
"My cousin's legs were bloody and ruined", the cousin, whose name is Wu, told the Guiyang Evening News.
Surveillance cameras show that Yuan arrived at the market at 04:40 on Thursday to feed the pigs.
His body was found about an hour later.
The animal that killed him did not belong to Yuan or his cousin.
The market leader told Evening News that the pig had been locked up to prevent him from attacking others, while the police gathered evidence of the incident.
Yuan's family is now negotiating compensation with the leader of the market.
Although rare, such attacks by pigs have occurred before.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband in Massachusetts, causing serious injuries.
Ten years earlier, a 295 kg pig, a Welsh farmer, was caught between himself and a tractor, until his wife shredded the pig.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a Manitoba farmer reported to CBC News that pigs are not aggressive to humans, but that the taste of blood can trigger the animal.
They just want to play.
They like to bite, they're curious... they don't want to hurt you.
You just have to have enough respect for them, he said.
Remains of Hurricane Rosa bring rain to southwest USA
As forecast in the weather report, Rosa is weakening over the cool waters along the northern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain to northern Mexico and southwestern United States in the coming days.
Rosa had winds of 136 km/h and was a category 1 hurricane until 05:00 am in the eastern time zone of the United States on Sunday, and the center of the storm was 620 kilometres southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rosa will move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a low pressure over the Pacific Ocean is moving eastward toward the west coast of the United States, with the Rosa approaching the Baja California peninsula on Monday in the form of a tropical storm, and will move tropical humidity northward to the southwest United States.
Rosa will bring up to 25 centimeters of rain to parts of Mexico on Monday.
The tropical humidity will react with the low pressure and cause heavy rainfall in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, between 3 and 10 centimeters of rain can create dangerous floods and possible landslides in the desert.
Tropical humidity will cause rainfall of between 5 and 7 centimeters per hour in some parts of the southwest United States, particularly in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona.
Between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain is expected in parts of the southwest United States; especially over large parts of Arizona.
Dangerous flows can occur due to spread of terrain and tropical rain.
It is advised against hiking in the desert on foot due to the danger of tropical rain.
Rain can make the river rivers slip and lightning and thunderstorms can bring strong winds and dust.
The coming low pressure will also bring rain to parts of the coast of southern California.
Total precipitation of over 1 centimeter is possible, which can create small flows and smooth roads.
This will be the first rainfall of the season in the region.
Spread of tropical rainfall will start in Arizona late Sunday evening and early Monday morning, before rain increases late on Monday and Tuesday.
The Four Corners region is expected to see heavy rainfall on Tuesday and Wednesday.
October may witness intense temperature fluctuations throughout the United States while the Arctic becomes colder, but tropical regions will still be quite warm.
Sometimes this leads to dramatic differences in temperatures, even between small areas.
Sunday was an example of dramatic temperature differences in central parts of the United States.
There is nearly a 20 degree temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, and between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa.
In the next few days, the late summer heat will try to build up and spread again.
Much of the central and eastern United States is expected to experience a warm start on October, with 25 degrees and upward from southern portions of the Great Plains to parts of northeastern United States.
New York City could reach 25 degrees on Tuesday, which is about 10 degrees above the average.
The long-term forecast indicates that there are high chances of above-average temperatures in the eastern United States during the first half of October.
More than 20 million people are watching Brett Kavanaugh's hearing
On Thursday, more than 20 million people watched the testimony of Brett Kavanaugh in the U.S. Supreme Court and the woman who accused him of sexual assault in the 1980s, Christine Blasey Ford, on six different television channels.
Meanwhile, the political discussion surrounding the case continued, with the usual television programs of various broadcasting companies interrupted to reveal the latest news on Friday: an agreement reached by Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake that the FBI would investigate the allegations during the next week.
Ford told the Supreme Court that she was 100 percent sure that Kavanaugh had assaulted her when he was drunk and tried to take off her dress at a high school party.
Kavanaugh said, during a sensitive hearing, that he was 100 percent sure that it didn't happen.
More than 20.4 million people were likely to have watched the hearing on Friday, according to Nielsen.
The company came up with this number by finding the average number of viewers on CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News and MSNBC.
The speech was not clear from other channels that showed the debriefing, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network.
Nielsen also has trouble counting viewers who watch from the office.
To put this in perspective, it's the same number of viewers watching a football final or the Oscars.
Fox News' hosts have backed Kavanaugh, and the channel was also the most-watched during the day with 5.69 million viewers, Nielsen said.
ABC was second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS had 3.1 million viewers, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, Nielsen said.
People are still interested in the hearing.
Flake was in focus during the drama on Friday.
After Flake, a moderate Republican, declared that he was on Kavanaugh's side, he was filmed by CNN and CBS while protesters shouted for him on his way to a Friday hearing with a judging committee.
He stood and looked at the ground for minutes while the protestors shut him up on CNN live.
"I'm standing right here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he's telling the truth to our country?
Some of them said to her, "You are strong, but so many women are weak".
Flake said that his office had made a statement, and before he went into the elevator he said that he would have more to say during the committee hearing.
The circuit-casting agency aired the hearing on television when the judges' committee voted for or against Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate and further voting.
But Flake said he could only do that if the FBI investigates the allegations against Kavanaugh within the next week, which the Democrats have also demanded.
Flake was partly convinced after speaking with his friend, the democrat and senator Chris Coons.
After consulting with Coons and several other senators, Flake made a decision.
Flake's decision proved to be powerful, as it became clear that the Republicans could not vote for Kavanaugh without an investigation.
President Trump has opened an FBI investigation into the allegations against Kavanaugh.
Theresa May accuses critics of "leaking politics" when it comes to Brexit
Prime Minister Theresa May blames critics of her plans to leave the EU for "sweeping politics" with the UK's future without regard for national interests, in an interview with the Sunday Times.
Theresa May is in Birmingham, England, to attend the Conservative Party's conference on 29 September 2018.
The interview with former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, which is published on the front page of the Sunday Times, attacked the so-called Chequers plan for Brexit, saying that the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's taxes is "totally absurd".
The Wayde Sims shooting in the United States: Police arrest suspect Dyteon Simpson for the Sims shooting
Police have arrested a man suspected of the fatal shooting death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old basketball player from Louisiana State University (LSU).
Dyteon Simpson, 20, is arrested and imprisoned for premeditated murder, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, say.
An official video shows the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the fight.
Police found the glasses at the scene and said they found Simpson's DNA on them, according to a report from the WAFB-channel, which is linked to CBS.
After the interview with Simpson, the police said he admitted to shooting Wayde.
Simpson's bail was set at $350 000, reports local newspaper The Advocate.
The coroner of East Baton Rouge released an early obituary report on Friday that showed the cause of death was a gunshot wound to the head that went into the neck.
The Baton Rouge Police Department thanks the Louisiana State Police Special Forces, the state police crime lab, the Southern University Police Department and local residents for helping find Simpson.
The athletic director at LSU, Joe Alleva, thanks the local police for being vigilant in the pursuit of justice.
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-tall basketball player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball for LSU.
In average he scored 5.6 points with 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "voting out" after Wayde was killed.
"It's something we're always afraid of", Wade said.
The volcano spews ash over Mexico City
Ash from the Popocatepetl volcano has reached southern parts of Mexico's capital.
The national center for crisis prevention urged Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Sunday after activity increased in the crater and the center recorded 183 gas and oscillations over 24 hours.
The center had observed several earthquakes and tremors.
Images on social media show thin layers of ash on cars in various neighborhoods in Mexico City, including Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have noted an increase in activity in the volcano, which lies 72 kilometres southeast of the capital, since a magnitude 7.1 earthquake struck central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano is known as "Don Goyo" and has been active since 1994.
Police support Catalonian separatists ahead of the independence vote
Six protesters were arrested in Barcelona on Saturday after pro-independence protesters clashed with police forces, and thousands of other protesters protested against independence one year after the vote on eventual expulsion from Spain.
A group of masked separatists were held back by police forces while throwing eggs and powdered lacquer that created dark clouds of dust in streets that are usually filled with tourists.
A riot broke out later that day, and the police used batons to prevent escalation.
For hours the separatists shouted "Never forget, never forgive", while the protestants against independence shouted, "Long live Spain".
Local news channels reported that fourteen people were treated for minor injuries after the protests.
The vote is still printed in the region and many still want independence one year after the 1 October referendum, which was declared illegal by Madrid but celebrated by separatists in Catalonia.
Most voters voted for independence, but there was also low participation among those who were against independence and boycotted the vote.
According to Catalan authorities, almost 1,000 people were injured last year after police attempted to prevent the vote and violent clashes erupted in the region.
Groups that were too independent slept in tents on Friday to prevent a demonstration in support of the state police.
The demonstration was however cancelled, but it was forced to take another route.
Narcis Termes, 68, an electrician who took part in the separatist protests with his wife, said he no longer had any hope for independence in Catalonia.
Last year we had one of our best moments.
I saw my parents crying for joy for being able to vote for independence, but now we're stuck again, he said.
Although they won the regional elections in December, the Catalan parties that are too independent are struggling to hold on to power this year, while many of their leaders are in exile or arrest while they await the trial for their role in the organisation of the referendum and the subsequent declaration of independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the protests in support of the police on her phone, said the conflict was being picked up by politicians on both sides.
"The tension is increasing", he said.
On Saturday Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been part of ongoing legal proceedings since last year, declared that he will stand for election to the European Parliament next year.
"Still being a candidate in the European elections is the best way to condemn the decline of democratic values and the repression we have experienced from the Spanish state", he said.
Londonderry, Northern Ireland: Men arrested for deliberately crashing into houses
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 have been arrested after deliberately crashing into a house several times in Londonderry, Northern Ireland.
The incident occurred in Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday around 19:30 local time.
Detective Inspector Bob Blemmings said the car caused damage to the entrance gate and the building itself.
An arm-brush may have been used to shoot the car.
Menga-shot gives Livingston 1-0 win over Rangers in Scottish football
Dolly Menga's first goal for Livingston secures victory
Livingston surprises Rangers and Steven Gerrard experiences his second victory after 18 matches as coach of Ibrox-klubben in Glasgow.
Dolly Menga's shot proved to be the difference while Gary Holt's side matched Hibernian's in the other.
Gerrard's side have no winners in the Scottish Premiership this season, and will play Hearts, who they are eight points behind, next Sunday.
Prior to that, Rangers will host Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston has six wins in a row, and head coach Holt has yet to lose since replacing Kenny Miler last month.
Livingston misses chances against the away team
Holt's team would have led long before they scored, and created several problems for Rangers with their direct play.
Scott Robinson broke through, but had low effort against goal, which made Alan Lithgow have to work hard after the meeting with Craig Halkett's heading over goal.
The home side were content to let Rangers play ahead of them, knowing that they could create trouble for the away team.
And that's how the deciding goal was scored.
Rangers went on a frispark and Livingston made an opening, Declan Gallagher and Robinson went against Menga, who took a touch and scored from the middle of the penalty area.
Prior to that, Rangers dominated the ball, but saw that the home defence was solid and the goalkeeper Liam Kelly was focused.
This pattern continued into the second half, although Alfredo Morelos forced Kelly to save a goal.
Scott Pittman tried to score, but was stopped by Rangers' keeper Allan McGregor, and Lithgow fled soon after the ball was returned from Livingston.
Passages were sent back and forth in the Livingston-straffefield, while two penalties - after Halkett's challenge to Glenn Middleton, and one for hands - were waved away.
'Fenomenally' by Livingston - analysis
BBC Scotland's Alasdair Lamont at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A phenomenal match and a phenomenal result for Livingston.
Kvar plays fantastically and still impresses on the curve upwards.
Their playing style has hardly changed since returning to the top-flight, but much of the credit for that goes to Holt for the way he has shocked the team since he was trained.
He had so many heroes.
Captain Halkett was intense, and organized a defense at military level, while Menga distracted Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall throughout the entire battle.
Rangers, on the other hand, were not motivated.
Still as good as they have been under Gerrard, they were not good enough this time.
They didn't play well enough, and only cut the home half once, which should make the Rangers realize they're no longer in the top flight.
Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
The leaders of Turkey and Germany smiled under blue skies when they met for breakfast on Saturday, September 29 in Berlin.
It's the last day of Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany - which it is hoped will repair relations between the two NATO countries.
The countries have been divided on human rights, press freedom and Turkey's role in the EU.
Erdogan went to Cologne to open a large, new mosque.
The city is home to the largest Turkish population outside Turkey.
The police prevented a crowd of over 25 000 from gathering in front of the mosque due to security concerns, but many of Erdogan's supporters gathered to see his president.
Hundreds of protesters against Erdogan - many of them Kurdish - also gathered to condemn Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to the country.
The protestant duels reflected the difference between German Turks, who see Erdogan as a hero, and others, who see him as an autocrat.
Car accident in Deptford, London: Cyclist killed after collision with car
A cyclist has lost his life in a collision with a car in London.
The collision occurred near the intersection of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy road in Deptford, southeast London, at 10:15 local time.
The driver stopped and an ambulance personnel quickly arrived, but the man died at the scene.
The collision occurred just a few months after another cyclist died when the driver stalled off in Childers Street, about 1.6 kilometres from the current accident.
Police in London reported that they are in the process of identifying the man and informing his family.
Vegans have been closed and buses have to drive around the area, while other motorists have been encouraged to avoid the area.
Long Lartin prison in England: Six guards injured in riot
Six prison guards have been injured in a riot in a high-security men's prison, the England prison office said.
The ongoing riots broke out in HMP Long Lartin prison in Worcestershire around 09:30 local time on Sunday.
Special Tornado forces are being deployed to quell the uprising, which involves eight prisoners in a separate part of the prison.
The guards have been treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison official said: "Special interest guards will calm the ongoing uprising in HMP Long Lartin.
Six guards have been treated for injuries.
We do not tolerate violence in our prisons, and we are prepared that those responsible will be reported to the police and may have to serve more time in prison.
There are more than 500 people in HMP Long Lartin, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the UK.
In June, it was reported that the prison director was being treated for injuries after a prisoner went on the attack.
And last October, special forces had to come to the prison to quell a serious riot in which prisoners threw billiard balls at the guards.
Hurricane Rosa threatens Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City with flooding (to benefit drought areas)
Tropical low pressure is rare in Arizona, but it is precisely such a weather phenomenon that is on its way toward Arizona early next week, in which the remnants of Hurricane Rosa pull southwest over the desert and create fear of flooding.
The national weather service has issued flood warnings on Monday and Tuesday in western Arizona and southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
The rose is expected to move directly over Phoenix on Tuesday, and may rain as early as late Monday.
The national weather service in Phoenix tweeted that only 20 tropical cyclones have had tropical storm- or low pressure status within 300 km of Phoenix since 1950.
Katrina (1967) was a hurricane that reached 60 kilometers within the Arizona border.
The latest models from the national hurricane center report between 5 and 10 centimeters of rain, with isolated amounts of up to 15 centimeters in the Mogollon Rim area of Arizona.
It can range from 2 to 5 centimeters in other areas of the southwest, including central parts of the Rocky Mountains and Great Basin, with isolated total amounts of up to 10 centimeters.
For areas outside the flood risk, the rain from Rosa can be a blessing in the drought.
Although flooding is a serious concern, it is likely to benefit areas of the southwest that are prone to drought.
According to drought monitors in the United States, extreme drought is over 40 percent of Arizona, the second highest drought category, weather.com reports.
First, the Rosa hurricane moves over the Baja California peninsula in Mexico.
With winds of over 135 kilometres per hour, Rosa is 619 kilometres south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and moving northward at a speed of 19 kilometres per hour.
The storm meets colder waters in the Pacific Ocean and therefore settles.
It is expected to reach the coast of Mexico with tropical storm strength, Monday afternoon or evening.
It's going to rain a lot in parts of Mexico, which could increase the risk of flooding.
Rainfall between 7 and 15 centimeters is expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora, with a possibility of up to 25 centimeters, weather.com reported.
Rosa will move northward along Mexico as a tropical storm before reaching the border of Arizona early Tuesday morning as a tropical low pressure, which will move further up through Arizona and into southern Utah Tuesday evening.
"The greatest danger to Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora, and the American southwest, " the National Hurricane Center said.
This rain is expected to create life-threatening floods in desert areas and landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: Four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenage boys and a 20-year-old man have been arrested on suspicion of murder after a 16-year-old was found stabbed to death in Somerset, England.
The teenage boy was found injured in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 04:00 on Saturday.
He was transported to hospital, and his condition is stable.
A 17-year-old, two 18-year-olds and a 20-year-old man were arrested in the Radstock area last night, Avon and Somerset police report.
The police have urged people who can have cell phone recordings of what happened to contact us.
Trump says Kavanaugh was "bad" and "angry" the Democrats were against him
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and unreasonable tactics of the Democrats", Trump said during a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said that Kavanaugh has suffered from how bad and angry the Democrats were through the nomination process.
Kavanaugh testified before Congress on Thursday, emotionally denying Christine Blasey Ford's accusation that he sexually assaulted her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified about her allegations during the hearing.
The president said on Saturday that the American people saw how brilliant and courageous Kavanaugh was that day.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished lawyers of our time, a lawyer with impeccable public service", he told a crowd in West Virginia.
The president also referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke about the importance of Republicans voting in the midterm elections.
Five weeks to one of the most important choices in our lives.
I'm not acting, but I'm really acting, he said.
That's why I travel around to fight for good candidates.
Trump argued that the Democrats are looking to resist and block.
The first major vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, a Republican representative told CNN.
Hundreds killed in earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia, death toll rises
At least 384 people have been killed, many of them by huge waves on beaches, while a powerful earthquake and tsunami hit the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, authorities reported on Sunday.
Hundreds of people gathered to take part in a festival on the beach in the city of Palu on Friday when the waves, which were six metres high, hit the beach at sunset, taking many people while destroying everything they came across.
The tsunami came after a 7.5 magnitude earthquake.
"When the tsunami warning came yesterday, there were still people on the beach who did not go with us and so they became victims", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesman for Indonesia's crisis-management agency BNPB, in Jakarta.
"As if the tsunami wasn't enough in itself, he brought cars, trestams, houses; he hit everything on land", said Nugroho, adding that the tsunami had traveled over open seas at a speed of 800 km/h before reaching the coast.
Some climbed up in trees to avoid the tsunami and survived in that way.
Around 16 700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial photos published by the crisis agency show many destroyed buildings and shops, twisted and collapsed bridges and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to hit the coast on Saturday.
The earthquake was felt in the surrounding area, which has a population of 2.4 million.
Indonesia's Bureau for Testing and Testing Technology (BPPT) said the energy from Friday's earthquake was about 200 times stronger than the energy from the atomic bombing of Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which lies at the end of a long, narrow wave, may have increased the size of the tsunami, the agency said.
Nugroho described the damage as "extensive" and said thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping centers and hotels had collapsed.
The bodies of the dead were found under the remains of collapsed buildings, he said, adding that 540 people were injured and 29 are still missing.
Nugroho said the number of casualties and the extent of the destruction could be greater along the coast 300 km north of Palu, in an area called Donggala, which is closer to the epicenter of the quake.
"We haven't heard from Donggala, the communication is cut off", said Nugroho.
"More than 300 000 people live there", the Red Cross said, adding that their staff and volunteers are on their way to the affected areas.
"This is already a tragedy, but it could be much worse", said the Red Cross.
The crisis agency was criticized on Saturday for not informing that a tsunami had hit Palu, although authorities said waves came within the timeframe of the warning.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the top floor of a building desperately calling out to people down the street to warn them of the coming wave.
A few minutes later, a wall of water hits the coast, taking buildings and cars with it.
Reuters was not able to verify the video at first.
The earthquake and tsunami caused power outages and cut communications around Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate emergency aid.
The military has started the process of sending in cargo planes with aid from Jakarta and other cities, authorities report, but the refugees still need food and other basic needs.
The city's airports were reopened to receive emergency aid, but will remain closed until October.
It was planned that President Joko Widodo would visit the evacuation centre in Palu on Sunday.
The death toll in Indonesia has exceeded 800.
It's very bad.
World Vision employees from Donggala have arrived safely in Palu city and set up tents in the backyard of their office, passing the total devastated area on their way to the city, Doseba said.
"They saw many houses in ruins", he said.
It's very bad.
While aid organizations are beginning to help those affected by the tsunami, some have complained that foreign aid workers with expertise in crisis management have been denied entry to Palu.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid organizations and their employees cannot start the work until Indonesia has declared the area a national crisis zone.
It hasn't happened yet.
"It's a crisis at the provincial level", said Aulia Arriani, a spokesman for the Red Cross in Indonesia.
When the government says, "OK, this is a national crisis", we can send international aid, but they haven't updated the status yet.
It's evening again in Palu after the earthquake and tsunami on Friday, and friends and family of those still missing are still hoping for a miracle, but know that such natural disasters don't end well.
On Saturday, a little boy was rescued from the sewer.
On Sunday, a woman was rescued from the remains of a collapsed building, where she had been trapped by the side of her dead mother for two days.
Gendon Subandono, the coach of the Indonesian paragliding team, trained two of the missing paragliders from the Asian Games that ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
A man named Mandagi said that some of those who were trapped in the Roa Roa hotel were his students.
"As someone with a lot of experience in paragliding, I have my own emotional burden to bear", he said.
Gendon said he desperately sent WhatsApp messages to the Palu paragliders, who had taken part in the local strandfestival, after hearing that the Roa Roa hotel had collapsed.
But his messages showed only one gray hook, instead of two blue hooks.
"I think that means the messages didn't come through", he said.
Thieves steal $26,750 from a minibank in Newport, Levee, USA
On Friday, a thief stole $26 750 from a worker at Brink's while filling up a minibank in Newport, Levee, USA, according to a press release from the Newport police.
The worker had just emptied a minibank in the entertainment area and was in the process of delivering more money, detective Dennis McCarthy stated in the press release.
While the worker was busy, a man jumped up behind the worker and stole a sack of money to be delivered.
Witnesses observed several suspects fleeing the scene, according to the press release, but police could not determine the number of people involved in the robbery.
If anyone has information about who was involved, they should call the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: Rapper changes his name to Ye
Kanye West changes his name to Ye
He announced the name change on Twitter on Saturday, writing: "The creature formerly known as Kanye West".
West, 41, has had Ye as his nickname for a while, and used the name as the title of his eighth album, which he released in June.
The name change came just before he was due to appear on Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to release his new album Yandhi.
He replaces singer Ariana Grande on the show after she cancelled due to "emotional reasons", said the host.
In addition to being an abbreviation of his current artist name, West has previously stated that the word has a religious meaning for him.
"I think the word 'ye' is the most used word in the Bible, and in the Bible it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year when discussing the album title with radio host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am us, that's us.
We've changed our name from Kanye, which means the one, to just Ye -- to reflect the good we do, the bad we do, our confusion, everything.
It reflects who we are.
Kanye is one of several famous rappers to have changed his name.
Sean Combs was previously known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he declared that he prefers the names Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West previously, has also changed the writing style of the name with and without bindestrek and large letters.
Future President of Mexico promises not to send the military against civilians
Mexico's future president, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, has promised never to send military forces against civilians, and the country will soon mark the 50th anniversary of the bloody treatment of students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he will never use the military to suppress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, the military fired on peaceful demonstrators and killed about 300 people, at a time when left-wing student movements were spreading in Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has promised to support young Mexicans by providing monthly grants to students and opening several free universities.
He has said that unemployment and lack of access to education have led young people to join criminal gangs.
The US should double investment in artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the United States should double its investment in research on the topic, says AI investor and user Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
His comments came after various parts of the US government expressed concerns about artificial intelligence, although the US lacks a formal strategy for the use of artificial intelligence.
Meanwhile, China introduced its plan last year, and aims to be number 1 in artificial intelligence innovation by 2030.
"A doubling of the budget for research on artificial intelligence would be a good start, since all other countries are so far behind the United States, and we are looking for the next breakthrough in artificial intelligence", Lee said.
A doubling of funding could double the chances of the next big breakthrough in artificial intelligence happening in the United States, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, who published the book AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order this month through publisher Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the managing director (CEO) of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of the largest artificial intelligence companies in China, Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on a system of artificial intelligence that beat the highest-ranked player of the game Othello, and later worked as a leader at Microsoft Research and as chairman of Google in China.
Lee recognized earlier technology competitions organized by the US government, such as the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Robotics Challenge, and asked how late the next competition was to be, so that he could identify the next visionaries.
Researchers in the United States usually have to work hard to get government funding, Lee said.
"It's not China that's taking the academic leaders, it's the big companies", Lee said.
Facebook, Google and other technology companies have been hiring brilliant university students to work on artificial intelligence for the past few years.
Lee said that changes in immigration policy could also help the United States to strengthen research on artificial intelligence.
"I think that PhD students in artificial intelligence should automatically get residence permits", he said.
The State Council of China published its plan for next-generation artificial intelligence in July 2017.
China's National Science Foundation funds students at academic institutions, not unlike the US National Science Foundation and other state organizations' way of distributing money to US researchers, but the quality of the academic work is lower in China, Lee said.
Earlier this year, the U.S. Department of Defense established a joint center for artificial intelligence, which is meant to involve partners from industry and academia, and the White House declared the formation of a committee for artificial intelligence.
This month DARPA announced an investment of $2 billion in an initiative called AI (artificial intelligence) Next.
The National Science Foundation invests more than $100 million a year in research on artificial intelligence.
At the same time, no one has worked on the national security and artificial intelligence legislation for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum to change the country's name
Macedonians voted on Sunday in a referendum to change the name to the Republic of North Macedonia to resolve a decades-old conflict with Greece, which has been trying to prevent Macedonia from joining the EU and NATO.
Greece, which has a province named Macedonia, insists that the name of its northern neighbour represents a claim to its territory, and has vetoed Macedonia's membership in NATO and the EU.
The two governments reached an agreement in June based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents argue that the name change could undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority of the population of Macedonia.
President Gjorge Ivanov has said he will not vote in the referendum, and a boycott has sown doubts about how far the referendum will reach the at least 50 percent of the population it needs to be valid.
The question on the referendum table is, "Are you for NATO and EU membership and agree with the agreement with Greece?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argue that the price of the name change is worth membership in the EU and NATO, and that Macedonia is one of the countries that gained independence after the collapse of Yugoslavia.
"I am here today to vote for the future of this country, for the youth of Macedonia, so they can live freely under the umbrella of the EU, because that means a safer life for all of us", said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not binding under the law, a sufficient number of members of Parliament have said they will follow the results of the vote to make it decisive.
For the name change to take place, the Parliament needs two-thirds of the vote.
The state election committee reported that nothing unusual had happened by 13:00.
Only 16 percent had voted, as opposed to 34 percent in the previous parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 of all registered voters cast their ballots.
"I vote for my children, we belong in Europe", said Gjose Tanevski, 62, a voter in the capital, Skopje.
The Minister of State of Macedonia, Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and his son Dushko voted in the Strumika in the referendum in Macedonia on whether to change their name and open to join NATO and the EU on 30 September 2018.
Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, organized a boycott of the referendum in front of the parliament in Skopje, setting up tents and stools.
"We are for NATO and the EU, but we are not for changing the name of our country", Kavadarkov said.
We're a poor country, but we have dignity.
If they don't want us under the name Macedonia, we can go to others, like China and Russia, and become part of the Eurasian integration.
State Minister Zaev has stated that NATO membership will attract investors to Macedonia, which has over 20 percent unemployment.
"I think the majority will vote for the change, whereby 80 percent of our citizens will become members of the EU and NATO", Zaev said after voting.
He said that a "Yes" result could be interpreted as a "first-place" of our future.
A poll conducted by Macedonia's Institute for Policy Research on Monday showed that between 30 and 43 percent of voters will take part in the referendum, which is below the required number.
Another poll by the Macedonian TV channel Telma showed that 57 percent of voters plan to vote on Sunday.
Of those, the channel said that 70 percent would vote yes.
For the referendum to be successful, at least 50 percent of the votes must be cast, plus one vote.
If the referendum fails, it could damage the policies of the left-wing government that took over in May.
Watch: Manchester City player Sergio Aguero navigates through Brighton's defence and scores
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling wrecked the Brighton defence that led to a 2-0 victory for Manchester City on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England.
Aguero made it look ridiculously easy, scoring in the 65th minute.
The Argentine spinner received a pass on the midfield at the start of the sequence.
He overtook three Brighton defenders and reached the open.
Suddenly Aguero was surrounded by four green shirts.
He got around one defender, before running past several others on the edge of the Brighton-straffe field.
He came past a passing on the left and found Sterling.
The Englishman used his first kick in the field to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to hit Brighton-keeper Mathew Ryan with a shot straight into the right end of the goal.
"Aguero is still wearing his feet", City coach Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about how he could play 55-60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky he scored when he did.
But it was Sterling who gave the sky-blue the first advantage in the Premier League match.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep inside the Brighton territory.
He kicked the ball beautifully along the left end of Leroy Sane's court.
The ball was then held while he led Sterling towards the goal.
The sky blue spinner kicks the ball into goal just before it slips off the field.
City will play Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12:55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer will play spoiler against the Rockies in American baseball
With the Nationals eliminated from playoff contention, there was little reason to force a fresh start.
Scherzer has a high competitive instinct, and hopes to take the mounden on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies, but only if it can lead to a playoff for the Rockies, who lead with one game over the Los Angeles Dodgers in NL West.
The Rockies won at least 5-2 against the Nationals Friday night, but look forward to locking in the first-division title.
Even though we're not playing for anything, it's worth playing because of the atmosphere here in Denver, with the audience and the other team most likely playing at the highest level so far this year.
Who wouldn't want to play in such conditions?
It is still unknown who will start in Nationals on Sunday, but it could be Scherzer's pitching.
Scherzer, who in such a case starts for the 34th time, throws a bullpen session on Thursday and will pitche normally on Sunday.
Scherzer, who comes out of Washington, is 18-7 with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump gathers voters in West Virginia
The president referred on an obscure note to his first choice for the Supreme Court, Brett Kavanaugh, while talking about how important it was for the Republicans to vote in the midterm elections in the United States.
Everything we've done so far is at stake in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
This is one of the big, big -- I'm not a lawyer, but I'm running around everywhere to fight for the best candidates", he said.
Trump continued, "You can see this terrible, terrible group of Democrats, you can see it's happening right now.
And they're convinced that they're definitely going to take back power, you see how awful they are, how disgusting they are.
They don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to take power and control, that's what they want, power and control, we're not going to give it to them.
Democrats, he said, are on a mission to oppose and block.
"And you can see it based on the last four days", he said, calling Democrats "crazy and bad and disgusting and dishonest".
He referred to Senator and Democrat Dianne Feinstein, who caused his audience to bow.
Do you remember her answer?
Was it you who leaked documents?
What?
No, uh, no, I'm waiting -- that was really bad body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.
Labour is no longer tolerant.
They're intolerant of those who say what they mean.
When the Momentum activists in my local party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
I'm the last in a line of Labour MPs who've been told I'm not welcome -- just to say what I mean.
My colleague in Parliament, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she protested against anti-Semitism.
In my case, I was criticized for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
When it comes to the importance of responsible economics, national security, Europe, and other topics like that, ironically, Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders about.
The call for the meeting in Nottingham East Labour on Friday read: "We want the meeting to be inclusive and productive".
For the last eight years of my time as a Labour MP, the Friday meetings have been exactly like this.
Unfortunately, today's meeting was not so, and the promise of "sniffer" politics is long forgotten, if it was followed at all.
It has become increasingly clear that different views are not tolerated in Labour, and that each opinion is judged by the party leaders.
This happened shortly after Jeremy became party leader, when colleagues who used to be politically united suddenly expected me to change my mind and agree on things I would never have agreed on -- whether it was national security or the EU single market.
When I speak in public, it doesn't matter what I say, I'm always getting shut up on social media and people want me out while they criticize the centre-right politics and say I shouldn't be a Labour member.
And it's not just my experience.
I know I'm luckier than some of my colleagues, because the comments against me are at least political.
I admire my colleagues who get the sexist and racist stereotypes straightened out every day, and who are still professional and don't quit.
One of the most deceptive aspects of this period is how normalized the harassment of politicians has become.
Jeremy Corbyn had earlier said the Labour Party should be more tolerant.
In fact, we are no longer a tolerant party that has something for everyone, but for every motion of no confidence and every change in the party rules, the party gets smaller and smaller.
I've been getting a lot of advice over the last couple of years from people who've been telling me that I should take it easy and not be so loud, so maybe people will like me better.
But that's not why I chose to get into politics.
When I joined the Labour Party, when I was still in school 32 years ago, it was because I was angry at Thatcher and how the government had failed the country. My classroom was on the verge of collapse, so I wanted better public services for those who needed them most -- whether it was as a city councillor or a government minister.
I've never hidden my political views, not even in previous elections.
No one in Nottingham East could have doubted what I stand for and which of the current leaders I disagree with.
To those who vote for the bill on Friday, I can only say that when this country is heading towards a Brexit that will hurt private, local businesses and public services, I don't understand why people would waste energy on questioning my loyalty to the Labour leader.
But in fact, the only message I've sent to Nottingham Momentum, but to the voters in my constituency, whether they're Labour voters or not: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise that no one can make me resign or change my policies or stop me from serving you the way I believe is best for you all.

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Unbeatable Ayr goes to the top of Scottish rugby
Two of these "trials" may have altered the outcome a bit, but there is no doubt that Ayr were hoping to win this very entertaining Tennent's Premiership match today.
They're now on top of the pile as the only invincible made of all ten.
It was their superb defense and ability to take chances that gave the home team and their coach, Peter Murchie, good reason to be satisfied.
"We have been tested in the last battles, and we are still unbeatable, so I must be content".
Robyn Christie from Melrose said, "They deserve credit, because they were better at taking chances than we were".
Grant Anderson had a try in the 14th minute, when Frazier Climo tried a conversion, which put Ayr in front, but a yellow card from Scotland captain Rory Hughes from Warriors allowed Melrose to gather, and Jason Baggot took an unconverted try.
Climo got a penalty just before the break, scoring and converting a solo try to give Ayr 17-5 before the break.
However, Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, which was converted by Baggot, reduced the slingringsmon by five points.
There was a long pause when Ruaridh Knott was seriously injured and put on a sled, and from the start Ayr failed through a try from Stafford McDowall, who Climo converted.
Ayr's acting captain, Blair MacPherson, was given a yellow card, and again Melrose attempted a unconverted Bruce Colvine try, at the end of a number of aggressive games.
The home side played back, and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card to tackle Climo without the ball from the penalty spot, MacPherson scored a try.

The Scottish Still Game star, Ford Kieran, seems ready for a new career in the restaurant industry, after it was discovered that he is the director of a restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC programme, which he writes and stars in with partner Greg Hemphill.
The duo has announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last, and it seems that Kiernan is planning his life after Craiglang.
According to official lists, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor will not comment on the case, but a source from the Scottish Sun has hinted that Kiernan would involve himself in the progressive restaurant industry in Glasgow.
Bolivia hopes to open a waterway to the Pacific
Sailors patrol the naval headquarters in La Paz.
Public buildings with flags of the blue flag.
Marine bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon River are covered with the motto: The ocean is ours.
And the obligation to go back to it.
In landlocked Bolivia, the people still remember a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict over resources in the 1800s, longing to sail the Pacific again.
These hopes are perhaps stronger than they have been for decades while Bolivia awaits the judgment of the International Court of Justice on October 1, after five years of territorial disputes.
"Bolivia has drive, is calm and is ready, and of course expects a positive result", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians are turning to the ruling by the International Court of Justice, hoping that the Hague court will uphold Bolivia's claim and that Chile - after decades of negotiations - will give Bolivia an independent access to the sea.
Evo Morales, the charismatic native-born president of Bolivia - who is seeking re-election next year - has good reason to hope for a positive outcome.
"Now we'll be back in the Pacific soon", he promised late in August.
But some analysts don't think the court will allow Bolivia access to the ocean -- and that little would have changed even if they had access.
The Netherlands-based UN court has no power to transfer Chilean territory to Bolivia, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any negotiations.
The fact that the court's decision comes just six months after the last negotiations indicates that the case was complicated, said Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
The last four years have far from promoted Bolivia's cause, they've done the opposite.
"The problem of access to the sea has been taken over by the current Bolivian administration", Zárate said.
Morales, with his struggling rhetoric, has killed what was left of Chile's goodwill, Zárate said.
Bolivia and Chile will at some point continue the negotiations, but it will be extremely difficult to discuss the problematic situation after this.
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962.
The former president, Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who is Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected the idea that the court's decision was unusually swift.
On Monday, Bolivia will have an extraordinary opportunity to open new relations with Chile and a chance to set a record of 139 years of inequality and rather benefit both, he said.
Calzadilla also rejected the claim that Morales, still one of Latin America's most popular presidents, used this maritime problem to win votes.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific", he added.
Judgment is an opportunity to see what we need to do to forget the past.
North Korea says they won't get rid of nuclear weapons if they can't trust the United States
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says his nation can't be the first to abolish if they can't trust Washington.
Ri spoke on Saturday in the UN General Assembly.
He urged the United States to follow up on the pledge they made during the Singapore meeting between the American and North Korean leaders.
Ri's comments come at a time when US Foreign Minister Mike Pomepo appears to be reopening his nuclear diplomacy, more than three months after the Singapore meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
Ri says the United States has a false hope that North Korea will submit if the United States continues to impose sanctions and opposes an eventual declaration of the end of the Korean War.
Washington refuses to agree to an eventual declaration of the end of the war, without Pyongyang abolishing first.
Both Kim and the US President, Donald Trump, will hold a new meeting.
But many are critical of Pyongyang's seriousness about its dismantling and the fact that it most likely sees its weapons as a guarantee of security.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump meeting.
Paris shows massive headwear is the latest fashion on the way to a store near you
If you want to upgrade your hat collection or block out the sun completely, you don't need to run anymore.
The designers Valentino and Thom Browne have revealed a number of large and special headpieces in their SS19 collection, which surprised audiences during the Paris fashion show.
Highly impractical hats are on Instagram this summer, and these designers have posted their shocking creations right on the catwalk.
The most stunning piece was an oversized, beige Valentino hat with a feathery, wide brim that covered the models' heads.
There were other oversized accessories during the fashion show, including a jewel-decorated watermelon, a trollman's hat, and even an pineapple - but they're not designed to keep your head warm.
Thom Browne also unveiled a collection of bizarre masks - just in time for Halloween.
Many of the colorful masks had lips that were sewn together and resembled Hannibal Lecter more than haute couture.
One of the creations resembled a dog's outfit, complete with a snorkel and a mask, while another looked like a melted ice in a biscuit.
If you like this enormously dramatic fashion, you can just be happy.
Fashion experts predict that these huge hats will go on sale in a store near you.
The oversized hats come right after La Bomba, the straw hat with the 60 centimeter wide brim that has been worn by celebrities from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The cult-brand behind the highly unpractical hat, which was everywhere on social media, has now sent a new creation out on the catwalk - a strawberry beach bag of the same size as the bikini-clad model who wore it.
The beach bag, colored in burnt orange and topped with a white leather handle, was the most eye-catching part of Jacquemus' La Riviera SS19 collection during the Paris fashion era.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage commented to FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in fashion stores next summer - the designer has made such a big impression that I doubt it's possible to ignore the demand for oversized accessories".
John Edward: Global citizens need language skills
Private schools in Scotland are known for their high academic standing, and this continued in 2018 with excellent exam results, which are only reinforced by individual and shared success in sport, art, music and other community initiatives.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS), work to offer the best services to pupils and their parents.
Independent schools aim to prepare their students for further and higher education, career paths and the role of global citizens.
As an education sector that can design and implement a customized curriculum, we see that modern languages are popular electives in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, the message goes to his head.
If you speak to him in his own language, the message goes to his heart.
This is an important reminder that we can't rely on English alone when we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries.
If we look at the exam results from this year, we can see that languages are at the top of the league table with the highest scores for independent schools.
A total of 68 percent of students who took foreign languages scored A.
The data, collected from SCIS's 74 member schools, shows that 72 percent of students scored A in Mandarin, while 72 percent of those taking German, 69 percent of those taking French, and 63 percent of those taking Spanish also scored A.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages as vital qualities, which children and young people will absolutely need in the future.
Language as an elective subject is seen as equivalent to STEM-facts (science, technology, engineering studies and mathematics) in the curricula of independent schools and other places.
A 2014 survey by the UK's Selection for Employment and Qualifications showed that 17 per cent of employers were unable to fill positions due to the applicants' lack of language skills.
Therefore, language is increasingly important in school to prepare youth for the world of work.
With more job opportunities for language-savvy people, these skills are essential in a globalized world.
No matter what kind of career a young person chooses, if they have learned a second language, they have a decent advantage in the future with such a quality.
Being able to communicate directly with people from other countries will automatically give a multilingual person advantages in a competitive world.
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 British adults in 2013, 75 percent could not speak any language other than English well enough to keep a conversation going, and French was the only language spoken by a staggering 15 percent.
This is why it's so important to invest in language learning for our children.
Knowing more than one language, especially the languages spoken in developing countries, can give children a better chance of finding good jobs in the future.
In Scotland, every school is different in terms of the language they teach.
Many schools focus on the classical modern languages, while others teach languages that are classified as important in the UK as we look forward to 2020, such as Mandarin and Japanese.
No matter what your child is interested in, there will always be a lot of languages to choose from in independent schools, and teachers who are specialists in this field.
Scottish Independent Schools are dedicated to creating a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
You can't deny that in this global, business-oriented environment, languages are vital for the future of this country, so this has to be reflected in the education sector.
Modern languages should be called international communication properties
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, and thus offer diversity and high competence for Scotland's young people.
It is all right.
John Edward is the Director of the Scottish Council for Independent Schools
LeBron debuts in the Lakers on Sunday in San Diego
The wait is over for fans who are eager to see LeBron James debut on the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team.
Lakers coach Luke Walton has announced that James will play in the preseason game on Sunday, against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But how long he will play has yet to be determined.
"It's going to be more than one minute and less than 49," Walton announced on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell doubts that James will most likely play for a limited time.
After training this week, James was asked about his plans for the Lakers' preseason schedule.
"I don't need pre-season play at this stage of my career to get ready", he said.
Trump's West Virginia Rally Time, YouTube
President Donald Trump begins a whirlwind of campaigning tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
It's the first of Trump's five planned stops next week, including stops in friendly places like Tennessee and Mississippi.
With the confirmation vote pending to fill the vacancy, Trump is aiming to build support for the upcoming midterm elections, as Republicans are in danger of losing control of Congress when votes are cast in November.
What time will Trump be in West Virginia tonight, and how can you see it online?
Trump's rally in Wheeling, West Virginia is scheduled for 19:00 p.m. on Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia speech online below, via live stream on YouTube.
Trump will likely resume this week's hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, who was pressured over sexual assault allegations, with a Senate confirmation vote expected in up to a week while the FBI investigates.
But the primary goal of this caucus is to help the Republicans meet the November election and gain some momentum.
So President Trump's campaign says these five rallies next week are aimed at "stimulating volunteers and supporters" that Republicans are trying to protect and expand their majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, according to Reuters.
"Control of the Congress is so critical to his agenda that the president will travel to as many states as possible as we enter the busy campaign season", a Trump campaign spokesman told Reuters.
Planned for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, the evening's rally could bring supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw coverage from Pittsburgh media, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Thursday will be the second time in the last month that Trump has visited West Virginia, the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016.
Trump is trying to help West Virginia Republican Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey, who is in demand in opinion polls.
"It's not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come and try to give him a boost in the polls", said Simon Haeder, a political researcher at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA showcase their fight to keep hope alive on Sunday's singles
After three one-sided sessions, Saturday afternoon's foursomes could only be what this Ryder Cup needed.
The swinging pendulum of momentum is a completely invented sporting concept, but one that the players really believe in, and never more so than in competitions like these.
So where would they say that moment is now?
"They had a six-point lead, and now it's four, so we'll take that as a little moment, I guess", said Jordan Spieth as he walked out for the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, four points ahead with 12 more at stake.
The Americans, as Spieth says, feel they have a little wind in their sails, and they have a lot to be encouraged by, not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas who played together all day, and each have three points out of four.
Spieth has been deadly from tee to green and leads, for example.
The guttural screams of celebration became louder as his round continued, seeking an important putt to take match four all-squaw.re when he and Thomas had been two down after two.
His putt, which won that match at 15, was met with a similar scream, the kind that tells you that he thinks the U.S. team is not out of this.
"You've actually just gotten to dig deep and worry about your own struggle", Spieh said.
That's all these players have left now.
18 holes to make a mark.
The only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, the invincible history of the Ryder Cup.
Europe's weird, but sweet couple is four out of four and can't go wrong.
Moliwood were the only pair who did not shoot a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also avoided the bogey on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the back nine (the last nine holes on a 18 hole course) on Friday morning.
That race, and the way their energy seems to flow both to and from this noisy, engaged audience, cements that they are the players who will be beaten on Sunday, and there would be no more popular players to seal a potential European victory when the sun sets over Le Golf National, than Fleetwood or Molinari.
Preferably both at the same time on different holes.
Talking about European honor is still too early.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson briefly worked with Sergio Garcia, the morning's fireball hero, when he was paired with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine, the Spaniard and the Swede dug into a hole they never came close to climbing out of.
But on Sunday, no one can help you out of your hole.
The fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch up close because of the interaction between opponents, the advice they give, and the advice they don't give, and the way that a strategy can change in an instant.
Europe has played better as a team so far and takes a significant lead into the final day, but this foursome-event also showed that Team USA has the guts to the fight that no one, especially Stateside, had doubted.
Europe takes a 10-6 lead in the Ryder Cup final
Europe will have a healthy advantage into the final day of the Ryder Cup after coming out of Saturday's fireball and foursome matches with a 10-6 lead over the United States.
Inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to take his match so far at Le Golf National to four points.
Thomas Bjorns' European side, which had lost the trophy at Hazeltine two years earlier, dominated a faltering American side in the morning fourballs, taking the series 3-1.
The United States offered more resistance in foursomes and won two matches, but could not catch the deficit.
Jim Fury's side needed eight points from the 12 singles matches on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari, named Molliwood after a sensational weekend, are only the second pair to win four points from their opening four matches in Ryder Cup history.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in fourballs, they gave themselves such a great out to beat an outstanding Woods and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even more stunning 5 and 4.
Woods, who slept through two matches on Saturday, showed sporadic brilliance, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in fireballs and foursomes and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, who rested for the morning's fourballs, returned to partners Henrik Stenson in foursomes to a 2 and 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka - ranked first and third in the world.
Europe didn't even get everything it wanted on a decent, windy day southwest of Paris.
Three-time winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans with two points on Saturday.
They won a courageous 2 & 1 victory over Spain's Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in fourballs and came back later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 & 3 in foursomes when they had lost the two holes in the opening.
Only twice in Ryder Cup history has a team come back from a four-point deficit and gone into a single, although as holders Fury's side need only draw to retain the trophy.
After being the second best for two days, it looks like a Sunday counter-attack will be outside them.
North Korea says unilateral disarmament is not a viable option without trust
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that if sanctions continue, the country's distrust of the United States will grow and that it would not give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally under such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual general assembly of the world's governing power that North Korea had taken "significant measures" to improve its behavior over the past year, including halting nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and promising not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
"We're not getting anything from the United States", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will be no trust in our national security, and under such circumstances, it is not possible that we unilaterally disarm first".
While Ri, a well-known North Korean, has made several complaints about Washington's resistance to a fa approach to the abolition of nuclear weapons, in which North Korea would be rewarded for taking gradual steps, his resignation was significant in that he did not reject a one-sided nuclear build-up, as Pyongyang had done earlier.
Ri referred to a joint resignation issued by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first-ever summit between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to work for the "de-nuclear buildup" of the Korean peninsula while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea's security.
North Korea has called for a formal end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also resisted talks to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US insists on "down-building of nuclear power first" and increases the pressure with sanctions to achieve its purpose by force, and they oppose even the "declaration of peace", Ri said.
The belief that sanctions can break us is a false hope among those who are not interested in us.
But the problem is that as sanctions continue, our distrust only grows.
Ri did not mention the plans for a new summit between Kim and Trump, which the US president had announced at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korea's leader, Moon Jae-in, in the last five months and added: If the party in this approach to the demolition of nuclear weapons was South Korea, and not the United States, the demolition of the Korean peninsula would not have stopped as it has now done
However, the tone of Ri's speech was dramatically different from last year, when he told the U.N. general assembly that it was not possible to stop North Korean rockets against the U.S. mainland, after the president of the United States, Trump, called Kim a "raket man on suicide mission".
Trump, who last year vowed to "totally destroy" North Korea, praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm, but said much work still needed to be done and that sanctions had to remain in place until North Korea dismantled its nuclear weapons.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have a time frame for this, saying, "Whether it takes two years, three years or five months, it doesn't matter".
China and Russia claim that the U.N. Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the actions taken.
But the US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, told the UN Security Council on Thursday that "The Security Council sanctions must remain strong and unfailing until we achieve the complete, final, verified disarmament".
The Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 for the purpose of destroying Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met Ri on the sidelines of the U.N. general assembly and said he would visit Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a new summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times already this year, but his last trip didn't go well.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying progress had been made, but a few hours later North Korea condemned him for coming with gangster-like demands.
North Korea promised in a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the US took such measures.
He said that Kim had told him that the "corresponding measures" he sought were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore, and steps toward normalizing relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on getting enough rest
A new course at Harvard University has this year been working on getting all students more sleep, in an attempt to combat the growing macho culture of studying in caffeine all night long.
One academic found that students at top universities often lack the most basic care - how to take care of oneself.
Charles Czeisler, professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, developed the course, which he believes is the first of its kind in the United States.
He was inspired to start the course after talking about the impact sleep deprivation has on learning.
At the end of it, a girl came up to me and said, "Why am I being told this now that I'm an adult?"
She said that no one had ever told her about the importance of sleep -- which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
The course, rolled out for the first time this year, explains to students what is important for how good sleep habits help academic and athletic performance, as well as improve their overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's executive director of health services, said the university decided to introduce the course after students had seriously impaired sleep during the week.
The hour-long course includes a variety of interactive tasks.
In one section, there is a picture of a dormitory, where students click on coffee cups, curtains, trainers and books to be told about the effects of caffeine and light and how athletic performance is affected by sleep deprivation, as well as the importance of evening routines.
In another section, participants are told how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A map of the campus, with interactive icons, encourages participants to reflect on their daily routines.
'We know it's not going to change behavior immediately.
But we think they have a right to know -- just like you have a right to know, the health effects of choosing to smoke cigarettes", Professor Czeisler added.
The culture of sleep deprivation still exists, he said, adding that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students mean that sleep deprivation is a growing problem.
Ensuring you get enough, good quality sleep should be the student's secret weapon against stress, fatigue and anxiety, he said -- even preventing weight gain, because lack of sleep puts the brain in starvation mode and makes you constantly hungry.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old California chemical and physical biologist, helped Professor Czeisler develop the course after being a student with him the previous year, his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a course for the entire campus.
The next step, he hopes, is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar program of study before they start at that prestigious institution.
Prof Czeisler advised that students should evaluate setting an alarm for when they are going to bed, as well as for when they are going to wake up, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light coming from electronic screens and LED-lighting, which can completely shift the inner clock, leading to problems with sleeping.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga-goal gives Gerrard's men the downfall
Rangers went on to a fresh defeat on the road when Dolly Menga's entry sent Steven Gerrard's week-end side to a 1-0 loss at Livingston.
Ibrox were looking to take their first win on the road since the 4-1-triumph at St Johnstone in February, but the team of Gary Holt only caused Gerrard's second defeat in 18 matches as leader, and gave eight points, a round below Ladbroke's Premier League leader, Hearts.
The score was tied at seven minutes before halftime, and a Ranger-upset with lacking inspiration never seemed to settle.
While Rangers now fall to sixth place, Livingston climbs to third and is only behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And there may be additional problems in store for Rangers after linebacker Calum Spence had to be treated for a head wound, after an object apparently was thrown from the side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team that saw Ayr enter the Betfred Cup semi-finals.
Holt, however, went with Livy 11 who took a point with a dream shot the previous week, and he would have been thrilled over the way his well-renowned dress took the kneecaps of his opponents every turn.
The Rangers may have had the ball the most, but Livingston did more with the ball they had.
They should have scored after just two minutes when Menga's first post sent Scott Pittman over to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder failed in his championship.
A long frispark from Keaghan Jacobs found then captain Craig Halkett, but his defense partner, Alan Lithgow, could only shoot long at the returnable.
Rangers took control, but it seemed to be more hope than faith in their game in the final third round.
Alfredo Morellos felt determined that he should have been punished at the 20 meter mark when he and Steven Lawless collided, but Judge Steven Thomson waved the colombian's wishes away.
Rangers managed just two shots on goal in the first half, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly worried by Lassana Coulibaly's header and a tamed shot from Ovie Ejaria.
While Livi's opening in the 34th minute may have been against the rules, no one can deny that they forgave it just because of the shot.
Again, Rangers failed to handle a deep deadball from Jacobs.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher hit the ball to Scott Robinson, who held his own to pick out Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard left in the pause as if he was swapping Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the exchange caused an immediate effect when the wingsman made a stop for Morelos, but the impressive Kelly ran forward to block.
But Livingstone continued to overlist the guests to play exactly the game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sending out longshot on longshot.
Holt's team could have increased its lead at the end, but McGregor succeeded well in preventing Jacobs in it, until Lithgrow left a long inlay from the cornermark.
Ranger's reserve, Glenn Middleton, had a new demand for punishment when he supported Jacobs, but again Thomson overlooked it.
Almanakk: The inventor of the geigerteljar
And now a page from our Sunday Morning Almanac: September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and we are counting the day that the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geiger-teller.
As a scientific reference since then, the Geiger counter has also become a reference in pop culture, as in the 1950 film Bells of Coronado, with the seemingly unlikely late cowboy researchers Roy Rogers and Dale Evans:
Man: What in the world is that?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, it can be used to find radioactive minerals, for example uranium.
When you put these earphones on, you can actually hear the effects of the atom that comes from the radioactivity in the mineral.
Evans: Yeah, now it is bubbling.
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name lives on.
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to see red cells.
A new cancer vaccine could teach the immune system to see red blood cells and kill them.
The vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize red cells as part of the treatment.
The method involves taking out immune cells from a patient and changing them in the lab.
They can then see a protein that's common in many cancers, and then they can purify
A test vaccine shows promising results in patients with a variety of cancer forms.
A woman treated with the vaccine, which teaches the immune system to recognize red cells, experienced ovarian cancer disappearing for more than 18 months.
The method involves extracting immune cells from a patient, changing them in the laboratory so that they can see a protein that is common in many cancer forms, called HER2, and then purifying the cells.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine".
HER2 drives the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer, explained Professor Berzofsky.
A similar approach to extracting immune cells from patients and teaching them how to target cancer cells has worked in the treatment of one type of leukemia.
Kanye West began a Pro-Trump diatribe, wearing a MAGA-lue, after he hosted the TV show Saturday Night Live.
It didn't go so well.
Kanye West was booed in the studio during Saturday Night Live after an incredible performance in which he praised the US president, Donald Trump, and said he would run for president in 2020.
After taking his third song of the evening, Ghost Town, in which he wore a Make America Great-cap, he gave the Democrats a tirade and reiterated his support for Trump.
So many times I talk to a white person, and they say, "How could you like Trump, he's a racist?"
Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have moved out of America a long time ago, he said.
SNL started the show with a number with comedian Matt Damon, in which the Hollywood star made fun of Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate's judicial selection hearing on the allegations of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although not aired, the recording of West's tirade was uploaded to social media by comedian Chris Rock.
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with the post.
West had also complained to the audience that he had a difficult backstage due to his headplag.
They bullied me behind the scenes.
"Don't go out wearing that hat", they told him.
They bullied me!
And then they say I'm in a sunken place", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West goes on, "Do you want to see the sunken space?" He says he wants to wear the Superman cap, because that means you can't tell me what to do.
Try love.
His comments led to at least two outpipes from the audience, and SNL cast members seemed embarrassed, Variety reported, with one person there telling the publication: "The whole studio was dead-still".
West was hired as a late replacement for singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West confused many with a performance of the song I Love it, dressed as a Perrier bottle.
West was backed by the leader of the conservative group TPUSA, Candace Turner, who tweeted: "To one of the most courageous spirits: THANK YOU FOR STARING UP TO THE PEOPLE".
But talk show host Karen Hunter tweeted that West was simply who he is and that's absolutely amazing.
But I chose NOT to reward anyone (by buying their music or clothes or supporting their art) who I believe embraces and spreads an ideology that is harmful to my society.
He is free.
We've added that.
Before the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and that he was now formally known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follow in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
The other members, Snoop Dogg, who has been given the name Snoop Lion and of course the last music legend Prince, changed the name to a symbol and then the artist who was previously known as Prince.
Tilted for attempted murder after knivestick in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has been charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The incident occurred in Ballyhackamore, police said.
The defendants are expected to appear in Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be reviewed by the prosecutor's office, the Public Prosecution Service.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington goes out against toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his sword-swinging role as Jon Snow in HBO's violent medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has gone against the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that on screen, these kinds of roles often lead young boys to feel like they have to be tough to be respected.
In an interview with The Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he believes something has gone wrong and asked how to deal with the problem of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married his Game of Thrones co-star Rose Leslie, also 31, admitted that he knows "very well" about the problem.
"Personally, I'm convinced that something has gone wrong with masculinity".
What have we taught men as they grow up, in relation to the problem we're seeing?
Kit believes that TV is partly responsible for the rise in toxic masculinity due to very masculine characters.
He goes on, 'What is born and what is learned?
What is being taught on TV and on the streets, what is making young boys feel that they have to be this special side of being a man?
I think that's really one of the big questions of our time -- how do we change it?
For it is clear that something has gone wrong for young men.'
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be making Game of Thrones' predecessors or sequels when the series ends this summer, saying he is "ready with battlefields and horses".
From November, Kit will star in a new spin-off of Sam Shepard's True West, which is the story of a film producer and his brother, a robber.
The actor recently revealed that he sees the meeting with his wife Rose as the best thing to come out of Game of Thrones.
"I met my wife in this show, so in that way it gave me my future family and my life to move on", he said.
Rose played Ygritte, the outsider to Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/AIDS: China reports a 14% increase in new cases
China has announced a 14 percent increase in the number of citizens living with HIV and AIDS.
More than 820,000 people have been affected in the country, health authorities say.
About 40,000 new cases were reported only in the second quarter of 2018.
The vast majority of new cases were transmitted through sex, marking a change from the past.
Traditionally, HIV has spread rapidly through some parts of China as a result of infected blood transfusions.
But the number of people who got HIV this way was reduced to almost zero, said Chinese health officials at a conference in Yunnan.
However, year by year the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
HIV transmission through sex is an acute problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT/HBTQ persons is widely reported.
Because of the conservative values of the country, studies have estimated that 70-90 percent of men who have sex with men will eventually marry women.
Many of the diseases transmitted by these relationships are due to insufficient sexual protection.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV-medication as part of an effort to tackle the problem.
Maxine Waters's nectar that, given the lack of information from GOP senators, it explodes into far-fetched lies and conspirational theories.
U.S. Rep. Maxine Waers on Saturday condemned claims that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia pages of lawmakers.
Los Angeles Democrats claimed that the claims were pedalised by extreme right-wing investigations and websites.
"Lies, lies and more slanderous lies", Waters said in a statement on Twitter.
The information released included the home addresses and phone numbers of the Americans Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
The information, which appeared on Thursday, was sent by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during a senate panel hearing on the allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak came after the three senators had asked Kavanaugh questions.
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the insider was linked to Waters' office and disclosed the information to a member of Waters' staff, Hill reported.
"This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie", Waters continued.
One of my employees -- whose identity, personal information and security have been compromised as a result of these untrue and false allegations -- was in no way responsible for the leak of this information.
This baseless claim is completely false and an absolute lie.
Water's question was quickly criticized on the Internet, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer.
"This denial is sin", wrote Fleischer.
This indicates that she does not have the temperament to be a member of the congress.
If a man is rebuked for something he did not do, let him not become angry.
They don't have to be tough.
They must not question the motives of the debtor.
They need to be calm and peaceful.
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused by critics of being apparently too angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate seeking to take over Waters's seat in the midterm elections, also expressed his thoughts on Twitter.
"Even if it is true", he tweeted.
In her statement, Waters said her office had warned the appropriate government and the judicial authorities of these false claims.
We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed, continue it, and that they will be held legally responsible for all their actions that are destructive and dangerous to each and every one of my employees.
Johnny English strikes again - spy-tull of the weak Rowan Atkinson
It is traditional to look for Brexit-specific titles in all new films with a British angle, and this applies to the revival of Johnny England's action-comedy spoof franchise - which started back in 2003 with Johnny English and was revived in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn.
Will self-deprecating satire about how openly ugly we are become the new export power of this country?
In any case, the big-headed, incompetent Johnny English with the rubber-faced face has for the second time been given renewed permission to f*** things up - his name signals more than anything else that he is a wide comic creator for filmmakers in non-English-speaking countries.
He's of course the silly, secret agent who despite his bizarre desire to spread a little glamour has gotten a little bit of Clouseau, a dash of Mr Bean and a portion of the guy who contributes a simple melody to the Fire Cars, the theme during the 2012 London Olympics opening ceremony.
It is also originally based on the traveling and international mysterious man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV ads, which left a mess in the aftermath.
There's a nice blink or two in this last JE excursion.
I love Johnny English approaching a helicopter wearing a medieval armor suit while the rotor blade hits his helmet.
Atkinson's gift for physical comedy is on display, but the humor feels quite weak and remarkably superfluous, especially since serious film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible themselves now safely offer comedy as an ingredient.
The humor felt like it was directed at children rather than adults, and for me, Johnny England's noisy accident is unfortunately not as inventive and focused as Atkinson's line clause is in the person of Bean.
The permanent current situation is that the UK is in serious trouble.
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated Britain's super-secret web-network of spies, revealing the identities of all the agents the UK has on the ground, to the horror of the agent on the job - a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon.
It's the last straw for a state minister who is a pompous and warlike figure, who already has a complete breakdown of political unpopularity: Emma Thompson does her very best with this quasi-Theresa-May character, but there's not so much in the script to work with.
Her intelligence advisors inform her that once every active spy has been charged, she must bring in someone who is retired.
And that means the incompetent Johnny English himself, who works as a teacher at a rather fancy establishment, but gives unofficial lessons on how to work undercover: a couple of nice jokes here, since English offers a School of Rock-type academy for espionage.
English is sent back to Whitehall for a necessity-briefing and reunited with his former understanding assistant Bough, played again by Ben Miller.
Bough is now a married man, moved over to an submarine pilot job, an overenthusiast role in which Vicki Pepperdine is somewhat outcast.
So Batman and Robin's ability to make things go terribly wrong in Her Majesty's Secret Service is back for good in the encounter with Olga Kurylenko's beautiful femme fatale, Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the prime minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic technology billionaire who claims to solve Britain's computer problems: the uncanny Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough begin their journey of farce-like wild game: disguised as waiters, setting them on fire at a fine French restaurant; they create chaos and smuggle themselves aboard Voltas's pleasure boat; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to use a Virtual Reality headset to get acquainted with the interior of Voltas' house.
All the stops are probably drawn to the final sequence, but as loving and undisciplined as it is, there's quite a lot of children's TV all over it.
Quite moderate stuff.
And like with all the other Johnny English films, I couldn't help but think: Couldn't the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent?
The Labour Party denies that they are working on a plan for the English to work a four-day week, but be paid for five days.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is now considering a radical plan that would see Britons working a four-day week - but getting paid for five.
According to the report, the party wants business leaders to pass on savings made through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution to workers by giving them an extra day off.
Employees would then be able to enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same pay.
Sources said the idea would fit with the party's economic agenda and plans to increase benefits for workers.
The change to a four-day week has been approved by the Trades Union Congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the changing economy.
An older Labour source told The Sunday Times: "A policy message is expected to be announced before the year-end.
'It doesn't happen overnight, but a four-day workweek is a desire that fits into the approach the party has to balance the economy in favour of the worker, as well as the overall party's industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party would not be the first to approve such an idea, as the Green Party promised a four-day workweek in its 2017 election campaign.
The ambition is however not immediately approved by the entire Labour party.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'A four-day work week is not party politics and it is not considered by the party.'
Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell used the previous week's labour conference to reinforce his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take back power from the unscrupulous directors and profiteers of wealthy companies.
The shadow chancellor's plans also mean that current shareholders of the water company cannot get back their entire effort as a Labour government could be dismissed for perceived misconduct.
He has also confirmed plans to place workers in company boards and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds (inclusive ownership funds) to provide 10 percent of the private sector's equity to employees, who would receive annual profits of up to £500, or about 5000 kroner.
Lindsey Graham, John Kennedy, tells the TV program 60 Minutes that the FBI's investigation of Kavanaugh could change their minds
The FBI's investigation into complaints against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on his nomination to the Supreme Court for at least a week, raising the question of how the agency's findings could influence some Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, correspondent Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could uncover anything that would cause them to change their minds.
Kennedy seemed more open than his South Carolina counterpart.
"I mean, of course", Kennedy said.
I said on the way into the hearing, I said, I've spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, the claim came out, and I said, 'Did you do it?'
He was determined, firmly determined, unquestioning.
Graham's voice is nevertheless seen as set in stone.
"I've made up my mind about Brett Kavanaugh, and it would take a dynamite charge to change me", he said.
Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett strongly denied it, added Graham, and referred to Christine Blasey Ford.
And they could not prove it to you.
That's 36 years.
I don't see anything new changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York is hosting the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event that features an enormously impressive array of performing stars and an equally impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the Global Citizen Festival will see tens of thousands of people flock to the vast Central Park grounds not only to enjoy Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mende's performances, but also to raise awareness of the event's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which began in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international support group that hopes to end poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
To get a free ticket to the event (unless you were willing to pay for a VIP ticket), concertgoers had to complete a series of tasks, or actions as volunteer work; send an email to a world leader, make a phone call or other meaningful ways to contribute to raising awareness of their goal of ending poverty.
But how successful has Global Citizen been in 12 years to reach its goal?
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people to demand a call to action, or just another case of click-activism -- people feeling like they're making a real difference by signing an online appeal or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen says it has registered more than 19 million actions from its supporters, participated in and pressured on a variety of different targets.
It says that these actions have allowed world leaders to announce commitments and policies that are worth more than $37 billion, which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group indicated 390 commitments and announcements as a result of their actions, of which at least $ 10 billion had already been paid or collected.
The group estimates that the secure means so far have directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Some of the most important commitments are The Power of Nutrition, a UK-based partnership of investors and entrepreneurs committed to helping children reach their full potential; pledging to give Rwanda $35 million to help end undernutrition in the country after receiving more than 4700 tweets from global citizens.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens, just like you, we can turn the social injustice of undernutrition into a footnote in history", the ambassador of The Power of Nutrition, Tracey Ullman, told the audience during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after taking more than 5,000 actions to demand that Britain improve nutrition for mothers and children, the UK government announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will reach 5 million women and children with nutrition treatment.
In response to one of the most common questions on their website, they ask, "What makes you believe that we can end extreme poverty?"
Global citizen responded, "It's going to be a long and difficult road -- sometimes we'll fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements that led us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, Weekend, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among some of the actors who will perform at this year's event in New York, which will be presented by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
The US could use the Navy as a barrier to prevent Russian energy exports - Interior Secretary
Washington may if necessary resort to its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including in the Middle East, international secretary Ryan Zinke has revealed, as quoted by Washington Examiner.
Zinke argued that Russia's engagement in Syria - particularly where it operates at the invitation of the legitimate government - is a prerequisite for exploring new energy markets.
"I think the reason they're in the Middle East is because they want to share energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, Southern Europe", he said.
And according to the official, there are ways to deal with it.
"The United States has this ability, with our Navy, to ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, block to ensure that their energy doesn't go on the market", he said.
Zinke spoke to participants at the event, which was organized by the Consumer Energy Alliance, an idealistic group that presents itself as the voice of the energy consumer in the United States.
He compared Washington's approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran, and noted that they're actually the same.
"The economic solution for Iran and Russia is more or less to exploit and replace fuel", he said, while pointing to Russia as a one-trick pony with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
The statements come as the Trump administration has been tasked with increasing the export of liquefied natural gas to Europe, replacing Russia, the much cheaper alternative for European consumers.
In this context, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to persuade Germany to withdraw from the passed Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says made Berlin Moscow's finger.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is set to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's zealous opposition to the project is driven solely by economic reasons, and is an example of unfair competition.
"I think we share the view that energy cannot be a tool for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers", Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said after a meeting with U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September.
The US has pulled back from Germany, which has confirmed its commitment to the project.
Germany's leading industry organization, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the United States to stay out of the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
"I have a big problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply", said Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Association (BDI) after a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will drive hard to run for president in 2020, says Massachusetts Senator
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said Saturday she would take a "due look" at running for president after the midterm elections.
During a council meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running as a candidate.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our bad government, and that includes a woman at the top", she said according to The Hill.
After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president.
Warren took on President Donald Trump during the Council meeting and said that he is leading this country in the wrong direction.
"I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", she said.
Warren has been sharp in his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
In a tweet on Friday, Warren said, "Obviously we need an FBI investigation before the vote".
A poll released on Thursday showed that the majority of Warren's own voters do not think she should run in 2020.
51 percent of "likely" Massachusetts voters said the senator should not run, according to a Suffolk University Political Research Center/Boston Globe poll.
Thirty-three percent supported such a candidate.
The poll showed more support for a round of former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent supporting a potential candidate and 48 percent against.
Other high-profile Democratic names discussed with a potential 2020 candidacy include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
Biden said he would make his decision officially in January, the Associated Press reported.
Sarah Palin argues for Track Palin's post-traumatic stress disorder at the Donald Trump rally
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after being deployed in September.
He was arrested and charged with domestic violence on Monday night.
"What my own son is going through, what he's going through when he gets back, allows me to relate to other families that are affected by PTSD and some of the wounded that our returning soldiers are with", she told the audience at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest the "elephant in the room" and said of his son and other war veterans that "they come back a little bit different, they come back hard, they come back and wonder about the respect for what they and their fellow soldiers and pilots and all the other military, have done for the country, exists".
He was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with domestic violence against a woman for disturbing a report on domestic violence and the possession of a weapon while he was in custody, according to Dan Bennett, spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department.
18 states, D.C. supporting new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to a new American policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence or violence.
Representatives from the 18 states and the district submitted a friend-of-the-right brief Friday in Washington to support an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the accuser in Grace v. Sessions fits the fact that the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) filed in August against federal policy has not been disclosed.
She said her partner and the violent gang members abused her, but U.S. officials denied her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Advocates for the United States supporting Grace describe El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which produce a large number of asylum seekers, as nations facing pervasive problems with gangs and domestic violence.
The new U.S. asylum policy reversed a 2014 decision from the Immigration Act, which allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
District of Columbia Justice Minister Karl Racine said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum cases be judged for the particular facts and circumstances of the claim, and such an obstacle is contrary to this principle", the court's friend said.
Advocates further argued in the summary that the policies that nectar immigrant access, damage the U.S. economy, and say it is more likely that they become entrepreneurs and provide necessary labor.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims of abuse and violence who fled in June.
"Asylum is available to those who leave their home country because of persecution or fear because of race, religion, nationality, or membership in a particular social group or political opinion", Sessions said in his June 11 policy statement.
Asylum was never meant to solve all the problems -- even the serious problems -- that people face every day around the world.
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu while death toll doubles in the race to find survivors
For survivors, the situation became increasingly serious.
"It felt very tense", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who was comforting her baby son with fever at an evacuation center in the devastated city of Palu.
Every four minutes, ambulances arrive with bodies.
Clean water is hard to find.
Inhabitants are observed on their way back to their ruined homes, searching through water-damaged properties and trying to save everything they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured, and the hospital, which had been destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake, was overcrowded.
Several of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who had broken her back and shoulders, rested outside Palu's Military Hospital, where the patients were treated outside due to still-strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how the powerful earthquake shook the hotel room he shared with his wife and daughter on the fifth floor.
There was no time to save ourselves.
I was pushed into the ruins of the wall, I think", Haris told Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife scream for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her and my baby.
I hope they're safe.
US ambassador blames China for bullying with propaganda ads
A week after an official Chinese newspaper ran a 4-page advertisement in an American daily highlighting the mutual benefits of trade with the United States and China, the American ambassador to China blamed Beijing for using the American press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump last Wednesday referred to China Daily's paid allowance in the Des Moines-register - Iowa's largest sales newspaper - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the November 6 US congressional elections, a charge China denies.
Trump's accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in US elections marked what US officials told Reuters was a new phase in an escalating campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is normal for foreign governments to place advertisements to support trade, Beijing and Washington are currently locked in a growing trade war that has seen them in turn increase taxes on each other's imports.
China's retaliatory tariffs early in the trade war were designed to hit exporters in states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts have said.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and the former longtime governor of Iowa, a major exporter of agricultural products to China, said Beijing had harmed American workers, farmers and businesses.
"China", Branstad wrote in a Sunday Des Moines-register opinion piece, "now doubles the mobbing by running propaganda ads in our own free press".
"In its propaganda efforts, the Chinese government is using America's cherished tradition of freedom of expression and a free press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines-register", Branstad wrote.
"In contrast, at the newsstand down the street here in Beijing, you'll find narrowly dissenting voices and you won't see any true reflection of the different opinions that the Chinese people might have on China's troubled economic path, given that the media is under the thumb of the Chinese Communist Party".
He added that "one of China's most prominent newspapers declined the offer to publish" his article, though he did not say what kind of newspaper.
Republicans are pushing female voters to the polls ahead of the Kavanaugh debacle, Analytiker warns.
With many top Republicans standing by and defending the high-profile Brett Kavanaugh in the face of multiple sexual assault charges, the analyst warns that they will likely see a setback, particularly from women, in the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment around this has been extremely high, and most Republicans have registered that they already wanted to go ahead with a vote.
These things cannot be regretted, says Grant Reeher, professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, to The Hill for an article published Saturday.
Reeher said he doubts that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Arizona)'s last-minute push for an FBI investigation will be enough to anger voters.
"Women will not forget what happened yesterday - they won't forget it tomorrow, and they won't forget it in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn, told the Washington, DC newspaper on Friday.
On Friday morning, protesters sang "November is coming!" while demonstrating in the Senate Hall when the Republicans, who control the judicial committee, chose to go ahead with Kavanaugh's nomination despite the testimony of Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, Mic reported.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are going to be outside the diagram", Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst, told the news site.
People say it's already been high, it's true.
But it could get higher, especially among suburban female voters and younger voters, 18 to 29-year-olds, who, while they don't like the president, often don't vote.
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the allegations of sexual assault directed against the top nominees, analysts suggested that a backlash could follow if the Republicans pressed ahead with the confirmation.
"This has become a confusing mess for the GOP", said Michael Steele, former head of the Republican National Committee, earlier this week, according to NBC News.
"It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh is on the bench, it's also about how Republicans have handled this and how they've treated her", Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helps elect Democrats, points out on the news channel.
But the Americans seem to be a little divided about who to believe in the wake of the Ford and Kavanaugh testimonies, with a little more of a side effect on the latter.
A recent YouGov poll shows that 41 percent of respondents definitely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35 percent said they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
Additionally, 38 percent said they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely laughed during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
According to press reports from Flake, the FBI is currently investigating the claims made by Ford, as well as at least one other complaint, Deborah Ramirez, reported The Guardian.
Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last week that Kavanaugh had completely abused her at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that the nominee showed her her genitals while they attended a party during their time at Yale University in the 1980s.
The inventor of the World Wide Web plans to launch a new Internet to compete with Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, launches a startup that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the technology giant, Inrupt, is a company that builds on Berners-Lees open source platform Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where data is stored and which people have access to which information.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that the meaning of Inrupt is verdensdomination.
"We have to do it now", he said of the beginning.
It's a historical moment.
The app uses Solid's technology to allow people to create their own personal online data warehouse or a POD.
It may contain contact lists, house lists, calendars, music libraries and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive; Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify are all available in one browser at the same time.
What's unique about the personal online store is that it's entirely up to the user who can access all kinds of information.
The company calls it "personal empowerment through data".
The idea behind Inrupt, according to the company's managing director John Bruce, is that the company should take resources, processes and appropriate capabilities to make Solid available to everyone.
The company consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform purchased by IBM and some contracted developers to work on the project, as well as a community of volunteer coders.
From this week, technology developers around the world can create their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not talking to Facebook and Google about not implementing a complete change where all their business models are completely turned on their head overnight.
We don't ask for their permission.
In an entry on medium published on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new Solid-based network.
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he established the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate about net neutrality.
Even during the launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
"I'm incredibly optimistic about this next era of the Web".
Bernard Vann: WW1 Victoria Cross divine feast
The only English church saint to win a Victoria Cross during the First World War as a warrior has been celebrated in his hometown 100 years afterwards.
Lt Col Pastor Bernard Vann won the award on 29 September 1918 in the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was however killed by a snikskitter four days later and never knew that he had won the highest British military honour.
A memorial stone was unveiled by his two grandchildren at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, on Saturday.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" that the stone would be unveiled exactly 100 years after his grandfather's prize-winning achievement.
According to the London Gazette, Lt Col Vann led his battalion over the Canal de Saint-Quentin on 29 September 1918 through a very thick gunfire and under heavy fire from fields and masking guns.
He later sprang up to the frontline, and with the largest gallantry led the line forward before he alone ran forward with a field gun and knocked out three of the group.
Lt Col Vann was killed by a German snikskitter on 4 October 1918 - a little over a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said that the actions of his grandfather were something I know I could never live up to, but something I'm humble about.
He and his brother Dr James Vann also laid a wreath after the parade, which was led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said he felt very honoured to play a part in the parade, adding that the value of a true hero is shown by the support given by many people.
MMA fans were up all night watching Bellator 206, they got Peppa Pig instead
Imagine this, you've been up all night looking at a pack of Bellator 206s but you miss the main event.
The San Jose countdown contained 13 matches, including six on the main card and was shown live through the night in the UK on channel 5.
At 6 a.m., just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were about to meet, viewers in the UK were again stunned when the coverage changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were slightly impressed after they had kept themselves awake until the early hours especially for the battle.
One fan on Twitter described the change to the children's cartoon as "a kind of sick joke".
"It's public regulation that the 6 o'clock if the content wasn't appropriate, so they had to switch to the kids' program", said Dave Schwartz, Bellators senior vice president for marketing and communication, when asked about the transfer.
The Peppa Pig, yeah.
Bellator company president Scott Coker said they will be working on plans to include UK viewers in the future.
"I think when I think about replay, I think we can probably figure it out", Coker said.
But it's six o'clock on a Sunday morning, and we don't find out until Sunday our time, Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when it was over, there were a lot of texts going back and forth, and not all of them were friendly.
We tried to fix it, we thought it was a technical glitch.
But it wasn't; it was a public issue.
I promise you, next time it won't happen.
We're going to keep it to five games instead of six -- as we usually do -- and we're trying to deliver to the fans, and we just go over.
That is an unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley was known to be "underrated" because of his sexuality
Olympic sprinter Tom Daley says that growing up he felt like the worst because of his sexuality -- but that gave him the motivation to become a success.
The 24-year-old said that he didn't realize until he went to high school that not everyone was like me.
Speaking on the first Radio 4 Desert Island discs presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke out about his gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that being a parent made him care less about winning the Olympics.
The long-running reporter Kirsty Young has taken several months off due to illness.
What might have looked like a missing person in Laverne's first show, Daly said that he felt less than everyone else who grew up because it was not socially acceptable to equate boys and girls.
He said: "From today, the feeling of knowing less than and knowing different, were the real things that have given me strength and strength to succeed".
He wanted to prove he was "nothing", he said, so that he wouldn't disappoint anyone when they finally found out about his sexuality.
The two-time bronze Olympic medalist has become a professional LGBT campaigner and used her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to appeal to more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without discrimination and wanted to give others hope.
The three-time world champion said that falling in love with a man -- the American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013 -- "surprised me".
Daley married the Oscar winner, who is 20 years older than him, last year, but he said that the age difference had never been a problem.
When you go through so much at such a young age -- he went to his first Olympics at 14 and his father died of cancer three years later -- he said it was hard to find someone his age who had experienced similar ups and downs.
The couple became parents in June of a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley said that his whole perspective had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, 'Do whatever it takes to win a gold medal,'" he said.
You know what, there are bigger things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medalist is Robbie.
His son has the same name as his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 after being diagnosed with brain cancer.
Daley said that his father didn't accept that he was going to die and one of the last things he asked was if they had tickets to London 2012 -- when he wanted to be in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him you weren't going to be in the front row", he said.
"I held his hand when he stopped breathing, and it wasn't until he actually stopped breathing and he was dead that I finally recognized that he wasn't invincible", he said.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Olympics and won bronze.
"I just knew that this was what I'd dreamed of all my life -- to dive in front of a home crowd at an Olympic Games, where fans couldn't feel better", he said.
It also inspired his first song selection - Stolt by Heather Small - which had vibrated with him in the build-up to the Olympics and still gave him goose bumps.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Sunday at 11:15 BST.
Out of shape, Mickelson sits on the bench at the Ryder Cup on Saturday
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he must turn his shape to avoid an unfortunate milestone.
Mickelson, who played in the two-year event for a record 12th time, was placed on the bench by captain Jim Furyk before Saturday's golf game in fourballs and foursomes.
Instead of being in the middle of the action, as he has often been for the United States, the five-time grand winner split his day between being a cheerleader and working on his game within reach in the hope of correcting what plagues him.
Never the most competent long-shooter, even at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old is best at hitting with the long-shooter on the narrow, French main course, where balls hit outside if the golf player is not accurate with the bat.
And if the course itself isn't scary enough, Mickelson meets in the ninth match Sunday, the exact British Open champion Francesco Molinari, who has teamed up with rookie Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches this week.
If the Americans, four points down at the start of the 12 singles matches, get off to a warm start, Mickelson's match could be quite decisive.
Furyk expressed confidence in her husband, not that he could say much else.
"He understood the role he had today, gave me a pat on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He has a lot of self-confidence.
He's a Hall of Famer, and he's contributed so much to these teams in the past and this week.
I didn't think he played two matches.
I envisioned more, but that's how it happened, and that's how we thought we had to do it.
He wants to be out there, just like everyone else.
Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
It could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never quite matched the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven half-parts, although Furyk said his closeness added some immaterial qualities to the team.
"He's funny, he's sarcastic, he's entertaining, he likes to keep people entertained and he's a nice guy to have in the storage room", he explained.
I think the younger players had fun dealing with him too, this week, which was fun to watch.
He contributes much more than just playing.
Europe Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that great leadership can soon disappear
Thomas Bjørn, the European captain, knows from experience that a significant lead on the way into the last days of the Ryder Cup singles can easily be turned into an unpleasant turn.
The Danish made his debut in the 1997 match at Valderrama, where a side-captain of Seve Ballesteros held a five-point advantage over the Americans, but only came over the nose-left goal line with the narrowest margins, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You kept reminding yourself that we had a great lead at Valderrama; we had a great lead at Brookline, where we lost, and at Valderrama, where we won, but only so far", said Bjørn, after watching the Class of 2018 win 5-3 both on Friday and yesterday to lead 10-6 at Le Golf National.
So history will show me and everyone in the team that this is not over.
You're going to the full opening tomorrow.
Go out there and do all the right things.
This isn't over until you have the score on the board.
We have one goal, and that is to try and win this trophy, and that's where the focus stays.
I've been saying all along, I'm focusing on the 12 players on our side, but we're so well aware of what's on the other side -- the biggest players in the world.
Pleased with how his players have performed on a tough golf course, Bjørn added: "I would never take the winner on the lead.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow is the individual performance, and there's another thing to do.
It's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well, but when you're out there individually, you're being tested to the fullest of your ability as a golfer.
That's the message you need to convey to players: get the best out of yourself tomorrow.
Now forgive your fellow servant, and let him go, and get out of his own way also.
In contrast to Bjørn, opposite number Jim Furyk will be on the lookout for his players to perform better individually than they did as partners, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who picked up three points out of four.
Furyk himself has been in both ends of the turn-offs in the last few days, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before ending as loser when Europe pulled out of the Miracle in Medinah.
"I remember every fucking word of it", he said when asked how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had gathered his players on the way to the final day.
We have 12 important matches tomorrow, but you want to get started with the fast start like you saw in Brookline, like you saw in Medina.
When that moment gets a go, it puts a lot of pressure on the middle struggles.
We set up our line-up correspondingly and set the guys up in a way that feels good, you know, we're going to try to do something magical tomorrow.
Thomas has been assigned the task of trying to lead the match and meets Rory McIlroy in the top game, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter the other Europeans in the top half of the order.
"I joined this group of guys in this order because I think it goes all the way through", said Bjorn about his choice of singles.
Germany's new warships delayed yet again
The newest frigate of the German Navy was to have been ordered in 2014 to replace aging warships from the cold war, but it will not be there until at least next year due to faulty systems and shining costs, local media reported.
The start of Rheinland-Pfalz, the lead ship of the new Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates, has now been postponed to the first half of 2019, according to Die Zeit-Avis, citing a military spokesman.
The ship was due to join the fleet in 2014, but the troubling problems after delivery plagued the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates ordered by the Navy in 2007 come as replacements for the aging Bremen-class frigates.
It is understood that they will contain a powerful cannon, a number of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as some hidden technologies, such as reduced radar, infrared and acoustic signatures.
Other important functions include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the newest frigates for up to two years away from the ports on home-grown basis.
Yet continuing disruptions mean that the pioneering warships, which supposedly allowed Germany to exercise power abroad, will already be outdated when they enter service, notes Die Zeit.
The accidental F125-frigate made headlines last year, when the German fleet officially refused to take the vessel and returned it to Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the German fleet has returned a ship to a shipbuilder after delivery.
Little was known about the causes of the return, but German media cited a number of important software and hardware flaws that rendered the warship unusable if it was deployed on a combat mission.
Software failure was particularly important when the ships of the Baden-Wuerttemberg class were to be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half the workforce of older Bremen-frigates.
It also showed that the ship is dramatically overweight, which reduces performance and limits the ability of the fleet to add to future upgrades.
The 7000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz is thought to be twice as heavy as similar ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Aside from faulty hardware, the cost of the entire project - including training of the crew - becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached a staggering €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) - up from the initial €2.2 billion (EUR)
Problems associated with the latest frigates are especially important in light of the recent warnings that Germany's fleet strength is declining.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, chief of the German parliament's defense department, acknowledged that the fleet had effectively ended distribution-competent ships.
The officer said the problem had built up over time, as old ships were being scrapped, but no replacement vessels were being delivered.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Wuerttemberg-class frigates were able to join the fleet.
National Trust eavesdropping on the secret life of a flagger
New research being conducted on a property in the Scottish Highlands, aims to reveal how the flagger mice use the landscape in the hunt for food.
It is hoped that the findings will shed new light on the unique behaviour of the flying mammals and help guide future conservation activities.
The study by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and soprano pipistrelles as well as the brown long-eared bat and Daubenton flaggermus at Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
Special recorders will be placed at key locations around the property to track flagger mouse activities throughout the season.
NHS-affiliates and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys using handheld detectors.
Expert sound analysis of all recorded sounds will determine the frequency of flaggermuss calls and what species do what.
A habitat map and report will then be produced to create a detailed landscape-scale picture of their behaviour.
Rob Dewar, the NTS's natural science adviser, hopes the results will reveal which areas of habitat, natural homes, are most important to the flagger mice and how they are used by each of the species.
This information will help determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the acquisition of engravings and how best to maintain the same forest area for flaggermus and other associated species.
Flagger mouse populations in Scotland and across the UK have declined significantly over the last century.
They are the result of construction and development work affecting resting places and habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can flying paper and some chemical treatments of building materials, as well as attacks by pet cats.
Flaggermuss is not actually blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are still more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to find flaws and obstacles in their flight window.
NTS, which is responsible for the care of more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country, takes the flagger mice very seriously.
It has ten trained experts, who regularly conduct investigations, rest inspections and sometimes save lives.
The organisation has even established Scotland's first and only dedicated flaggermus reserve at Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's ten flaggermus species.
Property manager David Thompson says that the property is the ideal territory for them.
"Here at Threave we have a great area for the flagbearer", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitats.
But there's still a lot about the flagbees that's unknown, so the work we're doing here and on other properties will help us understand more about what they need to thrive.
He emphasizes the importance of checking for flaggermus before performing maintenance on property, since it is possible that the endless destruction of a single buplass could kill up to 400 female flaggermus and young, and perhaps exterminate an entire local population.
Flaggermuses are peaceful and it is illegal to kill, harass, disturb or destroy their resting places.
Elisabeth Ferrell, Scottish officer for the Bat Conservation Trust, has encouraged the public to come in and help.
She said, "We still have a lot to learn about our flagbearers, and for many of our species, we don't know how their populations are endangered".
Ronaldo rejects allegations of violence in court
Cristiano Ronaldo has labeled the violence charges against him as "fake news" and says people "wish to stand out" by using his name.
His lawyers are set to sue German news magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus forward has been accused of raping an American woman, Kathryn Mayorga, in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009.
He is alleged to have paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported on Friday.
In a live Instagram video, Ronaldo, 33, tells his 142 million followers just hours after the accusations, that the accusations are fake news.
No, no, no, no, no. I'm not going to do that.
What they said today, fake news, the five-time Golden Ball winner says to the camera.
They want to market themselves using my name.
That is normal.
They'll be known for saying my name, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man and all is well, the player smiled.
Ronaldo's lawyers are planning to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "an unacceptable reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy", according to Reuters.
Advocate Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for moral damage in an amount that reflects the seriousness of the breach, which is likely one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years.
The alleged incident is said to have taken place in June 2009 at a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player's room, where they claimed he had raped her anal, according to documents filed with the Clark County District Court in Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on his knees after the alleged incident and told him that he was 99 percent a good guy and failed by one percent.
The document claims that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex, but that it was consensual.
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and had photographs taken of her injuries at a hospital, but later agreed to an outcome because she felt "scared of retaliation" and was concerned about "being publicly humiliated".
The 34-year-old says she is now trying to move as she continues to be traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was on the verge of joining Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and in the summer he moved to Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: UK 'would forever regret' losing carmakers
Britain would regret it forever if it lost its status as a world leader in car production after Brexit, said business secretary Greg Clark.
He added that it was "unfortunate" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that if the UK left the EU without an agreement, it would temporarily stop production at the Burnaston factory, near Derby.
"We need a deal", said Clark.
The Japanese carmaker said the effect of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis - produced nearly 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of the EU.
"My view is that if the UK leaves the EU at the end of March, we'll see a production halt at our factory", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's CEO in Burnaston.
Other British carmakers have raised fears of leaving the EU without an agreement on how cross-border trade will work, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
BMW says, for example, that it will close its Mini-factory in Oxford in one month after Brexit.
The main concerns are what the carmakers say is the supply chain risk in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run on a just-in-time basis, with parts coming in every 37 minutes from suppliers in both the UK and EU for cars that are ordered.
If the UK leaves the EU without a deal on March 29, there could be border disruptions that industry says could lead to damage and parts shortages.
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day's worth of inventory at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and thus production would be halted.
Mr Clark said that Theresa May's Checkers plan for future relations with the EU is "extremely calibrated to avoid border controls".
"We need to have the best deal that will allow, as I say, not just to enjoy the success of today, but for us to seize this opportunity", he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
The evidence, not just from Toyota, but from other companies, is that we absolutely need to continue what has been a very successful supply chain.
Toyota could not say how long the production would be halted, but on the longer term they warned that additional costs would reduce the plant's competitiveness and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked in Burnaston for 24 years, and is the Unite union at the plant, said that his members are more concerned about: "In my experience, once these jobs go, they never come back.
A government spokesperson said: "We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relationship with the EU".
Trump meeting with Rosenstein could be delayed again, says White House
Donald Trump's high-profile meeting with next-in-command Rod Rosenstein could be pushed back a week as the fight against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues, the White House said Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who investigates Russian election meddling, links between Trump supporters and Russia and potential obstruction of justice by the president.
Whether Trump will resign as attorney general or not, and thus put Mueller's independence in jeopardy, has fueled Washington's gossip for months.
Earlier in the month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed a lead to recording conversations with Trump and the possibility of removing the president by the 25th amendment.
Rosenstein denied the report.
But Monday before, he went to the White House, and it was reported that he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump said he would "prefer" not to kick Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid colliding with the Senate committee's hearing where both Kavanaugh and one of the women who accused him of sexual harassment, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, testified.
On Friday, Trump ordered a week-long FBI investigation into allegations against Kavanaugh, delaying a full vote by the Senate.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, appeared on Fox News on Sunday.
When asked about the Rosenstein hearing, she said, "There's no date set. It could be this week, but I can imagine it's being delayed another week given everything else going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I always like to keep the press updated.
Some reporters will probably disagree: Sanders hasn't held a White House press briefing since September 10th.
The host, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said the lack of orientation was not due to a dissatisfaction with TV reporters' play for the gallery, although she said: "I'm not disagreeing with them doing it".
She also mentioned that direct contact between Trump and the press is going to increase.
"The president is holding more press conferences than any president has ever done", she said, "right enough without providing any evidence to support the claim.
Sanders says that updates will still happen, but since the press gets the chance to ask the President of the United States directly, it's much better than talking to me.
We've been trying to do it in a way, and you've seen us do it a lot in the last few weeks, and it's going to take over from a press orientation if you can talk directly to the President of the United States.
Trump is likely to take questions when he leaves the White House or participates in open sessions or press conferences with visitors.
It is unusual for the president to hold press conferences alone.
In New York this week, the president demonstrated why, perhaps, by behaving before reporters in a shameless, almost bizarre way.
Health Secretary writes about Brexit fears among EU NHS workers in Scotland
The Health Secretary has written to EU workers working at the NHS in Scotland to express their gratitude and wish them continued success after Brexit.
Jeane Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, sent a letter, even though it's less than six months left before the UK withdraws from the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to taking on the costs of applications that have the status of settled for EU residents working in delegated public services.
In the letter, Freeman wrote: "During the summer, negotiations on a withdrawal between the UK and the EU have continued, and the expected conclusion is approaching in the autumn.
However, the British government has stepped up preparations in case there is no agreement.
I understand that this must be a difficult time for all of you.
So I would like to reiterate my appreciation for the contributions of all our employees, regardless of their nationality.
Our colleagues from the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and expertise that strengthens and improves the work in the health sector and is beneficial to patients and communities.
Scotland is clearly your home, and we want you to stay.
Christion Abercrombie undergoing emergency surgery after head injury
Linebacker Christion Abercrombie, who plays for the Tennessee State Tigers, underwent an emergency surgery after suffering a head injury in the team's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores on Saturday, reports The Tennessean.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed told reporters the injury occurred just before the break.
"He came to the sidelines and collapsed, sort of", Reed said.
Coaches and medical personnel gave Abercrombie oxygen on the sideline before placing him on a belt and taking him back for further evaluation.
An official spokesman for Tennessee State told WSMV that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
There are no details about the extent of the damage yet, Harris said, adding that Tennessee State is still trying to figure out when the damage occurred.
Abercrombie is in his second year at the university, and is in his first season after being transferred from Illinois.
He had a total of five tackles before being injured in Saturday's game, and is now up to 18 total this season.
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher documentation fee when buying property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay a higher documentation fee when buying property in the UK, and the extra proceeds will be used to help the homeless, according to the Conservative's new plans.
The decision will neutralize Corbyn's success in attracting young voters
The increase in document fees will be added for those who do not pay taxes in the UK
The Treasury expects an increase of up to £120 million a year to help the homeless
Theresa May will announce that foreign buyers will have to pay a higher documentation fee when they buy property in the UK, and the extra proceeds will be used to help the homeless.
This decision will be seen as an attempt to neutralise the success Jeremy Corbyn has had in attracting young voters who earn a lot, with the promise of offering affordable housing.
The increase in document fees will be added to individuals and firms who do not pay taxes in the UK, and the extra money will strengthen the government's desire to reduce the number of taxpayers.
The tax, which comes in addition to the current documentation tax, includes the higher levels introduced two years ago on housing number two and rental housing, which can be as much as three percent.
The State Treasury expects the decision to bring in up to 120 million pounds a year.
About 13 percent of London's new housing is bought by people outside the UK, which is driving up prices and making it harder for first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
Many prosperous areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become ghost towns because of the large number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time in other countries.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson wanted to cut the documentation to help more young people buy their first home.
He accused large construction firms of keeping prices high by taking property but not using it, and asked Theresa May to give up the quotas on affordable housing to fix Britain's housing shortage.
Corbyn has announced a series of controversial proposals for housing reform, including controlled rent and the end of unjustified evictions.
He wants to give the council more power to build new homes.
May said, "Last year I said I would dedicate my position to bringing back the British dream -- that life should be better for every new generation.
It means fixing the ruined housing market.
The UK will always be open to people who want to live, work and build a life here.
Yet it cannot be right that it should be as easy for non-UK residents, or foreign companies, to buy homes as it is for hardworking UK residents.
For many people, the dream of owning a home is too far away, and the humiliation of being a neighborhood is real.
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland boss Jack Ross says his ultimate ambition is to become manager of Scotland at some point.
The Scots (42) are delighted with the challenge of reviving the club from the north-east, currently in third place in League One, just three points off the top.
He moved to Stadium of Light in the summer, having led St Mirren back to the Scottish elite in the previous season.
I wanted to play for my country that plays.
I got a B-team match, and that was it, Ross told Scotland's BBC Sportsound.
But I grew up seeing Scotland on the Hamden with my dad, and there's always been something that's drawn me back.
That opportunity can only come if I succeed as a club manager.
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland manager include Dick Advocaat, Sam Allardyce, Martin ONeill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former Alloa Athletic boss says he has not been anxious to come after so many established names in such a big club, having previously rejected approaches from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"At the moment, my success will be measured by whether I can get this club back into the Premier League".
"On the basis of the structure and facilities of this club, there is no doubt that they belong in the Premier League", he said.
It's not easy to get them there, but I can probably only consider myself successful if I get the club back there.
Ross is just three years into his career as a manager, after a period as assistant chief at Dumbarton and a 15-month period in Hearts' training kit.
He then helped Alloa to come back from relegation to third level, and transformed St Mirren, who was on the way to relegation, into the title winners of the Championship the following season.
And Ross says he feels more comfortable now than he ever did when he was playing for Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"It was probably a crossroads", he says of leading Alloa.
I really thought being a manager suited me much better than being a player.
And it sounds weird, because I did it well, I earned it well, and I liked it pretty well.
But gaming can be tough.
There are a lot of things you have to get through every week.
I still feel it when it comes to the stress and pressure of the job, but it feels right to be a manager.
I've always wanted to be a manager, and now I am, and it's the most comfortable thing I've ever felt in my own body in my entire adult life.
On Sunday 30 September you can hear the full interview on Sportsound, Radio Scotland, between 12pm and 1pm.
Research shows that the perfect time for a half-liter is 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday.
The summer heat wave has led to an increase in the income of struggling pubs in the UK, but also increased the pressure on restaurant chains.
In July, sales in the children's market increased by 2.7 percent - but for the restaurant industry, it fell by 4.8 percent, statistics show.
Corporate adviser Peter Martin, who is behind the statistics, said: "The continued sunshine and the fact that England was in the World Cup longer than planned means that July followed the pattern for June where pubs went up 2.8 percent, only restaurants were hit even harder.
The 1.8 percent decline in the restaurant industry only worsened in July.
Pubs and bars selling drinks did a lot better and went up more than restaurants went down.
Pubs selling food noticed the sun's decline, though not as dramatic as for restaurant owners.
It may seem like people just want to go out for a drink.
Among pubs and bars, the drink sales had increased by 6.6 percent this month, while food had fallen by 3 percent.
Paul Newman, travel and leisure analyst at RSM, said: "These results are the continuation of the trend we've seen since the end of April.
Weather, and the impact of an enormous social or sports event, will still be the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the outdoor industry.
It's no surprise that the restaurant industry is still struggling. a 4.8 percent annual decline in sales would be hard to come by on top of an ongoing cost pressure.
The long, hot summer could not come at a worse time for food operators, as the more moderate temperatures experienced in August will provide a much longer breathing space.
The total sales growth across pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7 percent in July, reflecting the downturn in the issuance of brands.
Coffer Peach Tracker, the sales supervisor for the British pub, bar and restaurant industry, collects and analyses the results of 47 operating groups with a combined turnover of over £9 billion, and is the established industry's reference index.
One in five kids has a secret social media profile that they're not telling their parents.
One in five children -- some as young as 11 -- have secret social media profiles that they hide from parents and teachers, a study shows.
Survey of 20 000 current students reveals an increase in fake Insta profiles
This news has raised fears that sexual content is being posted
Twenty percent of the students say they have a "God" profile they show their parents.
One in five children -- some as young as 11 -- create social media profiles that they keep secret from adults.
A survey of 20,000 students at secondary schools revealed a sharp increase in falske Insta profiles - a reference to the image sharing platform Instagram.
The news has increased fears of sexual content being posted.
Twenty percent of the students say they have a sterile God profile that they show to their parents, and they have private profiles at the same time.
A mother who stumbled upon the secret side of her 13-year-old daughter found a teenager who encouraged others to "violent me".
The research, conducted by Digital Awareness UK and Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) at various schools, found that 40 percent of those between 11 and 18 years old had two profiles, and half of these admitted to having private users.
The head of HMC, Mike Buchanan, said, "It's alarming that so many teenagers are tempted to create places on the Internet where parents and teachers can't find them".
Eilidh Doyle becomes the atletane's voice in the Scottish athletics governing body
Eilidh Doyle has been elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Friidrett as non-executive director at the Board's annual general meeting.
Doyle is the most decorated Scottish freestyle athlete, and board chairman Ian Beattie described the event as a great opportunity for those leading the sport to benefit from her extensive experience at international level during the last decade.

Internet divided on breast pump ads comparing mothers to dairy cows
A breast pump company has split the Internet with an ad comparing nursing mothers to dairy cows.
To mark what is described as world's first still-moving, on-set breast pump, technology company Elvie released a small-scale advertisement inspired by music videos to demonstrate the freedom the new pump gives mothers who obtain milk.
Four real mothers dancing in a crowded cowshed to a song that includes lyrics like, "Yes, I'm milking myself, but you don't see any tail" and "In case you didn't notice, these aren't spiders, these are my nipples".
The refrain goes on: "Pump it out, pump it out, I feed these kids, pump it out, pump it out, I milk my ladies".
The ad, which was published on the company's Facebook page, has, however, caused controversy on the web.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from viewers, many saying it highlights the "horror" in the dairy industry.
Very bad decision to use cows to advertise this product.
Like us, they need to get pregnant and give birth to produce milk, only that the calves are stolen from them just days after birth, one writes.

Another commented: "Understandably traumatic for both mother and child
But, yes, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who get to keep their babies?
Another added: "For a remote advertising".
Others defended the ad, and one lady admitted that she thought the sound was "festival".
I think this is a brilliant idea.
I would have one if I still breastfed.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
This commercial is a little crazy, but I took it for what it is.
This is a brilliant product", one wrote.
Another commented: This is a funny advertisement directed at mothers who pump (often at work or on the toilet) and feel like cows.
This is not a commercial that boasts or judges the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the group of women reveal that they have all danced with the discreet pumped pack into their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the insight that many women who pump say they feel like cows.
The Elvie pump, on the other hand, is completely quiet, has no leads or pipes, and is set discreetly inside a breast-BH, giving women the freedom to move, hold their babies, and even go outside while they pump.
Ana Balardin, partner and creative director at Mother, commented: "The Elvie pump is a so-so revolutionary product, that it deserves a daring and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between mothers who produce milk and dairy cows, we want to shine a light on breast pumping and the challenges associated with it, and at the same time demonstrate the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring, in an entertaining and recognizable way.
This is not the first time the Elvie pump has made headlines.
During the London fashion week, a mother of two appeared on the podium for designer Marta Jakubowski, while she was wearing the product.
Hundreds of immigrant children quietly moved to tent camps on the Texas border
The number of immigrant children in prison has topped even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged, partly due to the Trump administration's strict policies that make it harder to place children with sponsors.
Traditionally, most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves, and they fear that standing up and taking in a child could threaten their own chances of staying in the country.
The risk of it rising in June, when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult family members would be forced to send in fingerprints, and that these data would be shared with immigration authorities.
Earlier this week, witness Matthew Albence of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency of the United States Congress said the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to sponsor solitary minors.
The bureau later confirmed that 70 percent of those arrested had nothing on their rolls from before.
Nearly 80 percent of the people who are either sponsors or family members of sponsors are in the country illegally, and a large proportion of these are criminal foreigners.
So we're going to keep chasing these people", Albence said.
According to officials in the camp, new rules have been introduced for handling the children, which require some of them to appear in court before a month has passed, compared to 60 days earlier.
Many will participate via video conferences and not in person, to get their case tried before an immigration judge.
Those who are not eligible for release will be deported quickly.
The longer the children are in custody, the more likely they are to develop anxiety or depression, which can lead to violent outbursts or attempts to escape, say camp officials, and reports that have surfaced in recent months say the same thing.
Spokesmen say these concerns are greater at large facilities such as Tornillo, and that because of the size of the facility, it is more likely that signs of child wear are overlooked.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them enough time to prepare emotionally, or to express hatred towards friends, can amplify the traumas that many have already suffered.
Syria asks US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also asked that Syrian refugees return home, despite the country's eighth year of war.
Moualem, who is serving as vice-minister, said foreign forces are staying illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism, and will be treated in that way.
"You must withdraw immediately and without delay", he told the assembly.
Moualem insisted that the war on terror is almost over in Syria, where more than 360,000 people have lost their lives since 2011, and millions have been displaced from their homes.
He said Damascus would continue to fight a holy fight until all Syrian territory had been cleared of both terrorist groups and illegal foreign presence.
The United States has approximately 2,000 troops in Syria, primarily for training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
France has more than 1,000 troops on the ground in the war-torn country.
When it came to the refugee problem, Moualem said it was safe for them to return, and blamed some Western countries for spreading irrational fear about the environment that caused the refugees to stay away.
"We have asked the international community and the humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return", he said.
They're making policy out of what should be a purely humanitarian problem.
The United States and the European Union have warned that there will be no help for the reconstruction of Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is in place.
Diplomats from the United Nations say a recently concluded agreement between Russia and Turkey to set up a buffer zone in Idlib, the last major rebel stronghold, has created an opportunity to press ahead with political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement prevented a major attack by Russian-backed Syrian forces on the province, which is home to three million people.
Moualem, however, stressed that the agreement had "clear timeframes" and expressed hope that military action would be directed against jihadists, including Nusra front fighters, who are linked to Al-Qaeda, who "will be wiped out".
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to soon assemble the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war law for Syria, paving the way for elections.
Moualem set the conditions for the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the panel's work should be limited "to reviewing the articles of the current constitution", and warned against interference.
Why Trump is going to win another term
With that logic, Trump will win re-election in 2020 if, as many liberal observers probably hope, the presidency is not brought to an early end by scandals and impeachment.
It would be without a doubt the most dramatic end to a presidency ever!
At the time of writing, there is no sign of any confusion.
Since 2014, CNN has doubled its rating in best broadcast time to 1.05 million, while MSNBC has nearly tripled its rating to 1.6 million.
Fox News has an average of 2.4 million viewers in prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's The Rachel Maddow Show has remained at the top of cable ratings with as many as 3.5 million viewers on major news nights.
"This is a fire that people are attracted to, because it's something we don't understand", said Neal Baer in the ABC drama "Designated Survivor", about a cabinet secretary who becomes president after an attack destroys the Congressional Building.
Nell Scovell, the former comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And a Few Hard Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has a different theory.
She remembers a ride in a taxi in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver said he was going to vote for Trump.
Why? she asked.
"Because he makes me laugh", he replied, according to Scovell.
There's entertainment value in the chaos.
Of course, unlike anything else on TV, the story coming out of Washington could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families get back together and the health of the global economy.
Turning off is a luxury that only the most privileged viewers can afford.
And yet it goes beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself in the sixth grade watching a panel of experts debate Bob Woodward's use of "deep-seated" sources for his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15 000 strut jacket ("a garment thick with arrogance", said the Washington Post), and the implications of Stormy Daniel's gruesome description of Trump's, uh, anatomy.
Personally, I'm never going to look at Super Mario the same way again.
"Part of what he does that makes it feel like a reality show is that he gives you something every night", said Brent Montgomery, day-to-day manager at Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of Pawn Stars, about the show's dealings with Trump's employees and daily disputes.
You can't afford to miss a single episode, otherwise you're not in it anymore.
When I met Fleiss this week, it was over 25 degrees and sunny outside his home on the north coast of Kauai, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while he was recording CNN.
He could not turn away, not when Brett Kavanaugh stood before the Senate Commission and the future of the Supreme Court hung in a thin thread.
"I remember when we did all these crazy shows back then and people said, 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization,'" Fleiss said.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Money from outside flows into the closest midterm election
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania's 17th district sees an abundance of money, thanks to a reorganization of the district in Congress that led to two sitting members fighting for the same seat.
The newly-renamed Pittsburg suburb is currently represented by Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in another district in a special election last spring.
Lamb is fighting another sitting member, Republican Keith Rothfus, currently representing the former 12th district of Pennsylvania, which largely overlaps with the new 17th district.
The map was redrawn after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old district was illegally designed to benefit the Republicans.
The competition over the 17th district has set in motion a weapon draw on the financing of the campaigns, between the big party's money arsenal, the Democratic Congressional Elections and the Republican Congressional Elections.
Lamb became a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory in a closely followed special election in Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district.
The seat had belonged to a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by over 20 points.
Political experts have given the Democrats a narrow advantage.
The US considered punishing El Salvador for allegedly supporting China, but withdrew
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama have already recognized Beijing without negative reactions from Washington.
Trump had a warm meeting with the president of Panama, Juan Carlos Varela, in June 2017 and had a hotel in Panama to expel the Trump organization's leadership group.
The secretaries of state decided to bring back the U.S. heads of diplomatic missions from El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama over their "final decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan", said Heather Nauert, the department's spokeswoman, in a statement earlier this month.
However, penalties were only considered against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control, development and economic aid.
The current penalties, which included cutting economic aid and targeted visa restrictions, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and murder rates.
As internal meetings developed, North American and Central American officials postponed a conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up a similar gathering last year that was seen as a step forward in preventing immigrants from coming to the United States.
However, in mid-September, top administrators announced that they wanted the conference to continue, and therefore halted the consideration of the punishment for El Salvador.
It has now been said that Vice President Mike Pence will meet the conference, which has been planned for mid-October, as a signal of the relevance the administration places on the gathering, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic without any further harsh messages or sanctions from Washington.
A spokesman for Bolton declined to comment on the details of the debate described by the three U.S. officials, including two diplomats, who were uncertain about discussing the internal considerations on the condition of anonymity.
Their description was confirmed by an uninformed analyst who works closely with the administration and spoke on condition of anonymity.
Studying history
Special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Trump's possible obstruction of justice is awaited, as substantial evidence is now available in the public protocols.
According to the reports, Mueller has turned his investigation to whether Trump's campaign conspired with Russia to launch attacks on our elections.
If the Congress were to change leaders, Trump would have to stand up to this body, in which he is preparing to convince the voters and possibly a jury of his peers.
There's a lot of hype about it, and I don't mean to imply that Trump's fall is inevitable, nor is it for his European counterpart.
It's a choice for all of us on both sides of the pond, that will affect how long this fight can go on.
In 1938, German officers prepared for a coup against Hitler, only the West had stood in his way and helped the Czechs in Munich.
We were wrong, and we missed an opportunity to avoid the years of bloodshed that would follow.
The course of history revolves around such turning points, and democracy's unprecedented march is accelerated or postponed.
Americans are facing many of these turning points right now.
What are we going to do if Trump fires Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of Mueller's investigation?
Rosenstein has been on the prowl ever since this newspaper revealed that he last year proposed to abolish the president in secret, and speculated that he was uncertain about his role.
Rosenstein says the Times's description is inaccurate.
How would we react if the recently-interviewed FBI investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is not complete or fair or he is accepted by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations of sexual abuse and dishonest testimony?
And most importantly, will we vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that holds Trump accountable?
If we fail these tests, democracy will face a long winter.
But I hope we do not fail, in the light of the teachings I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the same Nazi regime that once occupied the country where I have my embassy.
She survived, immigrated to the United States, and 60 years later, she sent me on a guard duty to light the Sabbath-light on the swastika-bearing table.
So, with this being my legacy, how can I not be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrans optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna
Rangers take on Rapid Vienna on Thursday, knowing that victory over the Austrians, after an impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will give them a good starting point to qualify from Group G of the European League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrans from making his first appearance this season before the 2-2 result against Villarreal, but he believes Rangers can use this result as a springboard to bigger things.
"It was a good point for us, because Villarreal is a good team", said the 31-year-old.
We went into the fight believing we could get something, and came out with a point.
Maybe we could have taken it towards the end, but overall, it's probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half, and then we came out in the second half and were the better team.
Thursday is another big European night.
Hopefully we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough fight, they had a good result in their first match, but with the crowd behind us I'm sure we can continue and get a positive result.
The last year has definitely been tough, with all the things that have happened with my injuries and the changes in the club, but now I feel fine.
The stables are good and the boys are doing well; the training is good.
Hopefully we can keep going, put the previous season behind us and be successful.
Women lose sleep over this fear of retirement savings.
Despite the fact that participants in one study had clear ideas about how they would be cared for, few talked to family members about it.
About half of those who took part in a survey by the insurance company Nationwide said they talked to their spouses about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent said they talked to their kids about it.
"People want a family member to take care of them, but they don't take the necessary steps to have that conversation", says Nationwide vice president Holly Snyder.
This is where you start.
Talk to your spouse and children: You can't prepare your family to take care of you if you don't make your wishes known in advance.
Work with a counselor and your family to discuss when and how you should receive care, as these choices can be a big part of determining costs.
Get a financial advisor: Your advisor can help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
Financing choices for long-term care can include a traditional long-term care insurance, a cash-value life insurance to help pay the expenses, or you insure yourself with your own wealth -- as long as you have the money.
Make legal documents: Avoid legal battles before they start.
Have a health authority in place, so that you can appoint someone you trust to oversee your medical treatment and to ensure that professionals act in line with your wishes in case you can't communicate.
You may also consider an authorized representative for your finances.
You should appoint someone you trust to make financial decisions and make sure your bills are paid if you don't have the means yourself.
Don't forget the little details: Imagine that your grandparent has a medical emergency and is on his way to the hospital.
Could you answer questions about medications and allergies?
Write all these details down in a written plan so you're done.
"It's not just the finances, but who are the doctors?" asked Martin.
What kind of medication is that?
Who's going to take care of the dog?
Have the plan ready.
Man shot multiple times with air gun in Ilfracombe
A man has been shot several times with an air gun as he was on his way home from a city tour.
The victim, aged 40, was shot in the chest, stomach and hand in the area around Oxford Grove in Ilfracombe, Devon.
Politicians describe the shooting, which occurred around 02.30 local time, as an "accidental act".
The victim did not see the assailant.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police are requesting witnesses.
Earthquakes and tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people have been killed in the powerful earthquake and tsunami that hit the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, public officials said, adding that the death toll is expected to rise.
Without the possibility to communicate, aid workers have not received any information from Donggala, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated after the disaster was a fact.
Here are some key facts about Palu and Donggala, which are located on the island of Sulawesi:
Palu is the capital of the central Sulawesi province, and is located on the edge of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island.
The city is celebrating its 40th anniversary of the earthquake and tsunami.
Donggala is an area stretching over more than 300 km along the coastline northwest of the island.
The area, which is an administrative region lower than a province, had an estimated population of 299 200 in 2017.
Fisheries and farming are the mainstay of the economy of central Sulawesi, particularly in the coastal region of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also important in the province, but is mostly concentrated to Morowali, on the other side of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years, according to the Indonesia Disaster Reduction Office.
In 1938, more than 200 people were killed and hundreds of houses destroyed by a tsunami in Donggala.
In 1996, the western side of Donggala was hit by a tsunami that killed nine people.
Indonesia lies in the seismic Ildringen of the Pacific Ocean and is likely to be affected by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis of the last few years:
2004: A major earthquake on the west coast of Aceh province in northern Sumatra on December 26, 2004 triggered a tsunami that hit 14 countries and killed 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of these in Aceh.
2005: A series of large earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Several hundred died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Java, Indonesia's most populous island, and triggered a tsunami that crossed the southern coastline and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake near the city of Padang, capital of the province of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake hits one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a 10-meter tsunami that devastates dozens of villages and kills about 300 people.
2016: A small earthquake hit Pidie Jaya area in Aceh and caused devastation and panic when people were reminded of the 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was triggered this time, but more than 100 buildings were destroyed.
2018: A major earthquake hits the tourist island of Lombok and kills more than 500 people, mostly on the northern side of the island.
The quake destroyed several thousand buildings and left several thousand tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested and charged with domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested and charged with assault.
According to a report released by the state police in Alaska, Palin (29) was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, interference in the reporting of domestic violence and resisting arrest.
According to the police report, he took the phone from a female acquaintance as she tried to call the police to report the crime.
Palin is being held in the Mat-Su prison, and is being held on a $500 bond, KTUU reported.
He appeared in court on Saturday and pleaded not guilty when questioned, the network said.
Palin faces three misdemeanor counts of Class A, which means he could face up to one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He has also been charged with a class B misdemeanor, punishable by a day in jail and a fine of $2,000.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
Her mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the attack.
The case is pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic assault, involvement in a reporting of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His girlfriend had alleged that he hit her in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups for associating her son's violent behavior with PTSD, which dates back to his service in Iraq.
Earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia: hundreds killed
At least 384 people have lost their lives after an earthquake struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake triggered a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
Electricity and communications networks are down, and the number of casualties is expected to rise in the coming days.
The earthquake struck just outside the central part of Sulawesi, northeast of the capital Jakarta.
Videos of the dramatic moment of the quake are flourishing on social media.
Several hundred people had gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami hit the beach.
Federal agencies want rare death penalty for New York terror suspects
Federal prosecutors in New York want the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, suspected of the terrorist attack that killed eight people -- a rare sentence that hasn't been carried out for a federal crime in the state since 1953.
Saipov (30) allegedly used a rental car from Home Depot to carry out an attack on a cycling track along West Side Highway in lower Manhattan in October, killing pedestrians and cyclists on the road.
To justify a death sentence, the actors must prove that Saipov killed his eight victims "deliberately" and that he "deliberately" inflicted serious bodily harm, according to a note filed in the Southern District of New York.
Both of these incidents could be grounds for a possible death penalty, the court document states.
Weeks after the attack, a federal jury handed over a list of 22 indictments, including eight counts of murder with intent to extort money, usually by federal actors in connection with organized crime, and one count of assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required "substantial planning and oversight", the actors said, describing the way Saipov carried out the attack as "abominable, cruel and destructive".
Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov caused damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco, it is stated in the note.
Five of the victims were tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the last time the Southern District of New York sentenced a person to death in a case.
The accused, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of killing two drug dealers, but was ultimately sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The last time a death sentence was carried out in a federal case in New York was in 1953 for Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had been executed two years earlier for conspiracy to commit espionage for the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
On June 19, 1953, both were executed in the electric chair.
Saipov, originally from Uzbekistan, showed a lack of reporting in the days and months that followed, according to court documents.
He told the detectives that what he had done was well known, the police said.
Saipov told authorities he was inspired to carry out the attack after watching videos of ISIS on his phone, the indictment said.
He also asked to have the ISIS flag on the hospital room, police said.
He has pleaded not guilty to all counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, says they are "clearly disappointed" with the prosecution's decision.
"We believe that the decision to pursue the death penalty, rather than accepting a guilty plea to life in prison without the possibility of parole, will only prolong the trauma of the incident for all involved", Patton said.
Saipov's defenders had earlier asked the actors not to pursue the death penalty.
Tory MP thinks Nigel Farage should lead Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage promised to "mobilising the people's army" today, during a protest at the Tory-landsmiths' meeting.
The former leader of the UK Independence Party said politicians had to "feel the pressure" from the eurosceptics as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested he should delay negotiations with the EU.
Conservative, one-sided MP Peter Bone told protesters in Birmingham that Britain would be out of the way if Farage was Brexit minister.
With the challenge May faces of reconciling her deeply divided ranks has been underlined by a separate protest in the city, held by Tories who wish to remain in the EU.
The prime minister struggled to keep the Chequers compromise on track after attacks from Brexiteers, Remainers and the EU.
Allies insist she will press for a deal with Brussels, despite the retreat and forcing Euroskeptics and the Labour Party to choose between her package and the "caos".
Bone told the Leave Means Leave group in Solihull that he wanted to "dismiss Chequers"
He suggested that Farage should be given a noble rank and be given responsibility for the negotiations with Brussels.
He said, "If he had, we'd be out now".
The MPs from Wellingborough, added: "I will fight for Brexit, but we must reject Chequers".
To mark his opposition to the EU, he said, "We didn't fight World Wars to be subordinate.
We will make our own laws in our own country.
Bone rejects the claim that the people's minds have changed since the 2016 election: "The idea that the British people have changed their minds and wish to stay is completely untrue".
Tory Brexit campaigner Andrea Jenkins also took part in the march, telling reporters: "I'm just saying: Prime Minister, listen to the people!"
Chequers are not popular with the population, the opposition is not going to vote for it, it's not popular with our party or our activists who frequent the streets and get us elected in the first place.
Please, drop the Chequers and listen
In a message directed at May, she added: "State ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises".
Farage said politicians must be "aware of the heat" if they are to betray the 2016 referendum decision.
"Now it's about trust between us - the people - and the political class", he said.
They're trying to betray Brexit, and we're here today to tell them that we're not going to let them get away with it.
In a message to the enthusiastic audience, he added: "I want you to make the political class, which is on the verge of betraying Brexit, feel the heat.
We are mobilizing the people's army of this country that gave us the victory in Brexit and will not rest until we have become an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom.
At the same time, Remainers marched through the streets of Birmingham before holding a two-hour meeting in the city centre.
A handful of activists waved Tories Against Brexit banners after launching the group this weekend.
Labour colleague Lord Adonis made fun of the security concerns of the Conservatives with a party app during the opening of the conference.
"These are the people who are telling us that they can have all the computer systems in place and all the technology for Canada plus plus, for friction-free borders, for free trade without borders in Ireland", he added.
It's a complete farce.
There's no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren plans to take a close look at running for president
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren says she will take a closer look at running for president after the November election.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat spoke about his future during a Saturday evening meeting in Massachusetts.
Warren, a regular critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against Republican Geoff Diehl, who was a member of Trump's 2016 Massachusetts campaign.
She has been the center of much speculation that she might try out for Trump in 2020.
The incident in Holyoke on Saturday was her 36th meeting with voters in a city hall since Trump's inauguration.
One participant asked if she had plans to run for president.
Warren said, "It's time for women to take the trip to Washington to fix our broken government, and that includes a woman at the top".
Arrest made in the shooting of Louisiana State University player Sims
Baton Rouge police announced Saturday that a suspect has been arrested in the shooting and killing of Louisiana State University (LSU) basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
At 11.00 local time, the police announced the arrest of Dyteon Simpson (20), in a press conference for ET.
They released a video of the shooting on Friday, and asked for help in identifying a man seen on the video.
Sims (20) was shot and killed early Friday on the university's southern campus.
"Wayde Sims suffered a gunshot wound to the head and eventually died as a result of it", police chief Murphy J. Paul told the media Saturday, according to 247sports.
Wayde went in to defend a friend and was shot by Simpson.
In fact, Simpson has admitted that he was on the scene, with a gun, and admitted that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without dramatic effect and placed in police custody in eastern Baton Rouge.
A six-foot-three third-year student, raised in Baton Rouge, Sims played 32 games, 10 of them from the start of last season, when he averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton approaches world title after team orders give victory over Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified ahead of Lewis Hamilton on Saturday that the Mercedes team orders came to play a major role in the race.
Bottas got a good start on the race, and let Hamilton take care of himself in defending his position the first two rounds and invited Vettel to attack the teammates.
Vettel was first in the depot and allowed Hamilton to enter the traffic backwards in the run, which should have been decisive.
The Mercedes drove into the depot a round later and came out behind Vettel, but Hamilton came out ahead after a bit of side-on-side action that made the Ferrari driver reluctant to let the interior be free of danger for not being able to defend himself at the third corner.
Max Verstappen started, on his 21st birthday, on the back row and was seventh at the end of the first round.
After that, he led large parts of the race as he went for a quick finish with the goal of passing Kimi Raikkonen who was fourth.
He entered the depot in the 44th round, but failed to increase speed in the last eight rounds while Raikkonen took fourth place.
It's a difficult day, because Valtteri did a fantastic job all weekend, and was a real gentleman who let me by.
The team has done an exceptional job, having both first and second chances", said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language.
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein at an election meeting on Saturday over her insistence that she did not read the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
During a speech at an election meeting in West Virginia, the president did not mention the testimony Ford had given to the Senate Commission directly, but commented that what was going on in the Senate showed that people were slemme and foul and spoke untruth.
"The only thing that can happen, and the most beautiful thing that's happened in the last few days in the Senate, is when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and uncomfortable and talking lies", he said.
When you look at publications and leaks and then say, "Oh, I didn't do it".
I didn't.
You know?
Dianne Feinstein, did you see that?
Can you imagine her answer -- did you open the document -- Whoa, eh, what?
Oh, no. I'm not going to.
I didn't laugh.
Wait a second.
"Let's... No, let's not", he added, imitating the senator.
Feinstein received the letter with details of the charges against Kavanaugh from Ford in July, and it was leaked earlier in September - but Feinstein denied that the leak came from her office.
"I didn't hide Dr. Ford's accusations, I didn't read her story", Feinstein told the committee, according to The Hill.
She asked me to keep it confidential, and I kept it confidential, which she asked.
But her denial didn't sit well with the president, who commented at Saturday's rally: "I'm telling you, it was really bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
While continuing to defend the Supreme Court nominee, who has been accused of sexual misconduct by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats use the charges for personal gain.
They are determined to take back power in any way they see fit.
You see the bad reputation, the bad reputation, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to drive over to get power and control.
Elite League: Dundee Stars - Belfast Giants (5-3)
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars compensated for their loss to Belfast Giants on Friday by winning the return match 5-3 on Saturday.
Giants were early to receive a two-point lead from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie equalized before Dwyer once again sent the Giants into the lead.
Francois Bouchard equalized for Dundee before two goals by Lukas Lundvald Nielsen secured the victory.
It was the third loss in the league this season for the boys of Adam Keefe, who beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday.
This was the fourth meeting between the teams this season, in which the Giants have won the last three games.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute after an assist from Kendall McFaull, and David Rutherford served an assist to Beauvillier who doubled the lead four minutes later.
In what was a busy opening period, Sullivan got the home team back in the game in the 14th minute, before Matt Marquardt provided the equaliser to Cownie in the 16th minute.
Dwyer secured the Giants' lead into the break when he scored his second goal of the evening on the first-half tampon.
The home team regrouped, and Bouchard again provided a striking goal for the game after 27 minutes.
Late in the second, Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen secure Dundee's lead for the first time in the match, and he, on his part, secured the victory with the team's fifth goal halfway through the final.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, face Milton Keynes at home in their next game, which is on Friday.
Pilots lose their lives to ensure that hundreds of planes escape earthquakes
An Indonesian airline pilot is hailed as a hero after losing his life in the attempt to ensure that a plane carrying hundreds of passengers safely got into the air.
More than 800 people have died and many are missing after a massive earthquake struck Sulawesi and triggered a tsunami on Friday.
Strong aftershocks continue to disturb the area, and many are trapped in the wreckage of the city of Palu.
But despite his colleagues fleeing for their lives, Anthonius Gunawan Agung (21) refused to leave his post in the control tower at Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport Palu, even though it swung wild.
He stayed to ensure that the aircraft on the runway, Batik Air Flight 6321, took off safely.
He then jumped off the control tower when he thought it was collapsing.
He later died in hospital.
Air Navigation Indonesia spokesman Yohannes Sirait said the decision may have saved hundreds of lives, ABC News Australia reported.
We sent a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to take him to a larger hospital in a larger city.
Unfortunately, he passed away this morning before the helicopter reached Palu.
"This is heartbreaking", he added.
Meanwhile, authorities fear the death toll could rise to thousands, while the country's crisis-control agency says access to the small towns of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
"The number of dead is increasing while we find bodies trapped under buildings, many of which we cannot reach", said agency official Sutopo Purwo Nugroho.
Waves of up to six metres have devastated Palu, which is to host a mass grave on Sunday.
Aid comes in military and commercial aircraft.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute there is an ambulance with bodies.
It is difficult to find clean water.
The shops have been robbed.
Jan Gelfand, the leader of the Indonesian Red Cross, told CNN, "The Indonesian Red Cross is struggling to help the survivors, but we don't know what they're going to find when they get there.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get a lot worse.
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia came to Palu on Sunday and told the country's military: "I urge you all to work around the clock to do everything you can to help with the evacuation.
Are you ready? CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by a major earthquake in Lombok, killing 550 people.
Air Niugini reports now man missing after laguneflystst
The airline that operated the plane that crashed into a lagoon in Micronesia in the Pacific reports that one man is missing, after having previously stated that all 47 of the passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the plane before it sank.
Air Niugini said that as of Saturday afternoon, it does not know where the male passenger is.
The airline said it is working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not provide further details about the passenger, and his age and nationality are unknown.
Local boat owners helped rescue other passengers and the crew after the plane hit the water while attempting to land at the airport on Chuuk Island.
Authorities said on Friday that seven people had been sent to hospital.
The airline said six passengers were still at the hospital on Saturday, and all were in stable condition.
It is still unknown what caused the crash and what actually happened.
Both the airline and the US Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon not far from the runway.
Some witnesses believed the plane flew past the runway.
The American passenger, Bill Jaynes, said the plane was very low.
"It was extremely good", Jaynes said.
Jaynes added that he and other passengers managed to swim through the water, which brought them to life, to the emergency exits of the plane before it sank.
He said the flight crew was in panic and screaming, and he suffered a head injury that was not serious.
The US Navy said that sailors in the vicinity, who were working on improving a quay, also rescued passengers with a rubber boat that they used to ferry passengers to land before the plane sank at about 30 metres.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network website show that 111 people have died in crashes of PNG-registered airlines' aircraft in the last 20 years, but none of them flew with Air Niugini.
Analysts create a timeline of the night a woman was burned alive
The prosecution presented all evidence on Saturday during the ongoing trial of a man accused of burning a Mississippi woman alive in 2014.
The U.S. Justice Department's analyst Paul Rowlett testified for several hours as an expert witness in intelligence analysis.
He presented to the jury how he had pulled together recordings from cell phones to find out what happened the night that Jessica Chambers (19) was killed by the accused, Quinton Tellis (29).
According to The Clarion Ledger, Rowlett said he used location data from several cell phones to show that Tellis was with Chambers the night she died, contrary to what Tellis had explained earlier.
When the location data showed that Tellis's cell phone was with Chambers's cell phone at the same time that he said he was with his friend Michael Sanford, the police pulled in to talk to Sanford.
Sanford testified on Saturday and said he was out of town that day.
So when the prosecutor asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's car that night, Sanford said he laughed because my car was in Nashville.
Another contradiction was that Tellis said he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
But their cell phone bills showed that they had only known each other for a week.
Rowlett said that some time after Chambers' death, Telli's messages, conversations and Chambers' contact information were traced from his cell phone.
"He's cut her out of his life", Hale said.
The defense will conclude the case on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the case to go to the jury later that day.
The High Descent What is conscious hip hop?
A hip hop trio will challenge the genre's negative reputation by filling their music with positive thoughts.
The High Breed of Bristol, England, says hip hop has moved away from the original political idea of tackling societal problems.
They want to go back to their hip hop roots and make the conscious version of the genre popular again.
The Fugees of Common have become more popular again in the UK through the artists Akala and Lowkey.
Another black person?!
New York childcare providers sue couple for firing after racism text message
A New York babysitter sues a couple for firing her on discrimination grounds after she received a mistaken text message from her mother complaining that she was "the only black person".
The couple has denied being racist, and compared the prosecution to utpressing.
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, was dissatisfied when she saw that the babysitter she had hired, Giselle Maurice, was black when she first arrived on the job in 2016.
"NEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEI, END A BLACK PERSON", Plasco-Flaxman wrote in a text message to her husband.
But instead of sending the message to her husband, she sent it to the babysitter Maurice, twice.
After admitting her mistake, the unsuccessful Plasco-Flaxman fired the former childcare provider Maurice, saying that the former childcare provider, who was afro-american, had done a bad job, so now she wanted someone from the Philippines, according to The New York Post.
Maurice was paid for one day's work before they sent her home in an Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for firing her, and she wants $350 a day for six months for the job she was supposed to have, even though it was without a contract, where she was to live with her family.
"I want to show them that it's not right to do this", she told The New York Post on Friday, adding, "I know it's discrimination".
The couple denied being racist, saying that giving Maurice the sack was the only thing they could do after insulting her, fearing she would retaliate.
My wife had sent her something she didn't mean to say.
She's not a racist.
We're not racists", said her husband Joel Plasco to The New York Post.
But would you let someone you've offended look after your children even though you didn't mean to offend them?
Your newborn baby?
Think about it.
Plasco compared the prosecution to "outpressing", saying that his wife was seven months pregnant and was in a "very difficult situation".
Would you really attack someone in a situation like this?
It's not a nice thing to do", said the investor Plasco.
While the case is ongoing, the public has been quick to condemn the couple on social media, criticizing them for their behavior and logic.
The publisher behind the Paddington books was afraid people wouldn't like a talking bear, reveals new letter
The daughter of author Michael Bond, who was born shortly after the first book was published, commented: "It's hard to imagine what it was like to read the book for the first time, before it was published.
It's really funny now to know how successful Paddington became.
Jankel said that her father, who worked as a cameraman for the BBC before he was inspired to write the children's book about the little teddy bear, would be optimistic even though the book had been rejected, adding that she had mixed feelings during the book's 60th anniversary, because her father died last year.
As for Paddington, whom she described as "a very important member of the family", she added that her father was proud of the success he had achieved.
"He was a very quiet man, and he never shouted", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having children who accomplished something: you're proud of them even though you're not actually behind it.
I think he saw Paddington's success that way.
Though it was his creation and imagination, he always gave all credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying and I had to say goodbye on the phone
When she landed, her daughter was rushed to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors worked in vain to save her life.
"Nad called regularly to say it was really bad, that they didn't think she was going to make it", said Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called to say that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye to her.
And I did.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, my dear".
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be there in a minute.
The medicines the doctors had given her to keep her heart pumping were slowly coming out of her system.
She was already dead and now her body was about to die.
I just sat there, knowing that this was happening.
I couldn't scream or scream, because I was in a room surrounded by family and people.
I really had to keep everything inside.
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, now mourning the loss of her daughter, had to board the plane with other passengers who had no idea what she had just gone through.
"No one knew anything", she said.
I sat with my head bowed while tears fell.
It's hard to explain, but it was on the plane that I felt how much sympathy I had for Nad.
That he needed my love and understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning women hanging leaves on bridges to prevent suicide
Two women who lost their loved ones to suicide try to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys have been featured on a bridge in Wales to inspire people who are contemplating suicide to call the numbers on the bill.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 years old when he began to struggle with depression and took his own life when he was 18.
I don't want any parents to feel the way I feel every day.
Davis, who is 45 years old and lives in Lydney, said her son was a talented cook with a contagious smile.
Everyone knew him by his smile.
They said his smile lit up all the rooms.
But before he died, he stopped working because he was in a really dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's 11-year-old brother was the first to find Tyler after he took his own life.
Davis said, "I'm still concerned that the younger brother may have been affected by Tyler's death".
Davis wrote the notes to let people know that there are other people out there who care and that they can talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't sit there alone  you need to talk to someone.
Humphreys, who had been Davis's friend for many years, lost her partner Mark after 15 years together and he had recently lost his mother.
"He never told me he was sad or depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed that he was behaving differently.
He was in the basement emotionally on Christmas Day, when the kids opened their presents, he didn't even look at them.
She told me that his death was very traumatic for the children, and they continued to work through the trauma: "There's a big void in our family now.
We're completely devastated.
But we all have to fight to survive.

Brett Kavanaugh's future hangs in the balance as the FBI begins its investigation
"I thought that if we actually got something like what he's asking for, a restricted investigation, then maybe we could get some solitude", Flake said on Saturday, adding that he's afraid the committee is "falling together" in the middle of a partisan backlash.
Why wouldn't Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate?
They're hesitating because of the timing.
The midterm elections in the United States are only five weeks away, on November 6, and if the Republicans don't do well, it will make it difficult for them to elect Kavanaugh to the US Supreme Court.
George W. Bush has called senators to get them to support Kavanaugh, who worked in the White House for Bush and was introduced to his wife Ashley in that way, then Bush's secretary.
What happens when the FBI presents their report?
They're going to vote in the Senate, where 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats sit.
It is still unclear whether Kavanaugh will be able to garner at least 50 votes in the Senate, with 50 votes to allow Vice President Mike Pence to give him the final vote and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
The number of defectors in North Korea is down under Kim
North Korean defectors to South Korea have been declining since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago, reports a South Korean lawmaker
Park Byeong-seug, referring to data from the South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said there were 1127 defectors last year compared with 2706 in 2011.
Park said that tighter borders between North Korea and China and higher smuggling charges are the main reasons for the decline.
Pyongyang has not made any public statements.
The vast majority of North Korean hoppers are granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul reports that more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most fled via China, which has the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected demilitarised zone (DMZ) between the two Korean countries.
China views drop-outs as illegal immigrants and not refugees, and often sends them back by force.
Relations between North and South Korea, which are technically still at war, have improved in recent months.
This month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang to negotiate the disarmament of the atomic weapons.
The talks come after the historic June meeting between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore, when they agreed to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula.
But on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the United States for not achieving anything since then.
"Without being able to trust the United States, we cannot trust that our country is safe, and in such a situation we cannot first disarm", Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical", and says he can't serve on the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh, who is nominated to the Supreme Court, "hysterical" and said he has too much temperament to serve in the U.S. Supreme Court.
Pelosi called Kavanaugh "hysterical" in an interview during the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas, on Saturday.
"I know if a woman had behaved like that, she would have been called 'hysterical,'" Pelosi said of Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate bench on Thursday.
Kavanaugh was emotional and denied all allegations that he sexually harassed Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were teenagers.
In Kavanaugh's opening speech, he was very emotional, and sometimes he would scream with a lump in his throat as he talked about his family and the years that followed.
He criticized the Democrats in the committee, calling the charges against him "grotesque" and a planned assassination of his reputation, organized by liberal politicians angry that Hillary Clinton did not win the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi added that she believes Kavanaugh's testimony proves that he can't serve on the Supreme Court, because it shows that he's prejudiced against Democrats.
"I think the way he behaved disqualifies him, and what he said about the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi raised an objection when asked if she would try to get Kavanaugh to resign if he was elected to the Supreme Court and if the Democrats won a majority in the House of Representatives.
"I can say this, if he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he can't serve on the Supreme Court, and he can't serve on the court he's serving on now", Pelosi added.
Kavanaugh is a judge on the federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.
Pelosi also said that as a Democrat she is concerned about potential Kavanaugh rulings against the Obamacare and Roe vs. Wade cases, because Kavanaugh is known to be a conservative judge.
In the confirmation hearings, Kavanaugh avoided answering questions about whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court.
"This is not the time for some hysterical, prejudiced person on the Supreme Court who expects us to say he's great", Pelosi said.
And women must wield the sword
It's a fair, bitter criticism, after months and years of rage, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we're angry", Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think it's unusual, you think?
She continued, "I got a lot of help from a woman in a high-level position in a company, who said she knew she was angry, but developed a technique where she said to the person who made her so angry that she knew, "You might think I'm sorry I cried.
I'm mad.
And then just keep going.
I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are a way of expressing your thoughts, but it's misunderstood.
In one of my strongest memories from a previous job, where most of my colleagues were men, I was in a situation where I felt angry, and a woman older than me grabbed me by the neck -- she was a cold leader that I had always been afraid of -- and pulled me out of the hallway.
"They never saw you cry", she told me.
She doesn't know you're angry.
They'll think you're sorry and that they won because they made you cry.
Patricia Schroeder, a congresswoman and Democrat from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart in his presidential campaigns.
In 1987, Hart was caught being untrustworthy on a boat called Monkey Business, and withdrew from the campaign. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, thought she could as well run for election as president herself.
"I hadn't really thought it through well enough", she told me laughing, 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates running for office, and the last thing they needed was one more candidate.
Some called the situation "Snorkit and the Seven Dwarfs".
Since the campaign had already been going on for a while, she hadn't raised enough money, so she promised that she would only stand if she could raise $2 million.
It was impossible.
She discovered that her support players who gave $1,000 to men only gave her $250.
"Do they think I'm getting a discount?" she asked.
When she declared that she would not run for office, she was so emotional and full of gratitude to those who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and targeted voters instead of delegates, and anger at gender discrimination, that she began to cry during the speech.
"You'd think I was having a nervous breakdown", Schroeder said about how the press reacted when she found out.
You should have thought Kleenex was my main sponsor.
I remember thinking, what are they going to write on my headstone?
What branch?
How the US-China trade war could be good for Beijing
The opening rounds of the trade war between the United States and China were deafening, and while the battle continued, a rift between the two countries could be an advantage for Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump has this year launched a crackdown on important Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminium.
The battle escalated this week, with tariffs on items worth over $200 billion, which in effect means that half of all goods from China to the United States are taxed.
Beijing has taken revenge and imposed tariffs of between five and 10 percent on US goods worth $60 billion.
China has promised to retaliate to the United States for every shot they fire, and the second largest economy in the world is most likely not going to collapse first.
To get Washington to quit, China has to comply with the US, but to bow to the US is too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the president of China.
Yet, experts say that if Beijing keeps its head down, the U.S. pressure could have a long-term positive effect on China's economy, by reducing the degree of dependency between the two economies.
"The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could cause both economies to collapse is more dangerous than people have dared to admit before", said Abigail Grace, an Asia researcher at the Center for American Security, a think tank.
Syria 'clear' for return of refugees, says foreign minister
Syria says it's ready to take back refugees who return voluntarily, and asks for help to rebuild the country that has been devastated after more than seven years of war.
Speaking at the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country's situation was improving.
"Today the situation on the ground is more stable and secure, thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism", he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas devastated by terrorists to restore normal areas.
All the necessary provisions are in place to allow refugees to return voluntarily to the country they were traveling to, from the grounds of terrorism and unilateral economic measures that went beyond the daily life and livelihood.
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would like to accept help to rebuild the devastated country.
But he stressed that they will not accept assistance or help on terms from countries that sponsor the uprising.
Europe secures victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating the American team with a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 in Le Golf National outside Paris, France.
The United States has now lost on European soil six times in a row, and they have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe took back the crown in the team of the Danish captain, Thomas Bjørn, who reached the 14.5 points they needed to beat the United States.
The American star Phil Mickelson, who had swept most of the tournament, hit the ball in the water from the tee-in at hole 16, par 3, and therefore gave the victory to Francesco Molinari.
The Italian golfer Molinari did well in all his rounds and became one of only four players to ever score 5-0-0 since the tournament started its current format in 1979.
The American Jordan Spieth was knocked out 5&4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Dane Thorbjørn Olesen.
Dustin Johnson, with the world's highest rank, was 2 and 1 behind Englishman Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish veteran Sergio Garcia, who has participated in eight Ryder Cups, became the most successful European with 25.5 career points.
Normally I don't cry, but today I can't help it.
It's been a tough year.
So grateful that Thomas chose me and believed in me.
I'm so, so happy to get my trophy back.
It's about the team, and I'm glad I could help", said an emotional Garcia after the European victory.
He passes the staff to fellow American John Ram, who beat the American golf legend Tiger Woods 2&1 in singles on Sunday.
"I feel an enormous pride in beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching him", said Rahm (23).
Woods lost all four of his matches in France, and now has a 13-21-3 Ryder Cup career record.
A strange statistic from one of the world's best players, who has won 14 major titles and is only beaten by Jack Nicklaus.
The American team struggled to find the fairway all weekend, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who impressed with high-level golf throughout the entire tournament.
Jim Furyk, the captain of the United States, said after a deceptive performance by his team, "I'm proud of these guys, they're fighting.
There were periods this morning when we made it hot for Europe.
We fought.
Hats off to Thomas.
He's an outstanding captain
All his 12 players played very well.
We're gonna regroup, I'm gonna work with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and get us moving.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
One must take off the hat.
We were left in the lurch.
Dinoflagellates: The concentration is reduced in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The latest report from Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission (FWC) shows a general reduction in the concentration of dinoflagellate in the area around Tampa Bay.
According to FWC, uneven conditions for growth are reported in the areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and counties around Collier - suggesting a reduction in concentration.
A growth of dinoflagellate extends about 200 km along the coastline from northern Pinellas to the southern counties of Lee.
Areas with dinoflagellate occur about 16 km off the coast of Hillsborough, but compared to the previous week there are fewer areas.
Dinoflagellate has been observed in Pasco.
There have been reports of medium concentration in Pinellas in the past week, low to high concentration along the coast in Hillsborough, low concentration in Manatee, high concentration along the coast in Sarasota, medium concentration in Charlotte, high concentration in Lee and low concentration in Collier.
Irritation of the airways is still reported in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier.
No airway irritation was reported in northwest Florida last week.
