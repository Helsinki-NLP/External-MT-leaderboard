A Republican Strategy to Oppose Obama ’ s Re-election
Republican leaders justify their policies with the need to fight electoral fraud.
But the Brennan Center believes the latter to be a myth, affirming that electoral fraud in the US is less common than the number of people killed by lightning.
In fact, Republican lawyers have recorded only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the United States in 10 years.
One thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the US democratic system.
Unlike Canada, the US states are responsible for the conduct of state elections.
In this sense, since 2009, the majority of US governments have passed new laws that make the registration or voting process more difficult.
This phenomenon gained in importance after the November 2010 elections, which saw 675 new Republican representatives in 26 states.
As a result, 180 bills were introduced in 2011 alone, limiting the exercise of the right to vote in 41 states.
The new election laws require voters to provide photo identification and proof of U.S. citizenship.
Furthermore, these laws also shorten the timescales for early voting, invalidate the right to register as a voter on election day and deny citizens the right to vote for which there is a judicial file.
Before the 2006 elections, no US state required voters to show photo identification.
Indiana was the first state to make such a demand.
The United States Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Indiana Act in 2008.
The Republican authorities hastened to extend this practice to other states.
Over the past two years, they have promoted bills in 34 states that force voters to show a photo ID.
It is important to note that unlike Quebec, US citizens do not have a universal health card.
Indeed, 11% of US citizens, i.e. 21 million voters, do not have a photo ID issued by a government agency in their country.
Moreover, five million new voters do not have such a badge in 2012.
However, often more than a hundred dollars have to be paid to obtain the required ID.
The new restrictions disproportionately affect young people, minorities and people on low incomes.
Indeed, 25% of African-Americans, 15% of people with an income of less than $35,000, 18% of citizens over the age of 65, and 20% of voters between the ages of 18 and 29 do not have the required photo identification.
This goes even further.
Students who are considered voters, who increasingly vote for democratic candidates, are not allowed to use their photo ID issued by their institution in several states.
On the other hand, the same States allow members of fishing or hunting associations who vote more strongly for the Republican side to use the cards issued by these associations for elections.
Before 2004, no federal state required proof of citizenship to vote.
Arizona was the first state to introduce such a requirement.
Since 2011, a dozen states have passed laws requiring voters to prove their U.S. citizenship.
These measures are clearly aimed at limiting Hispanic voices.
For it is obvious that two out of three Hispanic voters prefer the Democratic Party.
Moreover, in 2011, Republican lawmakers promoted laws in eight states that abolished voter registration on election day.
In addition, you have restricted the right of individuals and groups to assist those voters who wish to register.
These restrictions are not without consequences.
For example, the voter registration campaigns in the 2004 general elections helped to register around 10 million citizens.
The measures adopted since 2009 have reduced the number of new voters registering by 17% in 2010 compared to 2006.
Moreover, Republican legislators in five other states have enacted legislation aimed at shortening the period for early voting.
For example, in Florida ’ s 2008 general election, 33% of voters who voted in advance were Afro-Americans, though they make up only 13% of the state ’ s voters.
The same applies to the Hispanic population.
The latter accounted for only 11% of voters, but 24% of those who voted in advance.
By contrast, whites, who made up 76% of voters, made up only 46% of pre-voting voters.
Of course, democratic legislators and their supporters have vigorously opposed the adoption of laws that restrict voter registration.
Several bills were blocked by the veto of democratic governors.
The US Advocate General has intervened to suspend the most controversial laws.
They were able to partially limit the damage.
For example, only 16 of the 34 states have enacted laws requiring the presentation of a photo ID.
However, the new rules introduced in 2012 will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the right to vote.
Democratic critics denounce the party-political nature of the enacted laws and see them as a clear goal of influencing outcomes in the states that will decide in 2012.
A 2011 report by the Brennan Center shows that the states that passed these laws accounted for 171 of the 270 votes needed in the Electoral College to win the presidency.
It is too early to confirm with certainty that these legislative changes to the electoral system will have a significant impact on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections.
But one thing is certain: these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter turnout.
In this sense, these measures partially undermine the US democratic system.
Prostate cancer screening: should the test be done or not?
The PPE test does, in fact, sometimes show faulty results, with false negative or false positive results, leading to unnecessary medical intervention.
This leads to more hesitation on the part of men who are already undecided about carrying out screening tests.
Should the test be done or not?
We asked for the opinion of two specialists.
In the studies conducted in the United States, there were a number of interference factors between the control groups, making it difficult to interpret these data and make clear recommendations.
Another study, this time from Europe, concluded that there is a difference in the mortality of patients with and without early detection.
This study also showed that in follow-up after 12 years, the probability of metastasis formation is 30 to 40% higher if no early detection was performed.
Therefore, I recommend the test from the age of 50 or 40 if you have a direct relative who has already contracted prostate cancer.
There is also a higher risk for men of African American descent.
The most important thing is to make the right decision as soon as cancer is detected.
There are cancers that are aggressive and others that are indolent.
The patient really needs to be made aware of the extent to which his cancer is at risk, by identifying the possible options for prostate cancer to go untreated if it does not affect the quality of life in the long term, and opting in these cases for active monitoring of the disease.
Today, many men who have been diagnosed with cancer are not treated because their cancer is not aggressive and poses no threat to their lives.
They are offered active surveillance and treatment as the disease progresses.
The criteria for deciding who should and who should not be treated are determined with increasing precision.
That is why I still recommend that the test be carried out.
But the most important thing is to talk to your doctor to determine whether it should be done or not.
In cooperation with the International Society of Urology, Movember has developed an instrument that makes it possible to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of the PPE test.

Prevention of the disease
Unfortunately, there is no miracle cure for cancer prevention.
Despite advances in research, adopting a healthy lifestyle remains the best way to reduce the risk of contracting it.
It is estimated that 30% of cancers could be prevented if everyone ate well and exercised sufficiently.
“If there were no more smokers, this figure would rise to at least 50%, ” said André Beaulieu, spokesman for the Canadian Cancer Society.
However, it is estimated that about 10% of cancers are caused by heredity.
Several remain completely unexplained.
For the Canadian Cancer Society, the fight against tobacco addiction remains a priority, despite the decline in the number of smokers.
Smoking is responsible for 85% of lung cancer cases.
It is also a risk factor for several other cancers.
It seriously damages people's health.
"There are still 1.5 million smokers in Quebec today," announces spokesman André Beaulieu.
Encouraging data: 10 years after quitting the cigarette, the risk of dying from cancer is reduced by half.
The Weight
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, overweight and obesity also promote the outbreak of the disease.
They appear to increase the risk of breast, colon, rectum, oesophagus, pancreatic and uterine cancer.
"Research shows that regular physical activity protects against colon cancer throughout life," he adds.
The Nutrition
The organisation also recommends limiting the consumption of red meat.
Too large a quantity increases the risk of developing cancer of the colon or rectum.
Sausages should also be avoided.
The preservation of meat by smoking, drying or salting can lead to the formation of carcinogens.
"The latter can damage the cells of the body and lead to the development of cancer," he explains.
Vitamins
In recent years, several scientists have investigated the link between vitamin supplements and cancer.
However, their investigations are currently inconclusive.
According to the Canadian Cancer Society, the studies on vitamin E are contradictory.
While one study found a reduction in the risk of prostate cancer, another showed an increase.
The effect of vitamin D on cancer has also not yet been clearly demonstrated.
In addition, Mr Beaulieu stresses the importance of talking to his doctor about his concerns and family predisposition.
"Conducting an early detection test does not lead to cancer."
Analysis of the Higgs ’ Boson
The announcement last summer of the probable discovery of the Higgs, Boson, caused quite a stir, and for good reason.
In fact, this boson is believed to be involved in nothing less than the mechanism responsible for the mass of all objects in the universe.
And finally, it is the last particle whose existence has been predicted but not yet empirically observed by the Standard Model - our best or "least false" explanation of nature and the behavior of matter.
But for physicists, it is not yet completely certain that it is really the Higgs.
We know without a shadow of a doubt that we have a real new particle, and that it is very similar to the Higgs "boson" predicted by the Standard Model.
Furthermore, this seems to be confirmed by new data presented at a major physics congress in Kyoto this week, but data is still missing to be completely safe.
Nevertheless, let us assume that it is indeed the Higgs, because there seems to be little risk of deception, and let us look at what it is all about.
In this world, there is an inevitable law that causes two objects not to exist at the same place at the same time.
It is not possible to break this rule - and do not try too hard, as you will hurt yourself.
For even if particle physics is a really strange world, it turns out that such a law also applies to it: Pauli's exclusion principle, which says that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time, if they are in the same "quantum state", whereby this "state" by and large consists of some of their properties.
Based on this, the physicists divide the particles into two categories.
In a corner there are the good citizens, which are called Fermione and obey the Pauli principle.
And in the other move the bosons, an evil gang of anarchists to whom nothing is sacred - certainly not this principle, which means that they can in fact be in the same place at the same time.
According to the website The Particle Adventure of the Berkeley Laboratories (which is absolutely amazing, by the way), these bosons are divided into two groups: the mesons, which we are not going to cover here, and the "force particles", through which the great forces of nature are spreading and with which the Higgs "boson would be somehow related.
It must be emphasized here, however, that these bosons are not all as exotic creatures as one might think.
If you are able to read this chronicle, it is only thanks to a boson of extraordinary banality: the photon or the "particle of light", which is the "messenger" of the electromagnetic force.
In fact, when a particle with an electric charge accelerates or changes direction, the electromagnetic field is "disturbed" at this very place, like a pebble thrown into a pond.
This "disturbance" gives rise to an electromagnetic wave (light, infrared or ultraviolet radiation, etc.), and this wave is nothing more than a photon and thus one of the bosons "carriers of force".
Stable field
The same is true for the Higgs-boson, with the difference that another field, the Higgs-field, must be "disturbed" in order for this boson to show up.
However, the Higgs ’ field is much more stable than the electromagnetic field; the pathogen must reach very high energies, somewhat comparable to a frozen pond whose surface could only be furrowed by a very large rock.
Therefore, a giant particle accelerator like CERN - the Large Hadron Collider is a ring with a circumference of 27 km! - is required to reach such energies.
The analogy with the electromagnetic field is helpful again to explain the relationship between the Higgs and mass.
In fact, not all particles and not all materials interact with the electromagnetic field.
Some, like magnets, do this, but others don't - for example, a sheet of paper would never hold on to the refrigerator by itself.
Likewise, not all particles interact with the Higgs ’ field: those who do do do have mass, while the others (like the photon, by the way) have no mass.
What can all this research be 'good for', asks Mrs Plamondon?
For science, they serve to verify the Standard Model (SM), and they also allow physicists to accurately examine any discrepancies between the observations and the predictions of the SM.
By the way, there are many physicists, who hope that such deviations will be found, because the smallest difference could open a door to a "new physics" and plug some holes of the model.
It has to be said that the latter still has big deficiencies, as it offers no explanation for gravity (ups!) and dark matter, which makes up about 80% of the matter of the universe (again ups!).
However, such deviations have not yet been found at CERN.
Impact
The impact of this research on the general public is more difficult to predict, but it would be wrong to assume that there is none.
By the way: in the early sixties, the pioneers of lasers in Bell ’ s laboratories did not suspect that their work would trigger such a revolution.
They saw scientific applications, but nothing else.
In fact, the late physicist Willard Boyle - who worked at Bell Labs, where the laser was invented in the 1960s, and who himself developed the first continuous wave laser (the first were pulsed) in 1962 - has already told us that the laser was initially seen as more of a "laboratory toy".
Imagine...
Applications can also come from all the tools that surround research.
In 1969, for example, Willard Boyle developed a small light sensor during his work in optics.
Although it was not the original purpose, this sensor now serves as an "eye" for all digital cameras worldwide and won him the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009.
Of course, this does not mean that the activities of the LHC will inevitably change our lives, but it does mean that you really never know...
Palliative care - the best way to die... | Le Devoir
Quebec recently discussed the delicate issue of the end of life with its Committee on Dying with Dignity.
The debate must be resumed shortly, although a draft law is being prepared.
However, much remains to be done in this important area.
Le Devoir has tried to take a closer look at this.
A few weeks ago, Mr. L. was still living alone in his apartment in Montérégie.
The prostate cancer that consumed him had given him a period of two years.
"They gave me five years to live, I managed seven years," he said half-heartedly, lying in his bed in the palliative care home in Beloeil, where he had arrived the day before.
"But it's always a shock, you can't be prepared for it," he says.
The illness does its work: an immeasurable weakness prevents him from going to the toilet alone and even eating.
Sitting at the table before a tasty lunch, he resigned to let himself be helped with the meal.
He even courageously manages to smile and talk to the strangers who are busy around him, bring him his medicine, and offer him a bath.
The courage of ordinary death.
"My greatest wish is for my diarrhea to be cured, as this is humiliating," he says.
A few hours later, the team found a cure for this evil.
"In the course of our lives, we learn that a man is peeing while standing up," says Pierre Brodeur, psychologist in the home of Victor-Gadbois.
Returning to childhood is an unacceptable humiliation for some people.
"It depends on the person's ability," he says, "to take a step backwards."
According to several people working in palliative care, major events take place in the midst of these regressions.
The patients, who are admitted to the home for palliative care Victor, Gadbois, all suffer from cancer.
They have a maximum life expectancy of three months.
At this stage, the doctors and nurses who look after them no longer overwhelm them with so-called "healing" care.
For Mrs. A., 89 years old, the worst fear is to die "consciously and by suffocation".
But I really got to know my children through the illness.
"I have good children," she adds.
"I have no more wishes in life," she says before she accepts that a mask be put on to help her breathe.
She still expects a last visit of her son, who comes from Italy, in the next days.
In the home of Victor O. Gadbois, a group of volunteers offers personal hygiene and food intake assistance.
Palliative care is used when there are no other options.
To make dying more pleasant.
In Quebec, there is a bed for palliative care for 11,700 inhabitants.
That is very little, considering that one day we will all die.
This is where life continues under the best possible conditions, explains Dr. Christiane Martel, one of the home ’ s doctors.
Both at the level of physical, emotional or spiritual comfort.
The dying person is given an oral hygiene treatment with brandy or pepsi.
Diabetics no longer have to control their blood sugar levels.
And death is part of everyday life.
Yesterday evening we served Mr X a beer that died during the night.
This morning his son will drink the beer at the feet of the deceased.
"We help relatives and patients alike," says Nathalie Savard, Director of Care.
There is no day like the other in the home of Victor O. Gadbois.
Next to an old man of 93 who enjoys the last family reunion in the courtyard and is well supported by his pillows while being toasted to his honour, a young man of 36, surrounded by his parents, his wife and his two young children, dies tragically after trying everything to survive.
"For six months, three to five beds have always been occupied by cancer patients under the age of 45," says Dr. Christiane Martel, alarmed.
53% of the patients admitted to the Victor ’ Gadbois Home come from their homes, and 47% come from the hospital.
The problem of access to palliative care
It is said that 77% of Canadians do not have access to palliative care, that is, care designed to alleviate the suffering of patients when they reach the end of their lives, either at home, in hospital or in a nursing home.
And several organizations, such as the Victor ’ Gadbois Home and the Montreal Greater Palliative Care Society, are specializing more or less exclusively in the care of cancer patients.
It is precisely this major deficiency in Quebec health care that causes several palliative care specialists to be concerned about passing a law regulating euthanasia and assisted suicide.
Since the month of October, a manifesto has been circulating, signed by prominent personalities of palliative care, such as Dr. Balfour Mount and Dr. Bernard Lapointe, to express their opposition to such an initiative.
According to Dr. Christiane Martel, Quebec ’ s health care system is not powerful enough to ensure that everyone has the right to high-quality palliative care before accepting euthanasia.
Recently, she says, I saw a patient who was in great pain in the emergency room for 14 days without any measures being taken to relieve her.
I fear that the only reason patients want to die is because they do not receive adequate healthcare.
And at the same time, despite the worst forecasts, several oncologists doggedly treat their patients until the last day.
Hélène Richard ’ s chances of survival were already minimal when she discontinued arduous chemotherapy.
When I told my oncologist that I was going to stop the treatment, she told me that she regretted that I gave up the fight.
However, she had told me that I was at the end!
No omnipotent care
Dr. Martel believes that 90% of patients who have asked to die thank the nursing staff for not complying with this request after their pain was alleviated by a palliative care team.
It must be clearly stated, however, that palliative care is not omnipotent in pain treatment.
According to Elsie Monereau, head of palliative care at the Montreal Greater Montreal Domestic Palliative Care Society, 8% of patients do not respond to pain treatment.
At the very end of their lives, doctors often resort to terminal sedation, which amounts to putting the patient to sleep either sporadically or permanently until the time of his death.
We can no longer pretend not to perceive this side of suffering.
Patients without pain relief will increasingly have the opportunity to fall back on this terminal sedation.
Patients whose pains are not relieved all say the same sentence: "I want to die."
But this does not necessarily mean "I want you to put me to sleep", but "I want my pain to be relieved".
The realisation of this report was possible due to a journalism grant from Canadian health research institutes.
Real estate scandals on a large scale in Quebec
Every day, officials from the Department of Road Construction, major construction companies, fundraisers from political parties and specialists from the Italian Mafia tell us what they know about a great 'system' that involves the construction industry, civil servants, politicians, trade unionists and mafioso.
An 'industry' that was very expensive for Quebec taxpayers, especially in the 1990s and 2000s.
“It ’ s strange how the system has crumbled since drastic measures were taken, ” quips Jacques Duchesneau, a Quebec MP and former police chief.
The scandal was uncovered by him following a thorough investigation into the misappropriation of the treaties on road works in Quebec, to which the then Prime Minister reluctantly agreed.
The "Duchesneau" report established a direct link between industry, secret financing of parties and bribery of officials.
"Since the investigation began in 2010," he says, "the Department of Transportation alone has saved a billion dollars in contracts," because some have curbed their instincts to get their share!
Charbonneau ’ s Commission “has already brought down two mayors, ” he adds, in the hope that it will succeed in“ pointing out the tactics behind individuals. ”
A permanent anti-corruption unit launched in 2011
Created in 2011, the Permanent Anti-Corruption Unit is also working hard with its troops of government auditors, investigators, and analysts.
In addition, the police of the "Marteau" force, which since 2009 has meant that the "sewerage cartel" of Montreal is more restrained in the artificial inflating of the contracts...
In recent weeks, she has conducted a series of house searches and made accusations of fraud and corruption against local elected officials such as Frank Tampino and Richard Marcotte, who is mayor of a suburb.
The next on the list would be Gilles Vaillancourt, who has just resigned as mayor of Laval, Quebec ’ s third largest city.
He is suspected of repeatedly receiving bribes in exchange for public contracts.
Incidentally, engineers from the Montreal Road Construction Authority, as well as entrepreneurs of Italian origin, such as Tony Accurso and Lino Zambito, were expressly accused.
The latter has caused a stir by explaining to the Commission the functioning of the 'system' for obtaining public contracts.
For several years, he himself paid 3% of the value of the contracts obtained in Montreal to a mafia-related intermediary who transferred the money to the Union Montreal, the party of Mayor Gérald Tremblay.
Mr Zambito was involved everywhere in the 2000s, giving more than 88 000 Canadian dollars (about 68 000 euros) to provincial parties, especially the liberals who were then in power.
He also confessed to having organized an illegal fundraising for former liberal vice-president Nathalie Normandeau.
Sewerage contracts, the costs of which were artificially inflated by him
In Montreal, the "system" of corruption worked smoothly.
Former civil engineer Gilles Surprenant described this in detail before the commission: in ten years, he received gifts, invitations to travel, golf tournaments, restaurants, and ice hockey games from the construction company, as well as $736,000 in bribes in exchange for drainage contracts, the costs of which he artificially inflated.
Other officials at the Department of Road Construction have admitted that they have allowed themselves to be lubricated by artificially inflating invoices with false extra services by 30%.
In addition, an organiser of the Mayor's Party, Martin Dumont, has accused Mr Tremblay of deliberately overlooking a shadow budget that filled his coffers with black money.
As a result of these revelations, Mr Tremblay resigned at the beginning of November, which plunged Montreal into a serious crisis.
Chantal Rouleau was one of the first Montreal legislators to sound the alarm.
As mayor of the Rivière district of Prairies, in the east of the island, she opposed the sale of municipal land purchased for $5 million in 2010 and resold to developers in the booming real estate market for $1.6 million.
70% black money in the election campaigns
Of the investigation that will eventually be carried out, she says that she is "pulling a thread that will make it possible to understand the workings of the system infiltrated by ants in order to stop the evil and denounce the guilty."
She says that the procedure is "painful but positive".
We are in the process of cleaning up the wound, but we would need an investigative unit dedicated solely to Montreal, as well as supervision, in order to prevent a return to the questionable practices.
How to clean.
Regularly.
For his part, Jacques Duchesneau notes that 'officials have stolen several hundred million dollars', but above all he is concerned about the role of 'elected officials who know the tactics' when they were not involved in the fraud!
Starting with a 70% share of black money in funding Quebec ’ s election campaigns, he quips, “I ’ ve been told it ’ s a faint imitation of reality. ”
The Quebec government proposes to limit donations to political parties to 100 dollars, which, according to him, would not change the situation: "As long as campaign expenditure is not strictly limited, black money will circulate in politics."
He recommends a complete overhaul of the system for awarding public contracts and funding the parties: 'We cannot go deeper; by getting to the bottom of things with courage, we can rebuild the house on a more solid basis with more controls and laws.'
If this story damages the international reputation of Quebec and Montreal, Mr. Duchesneau invites those who laugh at it to take a look into their own backyard...
"PSG is not the FC Barcelona!"
This season you have taken on a new dimension with PSG.
How do you explain this progress?
One can explain it by a personal insight, but also by the new dimension of the PSG.
Great players have come.
Every day I make progress at their side.
The technical staff also gave me a lot.
These elements encourage me every day to improve my playing level.
And in a game this is even easier.
In football, everything happens very quickly.
But I don't break out in enthusiasm.
From my beginnings at the centre of INF Clairefontaine ’ s preparatory training to my playing time at Saint-Etienne, I have progressed step by step.
They are taking advantage of the competition introduced by Carlo Lewandowski...
The new additions of this summer are accustomed to carry out games very high levels.
They also know that every workout session is crucial.
As a result, a player like me must stand up and do his best.
Incidentally, Carlo Seehofer gives me a lot in terms of my playing position.
He is supported by co-trainers like Claude Makelele, who played in the same position as me.
Is Seehofer the right person for the job?
Of course.
umph inspires respect for all technicians.
There is currently no comparable person in Ligue 1, and he is one of the best coaches in Europe.
He can look back on a rich experience and has won many titles with prestigious clubs.
He had contact with big players.
I think he will win more titles in Paris.
I had an encouraging conversation with him in January.
At that time I had just recovered from a series of injuries.
The trust he has placed in me is also an explanation for my achievements.
What do you think about the first part of the PSG season?
In the Ligue 1 Lyon took the place of the leading rider.
But we are lurking in ambush.
One of our most important goals is the Champions League: we have qualified for the second round in this way.
What is the goal of the association in this competition?
We will try to get as far as possible.
From now on, anything is possible.
However, we will have our say against very good European teams.
First we want to be first of our group before Porto, so that we can play the return leg of the eighth finals as a home game.
Can the PSG become a large European club in the short term?
He already has the budget for this...
To become a great European club, Paris has to win titles and make a name for itself in the long run.
This is not the case today.
Financially, the PSG gives itself the means to make this project concrete.
Would it be a big failure not to win the title in Ligue 1, as it was last season?
Of course, that would be a great disappointment.
This year it is really important to us to imagine this title.
Last season we were close to it.
In May we were disappointed because we were strong enough to win.
We finished the season with a very strong performance.
We have finished with 79 points.
Normally you should be a master with 79 points...
But another team, that of Montpellier, scored an even better season.
I believe that this year is the right one.
Even if the big teams like Marseille, Lyon or Bordeaux fight for the title, I think we have what it takes to win it.
Do you think that the media expect too much from the PSG?
Given what has been invested and the players we have, it is normal that much is expected of us.
We fully accept that.
However, if we win at a home game against Troyes 4, and you still find something to blame us for, it is certainly a bit frustrating.
One wonders what more people expect.
We could never win every weekend with 4: 0.
We are not the FC Barcelona!
We try to create a game concept.
A team builds up over time.
In the Champions League we have shown strength.
Consider Manchester City, a club that has not been able to qualify for the quarterfinals for two seasons, and which has also made huge investments!
With regard to the invested sums, you were believed to be 15 points ahead during the break!
That would mean ignoring our opponents and the French championship.
Lyon and Marseille, who were not good last season, were "boosted" by this new PSG.
This shows that the Ligue 1 is exciting.
I hope that in the month of May we will be the smiling winner and that we will say to ourselves that, despite all the difficulties, we have finally won them.
The PSG seems to depend entirely on Zlatan Ibrahimovic ’ s performance.
It is all the better to speak of a 'Zlatan' dependency.
This means that Ibrahimovic is powerful and scores many goals.
That is why he came and he proves that he is the star of Ligue 1.
Wherever he has played, he has shown that he is a great player and a world star.
Within the team, we respect both the player and the person.
He also respects the people who surround him.
What he has achieved is truly extraordinary.
This encourages others to improve their playing levels.
Thiago Silva, who is one of the best defenders in the world, also allows everyone else to make progress.
How did you experience the Euro 2012 with the French national team?
Like a disappointment.
It was close to my heart to participate in this European Championship.
Unfortunately my injury prevented me from playing time.
I saw things there from which I emerged strengthened.
Today I manage to realize good games in the national team.
This was my hope since my baptism with the "Bleus".
We have learnt a lesson from what has happened in Ukraine, and today we must show exemplary behaviour.
What do you think about the first months of Didier Deschamps at the head of the "Bleus"?
He has achieved promising results.
We have a good position in the qualification group for the World Championship.
The coach is strict, close to the players and encourages them to win.
As was Laurent Blanc.
But I do not want to make a comparison.
Blanc had achieved his goal by qualifying us for the European Championship.
I hope that Didier Deschamps will take the "Bleus" to Brazil.
Is the draw forced on 16 October in Spain (1: 1) a kick-off game?
This game has given us confidence.
Everyone has stood up for everyone else.
Before this meeting in Spain, I have never seen a comparable game in my career.
With Bitcoin it is possible to pay and sell without a bank
The opposite of the current monetary exchange based on central banks, identified transactions and handling fees between the parties.
Moreover, as is so often the case with these technologies, a political vision is tangible: the belief that the current monetary system, shaped by bank monopolies, leads to financial crises.
In fact, the Bitcoin invented by Satoshi Nakamoto (a pseudonym) is both a virtual currency (but convertible into dollars, euros, etc.) and a secure exchange protocol such as BitTorrent, which enables the direct exchange of files.
With 15,000 computers in the network, around 200,000 transactions have already been recorded.
A few thousand websites accept Bitcoin as a donation or as a means of payment.
After peaking at $30 ($23) in June 2011, Bitcoin fell to $2 five months later, before recovering to about $10 today (listed on bitcoincharts.com).
Nothing particularly impressive compared to world trade in real currencies or financial products.
Nevertheless, the European Central Bank (ECB) has shown interest in this in a report on virtual currencies published in October.
She describes Bitcoin as "the most successful virtual currency", "competing with the dollar or euro" and "similar to conventional currencies".
Bitcoin is different from other types of virtual currencies, such as "credits", which are used to advance in a video game, which you can win or buy (and sometimes trade back) through games.
The social network Facebook has also developed such a system.
However, trade is controlled and processed by a central authority each time.
With Bitcoin, all network nodes are simultaneously depositories of the invoice book, auditors, monetary authorities, issuers, buyers and sellers.
How does this network work?
Every transaction between two users actually takes place between two e-mail addresses in the form of an e-mail.
With the difference that the user can choose a different address for each payment, which ensures anonymity.
A number of the data related to this transaction is electronically signed by a double encryption system.
In this way, the network can verify the authenticity of the transaction.
Using the contents of the file, it is also possible to ensure that the traded Bitcoin is present in the account book of public accounts that is distributed throughout the network.
The decisive step is to enter this new transaction in this book.
This is done through a mathematical task that is started on the computers, with the winner, who is a kind of temporary central banker, having the privilege of adding this additional line.
It is a fragmentation of the file, i.e. the conversion of a large file into a shorter and unique electronic fingerprint.
The computers "take" the new transaction and add a number to it before the whole thing is "hacked".
The goal is to find the number that gives a special fingerprint (many zeros at the beginning).
If this number is found, the other nodes can easily check if it is the right one.
The transaction is therefore permanently linked to the chain of all other transactions, and any modification would change the fingerprint.
If a user wants to pay two times very fast (less than 10 minutes) with the same money to cheat, only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network and the other would remain unlinked, since both have different fingerprints.
The computer that solved the problem receives 50 Bitcoins.
To prevent inflation, the reward is regularly halved, probably before the end of 2012.
The amount of Bitcoins in circulation is therefore limited to 21 million, but divisible to a hundred-millionth, which leaves some room for manoeuvre...
In addition, the difficulty of the task is increased with each improvement of computing power.
The life of the network has already had ups and downs.
The websites providing services for Bitcoin have been attacked and the Bitcoin inserts have been stolen.
"The vulnerability used does not affect the actual protocol", assures Pierre Noizat, who has just introduced Paymium, which is a real money payment company using the Bitcoin network.
The ECB also reports on the possibilities of money laundering using this anonymous service.
However, cash also has these shortcomings.
Major players such as Wikipedia refuse donations of this kind.
They are accepted by others such as the blog, platform WordPress.
Recently, Adi Shamir and Dorit Ron from the Weizmann institute in Israel analyzed the account book and showed that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are not in circulation.
In November, a "mega sales" was launched.
"Thirty thousand dollars were exchanged," says Jon Holmquist, who works for the Coinabul company, which converts Bitcoins into gold.
Pierre Noizat, who is also the author of a book on this currency, firmly believes in the potential of this technology as a transaction network.
His system Paytunia corresponds to a credit card (with real money) or a contactless payment with a mobile phone, but uses Bitcoin to validate the transactions, which are thus cheaper.
In addition, the holder maintains his identity and can therefore remain anonymous.
The system can be easily implemented at retailers and the latter do not need to install new terminals or computer programs.
You simply have to enter an address that can be "photographed and recognized" by a phone, says Pierre Noizat, who assures that he has thousands of users.
There is a general trend to rethink hierarchical systems in favour of more horizontal systems.
“It will take some time for Bitcoin to prevail, but 2013 could be a turning point, ” he predicts.
Moreover, in its report, the ECB envisages a reassessment of the various risks that it now considers to be high if this currency succeeds.
We have left Afghanistan.
And then?
French troops have left their responsibilities in Afghanistan (Kapisa and Surobi).
NATO and the US are expected to follow at the end of 2014.
It is time for the Afghan army to regain possession of its territory and for the Afghan people to decide their future without expecting anything from us.
We have punished Afghan farmers in particular by treating them as terrorists.
And ourselves with our 88 killed soldiers, as well as the injured and injured.
The Taliban consists of foreign extremists, former leaders who have fled to Pakistan, but often also farmers who refuse an armed foreign presence, as in the Soviet era.
They want to defend their centuries-old and archaic traditions, even if they are joined by jihadists, Pakistanis, Arabs, Uzbeks and Tajiks.
If tolerated, sometimes supported by the local insurgents, the latter will no longer be there when Western countries become more discreet.
The withdrawal of the French troops from the base in Nijrab, which I observed from a hill planted with almond trees and financed with French loans, was proper.
The convoys of trucks and tanks overflown by helicopters have reached Kabul without being attacked.
From the end of 2014, there will be no more Taliban influx into Kabul.
Conditions have changed since their irresistible advance from 1994 to 1996.
At that time Kabul was empty and the country was overrun by war due to the struggles of the various insurgent groups.
Their seizure of power was then seen as a kind of liberation and return to security.
Afghan women have paid the price for the obscurantism of farmers overwhelmed by Al Qaeda, but their situation has not improved to date.
Former Mujahedin, the Afghan government, and the current Taliban have a common desire to keep women in a subordinate position.
The main figures of the anti-Soviet war returned to power in 2001.
They have turned into profiteers by confiscating government land to sell as building land to refugees from Iran and Pakistan, taking advantage of America ’ s massive subcontracting.
They have brought themselves into disrepute, and most of them were not themselves involved in the fighting.
As I have heard in the campaigns, people want a government that is not made up of thieves.
Many young people want to leave the country, like those who have benefited from American grants: capital flight is considerable.
Young people are fed up with war and its ideologies.
During their exile in Iran or Pakistan, they had contact with the modern world and enjoyed its benefits.
Approximately 65% of the population is under 25 years of age; Kabul now has 5 million inhabitants, which is one fifth of the total population.
In the cities, state schools are full of girls and boys.
These young people, who do not want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or the corruption of certain leaders, will have to be given jobs.
Everyone, including the armed parties, is obsessed with mobile phones; television, with its Turkish series representing a modern world, is watched everywhere.
An army is now in place.
Are the authorities under whose authority it will be considered legitimate?
Former commanders of the anti-Soviet struggle are already trying to restore the militias in the province, which will escape the power of the central government.
Afghanistan, the country of mountains with strong local identities, should have benefited from a certain decentralization, on the example of the Western nations, but by abolishing the office of Prime Minister, which existed since the constitution of 1964, the USA wanted to make of it a centralized state with a strong presidential power.
President Karzai does not want any foreign controls, especially on the occasion of the elections scheduled for April 2014.
However, his country has been dependent on foreign aid since the 1950s and long before that.
Industries have not been rebuilt, functioning dams are not in place and important irrigation systems have not been repaired.
Everything is imported; nothing is produced apart from fruit and vegetables.
Priority will be given to private initiative.
In a country devastated by 30 years of war, state control of infrastructure would have been necessary.
The rumor was spread that Afghanistan possessed immense mineral resources.
This reinforces the impression that Western countries were only there to seize it.
Mining is not possible without energy to process the iron ore or copper ore locally, or without means of transport for export via the mountains.
The Chinese have almost left the copper mine of Mes Aynak, the international archaeologists (financed by the World Bank) have their excavations carried out on the huge Buddhist site and remain the most important employers of the province.
One day it will also be necessary to restore normal relations to Afghanistan and Pakistan, on which imports and exports are largely dependent.
The withdrawal of the French combat troops was completed on 20 November.
The new cooperation agreement provides for the continuation of traditional aid: high schools for girls and boys, French university institute, French Institute, military, legal, medical and agricultural cooperation, and support for the archaeological delegation.
Since 2009, a Civil Military Action Service of the Ministry of Defence (Cimic), which ceased in 2012, has carried out in dozens of mountain villages numerous community works and agricultural rehabilitation measures, and has had them carried out by a small French non-governmental organization to try to "win hearts and minds" and achieve the impossible task of compatibility of aid and offensive actions.
This work, which required a large number of local workers, has helped to suppress the uprising: irrigation, wells, drinking water, reforestation, fruit trees, soil protection and increased agricultural land.
Which souvenir will we leave behind after military expenditure of two billion euros?
A much more modest budget will help to improve local living conditions, which are very harsh in these valleys, often at altitudes of more than 2000 metres.
The Embassy has received dozens of written enquiries about small agricultural projects from municipalities in the province of Kapisa.
In order for farmers to free themselves from the uprising led by foreign groups, which is what they themselves say they want, it would be necessary for them to continue to receive small, well-controlled civilian aid that affects them directly.
A Constitution with a Crowbar in Egypt
This is a new poker game by President Mohamed Morsi.
While Egypt remains more divided than ever on the Constitutional Declaration, which temporarily grants it unlimited powers, it has decided to put all its eggs in one basket.
To the surprise of everyone, he announced on Wednesday that the Constituent Assembly would adopt its final version the next day.
Just a week ago, the Head of State granted this plenary two extra months to complete its work.
Egypt has now been relying for almost two years on a provisional text, amended several times, which weakens institutional stability and leads to legal confusion.
This new initiative has only led to an even greater division of the country.
For his opponents, the president remains in his "autocratic delirium" by continuing to "break his word" and "trample the law."
Its advocates assure us that one way is to end the institutional and political crisis as quickly as possible and accelerate the transition process.
A referendum should be held within 14 days.
A very short period of time that compels the Brothers to renounce their plan to explain the text to the Egyptians, section by section.
It is also a way for the president to regain his public and democratic legitimacy as the protest rages across the country.
According to an interview with the American newsreel Time, Mohamed Morsi seems convinced that the Egyptians will vote favorably.
Especially since the Egyptian people are given an ultimatum by resorting to a hasty vote: 'Either you vote in favour of my draft or I keep the unlimited power', the latter supposedly having come to an end after the adoption of the Constitution.
85 mostly Islamist members of this Constituent Assembly adopted the text yesterday in a strange atmosphere.
The majority of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe has not complied with this request.
Shortly before the Constitutional Declaration in mid-November, they turned their backs, believing that they were unable to assert their views.
Representatives of human rights organisations, religious minorities or civil society have acted in the same way.
In order to reach the quorum, 11 persons, alternate members, were added yesterday morning in a hurry.
Some are very close to the Muslim Brotherhood.
It is not surprising that most of the articles were adopted unanimously.
By the way, the commentators found it entertaining that the only difference of opinion of the day... was expressed at the time of the prayer, since some members of the board were of the opinion that the pendulum clock of the constituent assembly did not go exactly.
The text, which was adopted last night, consists of 234 articles.
Finally, Article 2, which attracted all the attention, remains identical to that of the 1971 Constitution and states that "the principles of Sharia are the main source of justice".
The Salafist parties, for whom the establishment of Islamic law is an important demand, had hoped to replace "the principles" with "the rules", which would have made a stricter application possible.
For the Islamists, the fact that this article has not been changed is proof of their good will and respect for other members of Egyptian society.
'Hypocrisy 'replies the liberals, who see this only as a propaganda strike.
According to them, the Islamization of the constitution takes place through other articles.
In particular, they have Article 220 in mind, which confers an advisory role on the University, particularly with regard to the verification of conformity with Sharia law.
According to Egyptian specialist Sophie Pommier, this is worrying because "the people invited to comment have not been elected and have no democratic legitimacy.
In this one can see the first signs of a theocracy. "
Liberals ’ fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of this university will be far less moderate than the current one.
"At present no concrete religious commitment is to be recognized.
With this Constitution we remain within the framework of the bourgeois state.
Most of the lawyers who have worked on this text are not Ulema, but academics, some of whom have been trained in the French system, "soothes Alexis Blouet, who is writing a doctoral thesis on the Egyptian constitutional transition.
He admits, however, "that there may be ambiguity with respect to Article 220, since the terms used are borrowed from the religious vocabulary.
One refers here in particular to the "Fiqh" [Islamic jurisprudence, editor's note].
And in the future the question could be raised to what extent civil judges are competent to decide on this. "
In addition to its religious aspect, the text adopted yesterday is heavily criticised for the wide-ranging powers it grants to the President of the Republic.
The Muslim Brotherhood argues that they are markedly reduced compared to the former regime.
Another point of contention: the powers of the army.
In accordance with the wishes of the military, the examination of the defence budget is not submitted to Parliament, but to a national defence council.
Similarly, there will be no ban on civil proceedings in military courts, as the associations for the defence of human rights have demanded.
The latter also share their concerns about the text, which they regard as threatening freedom.
Blasphemy is maintained and insults are now banned, which could have serious consequences for freedom of expression, particularly for the press.
Moreover, no article refers to the protection of women, underlines Heba Morayef of Human Rights Watch.
In their opinion, the only positive point is the prohibition of torture by Article 36.
That word was not included in the previous Constitution.
While the Egyptian president had to speak on television last night, demonstrations are planned for this afternoon.
The proponents of the head of state will march on Saturday.
In Israel, Ukrainian tourists await sacred sites, the navel of the world and a sea of brine
The Promised Land combines the glory of biblical truths, modern comforts and unspoilt nature.
AIF gives you the five most important reasons to visit Israel.
Bowing to the Holy Places
Visit the Jordan River where Jesus was baptized.
It is said that all who bathe in this river receive God ’ s blessing.
Galilee is the place where Jesus performed his miracles: turning water into wine at a wedding feast, walking on water, calming the storm and fishing.
It was here that Jesus appeared to his disciples after the Resurrection.
Most of the sanctuaries, however, are in Jerusalem.
Faithful walk here the Way of the Cross of Jesus Christ (in Latin: Via Dolorosa).
The trail starts at the Roman fortress of Antonia, Pretorium, where the court was, and leads through the streets of the old town to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Mount Golgotha, where the crucifixion site, the anointing stone and the tomb of Jesus are located.
Here, according to the Christian view, is the navel of the world, which symbolizes the salvation of mankind.
The monastery of the Holy Cross in Jerusalem stands in the place where, according to Christian legend, the tree from which the cross was made for the crucifixion of Jesus grew.
Jerusalem is also the most sacred place of the Jews - the Wailing Wall, the remains of a temple destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD.
Traditionally, people of different faiths leave notes with wishes, which are then fulfilled.
Take a trip to the heights
The ruins of the fortress of Massada are the remains of the secret hiding place that Herod the Great had built for his family in 25 AD.
They are located on a rock face in the mountains at 450 meters above sea level.
Only climbers can reach the ruins by themselves.
All others take a cable car to this historic summit.
In the north of the country at an altitude of 1600 to 2040 meters is the famous ski resort Hermon, which attracts countless tourists in the winter months.
There is a shuttle bus from the foot of the mountain.
The ski slopes have a total length of 45 kilometers.
According to an old legend, pagan gods lived on the mountain top.
Visit unique museums
In this country there are almost 300 museums.
Not all of them can be visited with just one trip.
But at least the five most interesting of them should be visited.
Among them is the Israel ’ s Museum not far from the Knesset (Parliament).
It contains ancient Qumran manuscripts or Dead Sea scrolls found in caves in the Judean desert, as well as approximately 500,000 archaeological and anthropological exhibits.
The Museum of Art in Tel Aviv is also worth a visit.
The collection includes works by the Impressionists and Expressionists Monet, Pissaro, Renoir, Cézanne, Sisley, Matisse, Modigliani, Chagall and Picasso.
In Akko you can visit the museum in the Al Basha spa, which houses several halls of old Turkish baths with sculptures of former visitors and bathing attendants.
In Caesarea you should visit the unique private Ralli Museum, where you can admire sculptures by Dali and Rodin.
There are no museum guides or souvenir shops.
Admission is free, and donations are generally rejected.
The fifth museum, the Holocaust Museum or Yad Vashem in Tel Aviv, tells the story of one of the most harrowing chapters in history.
The most moving section is the Monument to the Children, built to commemorate the 1.5 million children exterminated in the concentration camps and gas chambers.
On entering the room there is complete darkness.
Stars sparkle.
And the names of the Jewish children and the countries in which they died resound.
Ukraine is also mentioned there.
Doing something for your health
Israel's three main recreational areas are on the shores of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and the Dead Sea.
At each of the three locations there are swimming pools, water parks, dolphinariums and oceanariums.
Surprisingly, bathers also swim in the Red Sea in the winter months, as the water temperature there does not fall below 21 ° C and the air warms up to 23 ° C.
The Dead Sea is even warmer and bathed there all year round.
This unusual sea, 417 metres below sea level, is the deepest in the world.
Its turquoise-blue water has a high salinity and therefore carries even non-swimmers easily on the surface.
The surrounding landscape is indescribably beautiful.
Visitors come here for treatments using salt water (natural brine) and medicinal mud, as well as for the treatment of skin inflammation, allergies, asthma, eczema, arthritis, bronchitis, diabetes and calming of strained nerves.
Touching the secrets of antiquity
These secrets are hidden in the old town of Tel Aviv, the city of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast.
The famous sea route that connected Egypt, Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia passed through this city.
The city is mentioned in ancient Greek and Egyptian legends.
According to tradition, Noah built his ark right here, and Perseus saved the beautiful Andromeda with whom he lived a long and happy life in this place.
Tourists like to stroll through the narrow streets, which are named after zodiac signs.
According to legend, Fortuna is said to hold all those who touch the walls in the alley with their zodiac sign.
In Jaffa you can meet newlyweds from all over Israel and even other countries at photo opportunities.
In Caesarea, the city of King Herod, you can wander through the Roman theatre and conquer the Crusader fortress.
In Roman times Caesarea was the most important city in Judea and the residence of the Roman governors, including Pontius Pilate.
Nowadays, evening concerts and operas are performed in the carefully restored theatre.
Tourist list
If you go to Israel, don ’ t worry about your poor English skills: about 30% of Israelis speak Russian.
The money in the trip is better not in euros, but in dollars, which can be easily changed into shekels (current exchange rate: 1 dollar to 3.8 shekels).
In the city you can usually get by bus, but in Jerusalem there is also a fast tram and in Haifa the only metro line in the country with six stations that connects the lower city with the upper city.
Strictly speaking, it is an underground funicular railway.
A journey within the city costs 6 shekels, regardless of the means of transport, which is enough for a journey of up to 1.5 hours, including a transfer.
According to Jewish tradition, the Sabbath is celebrated in Israel on Saturdays.
Markets and shops are closed from Friday evening until sunset on Saturday, and public transport is at a standstill.
And on Sunday morning the working week begins.
In many cafés, restaurants and pubs, only kosher food is served, which excludes pork, seafood, fish without scales and food containing both dairy and meat products.
Instead, you can choose from a variety of mutton and beef dishes, soups and desserts (prepared with coconut milk), traditional Jewish humus, paste, various sauces, fried balls of pureed beans and peas (falafel), and fruits and vegetables.
There are no stray dogs in the streets of Israeli cities.
But there are many well-nourished cats, who roam comfortably and undisturbed through the streets.
In the evening you can even see them sleeping on the roofs of parked cars.
The cats like animated places and don't say no to treats.
Depending on the brand, a rental car costs between 37 dollars per day (Hyundai Getz) and 188 dollars (Audi A6, Volvo S80).
The insurance costs an additional $15 per day.
And bike rental costs 15 shekels per day.
Tickets to museums cost an average of 30 shekels.
Key figures
In 2012, more than three million tourists from all over the world visited Israel.
Most of the adventurers and recreation seekers came from Russia, France, Germany, Italy, England, the USA and the Ukraine.
From January to October 2012, 118.8 thousand Ukrainian tourists came to the Promised Country, an increase of 51% compared to the same period in 2010, before the lifting of the visa requirement on 9 February 2011.
"The big and powerful" leads to Moscow: migrants save money for language
While members of parliament and civil rights activists discuss the benefits of the law on mandatory language tests for migrants, criminals are already dealing with fake certificates
Every year 13 million foreign workers come to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other cities in Russia.
Most of them are citizens of Central Asia: Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.
Their only goal is to earn money for the maintenance of the families remaining in the homeland.
On 1 December, a law came into force requiring every migrant worker to take a test certifying knowledge of the Russian language.
So far, this regulation only applies to migrants who want to work in the service sector, in the municipal housing industry and in the retail trade.
However, according to the Federal Migration Service, the tests are to become mandatory for all guest workers in the future.
It is necessary to pass not only language tests, but also tests into Russian history and the foundations of legislation.
Language skills must be proven for obtaining and renewing the work permit.
Exceptions apply only to citizens of countries where Russian is an official language.
Also excluded from this law are persons who received their training certificates and diplomas before the disintegration of the USSR in 1991.
Sense, problems and protection of rights
All examination centres will be under the auspices of the Pushkin Institute for the Russian Language, the Russian Peoples' Friendship University, the Moscow State University, the St. Petersburg State University and other Russian universities.
Migrants can take the tests in any city; more than 160 such centres have already been opened in Russia.
The initiative to introduce the tests was supported by the deputies of the State Duma and the Federal Migration Board.
Before the law came into force, however, civil rights activists asked the following question several times in the press: What is the point?
What are the changes brought about by the requirement to demonstrate language skills, both for Russians and for migrant workers?
Above all, according to spokesmen for the migration authority, the aim is to reduce the number of forced laborers.
"Many are now talking about protecting the rights of migrant workers," says the head of the Representation of the Federal Migration Service in Tajikistan, Viktor Zebelev.
However, their rights must be protected before they leave.
Only organized recruitment will solve 90% of the problems of foreign workers.
Problems are encountered by migrants without a job, education, language skills and medical expertise.
Zebelev is convinced that a future migrant without language skills will inevitably encounter people with evil intentions, who, under the pretext of help, will put him in a dark, narrow barrack, where he will remain with dozens of his peers for months without food or documents and toil 12 to 14 hours a day.
We receive many complaints from our migrants.
"In the homeland you are promised the one thing, and on arrival you will be cheated, your passports will be confiscated and you will not receive the promised salary," confirms the head of the Central Office for Labour Migration of the Tajik Migration Board, Tolib Schwaripov.
Don't scold, boss!
Nevertheless, many citizens of the Central Asian republics who want to earn their living in Russia admit that they not only do not know the language of the target country, but can hardly express themselves in writing in their own language.
Of course, this is not so much their fault as the evil: only a few Turkmens, Uzbeks, and Tajiks can afford a decent primary education.
Because in their families there is not even money to feed the children, let alone to buy them decent clothes, shoes and school things.
As teenagers, these children immediately seize the first opportunity to earn money.
"It's difficult without language skills", they admit.
"You feel humiliated and inferior."
Civil rights activists emphasise the following important aspect of the law.
Only migrants with legal status have to pass the test.
If you do not have this status, there is no examination and therefore no official work.
Meanwhile, the majority of migrant workers remain illegally in Russia.
"Welcome" or "No Access for Unauthorized Persons"
Many migrants confirm that it is not easy to obtain official status in Russia.
This is due to bureaucratic hurdles and, of course, linguistic difficulties.
In addition, legalization costs money: 12 to 16 thousand rubles.
A fake registration can be done quickly and only for one and a half thousand.
The staff of the Russian police know that our documents are largely forged and we are not registered, and this leads to cases of extortion.
"They want one or two hundred rubles for cigarettes and tea," the Tajik Umed Huschkadamow told journalists.
"Don't shy away from any costs for false papers"
Already on the day the law came into force, it became apparent that not only the registration documents of migrants can be falsified.
Some of the fake certificates that certify the language assessment have already been confiscated by staff of the Federal Migration Service.
The counterfeit papers were printed with an ordinary colour printer.
Of course, the new owners did not get it for nothing: every migrant who hoped to save himself the tests in this way paid seven thousand rubles for the document.
That is more than twice the cost of the official test: it costs a migrant worker three thousand rubles.
Both officials and civil rights activists agree that the most important immediate task is to protect the system from corruption, so that certificates cannot simply be bought.
For the moment, the authorities can only promise foreign workers who fall through the test for the first time that they will get time for a basic language course.
In addition, new arrivals without language skills are offered jobs in areas where no active communication with people is necessary.
Interior Ministry ignores illegal weapons market
Percentage of legal weapons in criminal offences extremely low
The Russian Ministry of the Interior is planning to tighten up the arms law for private gun owners.
In doing so, the authorities are reacting to recent events: injured in shootings at weddings and seven dead in the shooting of the Moscow lawyer Dmitry Vinogradov.
The police want to ban the wearing of non-lethal weapons in public and raise the age for possession of firearms from 18 to 21 years.
The proposal was supported by the Chairman of the Duma ’ s Committee on Security and Anti-Corruption, Irina Yarovaya, who promised that the amendments to the Law on Weapons would be submitted to the Duma shortly.
Not everyone is satisfied that the Russian authorities want to combat the problems by 'tightening the screws'.
An open letter has been published on the Internet, the authors of which - representatives of various arms associations - demand that the authorities refrain from "pointless tightening".
The percentage of crimes with registered weapons is very low, said the criminal lawyer, Vasily Lesnikov, the Russian service of the BBC.
According to the statistics of the Ministry of Interior, 142 crimes involving the use of registered weapons were committed in the course of six months in 2012, while for the same period a total of 1,168 thousand crimes were recorded.
The authors of the open letter are convinced that tightening the law for private gun owners will not prevent criminals from using the black market.
At present, according to the authors, every possible weapon can be found in Moscow for little money.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of the Interior stresses that the spread of illegal weapons is under control.
Suppliers: from factories to officers
The weapons enter the black market through several channels.
There are five such main channels, says a former colonel Viktor Baranez, who worked for ten years in the Ministry of Education and the General Staff.
Screenshot of a website that accepts gun orders
The first channel is the army or the military, i.e. weapons stolen during the fighting in the Caucasus.
“The weapons were stolen by both the Russian officers and the Caucasians themselves, ” says Baranez.
On the second channel come illegal weapons, the law enforcement officers are stolen by criminals.
Baranez explains that these include weapons stolen both from police armoury and directly from law enforcement personnel.
Other weapons sold illegally come from military stockpiles.
In many military camps there were frequent explosions.
“There is evidence that some cases were arson to cover up the lack of weapons, ” says the former military official.
According to Baranez, arms manufacturers also contribute to the black market.
"Nowadays there are countless private armament factories that cannot withstand international competition and therefore dump their weapons on the black market, for example in Moscow," reports the expert.
Another channel of the black market is smuggling.
Particularly many pistols and rifles come from poor countries such as Kyrgyzstan.
“There is an own, sometimes artisanal production as well as a Mafia, which organizes the smuggling ”, explains the former military member.
Where do the weapons come from?
Experts calculated the approximate share of each of the five channels in supplying the black market with illegal weapons.
In 2011, a report was prepared by the Centre for Analysis of Problems and State Administration.
The experts analysed reports from the Ministry of the Interior and the Federal Service for State Statistics, criminological literature and publicly accessible data on portals on the subject of weapons.
According to the investigators, most of the illegal weapons come from the army and the legal protection authorities.
Half of all weapons on the black market have arrived there through the "fault of those responsible for dealing with weapons in their work", the report says.
According to researchers, 17% of weapons come from conflict zones, 14% from thefts in the production of weapons and 5% from illegal excavations.
A sales advisor from an arms shop, who does not want to be named, assures us that weapons found during illegal excavations have not been bought for a long time because they are outdated.
According to him, it is more common for traders to obtain supplies in an arms depot.
A weapon, such as a TT pistol, is purchased through an ensign.
The weapon is issued and handed over through the fence.
"The dealer brings the weapon to the city and sells it there for 900 euros apiece with two magazines," he says.
“The police know everything, of course, and therefore, if they cannot comply with the crime detection plan, they periodically buy checks from traders selling illegal weapons, ” the sales consultant adds.
"Like in a luxury shop"
Buyers and sellers often find each other through acquaintances.
I had looked at websites and blogs, when someone noticed me and suggested to me to come to the station "Begovaya", where a person would wait for me, who would bring me to a certain place, where we could then negotiate the price.
The price for the weapon I learned only there
Military commentator Viktor Baranez
"To get a gun, I need an acquaintance who has contacts," says the sales consultant. "I have such an acquaintance, but I don't trust him."
There are traders in the markets, but you have to go there and make an appointment with a code like "by Ivan Ivanovich, who lets it be known that the daughter has lost a tooth".
I currently even get some knuckles about an acquaintance I trust.
He also gives me the knuckles only because he knows that I don't whistle him.
Newcomers look for weapons in different ways.
Former military official Viktor Baranez tried to buy illegal weapons in the mid-1990s when he wrote an article on the subject.
According to him, the schemas have not changed.
He got a photo album with "all sorts of things".
"I felt like I was in a luxury shop," recalls the military officer.
According to Baranez, the buyer does not get the cat in the bag, but can try everything.
As a potential customer, I do not just buy, I drive with the seller into the forest and there we set up a target.
"I can then shoot there, and if I am convinced that the weapon has a good shot, we negotiate with each other," the expert describes the procedure.
Shopping from the sofa
Internet search engines show search results to websites and groups in "Vkontakte", where weapons are offered "for different purposes".
There is no need for any paperwork, nor are there face-to-face meetings.
"You only need the right amount of money," says the advertisement on the website "buy a gun or rifle".
There users place their orders and make inquiries.
Will it also be sold to minors?
"Of course without a license," asks user "Ivan" (literal quote).
"Buy a TT. Moscow" is the laconic request of "Fedorenkov".
The Federal Security Service recently shut down countless bogus websites, and buyers wanting to buy weapons are joining the service in droves.
People come to feed like hungry fish and then land in Siberia and are allowed to shovel coal
Military commentator and former military member Viktor Baranez
I have heard of the following scheme: The website is usually registered abroad, and Russian laws do not apply.
Those responsible accept the orders.
The buyer transfers the money via an ATM.
"In response, he receives a photo and a description of the hiding place of the weapon," reports the press spokesman of the non-profit organization "Pravo na oryzhie" Dmitry Kislov.
Viktor Baranez emphasizes that in the end you can go out empty and get behind bars if you place a request on a website.
The Federal Security Service recently shut down countless bogus websites, and buyers wanting to buy weapons are joining the service in droves.
“People come to feed like hungry fish and then land in the Siberian labour camp and are allowed to shovel coal, ” he says.
A Makarov for 100 US Dollars
According to experts, the purchase of illegal firearms is likely to cost between USD 100 and USD 900.
According to Dmitry Kislov from the "Pravo na oryzhie" organization, a Makarov-type pistol can be bought for 100 to 300 dollars.
You have to wait up to one and a half months.
The weapon is distributed in military warehouses by middle-ranking supervisors.
According to the official statistics of the Ministry of Interior, the number of illegal weapons offences throughout Russia decreased by 7% to 22.9 thousand in the period from January to October 2011, while the number of detected cases of theft and extortion involving weapons, ammunition, explosives and explosive devices decreased by 7.8%.
Almost Food- and Supermarket Workers Strike in the United States
Every fourth U.S. American teenager sits at some point behind the box office of Mc Donald's
In recent days, there have been massive protests across the US against low wages in Walmart stores and restaurants of popular fast-food chains such as Mc Donald's, Burger King, Taco Bell, Wendy's and Kentucky Fried Chicken.
No one can yet predict whether the protests will swell further, or whether they will soon run out of steam.
The protests are supported by trade unions and several left-wing non-profit organisations.
In addition to raising the modest wages of ordinary Walmart and Nearly Food-related workers, the organizers of the protests are pursuing the goal of establishing trade unions.
So far, this sector of the economy is hardly unionized.
46 cents a year?
The protests began last week after Thanksgiving, the so-called Black Friday, which saw sales in the US that attracted millions of customers, sometimes leading to scuffles.
On that day, some Walmart employees, of whom there are 2.2 million worldwide, laid down their jobs and, together with trade unions and left-wing activists, attacked chain branches targeting low- and middle-income people.
Walmart sells everything from diapers, hunting guns and car batteries to vacuum cleaners, eggs and milk.
Products in Walmart ’ s stores are on average between 8 and 27% cheaper than in large supermarkets.
As a result, many of Walmart ’ s low-paid workers buy only in their own jobs.
The prices and product range made Walmart one of the largest companies in the USA.
According to critics, Walmart can often sell goods so cheaply only because its employees are poorly paid.
The latter also complain about heavy working conditions, such as the lack of forklifts or hand-held scanners.
Participants in the Black Friday protests called for wage increases and expressed anger that the contribution to company-owned health insurance had risen from $30 to $100 per month.
A typical Walmart employee who earns $9.5 per hour cannot afford this increase, they said.
Researchers at California University in Berkeley have shown that if the company increased the average wage to $12 per hour, it would cost Walmart $3.2 billion.
That is about 1.1% more than you now donate for wages.
If Walmart applied the wage increases entirely to customers, each purchase would cost them just 46 cents more.
They would spend just $12.39 a year more than they do today.
Advocates of Walmart are pleased to note that there have been protests in only nine states, which have not caused the company any losses.
Black Friday lasted into its store from 8 p.m. on Thursday night to midnight the next day, and during that period Walmart sold about 5,000 items per second.
In total, Walmart carried out nearly 100 million transactions on Black Friday.
The company ’ s spokesman, Dan Fogelman, claimed in an interview on the website of the left-wing Huffington Post that a total of “less than five ” Walmart employees were laying off work and that the protest action was merely“ another PR trick ” by the union that organized the protests.
"Free cash!"
The protests continued this week in New York, where they targeted McDonald's and other low-priced restaurants, not Walmart branches (which are unwanted in this advanced city and therefore non-existent).
McDonald's says the company sells billions of portions and yet you are not given sick days and you are not paid for your honest work!
Jumaane Williams, Member of New York City Council
Currently, the minimum wage under federal and New York legislation is $7.25 per hour.
In fast foodstuffs restaurants, the minimum wage is gradually being raised, but not too much, and on average, their employees in New York get $8.90 per hour.
No one in this expensive city earns less than this.
How it is possible to get by in New York with so little money is beyond me.
There used to be a time when almost a quarter of all American youths lived behind the counter at McDonald's after school, but the youths still lived with their parents.
Hardly anyone saw it as the main source of income or planned to stay longer.
Now, in interviews with McDonald's employees, I constantly meet people who complain that they have to make do with this salary and sometimes even feed their children.
On the other hand, there is a comment in the forum of the Wall Street Journal, whose author notes that it is irresponsible to have children if you do not know how to feed them.
Participants in the protest, which began Thursday morning at 6: 30 a.m. in front of McDonald's on 40th Street and Madison Avenue, demanded that the cashiers and chefs of Fast Food Restaurants receive a minimum wage of US $15 per hour, more than double the current minimum wage.
They continued to call for the formation of trade unions in the fast food industry.
The U.S. federal law prohibits corporate management from standing in the way of this goal, warning or dismissing union members.
On the other hand, corporate governance does not make it easy for them.
Establishing trade unions in the fast food industry is also difficult for objective reasons.
The most important reason is the high staff turnover.
Discontented people
There were loud protests that day in front of many other fast food restaurants in Manhattan.
The high point of the protest was a midday gathering in front of McDonald's in Times Square, where some local Democrats spoke, including City Councillor Jumaane Williams, who said, "McDonald's say it sells billions of servings, and yet you are not given sick days, and you are not paid for your honest work!"
The protesters were also supported by other prominent New York Democrats, for example, Mayoral candidate Bill De Blasio, who said that "we should work together to support the Fast Food employees so that they can receive a fair wage and achieve the economic prosperity that every New Yorker deserves!".
According to the New York Times, this was the largest action of its kind in the history of the U.S. Fast Food industry.
However, there were only a few hundred people on the ground, not all of whom are employed in the fast food industry, which employs tens of thousands in New York.
It is not yet clear whether the spark of these protests will mobilize whole masses.
"Up to now, the brain can only be tricked moderately"
The topic of augmented reality, popular with followers of modern technology, has lately been usually perceived through the lens of special glasses.
First, Google presented a working model at its annual conference in the summer, and in November it became known that Microsoft had also applied for a patent.
However, in a conversation with Shahram Izadi, head of the Interactive 3D Technology Group at Microsoft ’ s Cambridge laboratory, it became clear that the glasses were only a transit station for the company ’ s scientists.
It attracts the possibility to manipulate virtual objects in the air with bare hands and to create virtual open spaces.
- Please describe briefly what research your group is conducting.
- We deal with the interaction of man and machine, but we want to extend the limits of this interaction.
Until now, most of humanity has been stuck in the phase of working with pixels on flat screens, which are sometimes touched.
However, we want to look forward to five to ten years and foresee the radical changes in this interaction.
For example, the Xbox console and Kinect ’ s sensors are an advance, and nowadays no Xbox is sold without Kinect, as everyone is interested in motion control.
- What can we expect in the future?
- Although Kinect has brought the interaction to a physical level, much is still happening on the flat screen, sometimes in 3D.
The input of information (the system receives more data) could be improved, the output not yet decisive.
We try to change that, working on real three-dimensional display systems based on different technologies, including projections.
We must release the computer world into our physical world and make it more tangible.
However, this requires that not only the user, but also his environment is recognized.
Then we could add virtual objects to the real world much more easily.
And first and foremost, we should get rid of these stupid Virtual-Reality-Helmets!
- What do you think about voice control?
It is popular, but is it not overvalued?
- It is certainly not a one-size-fits-all solution, since it raises questions about privacy, because you do not always want to inform everyone around you about your actions and intentions.
Actually, any kind of interaction with computers is good, but each in its particular niche.
For example, in the area of controlling objects in public places, we worked on a project in which we experimented with short and concise gestures rather than expansive ones.
The gestures were not recorded by the object camera, but by a wristband that recorded the movements of the bones and muscles.
It is still relatively large, but theoretically it could be reduced to the size of a wristwatch.
But overall, the future belongs to mixed control types, such as gesture and speech.
- How?
- We would ask you, for example, to give you this jacuzzi?
They say it and at the same time point to it.
- Usually I just say it.
- Oh, that would be very hard to see.
- Does that mean that you want the user to adapt to what a machine can and cannot achieve at a given time?
- Not necessarily, but it is a matter of mutual rapprochement.
I think that in the near future, we will have to work primarily on the development of new types of sensors that will enable people ’ s reactions to be recorded more accurately.
These can be laser sensors, for example, as they offer good resolution in depth, which is very important.
- What are your demands on modern cameras based on your work with the Xbox Kinect?
Is there a lack of resolution, depth or anything else?
- The current generation is basically a good starting point for our work in the field of three-dimensional recognition.
Of course, 8 Megapixels with a speed of 1000 fps would not be bad.
But the main thing is not the megapixels themselves, but the quality of the matrix and the depth.
From this point of view, all current technologies are not good enough for us, as the developers of the algorithms have more work to do.
Not only the resolution along the x- and y-, but also along the z-axis has to be considered.
The speed and number of frames per second are also important.
The human movements are extremely dynamic and frankly, the current 30 fps are too little, especially for gestures.
Stephen Betishes developed in our lab in Redmond a touch sensor with an adjustable processing delay between 1 to 100 milliseconds, with today's commercial sensors closer to the second value (60 to 100).
Not everyone understands how much this influences the interaction between man and machine.
For my work I needed just such a device, only without touch control and with more pictures per second.
- Would it not be necessary to increase the number of cameras?
- Kinect currently works with three "cameras", one of which is actually an infrared transmitter and the second a receiver for the reflected signal.
And the third camera is actually an ordinary RGB camera.
It is not used to calculate the object depth.
More cameras could possibly solve the problem...
Or reinforce the problem, as more calculations would be needed.
A flexible system similar to Kinect would be nice, in which we could play with different camera angles to see how this helps us in the three-dimensional determination of a position.
- If I remember correctly, Microsoft, unlike Google, did not present its glasses to the public.
Do you not think that, with regard to the application of the technology of augmented reality in everyday life, glasses have the best prospects?
- Of course, it is not pleasant to always have a smartphone in your hands when you are on the move, but I think the following: The best variant would be a "changing" expanded reality, in which we could switch from the glasses to the smartphone via a cloud,
The glasses are a personal gadget and therein lies their strength (private things only you can see), but at the same time also their weakness, because an expanded reality with glasses prevents that you can work together with others on virtual objects.
- Imagine for a moment that the manipulation of virtual holograms in the air is accessible not only to Tony Stark of Iron Man, but also to ordinary mortals.
There is a problem that critics of this idea often point out: there is no tangible reaction!
The hands feel nothing at all!
What answers does your group want to give to this objection?
- In my lectures, I often speak of augmented reality as the seventh breakthrough in human-machine interaction.
I think the eighth breakthrough could well be the integration of tactile perception.
An interesting method is currently the use of the second hand as a somewhat unusual projection surface.
It perceives pressure excellently!
But there are also technologies that are actually aimed at giving something tangible to the "images in the air", for example, the interference of some directed ultrasonic beams at a certain point where the finger is, creates a feeling that is currently still as weak as if someone were blowing over the ball of the hand.
There are also wrist bands that act on the nerve endings in the fingers, which is also a potential direction.
- Have you tried to outsmart the brain?
Let it think that it feels what it should feel when it is seeing something?
- That's a good idea, so we haven't tried it yet.
This is another task that we will have to contend with for a long time to come, namely to make a person who is physically in an enclosed space believe that he is instead in an open, practically infinite space; here we are working on concepts with treadmills (other than in gyms), mobile platforms and large spheres.
So far, the brain can be tricked only moderately, and we still have many busy years ahead of us.
This is what makes working in the field of virtual reality so attractive for a researcher: for many topics, we are only at the beginning.
Taste instead of culture - rosbalt.ru
Rosbalt continues the "Petersburg Avant-Garde" project, which is dedicated to city dwellers who form the avant-garde of art and culture.
High-ranking representatives of the Petersburg art scene, whose successes extend beyond the borders of the city and which often find recognition in Europe without being known in the rest of Russia, have already landed on the select list.
The new hero of Rosbalt is the extravagant artist Kirill Miller.
The whole town knows Kirill Miller, the bearded man dressed in red, who can be seen at the Russian Museum, at the summer garden, at the scene of meetings or at openings.
Wherever Kirill Miller ’ s paintings are exhibited, they attract large crowds.
Kirill Miller is one of the typical Petersburg social-philosophical artists who create new myths.
Kirill Miller is a luminous figure of the Petersburg avant-garde at the end of the 80s and the beginning of the 90s.
He is also a man of the city and, by his presence on the street, brings a smile to the faces of his fellow citizens and puts them in a good mood.
Recently he grabbed a barrel organ and became the St. Petersburg barrel organ player, as he finally felt ready for this difficult role in terms of his artistic life, his philosophy and his image.
- Kirill, why are you always in red and not, for example, in yellow or turquoise in the city on the road?
I chose the color red as a fashion designer, who deals with the optics and the image.
In this world, red is the compromise between artist, image consultant and society.
In society, anything that deviates from the Gray Norm causes aggression and bad behavior.
But I want to enter into conversation with the people through my provocations.
Each of my past provocations was an invitation to talk.
- When did you know that you had to become a painter?
- At an exhibition in the Palace of Culture Nevsky, where my works were exhibited.
I understood that I had to go this way.
Then the time of the old free, but not officially recognized painters came to an end, and new and free painters like me were incomprehensible.
I became friends with the painters of the new generation, that is, with the representatives of the "Gazonevshina"; this resulted in "Pushkinskaya 10", and then it was over.
I am drawn to the theatre, to fashion, to music, to everything but literature.
- And all this united in your kind of clinic... - It was important to me to be at the centre of St. Petersburg culture, where the best creative artists should gather.
In 1995, I occupied one room at Pushkinskaya 10, and before the renovation works, there was an artistic club for Bohemian music, the House of St. Petersburg Bohemians.
Many were born there: N.O.M., Tequilajazzz, and I also remember how Schnur came there with his project "Ucho Van Goga".
Schnur and his friends sang simple songs to the playback, wore tight jerseys and to them belonged the composer Igor Wdowin.
When the group started to play live, it became "Leningrad".
Trachtenberg moderated many programs before the time of "Hello Galli".
We gave them Trachtenberg, and it began his great career, but he learned the basics from us.
Also the gallery "D 137" or the club "Griboedov" have their origin in the art clinic.
Our employees and regular guests went there.
I am a hero of the last century, when culture still meant something.
In the year 2000, there was a poll in the press about the award "Personalities of our city".
I won in the category "Artist of the Year" and with that I reached the climax.
It is not easy to work according to old rules in new times; I am a man of truth, honesty and culture of the past century.
Nowadays it is easy to become famous, but culture and popularity are not the same: you can be famous without making a cultural contribution.
- Your works have an unmistakable style.
- Many of my pictures are real pearls and express clearly the actuality and sharpness of the thoughts.
I will have an exhibition with the theme "The Russian Museum as Clowns".
Clowns are timeless.
I used to be social, but now it hurts and scares me to be that way.
In a clown it all blurs and loses its tragedy.
I love the grotesque, and I have grotesque ideas.
For example, let us save the world by prescribing that everyone has to dress up completely.
Now everyone pays attention to the clothes and orients himself on the outside and not on the inside of the person.
But perhaps one should not shake hands with a person, but spit in his face.
The deception disappears through the disguise.
- Recently we saw you in the role of the urban barrel organ player. - A cultural city should have such a hero.
Who, if not me?
- Can commercial art be beautiful?
- Nowadays commercial art must be cautious, considerate and flattering.
We see the disintegration of cultures.
People used to form large groups: the bohemians loved one and the common people the other.
Now there are micro-communities and it is difficult to please everyone.
I ’ m not a hundred dollars ’ note that everyone likes.
Now you have to decide who you will like.
Now every cult star has about 100 followers.
- Several thousand come to the performances of Stas Mikhailov!
- Abandoned women come to him, where the sexual-social sphere plays a role.
For cultural reasons, 300 people come and not 10 thousand, so there is less management, money and everything is ruined.
I have supporters, and the most important thing is not to deceive them and not to destroy what has been achieved.
In my youth I painted such pictures, which even hung with a collector in a row with the works of Falk and Larionov.
I started with pictures that normally don ’ t come until the end of my career.
Nowadays, there are often misunderstandings.
It is called: spiritual culture and consumer culture.
Consumption has no culture at all, that is something quite different.
I am a person of the past culture and I grew up with artists who lived in poverty and died in poverty and refused money in order to paint.
That is the culture I support.
- Kirill, what is missing Petersburg?
- Good cultural experts.
They say: servants of culture.
But not all of them can deal with culture.
It was different with the real Tsars, for the Tsars perhaps did not understand much about culture, but they understood that real experts are necessary.
There are currently good advisers in Moscow.
In Petersburg, we have some who could be experts, but they are barred from the road, because there is a need for higher-level experts to properly assess the former and clear the way for them.
Now only one ’ s own taste counts.
The same goes for the erarta, but with the difference that they say honestly that they do not accept all contemporary art and that some painters have to look for other museums.
- What is Petersburg for you?
- Petersburg is not the capital of culture; there is much more culture and fertile soil in Moscow.
Art can hardly grow on our stones.
We need a breeding ground for culture because, for example, we now have more writers than readers, and that is not right.
In Europe there are many curious people who visit exhibitions or concerts.
For us, this is much less.
Art must be modern again, as it was at the beginning of the last century.
The project is financed by grants from the City of St. Petersburg
Birth in space
Earth in danger.
Global warming or collision with killer asteroid.
Caravans of spaceships with inhabitants on board set off in search of a replacement planet.
In order to save mankind, the important question arises, how we can propagate in weightlessness or on the substitute planet?
I do not think there are many choices.
In fact, there are only two real planets that we could at least hypothetically inhabit.
"Namely Mars and Venus", says the scientific assistant of the Astronomical Institute Vladimir Surdin.
However, while the conditions on Mars are relatively friendly to life, there is a temperature of 500 degrees on the surface of Venus.
Life would only be possible at high altitude or in the orbit of Venus, i.e. in space.
The researchers first addressed the question of reproduction in space with regard to the flora.
Experiments with plants had already been carried out half a century earlier.
The fourth generation of peas bred in orbit was not at all different from the earthly species.
This was followed by the cultivation of insects, more precisely of tiny fruit flies (Drosophila), in orbit.
In 1979, quail eggs were sent into space to investigate the effects of weightlessness on the development of embryos.
A normal chick develops.
But then the problem begins.
"The problem is that the chick has to be able to stand on its legs and start moving," says Vladimir Sykhev, head of the laboratory at the Institute for Medical Biological Problems RAN.
Without a solid ground the chicks spilled over wildly.
Ten hours later, the newborn ’ s instincts became completely numb.
The chicks did not react to light and sound.
Four days later, they simply died.
"We let chicks hatch twice and then stopped the whole thing, because it is simply impossible to work with them there," Vladimir Sykhev says about the failed experiment with the chicks in space.
The last breeding cage with animals flew into orbit 16 years ago.
The experiments will continue in spring 2013.
However, the biosatellite "Bion" will contain only same-sex species.
There was an experiment with rats that had already been fertilized and sent into space.
In principle, nothing special was found.
"That was with the bio-satellites, but again it was just a single experiment, and the research must continue," says Vladimir Sykhev.
After landing, the space rats had offspring.
The problem of reproduction directly in space has not yet been solved.
The task is difficult.
Animals, which are torn from its natural habitat, simply cannot follow its reproductive-instinct.
In contrast to animals, humans could do this in principle.
Homo sapiens is capable of abstract thinking and can create a similar emotional background.
For ethical reasons, such experiments are not carried out.
But women have been flying into space for 50 years.
The biggest risk was with Tereshkova.
The most precious thing that mankind possesses is the female organism.
Our seagull flew away, and no one on earth could have answered the following question: Will it survive the space flight?
Will she be able to give birth to a child after this flight?
"After all, no one answered this question," says space veteran Vakhtang Vachnadze.
In June 1964, only one year after her space flight, the first female cosmonaut, Valentina Tereshkova, gave birth to a daughter.
The father of the child, Andriyan Nikolayev, was also a cosmonaut.
In 1988, the second woman in space, Svetlana Savitskaya, who was in orbit twice and even did work outside the spacecraft, gave birth to a son.
Nevertheless, there is still a risk.
We have only very few cosmonauts, where everything went well after long flights and they got healthy offspring.
"The more dangerous it is, even during flights into orbit," concludes cosmonaut Valery Polyakov, Hero of the Soviet Union and Hero of the Russian Federation.
And yet mankind must look for new paths in biotechnology, radiation protection, and the creation of artificial gravity.
The hydrolaboratory in the cosmonaut preparation center is a compulsory station during flight preparation.
Here in a state of limbo, the cosmonauts gain routine for their work in open space.
The water represents weightlessness.
Although adults find water pleasant, it is an alien environment; but infants perceive water as a natural element.
It is as if little Ichtyander were witnessing life on land emerging from the ocean.
There is a connection between the fact that a child is in amniotic fluid in the mother ’ s womb for about 9 months and the fact that it can then get used to water more easily.
In principle, this is logical, since only 2 weeks pass from birth until the first swim.
"This is not enough time to forget something," says baby swimming instructor Marina Aksenova.
Whereas weightlessness is a much more natural condition for a newborn child, the woman cannot do without gravity.
In a state of weightlessness, the abdominal and pelvic muscles shrink enormously and thus the ability to squeeze out the child also decreases.
All right, let us avoid this by using birth initiating aids.
For example, the birth could also take place in a special chamber to squeeze the child out.
"But what happens then?" is Valery Polyakov's not insignificant question.
On the other hand, the child also needs artificial gravity.
Without feeling an earth attraction, an organism cannot form a skeleton and muscles.
A newborn child cannot be put in an endurance suit in orbit like an adult for training.
He will simply lack what is of elementary importance for his life.
"This experiment, which we are undertaking together, namely the birth of a child in a foreign environment, will result in the birth of a disabled person, a completely unadapted person," predicts the head of the Bioethics Commission of the Institute for Medical Biological Problems RAN, Igor Pestov.
So far, the birth of children in space has been a mere theory.
At some point, however, it will become reality when the inhabitants of the earth set off in their spaceships to a distant planet that will be the home of their offspring born in space.
NKÚ Inc. chief: Control of Black System Failed by Political Debt
The Czech Republic has good supervisory bodies and adequate laws in connection with public contracts, but falls behind in their application.
In an interview for Aktuálně.cz, the Vice-President of the Supreme Control Office (Nejvyšší kontrolní úřad, NKÚ), Miloslav Kala, said the following.
"A law is never perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and I do not think that is the case with us," comments Kala on the current situation.
A similar conclusion seems to be reached by joint control by Czech and German auditors.
As a negative practical example, he cites the attitude of Prime Minister Petr Nečas to the so-called "black" system.
The Prime Minister recently said that ODS would not harass entrepreneurs with controls, so is the system banned or allowed?
"A law must be valid, and if something is forbidden by law, it cannot simply be the head of the government who comes and impedes the activities of the Office of Control, whose duty is to monitor compliance with the law," notes Kala.
At the meeting of the Control Committee of the Chamber of Deputies, you spoke about a joint Czech and German project in which the laws of both countries on public contracts were compared.
What exactly was this about?
This is a parallel test, which we started about two years ago.
Simply put, it is a question of the European legislature determining how public contracts are to be handled, which is what national legislation builds on, and, finally, there is the actual practical application.
All of this we have compared with each other, and although the examination is not yet completed, we have been able to find extremely interesting differences. Generally speaking, the laws here are perhaps even more "strict and perfect", but the actual application in Germany is better in some parameters.
This confirms that it is not enough to constantly draw up new and more precise rules, but that we must also look at the actual application of the law.
To what extent can the project be of help to you? What does this project imply for you?
It is precisely this kind of joint monitoring that could help us to stop constantly striving to improve legislation and to lower and balance thresholds, when this does not seem to have a particularly positive effect.
Profitability means acquiring a thing at a reasonable price (which is not always the lowest price) and excluding unlawful enrichment or even criminal acts.
However, lowering the thresholds for contracts does not guarantee that we will achieve this objective.
It may even be the case that we are burdening the system in this way only with excessive 'paperwork', and those who are looking for loopholes in the system have it much easier to exploit the system than if the thresholds remained higher.
You talk about the problems in the practical implementation of the Czech procurement law.
How does the control system work in Germany?
Is there a similar authority to our NKÚ, or does the system work differently?
As far as the authorities are concerned, the German equivalent of the NKÚ is the Federal Court of Auditors, which has a similar structure to ours and also has a college that is formed slightly differently. In principle, however, both authorities work in a similar way.
The competencies are also comparable to a certain extent, although Germany is a federal state, i.e. these audit offices also exist in the individual Länder - this is how the German system differs from ours.
The FRG may control only federal funds, which corresponds to our state funds.
Public funds, which in our country are administered by the districts and municipalities, are there subject to the control of the provincial audit offices.
As far as German legislation is concerned, is it simpler than ours?
In general, I would be reluctant to compare this without specific data. Nevertheless, Germany is often referred to as a role model in some respects, but it is certainly not possible to say that Germany is better in everything.
Is that perhaps because the auditors are better?
Certainly not, but as I said, I do not particularly like comparisons of this kind.
It should also be noted that those countries which are an example to us also face problems.
Otherwise, they would not be cooperating with our authority, would they not?
As far as Czech legislation is concerned, what significance did the amendment of the Public Procurement Act have for your authority, do you feel any impact?
In view of the fact that this amendment is only in force for a short time, it has not yet had any effect on our audits.
Since our controls are retroactive, we must expect a certain delay here.
So far, we have felt more of an impact in the preparatory phase of future controls - we have introduced the new control instrument "Identification of risks of inefficiency" and with this we have examined and analysed almost 14,000 public contracts - here the changes will of course have an impact, as the thresholds change, the conditions for certain types of tenders have been modified, etc.
Do you see the adoption of this law as rather positive, or will the system be burdened with further bureaucracy?
I think that this law is certainly a step in the right direction and I hope that this assumption is confirmed.
However, the problem may arise that the rules become 'stricter' and can no longer be complied with.
Under the previous rules, audited persons are already accountable to the institution (for example, in the case of a regional policy operational programme, the Regional Council) to the effect that any failure to comply with the procurement law amounts to a breach of budgetary discipline.
But does it make sense to make the law even stricter?
I do not think so.
The system must exclude those who want to attack and abuse the system and not punish those who have made a formal error that does not affect the actual decision-making process.
Such a system merely puts even greater pressure on bureaucracy.
Where is the way out?
First of all, let us say which way is not the right one.
The Prime Minister said recently that the ODS would not bother the entrepreneurs with controls of the so-called "black" system - what exactly does that mean?
Is the black-and-white system now prohibited or allowed?
A law must be valid, and if something is forbidden by law, then it is not easy for the President of the Government to come and obstruct the activities of the Office of Control, whose duty it is to monitor compliance with the law.
He can say, "We change the law and let the thing go," but he can't say that we pretend there is nothing.
The Public Procurement Act contains relatively strict rules on the formal execution of certain transactions - and that is also right for the protection of public competition.
On the other hand, it is also tragic if the bidder with the best bid is excluded solely because of formal errors.
The law will never be perfect, but it must be applied correctly - and that is what I think we lack.
On the streets there is some ice, but mostly they are dry.
The roads of the Czech Republic are partially covered with snow and ice.
However, the roads are mostly passable, sometimes caution is required.
Karlovy Vary
In the district of Karlovy Vary, the roads were well driveable this morning, and there were isolated snow and ice smells.
The temperatures dropped to -5 to -10 ° C, during the day it should get warmer.
It is no longer snowing in the region, and only a thin layer of snow remains at lower altitudes.
On the ridges of the Erzgebirge, however, there is about 30 cm of snow.
According to the Bezirksstrassenwacht there was limited visibility due to fog.
The R6 expressway and first-class roads in the region are currently fully accessible.
However, attention should be paid, for example, to bridges on which the roads are sometimes icy and slippery.
All second and third class roads, including mountain roads, can also be used.
On these roads, however, ice or snow remains in sections.
Particularly in the higher locations, therefore, increased attention is required.
Pardubice and Hradec Králové districts
On some roads in East Bohemia there is danger due to ice, at higher altitudes and in the mountains there is sometimes an extended snow layer on the roads, the road and motorway management informs on their websites.
The road maintenance services warn drivers of icy conditions, which can occur especially at higher altitudes in the district of Pardubice.
Glacier may occur especially on second and third class roads in the districts of Lanškroun, Ústí nad Orlicí, Polička, Svitavy and Vysoké Mýto.
Roads I / 43 and I / 34 near Svitavy are chemically treated.
Snow is especially found on the roads in the Giant Mountains and Orlické hory.
Extended snow cover is located at high altitudes on the roads of Rychnov nad Kněžnou and Trutnov counties.
In East Bohemia today it is mostly sunny or sunny, and precipitation is largely absent.
The temperatures are between -3 and + 1 ° C, there is a weak wind.
Pilsen District
The roads in the district of Pilsen are now well drivable, but locally increased attention is required, and the driving style is adapted to the weather.
This is frosty in the morning, with temperatures between 3 and 9 degrees below freezing.
Since it has snowed before and the temperatures fell afterwards, it can come to ice smoothness on the roads.
In addition, fog is to be expected locally, whereby the view will improve however in the course of the day.
This information comes from the Bezirksstraßenmeistereien.
The D5 motorway is practically unrestricted, but the road maintenance services recommend increased attention between the 80th and the 131st kilometres.
The roads of the first class are mainly dry, but completely frozen.
In the south of the districts of Pilsen and Tachov, ice may occur in sections.
The second- and third-class roads are wet, and therefore the reference to possible icy sections applies here too.
Drivers should be especially careful on the less frequented roads in the Bohemian Forest area.
Olomouc Municipality
Today, drivers heading towards the altitudes of the Olomouc district have to reckon with slush.
After the use of spreading vehicles, slush remains on the Červenohorské sedlo pass and on the road towards Videlský kříž.
Nocturnal snow drifts forced the road maintenance services to deploy. According to the road administration, around 3 cm of fresh snow fell in the Šumperk district.
In the rest of the district, the roads are mostly unrestricted.
"Snow remains in the Šumperk region.
At the Červenohorské sedlo pass, drivers heading towards Jeseník will have to reckon with slush, "a member of the Šumperk road administration told the ČTK agency today.
Her colleagues in the Jeseník region also had to leave at night, and according to her, the streets are free and wet up to the altitude after chemical treatment.
The roads in Olomouc County are unrestricted, but in Šternberk County drivers have to drive carefully in forest sections, as the roads here are still damp.
Ústí nad Labem district, Liberec district
In northern Bohemia, the road maintenance agencies report several poorly passable road sections.
Besides several places with snow or ice, the mountain road from Telnice to Knínice in Ústí nad Labem is closed, according to traffic police.
The temperatures remain below zero even at lower altitudes, so that snow and ice will remain on the roads. However, from the lowlands, especially southeast of the Bohemian Central Mountains, no problems are reported, and the roads there are usually dry.
So far, no traffic disruption has been reported.
Glacier is mainly reported from the vicinity of Štětí.
According to meteorologists, there were ideal conditions for this at night - rain and melting snow during the day, cloudless sky and frost at night.
Bad traffic conditions are reported on the main routes and on road I / 13 at the border of the Ústí n.L. and Liberec districts.
The closure of the road between Telnice and Knínice was necessary because of the branches that were pushed from the snow load to the road surface.
Šimon Ornest: At our concerts we want to gather positive energy
What do you think about the end of the world taking place in less than a month?
This is one of the disaster reports to which we humans are so keen to jump.
With our band The Tap Tap we make fun of it and say that we are the only band in the world that can gather enough positive energy to stop or prevent the end of the world.
In December you will also realize a unique project with three concerts against the end of the world.
Can you introduce the project to our readers?
This is a nationwide charity event, which we have been planning for two years.
For this, we want to utilize the marketing potential of the Mayan calendar, the end of which is predicted for 21 December at 11: 10 in the morning.
The day before, i.e. on 20 December, three concerts will take place at the same time from 21: 00 in Prague, Brno and Ostrava.
The end of the concerts is said to be around the time that the Mayan calendar ends on the Pacific island of Kiribati, which lies in a time zone 12 hours ahead of us.
Who came up with this idea?
Originally probably from me, then we designed the idea together with our graphic designer Honza Augusta.
Not only do we want to gather enough positive energy to prevent the end of the world, but we also want to reflect with the public on the state in which we will once hand this world over to our children.
On the occasion of the end of the Mayan calendar, we have also developed a unique collection of shoes, t-shirts, bags and key chains against the end of the world, with the purchase of which people can also support us via www.e-tap.cz.
The band The Tap Tap together with other performers has also recorded the so-called Hymn against the end of the world with the title "Weltuntergang fällt aus".
The anthem is already very popular on YouTube. Will it also be heard at the benefit concerts?
Of course, and at the very end, provided that everything works out and the end of the world does not take place...
The hymn is to be sung by all performers at all three concerts simultaneously.
The anthems will also be broadcast live by Czech television.
The lyrics of the hymn are by Tomáš Hanák, who also plays the main character of Jesus in the video clip, Xindl X also sings with...
How did you come to work with both of them?
We also cooperate with other personalities of the Czech cultural scene, which is related to the fact that we organize many charity events and concerts...
We strive to involve these people intensively in our projects.
It turned out that most people are interested in working with us and enjoy it.
What is the purpose of the concerts against the end of the world?
For the establishment of the accessible educational center Studeo, on which we have been working for six years together with the association Tap in the Jedlička-institute.
Students of the Jedlička institute are regularly supervised by lecturers who help them with various leisure activities.
Since the students themselves do not have the means to visit the lecturers, we want to help them in this way.
As part of the completion of the Jedlička institute, a separate building is to be constructed, into which we will move with this project.
Several groups and performers perform at each concert.
What criteria did you use to select them?
We wanted to put together a program that appeals to all generations, including children.
In Prague, for example, Chinaski, Support Lesbians, Illustratosphere with Dan Bárta, The Tap Tap, Marián Bango and Jiří Suchý perform.
You can find out more on the website www.kpks.cz.
Are similar "major events" planned for the future?
In May, we will perform for the first time at the Prague Spring, and also for this concert we will prepare an interesting program with interesting guests.
Next year we would also like to perform at the Czech House in New York, and I personally - when we are in the USA - would also like to combine this with appearances in Washington and Chicago.
Your foreign plans are not exactly small, so far you have performed in Madrid, Brussels, London or Moscow.
The Tap Tap, however, is a group of people with disabilities.
How do you manage these journeys logistically and organisationally?
It is not as bad as it seems at first sight.
Five of our members are wheelchair users, i.e. the wheelchairs must be carried in the luggage compartment. In addition, we must of course carry many instrument cases and other luggage...
Nevertheless, it has always worked without problems, ČSA and British Airways were always very well prepared for us, that I have sometimes already wondered.
Even in Moscow, where we were recently, there were no problems.
Your trips abroad will give you a comparison of what accessibility is like in the individual countries, how to deal with disabled people, etc.
How have you experienced these things so far?
After Madrid, Luxembourg, London and other cities where everything works better than here, we have witnessed in Russia that everything is still in its infancy in the East.
Opposite Prague, Moscow is absolutely not accessible for disabled people. There, it is still unusual when someone is travelling alone in a wheelchair in the city centre.
There it is not even self-evident that one leaves a wheelchair user for example in the elevator.
Fortunately, associations are also being set up there to try to draw attention to the problems of people with disabilities.
And in what respect do we need to catch up with the more developed countries?
There are still many things in which we are lagging behind...
It should also be noted, however, that an improvement in the situation always depends on the efforts of those affected.
In London and Madrid, it is absolutely common for people with severe disabilities to be able to move independently in public spaces, go to museums, use toilets, etc.
But it is not common for a large group of handicapped people to take an active part in social events. In this respect, we are a little ahead of the West with the band The Tap Tap!
Respect among the public and accessibility is one thing, but it is only when major athletes, artists, actors, politicians or lawyers come from our ranks that things will really start to change.
So far these are only individual cases of particularly strong-willed personalities.
The Tap Tap is very popular at the moment, but if we go back a few years, what motivated you to start a band in 1998?
At that time I started as a supervisor at the Jedlička ’ s institute, where I met many young people who were interested in doing something intensive.
And since I am a musician myself and play the saxophone, among other things, I founded a music society together with a colleague.
Well, and over time, as our moderator, Láďa Angelovič, likes to say, it got a bit out of control (laughs).
But the band only became known in the last years, or am I wrong?
It is true that working with well-known singers has helped us and we have also started to actively promote ourselves.
We have become aware that if you do something and it is not visible to the outside world, your own achievement in a certain sense does not exist.
Thanks to the EU funding, we can also afford good lecturers, high-quality equipment and the like.
Was it your goal to bring The Tap Tap this far?
Right from the start, I felt the potential to do things differently.
In show business today, one often copies the other.
This is logical in its own way, since everything new is viewed with caution and only accepted after a long time.
There are few truly unique things, and I dare say that tap tap is part of it.
The first impression the viewer usually gets is of course pity; that is only natural...
But this compassion is absolutely superfluous, because people with disabilities are not lonely and abandoned beings that we should regret.
They are people who can live and develop a fully-fledged life, provided that they have the necessary means.
I always say that if people with disabilities succeed, it is progress not only for them, but for society as a whole.
Was it also helpful for this success that you are a strict boss, as one hears from many people?
If you want to do something well, you must not compromise on many things and must also demand a certain degree of discipline.
In my opinion, this is perfectly normal.
Some come to us with romantic concepts, and when they discover that they have to rehearse twice a week, complete preparatory phases and spend a lot of time on concert tours, the enthusiasm of many quickly disappears.
But that ’ s how it works everywhere, in every band that wants to work seriously and achieve something.
The Tap Tap currently has twenty members.
How many of them were there from the beginning, i.e. since 1998?
Only one: Láďa Angelovič.
We are an open group. People come and go. You can ’ t prevent that.
Whoever has the will and the desire to participate is always welcome with us.
Takes place the day before the predicted end of the world, Thursday 20.12.2012 at 21: 00
Venues are: Incheba / Prague, Fléda / Brno and Plynojem / Ostrava; 12 Czech bands and other musicians
All three venues will be connected to each other via a live link and there will be a joint interpretation of the hymn "Weltuntergang fällt aus" by the band The Tap Tap.
The aim of the concert is to raise funds for the equipment of a multifunctional educational centre for the disabled, to be built under the name of STUDEO at the Jedlička Opera Institute in Prague. Cost: CZK 25 million.
Entrance costs 400 CZK, children up to 12 years free of charge, tickets are available in advance with a Bohemia ticket.
Poland and space.
Last week, Poland was accepted as the twentieth member of this space agency at a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the member countries of the European Space Agency (ESA), making it the second member country from the former Eastern Bloc (after the Czech Republic, which became an ESA member on 12 November 2008).
Poland started a close cooperation with ESA in 1994 and participated in several ESA projects in the following years.
Poland ’ s path into space began much earlier.
Even before the Second World War, Polish cosmos enthusiasts were occupied with space travel, although they did not always meet with understanding.
I recall, for example, the lecture given by A. Šternfeld on 6 December 1933 at the Warsaw Observatory, in which the author presented thoughts from his pioneering work "Entrance to Cosmonautics".
The ideas of the young engineer (born in 1905) left the audience cold, and years later Šternfeld remembered that only Dr. Jan Gadomski had shown interest in his work.
Šternfeld won the Prix REP in 1934 for "Entrance to Cosmonautics", donated by Robert Esnault and André Louis Hirsch.
Dr. Jan Gadomski (1899 - 1966) later became an important advocate of astronomy and space travel.
He published hundreds of articles in Polish journals and wrote several books on these scientific disciplines.
Gadomski's world-renowned contribution to the development of space flight was also honoured by the fact that one of the craters on the away side of the moon was named after him.
Already in 1925 a railroad was built in Poland, for which a rocket drive was planned.
Unfortunately, the author of the draft and the details of this project remained unknown.
It is not even clear whether the rocket should be used to start or to brake the draisine.
The information on this comes exclusively from the contemporary press.
In 1933 the Polish infantry began to deal with missiles.
The research was conducted by the Komórka Techniki Uzbrojenia Institute in cooperation with Prof. Mieczyslaw Wolfke and Prof. Gustaw Mokrzyckiegi.
It can be seen from the documents handed down that research had reached the stage of practical tests.
However, research was interrupted by the invasion of the German Wehrmacht.
In 1937, a draft of a photoelectric hunting rocket by Ing. Rohoziński appeared in the trade press, and in the following year the work "Rakieta - torpeda powietrzna i rakietobomba lotnicza" by the author Leliwa "Krzywoblocky" appeared.
Both projects dealt with the military use of rocket propulsion.
Shortly before the war, all projects for the military use of rocket technology were coordinated by the Temporary Scientific Advisory Committee (Tymczasowy Komitet Doradczo, Naukowy).
The committee was established in 1937, but after two years of activity its work was terminated at the beginning of the war.
More articles on space flight appeared in the Polish press after the war thanks to the work of the Polish Space Society (Polskie Towarzystwo Astronautyczne).
The first mention of this company comes in 1954 in the November issue of the magazine Problemy, in which four extensive articles are dedicated to space travel.
Prof. M. Subotowicz's article proposes the creation of a space company.
At that time, there were already the first satellite technology projects, and it was foreseeable that space exploration would have a future.
Already in its beginnings in 1956, the Polish Space Agency (PTA) endeavoured to join the International Federation for Space, founded in 1951, and in fact the PTA became a full member as early as the autumn of 1956.
The following year, the first PTA president, Kazimierz Zarankiewicz (1902-1959), became the deputy chairman of the International Federation for Space.
He held this office until his death in 1959.
Since 1956, the PTA has been instrumental in the development of the highly successful meteorological rocket (Rakieta Meteorologiczna), the first Polish rocket for scientific research.
The first type, the RM-1, was completed in 1957, the first launch took place on 10 October 1958.
The rocket with a maximum flight height of 1800 m was about 80 cm long and weighed less than 5 kg.
Later, an improved version, the RM, 1A, was built, and in 1959, in the Błędów, the desert, flight tests began with the two-stage rocket RM, 2.
The rocket was 1.4 m long and weighed about 11.5 kg.
A further stage of development should already be in a position to carry out real scientific work - the RM-34 rocket should reach an altitude of up to 14.5 km and be used for the observation of high winds.
In the year 1962 however the further development was stopped.
Successor of the first missiles of the type RM was the in the years 1962 to 1965 developed meteor "1" rocket.
The rocket was designed as a two-stage rocket, its total length was 510 cm and the launch weight was 32.5 kg.
Three types of this rocket have been developed (Meteor-1A, -1B and -1C), which differ in the size of the transport space for scientific instruments.
The Meteor-1A missile had a transport compartment with a capacity of 0.4 litres, Meteor -1B over 0.34 litres and Meteor -1C over 0.62 litres.
The maximum altitude for all three types was 37 km.
In the years 1965 to 1968, the Aeronautics Institute developed the Meteor-2 rocket, whose first flight tests began in October 1970.
Meteor ܢ 2 had a take-off weight of 380 kg and was able to carry a payload of 10 kg to an altitude of about 60 km.
Thereafter, the versions Meteor, 2H and Meteor, 3 were built.
It is also worth mentioning Poland ’ s accession to the Committee for Space Research (COSPAR) in 1960, followed two years later by the creation of a national COSPAR committee.
Poland also participated in space exploration with Soviet satellites as part of the Intercosmos, and in 1978 the Polish pilot Miroslaw Hermaszewski became the second Intercosmonaut after the Czech Vladimír Remek.
The repeal of the Public Service Act is not a solution.
Last week, the Constitutional Court annulled the law on community service.
This decision provoked a lively public discussion.
It is certainly interesting to look at the problem from a broader perspective.
The liberal economies of the EU and the globalised world are based on the principle of unregulated economic competition.
Ultimately, this means that economies are in permanent conflict with each other.
This is due to the principle of free trade and the free, unrestricted movement of private capital, which goes hand in hand with unbridled financial speculation.
Due to the large differences in the value of labour (wages), there are price tensions.
This term refers to a situation in which the manufacturer tries to compete economically by importing cheap goods, "undercutting" competition, in order to gain a larger share of the market and increase its profits.
On a large scale, this means for most companies moving their manufacturing operations abroad, or buying cheap, or giving up business, resulting in high unemployment in countries with comparably high labor costs.
Since private capital bears no social responsibility, and therefore no responsibility for the unemployment it causes, government spending necessarily increases.
This situation is exacerbated by the fact that employers are absolutely unwilling to pay their taxes, thereby compensating for the economic and social damage they cause to society as a whole.
This situation is well known, so specific statistics are superfluous here.
The ruthless practice of private capital creates a situation in the individual economies in which governments are forced to compete with each other in order to artificially lower the social level of their own population and thus attract foreign capital into the country.
In other words, governments leave their own people at the mercy of private capital, regardless of the social consequences.
This is reflected in particular in amendments to existing laws.
The aim of these measures is to force their own people to accept the dictates of private capital, particularly in the area of wages.
This is being done, on the one hand, through economic constraint in the face of long-term unemployment, and, on the other, through the curtailment of workers' rights.
The result is growing poverty, as well as widening disparities between rich and poor.
In Germany, there have been public food dispensaries for the poor for several years that are no longer able to feed themselves through their own work.
The number of those affected is already running into millions.
In the course of increasing the competitiveness of the German economy, there are regularly cases in which workers receive such a low wage that the state has to increase their income to the subsistence level.
Such a scandal was also uncovered in the case of auxiliaries employed by the German Bundestag.
Austerity measures by virtually all the EU ’ s southern states will undoubtedly amount to the same condition, with people forced to emigrate (as was the case in the nineteenth century) under the pressure of a catastrophic fall in their social level, or to starve on the margins of society for a pittance, hoping that private investment capital will eventually flow into the country.
Here, of course, the question arises as to where this capital comes from.
If it comes from another EU country, only poverty migrates from one country to another; or capital simply stays out, because in China, India, Brazil, Turkey, Morocco, Egypt, or Africa in general, workers work for a fraction of European wages.
This concerns the whole of Latin America.
Liberal theories and media claim ad nauseam that the state must not participate with capital in its own economy, and that planned economy leads to economic disaster.
Private capital persists narrowly in its position that the state must not intervene in the economy in a directive manner.
But then one has to ask oneself whether private capital does not influence or even direct politics and thus the whole state in its own selfish sense.
Here is the clear answer: yes.
Proof of this is the existence of a virtually omnipotent and omnipresent lobby in all states.
The result is a desperate situation in the area of corruption, mutual advantage, legislation in which practically everything is criminal but nothing is punishable.
In Germany, the situation is such that due to a lack of finance, a State Ministry entrusts private legal entities closely linked to industry with the preparation of draft laws.
These bills will then be passed by the Bundestag.
All violence then no longer emanates from the people, as the Western constitutions proclaim, but from strong financial groups that prefer their own interests.
Obviously the liberal democracies are quickly finding themselves in a situation such as that described by Appian in his work on the crisis of the Roman Republic at the time of Caesar and Pompey: "The state had long been in disarray and the offices were occupied by force.
Against bribes, by illegal creeping of advantages or with stone and sword.
The corruption grew rampant and the people went to the elections with votes already bought "..." People of character did not apply for office, so that the state did not have a consul for eight months as a result of this decline "..." People began to really talk about the fact that the only medicine in this difficult situation was an autocracy, and that a strong man had to be elected "... Appian thought of Pompey, but the strong man was finally Caesar, who permanently replaced democracy with autocracy.
Today's society, as in ancient times, is based on the ruthless preference of one's own advantage, without paying any attention to the interests of society as a whole.
By its very nature, private capital is incapable of recognizing and enforcing the advantage for society as a whole.
The result, now as then, is an unprecedented decadence of elites who are not at all committed to deeper reforms.
The cause of the rise of fascism and communism must therefore be sought in the ruthless liberalisation of the economies of the 19th and 20th centuries.
From today ’ s perspective, the demise of these regimes in favor of liberal democracies can be seen as some pause, with the next round already looming.
What is particularly catastrophic is the fact that today's elites are completely ignorant of the possible future loss of hundreds of thousands of lives, of the humanitarian and social disasters that we are already witnessing and of the crimes against humanity that we know from past and recent history.
The repeal of the Public Service Act is not a solution, at least not a permanent one.
Under the pressure of global and European economic competition, the Czech Republic will be forced to continue to look for ways to lower the social level of the population.
This trend is therefore systemic.
The only solution is targeted political and social reforms that increase the state ’ s participation in the economy, increase citizens ’ influence on the government, and weaken the monopoly position of private capital in society for the benefit of the state.
Israel: laboratory of chaos.
"... that nothing comes out of violence, or could ever come into being" sings Sting in the song Fragile, whose most important verse in the refrain is: "... so that we do not forget how fragile we are".
"If my sons did not want wars, there would be none", says the dying Gutele Schnaper, wife of Mayer Amschel Rothschild, in the year 1849
After the last wave of violence between Israel and the Gaza Strip, as always, there was a myriad of reactions.
Some support Israel and argue with its right to self-defence, while others call the Palestinians terrorists; others support the Palestinians, argue with the racism of the Israeli state, with the genocide committed against the Palestinian Arabs, and call the state of Israel terrorist.
I do not want to write here about who is guilty and who is a victim in these recurring waves of killing; in the end, the current inhabitants of Israel, including the self-governing territories, were born into the current political situation and did not witness the beginning of the violence themselves.
It is my aim to give the readers a look behind the scenes, a look at who the 95 years of tension (calculated from the Balfour Declaration in November 1917) in the small patch of land in the Middle East are most beneficial to.
My thoughts are partly based on accessible historical facts, others are derived from these and emerge from my own understanding of who or which group of people has a significant influence on the events of modern history.
The history of humanity is first and foremost a history of the struggle for power.
In every epoch we can see an Alexander the Great or a Napoleon.
What is less obvious is the question of whether it was really always these personalities themselves who autonomously determined their steps, or whether behind their throne was someone who directed their actions toward a predetermined goal.
We must admit to ourselves that we live in a time when the wealth of the world is concentrated in the hands of a few individuals, and that this concentration of money and the resulting power has not arisen within the lifespan of a generation.
Of these astronomically rich families, one stands out that could be described as the head of the octopus (I do not know if there is anyone above them, but I do not rule this out) - the Rothschilds.
Not much is written about them.
Understandably.
The first press agency (Reuters) was bought by the Rothschilds as early as the nineteen-nineteenth-century in order to prevent their name from being linked to highly criminal acts that always served to consolidate their power, increase their wealth, or both.
The Rothschilds are involved in almost all the central banks in the world, and they are at war or preparing themselves against countries in which they do not participate in the central banks (before the attack on Afghanistan there were 7 countries, after the attack on Iraq there were 5 countries, after the overthrow of Ghaddafi there were only 4 countries left, with Russia meanwhile subordinating its central bank to the Russian government).
Whoever tried to oppose this family had to pay with his life for it.
Abraham Lincoln refused to renew the status of Rothschild ’ s Bank of America as a central bank, began issuing his own (i.e. state) banknotes during the civil war and was murdered in a theatre in 1865.
J.F. Kennedy started to issue his own banknotes and wanted to abolish the Fed - he was murdered in 1963; the MP Louis McFadden was poisoned in 1936 after he wanted to sue the Fed for triggering the Great Depression in 1929.
The global lust for power of the Rothschilds led in the years 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a plan for the unleashing of three world wars by Albert Pik, a freemason of the 33rd and thus highest degree of knowledge.
The aim of the first war was to eliminate the great monarchist statehood of Europe, the second war was to break the colonial rule of Great Britain in particular, and the third war was to reduce the world population to approximately 0.5 - 1 billion people (such a number would provide for their convenience and luxury and would also not consume as much resources), create a universal religion (ecumenism is nothing more than the apron here) and ultimately lead to the assumption of absolute power.
The method used by the group of the richest families with the Rothschilds at the top is to trigger a crisis and then offer a solution (order ab chao - order out of chaos).
These solutions, however, are wrong and always lead to a worsening of the situation (see the foundation of the FED, so that crises such as those triggered by them in 1907 are not repeated).
Having succeeded in starting the First World War by murdering the heir to the Habsburg throne Ferdinand in Sarajevo, they destroyed the Russian empire by the revolution of the Bolsheviks.
The First World War ended with the sudden, militarily and economically unfounded surrender of Germany (the war was no longer necessary for the destruction of the Russian empire), followed by the dissolution of the Central European great power of Austria and Hungary.
In order to ignite the Second World War more easily, the bankers allowed politics to create a latent conflict situation by imposing gigantic war reparations on Germany; thereby creating the conditions for impoverished masses, so that they only had to accuse the Germans of having a sufficiently strong leader to name the culprits and offer simple solutions; another factor was the creation of the multi-ethnic state of Czechoslovakia with a strong German minority, which was to take on the function of a fifth column and also took on the function of igniting the war.
At the end of the nineteenth century, the Rothschilds initiated the founding of the Zionist movement, in which one branch sought to establish a Jewish state, preferably on the historical territory of Judea, with Jerusalem as its capital (return to Zion).
The above-mentioned Balfour Declaration laid the groundwork for the mass immigration of Jews to Palestine; the first confrontations with the resident Arab population ensued.
Terrorist attacks were carried out on both sides.
The Second World War broke out, and it is difficult to assess whether Hitler broke from the chain that the international bankers had initially held him to, or whether everything was going according to plan. In any case, the suffering of the European Jews in the concentration camps created the conditions for the international community to recognize the Jewish state.
Israel was founded in 1948, and just as war reparations against Germany prepared the ground for the Second World War, the proclamation of the State of Israel is the focal point for the Third World War.
If the international bankers succeed in unleashing this war, the Jewish people will be the victims of the front line, similar to World War II, this time together with the Arab and Muslim populations of the Middle East.
Israel is like a huge laboratory, a source of strife and chaos, not only within the country itself, but also internationally (just think of how sharply people divide into adherents and opponents of Israel).
Who is the culprit and who is the victim in the conflict between Palestinians and Israelites, where injustice triggers only injustice in an endless spiral of violence, beginning with the greed of individuals and their quest for global power?
A distinction must be made here between the inhabitants of Israel and their leaders, given that the international bankers in Israel, as with us, the people, are only voting for their own candidates.
Israel ’ s current prime minister, Netanyahu ’ s hawk, is a typical example of a fascism-prone politician loyal to international bankers who is doing all he can to start a war with Iran, which, given Iran ’ s membership in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (China, India, Russia, Pakistan …), could rapidly become a global conflict, and which could destroy the world economy because of Iran ’ s control over the two-mile Strait of Hormuz, which carries 20% of the world ’ s oil supplies.
In what light do David Rockefeller's words from 1994 appear: "The only thing we need is an all-encompassing crisis, and people will welcome the new world order."
In their view, the new world order is a world of masters and slaves.
A world in which the rest of the human population serves a small group of financial aristocrats.
A world in which every newborn child is implanted with a chip at birth in order to subject this being to total control.
"And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand or in their forehead, that no man may buy or sell, save he that hath the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.
Here is wisdom! Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast.
For it is the number of a man, and his number is six hundred sixty-six. "
The movie Argo: When it's Worst, Call Hollywood
In November 1979, a mob of Islamic student protesters occupied the US American Embassy in Tehran, taking 52 diplomats hostage.
For their release, they demanded the extradition of the ousted Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, who fled after the revolution to the United States, which had held patronage over his regime for decades.
The American administration had no positive way out of this situation - it could not afford to throw the Shah overboard, as this would have severely damaged the confidence of its allies in other countries.
At the same time, it was unable to secure the release of the hostages in Iran, where the revolution led to the establishment of a theocratic regime.
It was a severe blow to the reputation of the United States, and the ensuing fiasco in the violent attempt to free hostages only made matters worse.
The captured diplomats were finally released after 444 days of negotiations mediated by the Algerian government.
The fate of the hostages provoked a wave of solidarity and anti-Iranian sentiments at home.
The Iranian debacle contributed significantly to Jimmy Carter ’ s defeat by Ronald Reagan in the 1980 presidential election.
The film Argo by director and actor Ben Affleck describes an episode of this story that brought the USA a small partial victory.
Immediately before the occupation of the embassy, six embassy employees managed to escape.
This ended after numerous complications in the residence of the Canadian ambassador.
The CIA, in collaboration with the Canadian authorities, succeeded in bringing the refugees from Iran, aided by an extravagant story to conceal their true identity - they traveled with Canadian passports disguised as members of a film crew who allegedly visited locations in the country for a science fiction film.
Combination of genres
The plan developed by Tony Mendez, an expert on "exfiltration", also made Hollywood's collaboration necessary.
To make the camouflage credible, articles about this film project appeared in professional journals, press conferences were held, and the fictional production company had a real office.
The details of this operation have long been kept secret, and the film is based on the memories of Tony Mendez.
Afflecks Film is a special combination of several film genres.
On the one hand it is a realistic political thriller, but at the same time it is also a so-called "Caper Movie", i.e. the story of a successful hussar play such as the film Ocean's Eleven.
This changes the mood in the film - on the one hand the documentary scenes from Tehran (in the title sequence iconic contemporary photographs are shown, and also in the film version of the same situations there are no big differences).
On the other hand, the relaxed passages from Hollywood, which are ironic and slightly exaggerated.
And then there are the scenes from the CIA headquarters and other institutions - men in suits at the meeting table, on the corridors, on the phone...
Ben Affleck has made a remarkable restart of his career with this film.
A scoffed at actor has become a respectable director, and even as an actor he is no longer the target of ironic remarks.
Argo is his third feature film after the thriller Kein Kinderspiel (Gone Baby Gone, 2007) and the thriller Stadt ohne Gnade (2010).
At the same time, it is Affleck ’ s first film that is not set in the director ’ s native Boston.
The sense for the atmosphere of the place was one of the characteristics that distinguished this director ’ s previous films from Hollywood ’ s standard.
Affleck proves this feeling also in Argo, where Tehran is "played" by Canada.
The best scenes of the film take place in the streets and show the reconstruction of events that have actually taken place - the opening sequence of the storming of the message is very impressive in its clarity, yet still conveys the feeling of confusion and unpredictability that occurs when the story moves somewhere.
Affleck and his team achieve a similar effect in fictional scenes (the false film staff on a bazaar in Tehran).
Too much action in too many places
The director also had to deal with the fact that the story does not actually offer many exciting scenes in the cinematic sense.
But he works quite successfully with the few, sometimes helping reality a little - which then does not always seem so elegant (the scenes, in which the impending crisis at the airport in Tehran is averted from a phone call in America, or the chase on the runway, seem somewhat artificial).
The weakness of Argo is its too broad dispersion, caused by the necessity of having to show too much in action in too many places.
Alan Arkin and John Goodman are very charming in their roles as Hollywood employees, but their characters deserve more space, and they are by no means alone in the film.
Affleck ’ s film loses some of its traction as a result. It is a film that one can follow with a certain interest, appreciating the design and the retro style reminiscent of a thriller from the 1970s.
However, it is difficult to arouse enthusiasm.
However, it is sufficient as a reminder of a piece of history that is still alive to this day and as a proof of how exaggerated the ideas of the omnipotent and omniscient secret services are.
Guidelines for inflating balloons, for bananas and for the circus
This year, the server www.bankovnipoplatky.com, which publishes an annual survey on the most absurd bank charges, has decided to organise the competition "Most absurd regulation or idea from the EU workshop".
"This is the idea behind the plan recently put forward by the EU to introduce a 40% quota for women in the management of large European companies," Patrik Nacher, who is in charge of organising this survey, told the newspaper Právo.
Among the absurdities nominated, for example, is the ruling by the European Court of Justice on the unification of insurance rates for men and women.
Until then, women enjoyed an advantage in life insurance because they objectively represent a lower risk for insurance companies.
"More incredible ideas from the EU workshop can be nominated by the end of this year.
The actual vote will then take place by the end of February 2013 ", informed Nacher.
Among the controversial EU regulations are the mandatory addition of bioethanol to fuels, which is damaging to nature as a result, the ban on reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain a relatively small amount of this hazardous substance, and the directive on the size of chicken cages, which made eggs significantly more expensive this year.
In the past, criticism has also been levelled at the de facto ban on the use of the term 'butter spread' or the ban on the sale of conventional light bulbs.
Bananas must be 14 cm long
The EU apparatus often decides under pressure from this or that trade and industry lobby, whose claims are usually represented in Brussels by one or more member countries (for example, the Czech Republic is currently attempting to use a veto threat to enforce the claims of Czech banks).
Lobby ’ s interests were also behind the fact that bananas of the highest trading class in the EU must be at least 14 cm long and must not exhibit any “curvature anomaly ”.
The European Commission defended itself with the argument that it merely harmonised the inconsistent national standards that would hinder trade.
The EU has already softened the standards for fruit and vegetables, in the face of opposition from some countries, by pointing out that the existing directives would result in a waste of food.
One candidate for the victory in this poll may be last year ’ s EU regulation, which, according to balloons, must be sold with a note stating that children under the age of eight may not inflate the balloon without adult supervision.
The EU cited an American study which, according to Luftballons, is the leading cause of the suffocation of children.
A similar restriction already applies to children up to the age of 14 when using fairground streams.
There are also strange ideas at home
Relatively absurd is also a directive that affects the European officials themselves - anyone who has an official function in the EU cannot use the name FYROM (Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia) because of the sensitivity of the subject for Greece.
The server Bankovnípoplatky.com nominated in cooperation with the association of liberal economists Laissez Faire apart from the above-mentioned absurdities also the EU regulation on the scope of food stocks in the territory of a member country.
The EU thus set the maximum volume of food stocks that was allowed to be on the territory of the Czech Republic on the day of our EU accession.
For example, the Czech Republic then exceeded the specified volume for canned mushrooms, for which we were threatened with a large fine.
The survey organizers were also impressed by the idea that certain countries should receive money for not having a sea, or by the idea of funding applications for grants.
These ideas did not come from Brussels, however, but from Prague.
"We are disadvantaged by having no sea.
We will apply to the EU for reimbursement, "said the then Minister of Agriculture, Jaroslav Palas (ČSSD), in autumn 2004.
As an argument, he pointed out that the grain harvest was very high and the state warehouses were overcrowded as a result of the so-called intervention purchases.
Since the Czech Republic has another route to seaports, according to Palas, the EU should pay us hundreds of millions of euros.
The European Commission finally went so far as to accommodate the Czech Republic by organising a call for tenders for the purchase of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea.
The Ministry of Regional Development, headed by Minister Pavel Němec (U.S. DEU), offered subsidies for applications for subsidies to the municipalities. Specifically, this should include funds for the preparation of subsidy applications to Brussels.
EU: Bizarre regulations are the exception
Although regulations may easily be the target of criticism in the Member States, the efforts of the EU to regulate and thus also to ensure the effectiveness and development of the European Union as a whole deserve more recognition, according to some experts.
A more serious problem, according to these experts, is rather EU funding for projects that have absolutely nothing in common with deepening European integration, but which have been forced by individual member states in the budget negotiations.
Emotions in this country are also aroused by the fact that, similar to other member countries, the Czech Republic has to fight in Brussels for the right to use specific names for traditional products and does not always win this battle.
After a six-year struggle with Germany and Austria, the Czech Republic was able to defend the name "Olomoucké tvarůžky", the Tuzemský rum, whose tradition here dates back to the 19th century, but our manufacturers had to rename it "Tuzemák".
The designation rum may only be used for products made from sugar cane distillate, not for products made from sugar beet.
In the official list of products registered in the EU, the world-famous feta and gorgonzola cheeses, Lübeck marzipan and Parma ham are now joined by Karlovy Vary rusk, Pohořelice and Třeboň carp, and Saas hops.
With an EU trademark, Pardubice gingerbread or Hořice rolls can boast.
“People want me to save the Republic, but I ’ m just an amateur, ” says Okamura.
Senator, how do you come up with the idea of running for President?
I do not want to be a senator or a president.
If everything worked smoothly in our country, I would not be standing for election anywhere.
But I can no longer see the republic being plundered for 20 years, thieves walking freely while people are being raised in taxes and retirement age.
I had no ambition to become a politician.
But when I see something I do not like, I try to propose a solution to change that.
And since I am already over 40, and independent and non-partisan, I have no other way of influencing things than to run for the office of senator or president.
You made it into the Senate and then made your way to the castle.
Are you not turning your back on your voters?
I have been telling myself all the time that I will take up the fight for the castle after the result of the Senate elections.
Later I clarified this and said that I would run for president if I were elected senator.
But my goal is not the function. The function is an instrument with which I can realize my visions.
For this I need as much influence as possible and a mandate that is as strong as possible.
The difficulty, however, is not only that we, as a people, grumble in the pub and in front of the television, but that we kill anyone who wants to make a difference.
Then there are the media, which want to rob you of your honour and confuse the freedom of the word with the freedom to lie.
It was said of me, for example, that I would bribe journalists or that I was an advisor to Jiří Paroubek.
Let ’ s talk about your visions.
You started the fight for the castle with the thesis of material and criminal liability of politicians as well as with retroactive property declarations of more than 20 million crowns.
To do this, you need to change laws.
As President, you have no competence in this respect, and only the Senate as a whole can bring forward legislative proposals.
How do you intend to solve this problem?
As an ordinary citizen, I have fought to ensure that the guide remains a free trade and this has been enforced.
The problem is petty-minded politics - if someone comes from the right or the left with a good proposal, it is deliberately rejected, and that only stops the population.
As an independent non-party, I have much greater potential to win support from all parties represented in Parliament.
My advantage is that, without pigeonholing and party dogma, I can take from any party what is best for our country.
Do you, as a person, see yourself more to the right or the left in politics?
From a Czech perspective, it seems to me that people tend to see me on the left.
For me, this is right and left thinking but completely unimportant.
For me, it is important that we move forward.
I am not interested in whether someone belongs to the left or the right; I want to connect people.
I always publicly support any good approach, even if it comes from the KSČM or the ODS, and I will also oppose bad ideas.
You dislike someone calling you a populist.
But do you not confirm what you have just said?
When you draw up a business plan in a company, you also have an ideal goal and a vision.
And this is what you want to approach.
This can be called populism, but all the proposals I have spoken about are already working in the world, or they have been discussed by important experts.
Without your support in Parliament, however, all that remains for you are slogans.
And you will not get very far in politics in the long term.
Or do you think that if you talk to people long enough, you will be able to enforce material and criminal liability, for example?
I have no other option.
To convince politicians, journalists and the public and try to get them on our side to achieve these goals.
As President, I would have no problem asking the leaders of the parliamentary parties, live on television, to legislate on material and criminal liability for politicians, civil servants, judges and prosecutors.
And the persons addressed would then have to say, if necessary, why they reject this.
A strong personality pointing out grievances can put pressure on the political scene.
Just take the direct election of the President, which was the result of public pressure.
I say clearly that I am an amateur; I am neither a genius nor an intellectual.
I try to find allies for my views and visions.
I have only just begun with politics and am trying to find the support of the majority for my programme.
I always try to judge things myself; and if it doesn't work, I will go back to the private sector in six years' time.
That sounds a little as if Okamura should save the Czech Republic.
I am not a savior.
I know that I do not achieve anything on my own, so I have talked to several well-known people about whether they also want to stand for the Senate.
For example, I spoke to Radim Jančura, who declined due to overwork.
I also supported the investigative journalist Jana Lorencová, who exposed the fraud in the trade in light heating oil.
I started my candidacy on the assumption that people are deeply dissatisfied, but now I am no longer sure.
Sixty per cent of those entitled to vote did not go to the elections at all, and those who did went mostly elected representatives of the establishment.
In the Senate, then, we are only two independents.
People have chosen such a senate composition that changes will be very difficult to enforce.
Nevertheless I will fight for my visions, e.g. for the direct election of the mayors and district governors.
Are you thinking about forming your own party?
I have not thought about this yet, because I do not have time to review the past of any potential party member, nor do I have the money for it.
I do not even have money for the presidential campaign; my transparent account is only CZK 20,000.
You have no money?
You talk about declarations of assets, what would your position be?
My personal wealth is estimated at about CZK 60 million.
In Prague, I have a piece of land worth 25 million, an apartment worth about 10 million, another for 8 million, an art collection worth about 10 million, an Aston Martin worth 3.5 million and a Škodu Superb worth about a million, and then I have a few million on my account.
By the way, the Aston Martin was a child's dream - I always liked James Bond driving in the car, being gallant to women and at the same time fighting against evil.
You drive an Aston Martin, have a fortune of 60 million and have no money for your campaign?
You say that you want to change the republic, but you do not want to invest your own money in it.
That is not very convincing.
I don ’ t have 15 million for the campaign.
Should I run into debt?
I have already invested 2.5 million in the campaign.
The fact that I don ’ t have any sponsors shows that my program probably doesn ’ t arouse much interest.
And I am not obliged to finance the campaign from my own resources.
The cost of the campaign is basically covered by my salary as a senator.
But I could not live on the salary of the senators alone; for example, I could not finance the English school for my son, which costs 30,000 per month.
If I just wanted to make money, I wouldn ’ t run for anything.
So do you continue to work as an entrepreneur to make a living?
Did you not say that you will reduce these activities?
But that has nothing to do with the level of salary.
As promised, I have partially scaled back my activities.
Thus e.g. my deputy becomes managing director of the travel agency in the spring.
People want to see me as the Samaritan who saves the republic.
But I have to live on something.
What monthly income were you used to as an entrepreneur?
Approximately 200,000 to 400,000, and that continues to be the case.
As President, however, I would stop my business altogether.
The full interview can be found in the Saturday edition of Právo.
The MVRDV architects prove that the real adventures are not only in the mind - the example of Spijkenisse and the recently built Bücherberg - 2 photos
“I find the building funny, it looks futuristic, and finally there ’ s something interesting to see again, ” says Lisette Verhaig, a passer-by by the roadside.
And Stefan Spermon, IT engineer at a large company nearby, says: "Yes, it's nice, the house."
But I wonder why we still need a library today.
They all have internet, iPad and e-books.
Nowadays, no one goes voluntarily to one of these old style libraries, right?
Spijkenisse, a dormitory town hardly in need of a visit at the gates of Rotterdam, is a strange record holder.
The 80,000 inhabitants of the municipality have the lowest education rate in the Netherlands.
In order to counteract this stupid circumstance, it was decided a few years ago to contribute to general education and to reconstruct the seven fictitious bridges depicted on the euro notes as beautifully brushed reinforced concrete miniatures.
The success of the education offensive was limited.
And so the city fathers realized that there was only one way to control the statistics: A library had to be created!
Winy Maas from the Rotterdam architectural firm MVRDV, master of daring bar charts and producer of funny, often cynical buildings, took the matter with the usual calmness and appeared at the 2003 Hearing competition with five books under his arm and a smile on his face.
And while the jury was still looking around in amazement and shrugging their shoulders, the cheeky Maas piled up his exquisite souvenirs in size to form a pyramid and ended his actionist speech with the words: "Dear city council!"
So this is my proposal for the Book Mountain of Spijkenisse, for the so-called Boekenberg!
Nine years later, the 30 million euro mountain has been piled up.
It is part of a revitalisation project that also includes underground parking, supermarket, post office and a few adjacent residential and terraced houses with a total of 50 apartments.
At the beginning of November, the Bücherberg was awarded the second prize "Best Library of NL 2012".
The project is also nominated for the Dutch National Wood Award 2012.
This means that the faceless small town gate, which until then had nothing more to offer than a post-modern pedestrian zone and a bewilderingly ugly town hall, behind whose white facades one would be inclined to assume a dairy factory, is enriched by a piece of contemporary architecture.
Above all, Spijkenisse now has the first public cultural building in the history of its existence.
The long way to the book
The first impression: Book Eldorado under cheese bell.
There is a lift that runs through the middle of the mountain massif, but the true joy of space and reading is revealed by climbing the topography on foot.
The all-round glazed interior is bright and clear, the burnt brick floor and the elegant street lamps speak unmistakably the language of a public town square.
The urban ambience is perfect.
One is already looking out for park bench, dog and football playing boys and girls.
And everywhere books, books, books.
“Usually the bookshelves are located along the façade, and in the middle there is a large, dark room, which is usually uncomfortable and impersonal, ” says Winy Maas.
We turned the classic room configuration upside down and turned the reading area inside out.
The interior of the Bücherberg is cleverly used: in the middle there are offices, the Internet ’ s library, chess club, environmental centre and building services centre.
A special joy are the black bookshelves, which are sometimes wall covering, sometimes parapet, sometimes stair railings.
Optics, feel and smell are foreign.
Even die-hard architects and civil engineers shake their heads over the unknown building material.
"We wanted to work with recycling materials here," explains Joop Trouborst, project manager at Spijkenisse Municipality, upon request from Standard.
And so one day, in a farm in Friesland, we came across a suitable waste product from agriculture.
In the Netherlands, a thin plastic fleece has been used as a root base in greenhouses and on fields for many years.
This is cheap and time efficient.
The thin textile lasts one or two seasons, after which it is ripe for bulky waste.
For the library, the fleece - for the first time in these quantities - was pressed into plates four centimetres thick.
Under the influence of heat and pressure, the so-called Landbouwplastic (KLP) turns into a dark, homogeneous, durable material that smells a bit like new cars and a bit like sports shoes.
After 105 steps you have reached the top.
At the end of the almost 500-metre-long hike, the Literaturcafé will reward you not only with a fantastic view of the city, but also with Dutch croquettes and potted ficus trees.
They provide the atmosphere, but above all the right humidity in the literary mountains.
Donations for the new soul
“You wouldn ’ t believe it, but this house is a model project in terms of ecology, despite the many glass surfaces, ” says Trouborst.
It is heated and cooled with geothermal energy.
Although the Bücherberg is under a glass lintel, the sun shines only briefly into the interior even on sunny days.
The broad glulam beams, which are perpendicular to the glass façade, serve as shading and absorb a large part of the solar radiation.
The indoor climate is very pleasant.
The rest is done by fully automatic roller blinds.
Stefan Spermon, the initial skeptic in the IT industry, has already ventured into the new library.
Lisette Verhaig was also there.
And also TCM ’ s teacher Cynthia Bogarde, who even calls the Boekenberg Spijkenisses “long overdue soul ”.
The reason: For the opening a few weeks ago, each resident was invited to donate a book from his personal collection.
This will initially fill the optical gaps in the library, which is not yet fully stocked - currently 70,000 pieces.
The concept worked.
The shelves are filled up to the top.
"Nothing is worse than a half-empty library," says architect Winy Maas.
"I think that now, thanks to our invitation, every resident has a certain relationship with this new house.
Everyone knows that his book is part of this building.
And if it is only for decoration.
Thus MVRDV succeeded in the supreme discipline, which one calls in the technical jargon identity endowment.
Spijkenisse has written literary history.
As young and uneducated as it may be.
This is finally a starting point for identity.
Szabo: "Germans must play a greater role"
Germany abstained in the vote on the admission of Palestine.
According to Stephen Szabo, an expert on US and European relations, Berlin is balancing on a narrow diplomatic level.
Deutsche Welle: At the beginning of the week, Germany first signalled that it would vote against the application for Palestinian observer status at the United Nations.
But then Berlin abstained.
Why?
Stephen Szabo: Germany does not support what the Israelis have done in Gaza.
Now, however, Germany must be cautious, owing to its special relationship with Israel.
At the same time, however, I do not believe that it supports the American position.
Germany wanted to demonstrate its independence - but without being too critical of Israel.
During the uprising in Libya in March 2011, Germany also abstained when it came to establishing a no-fly zone.
This was finally enforced by NATO.
Is it difficult for Germany to adopt a clear position on important international issues?
Yes, that is true.
This is because it is changing its foreign policy, moving away from a policy that was, so to speak, managed by the USA towards a German foreign policy.
Making matters worse, Europeans lack a coherent and coherent policy.
So the Germans find themselves between the fronts.
They are expected to play a more independent role, but they are not used to it.
I believe they are still trying to play their role, but they are on the way to a more 'normal' foreign policy.
A foreign policy like that of France or Great Britain.
What does a "normal" foreign policy actually mean from a German perspective?
It shows a willingness to take positions on national interests that are independent of those of the USA or European partners.
I believe that German foreign policy is motivated by economic policy, in other words by exports and its relations with certain regions, such as Russia, China or the Middle East.
Germany ’ s economic interests are to some extent different from those of the other major powers, and so Germany must protect its interests.
Have these economic interests influenced the stance in the Middle East conflict and the vote in the UN?
On the one hand, Germany has large sales markets in the Middle East, especially in the Gulf States.
Therefore, it must be careful not to offend the public, but also the elites, in the Arab countries.
That certainly matters.
But I would not want to attach too much importance to that either, that is not a completely one-sided relationship.
But it certainly plays an important role in German considerations.
Has Germany damaged its relations with the US by abstaining on important decisions, such as the vote on Palestine?
I believe there is a great deal of understanding in Europe and even in the USA for the German position.
That is why I do not believe that this was such a dramatic rupture as on the Libyan issue.
Perhaps Germany will even win some respect for itself.
After all, it signals that, as an international player, it must be taken seriously and its interests taken into account.
There are different views in Europe on the Palestinian initiative.
The US, on the other hand, has spoken out clearly in favour of a veto.
Are there differences of opinion between the US and many European nations?
Because of American domestic politics, these differences have always existed.
I believe that the Obama administration has a good deal of secretive sympathy for the European position.
But due to the political situation here, the government cannot publicly represent this position, of course.
I believe that the real differences of opinion are not as great as they always appear.
If you look at the relationship between Obama and Prime Minister Netanyahu, Obama is not all that enthusiastic about Netanyahu ’ s policies.
Is Germany finding it difficult to reconcile its close relations with Israel and the US on the one hand and the position of the EU ’ s most important partners on the other?
I think that is what makes it so difficult for the Germans.
It would, of course, be a little easier for the Germans if there were a coherent and unified European policy, which is not the case at present.
So they cannot be part of a broader line and must instead push things from their own position.
That is what they are doing with the euro.
I believe that in future, Germany will play a leading role in pushing Europe towards a European position.
Of course, this is not easy for Germany, if only because of its relationship with Israel.
This has always been a sensitive issue.
But I believe that the Germans understand that they must play a more independent role.
Does Germany see itself in the role of an important international player? Does Germany even want to play a leading role?
Or is Germany still finding it difficult to lead?
Germany is not yet used to it, it is still unpleasant and, for obvious reasons, it still finds it difficult to play a greater role.
If we look, for example, at the euro crisis, every time Germany assumes a greater role, various anti-German feelings become free.
That does not make it easy for the Germans.
That's the old problem: you don't want to be surrounded by hostile countries.
In this sense, Germany is in a much more difficult position than the US.
It has to be receptive to different neighbours and opinions and that is not easy.
Now the influence of the USA in European politics is steadily diminishing, but the EU is not filling this vacuum at the moment; who else is left?
The Germans will simply have to play a greater role.
Even if they don't like it, it is unpleasant and makes them even more unpopular - c'est la vie!

"Trademark Protection" in China: When Puma and Armani suddenly become Chinese
Armani is a world-famous brand, Polo Ralph Lauren also.
But what is Armani Polo?
This is an officially registered name in China, but it has nothing to do with the original companies.
Nevertheless it enjoys as long protection, as the actual name-givers do not complain.
Even then, it is not clear whether they will be proved right.
“It is becoming increasingly difficult for foreigners to protect their trademarks in China, ” says Thomas Pattloch, attorney at Taylor Wessing law firm, which specializes in infringements of trademark rights in the Far East.
Every week a new case lands on my desk.
For the imitators, a few additional letters are enough to allow them to register their trademarks.
Thus, Gucci is simply Lu ’ Gucci, instead of Prada Prada let Prada ’ Kny register.
German companies, such as the sports goods manufacturer Puma, are also legally copied in this way.
Pattloch opens a folder with entries from the trademark office in Beijing.
On September 14, 2010, a Chinese company protected the trademark Zegna DF Puma, an art name that was also used by the fashion house Ermenegildo Zegna.
It is well known that the Chinese are world champions in copying and in injured intellectual property.
In the big cities there are multi-storey department stores that sell almost exclusively counterfeit goods.
But Pattloch ’ s cases are different: On behalf of his clients, he takes action against the fact that Chinese companies are officially granted the right by the Trademark Office to use a name that is already protected elsewhere.
The Chinese call it "Bang Mingpai", a co-driver brand.
The word is based on "Bang Dakuan".
This means women fishing for rich men.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt
"That is damaging to business, you have to fight it," demands Pattloch.
"The brand is watered down, the unique position disappears, the image damage is enormous."
The financial losses and the litigation costs of the affected industries are in the millions, especially in the case of expensive flagship products.
According to the market research company CLSA, China is the third largest and fastest growing market for luxury goods with a volume of 15 billion euros per year.
But deletions of dubious entries in the trademark register are difficult to achieve and go into the money.
The procedure may take up to nine years, with an uncertain outcome.
Pattloch reports of cases in which the court dismissed complaints because, after the long duration, the name complained of had become "market reality".
If the plaintiff is unlucky, he will even have to pay money to the plagiarist because he violated his trademark in China, says Pattloch.
Sometimes the law of the jungle rules here.
Famous cases also involve graphic elements.
In 2009, Daimler lost a dispute with the construction equipment manufacturer Sany, the company that recently took over the German concrete pump manufacturer Putzmeister.
The Chinese are therefore allowed to use an emblem, similar to the Mercedes Star.
Volvo buy-in Geely originally used a blue-and-white logo reminiscent of BMW; the dispute was settled, Geely had to change it.
The fashion manufacturer Lacoste lost in China to imitators from Hong Kong and Singapore, who let the famous crocodile look the other way.
The Chinese authorities are not aware of any guilt.
The trademark office CTMO in Beijing admits that there were bottlenecks in 2010 due to insufficient staffing and space.
In the past year however one had returned from the emergency situation in the operational sequence to normality ".
Thus the existence of unworked opposition proceedings had fallen by 22 per cent.
Almost 57,000 such cases have been closed, 75% more than in the previous year.
Nevertheless, the Office is still awaiting the settlement of 81,500 oppositions.
Addressing this costs a lot
As is often the case in China, the figures are impressive.
Last year, the CTMO received more than 1.4 million trademark applications, almost a third more than in 2010.
According to the agency, this is a record and means that China leads the list of new registrations for the tenth time in a row all over the world.
This also applies to the stock of all valid trademarks, a total of 5.5 million pieces.
In 2011, 1.8 billion yuan in fees were collected.
Simply put, each registration costs an average of 1280 yuan or 160 euros.
Addressing this problem costs many times as much, as the case of the German family business Freudenberg shows.
For more than seven years, the company has been fighting against a Chinese plagiarist.
It is true that the Germans succeeded in removing its illegal manufacture of imitation car parts.
But the imitator continued to secure the Chinese rights to the Freudenberg brand.
Hanno Wentzler, Chairman of the Management Board of Freudenberg Chemical Specialities in Munich, said that this had been neglected because family names could not be protected in Germany.
The trademark office CTMO rejected the objection of the Munich company.
In the next two instances Freudenberg was right, but the opponent is still fighting today.
You have to watch out hellishly
Now the matter is before the Supreme Court.
Wentzler is confident to bring the matter to a good conclusion, and praises the professionalism of the courts.
But he also says: "The procedure is extremely complex and costs us a lot of time, money and nerves."
The internal costs could hardly be quantified, the company archive had to look through even one hundred years old files in order to produce evidence.
Five years ago, Freudenberg offered the other side a "high six-figure euro amount" for settlement.
"You can see how much this is worth to us," says Wentzler.
The dangers in the Far East are even threatening to slosh back into Europe.
That is when imitators secure unprotected trademarks.
A Chinese manufacturer wanted to register the designation Freudenberg for shoes and leather in Germany.
The Group has long since given up this business field, but nevertheless was able to avert registration.
"You have to be infernal," says Wentzler.
Both he and lawyer Pattloch advise German companies to be very careful when doing business with China.
It is not enough to rely on international trademark rights, but foreigners should "apply for everything that is somehow worth protecting in China", as Wentzler says.
Otherwise it can be much more expensive than registration.
Indeed: If Freudenberg is subject to the last act of his brand drama, then you would probably have to pay the opposite side royalties for your own name, explains Wentzler.
Or we are forced out of the market in the segment in question.
World AIDS Day: stomping, singing, helping
In Heidelberg the choir Imbongi rehearses - and in Swaziland AIDS orphans are happy about it.
The story of a connection that exceeds far more than 8,733 kilometers.
First there is the stomping: cowboy boots, basketball shoes, ladies' pumps and men's slippers look for the beat on the parquet floor, find it quickly.
There are two or three or four.
Only then do the voices of the singers slowly swell - alto, bass, tenor and soprano - harass, beguile and pursue each other.
And Fiete Hopf, the 29-year-old conductor, almost lifts it out of his cloth shoes when he brings them together with his supple, wild gestures.
It is Monday evening, in the music room of the Institute for Medical Psychology in Heidelberg, the choir Imbongi rehearses a new song.
Approximately fifty singers came, between 23 and 69 years old, from the human geneticist to the houseman.
"Om'Obani" is not a simple piece, every choir voice has a different text and this also in a very foreign language: Zulu, which is spoken by eleven million people in South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique and in parts of Swaziland.
Helping people to help themselves
According to estimates by Unaids, the United Nations programme to combat AIDS, there are around 34 million people infected with HIV worldwide.
23.5 million people live in southern Africa.
There are 245,000 AIDS orphans living in Swaziland.
More than 40 percent of the population is now HIV positive.
The association Voices for Africa has found sponsors in Germany for 180 AIDS orphans in the village of Esitjeni.
70 of them attend secondary school.
For 15 or 20 euros a month you can take on a sponsorship.
She guarantees the child school fees, school uniform and a hot meal daily at the Gogo behandlung Center.
Imbongi in Zulu means storyteller or praise giver.
Nobody in this room can speak the Bantu language fluently, but they can sing.
For almost ten years, the choir has been practicing songs in this foreign, soft language and from time to time also bringing them back to where they originally came from: to the South of Africa.
For 8 733 kilometres as the crow flies from Heidelberg, in the northwest of the Kingdom of Swaziland, there is the village of Esitjeni, which depends on the vocal power of the German choir.
Forty Percent Are Infected
About 2000 people live there, some of them in simple mud and straw huts, the majority of whom are children.
More than 300 of them have no parents because they have succumbed to the HI virus.
In Esitjeni, Swaziland suffers from the highest HIV infection rate and the lowest life expectancy worldwide, according to UNICEF.
Circumcisions of the male foreskin, which have been shown to reduce the risk of infection by half, are hardly accepted by the population.
More than forty per cent of the people in Swaziland carry the immunodeficiency “virus, to die with middle thirties is not rare.
During a joint trip to Africa in the spring of 2005, the choir discovered the village, but above all, the imbongis saw many children on the streets, who were not only lacking parental care, but simply everything: food, clothing, education.
Without a school leaving certificate, there is no chance in a poor country.
Initially it was the private commitment of individuals to send a child to school for a few euros a year and to allow him a warm meal a day.
But only one year later the choir founded the association "Voices for Africa", which takes care of the AIDS orphans in Esitjeni almost professionally.
Facts on Sexually Transmitted Infections
What are the main sexually transmitted diseases?
Bacterial STIs include syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea.
Common viral STIs are HIV, human pappiloma viruses, genital herpes or hepatitis.
Felt lice and scabies are parasitic STIs.
Who are the main stakeholders?
Syphilis and gonorrhea occur mainly in men who have sex with men.
According to the German Institute for Medical Research, at least four out of five cases of syphilis reported in Germany are transmitted through sexual contact between men.
In heterosexual adults, chlamydia are sexually transmitted infections, trichomonads, candidiasis (fungi), gonorrhea and human pappiloma viruses.
The prevalence of HIV among heterosexual adults in Germany is comparatively low - nevertheless, around 20 percent of new HIV infections are attributable to this group.
Chlamydia infection is much more common in adolescents than in other population groups.
According to European surveys, three-quarters of all infections affect young people aged 15-25.
In Germany, human pappiloma viruses are also common among adolescents.
How has the number of infections developed?
Not all sexually transmitted diseases are reportable.
The number of syphilis cases has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 to 3,698 cases in 2011, according to Robert Koch ’ s Institute.
The number of new HIV infections has declined since 2007.
In 2011, there were around 2,700 cases.
That is about a tenth less than the year before.
Which symptoms indicate venereal disease?
Infectious diseases can cause ulcers in the genital area, discomfort with urination, discharge, lower abdominal pain as well as blisters or warts.
However, they often cause no pain or other symptoms and therefore go unnoticed.
How to protect yourself?
Condoms can reduce the risk of contagion, but do not provide 100% protection.
In some cases, pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be transmitted through smear infections and close physical contact.
Therefore, experts recommend regular examinations, especially for frequently changing sex partners.
If diagnosed early, most STIs can be cured and long-term consequences avoided.
Through sponsorships, donations and not least the fees that the choir sings all over Germany, a lot comes together.
"In total, we have already sent around 200,000 euros to Esitjeni," says Annette Lennartz, the association's chairman.
In the village itself, Zodwa Dlamini, a confident and assertive woman, manages the funds from Germany.
She also takes care that the orphans are well accommodated, for example with one of the grandmothers.
The Gogos, as the old women in Zulu are called, are the pillars of the village.
Some of them have taken in up to 14 orphans, give them a roof over their heads and ensure that the children appear in their uniforms every day in time for school lessons.
Those who have no one left come to the shelter of Khanyisile, a single woman who is paid by the club just like the two cooks who cook for more than 200 hungry children every day.
In addition, "Voices for Africa" has set up a sewing school, built two chicken houses, and organized, together with the American health organization PSI, that many in the village have undergone an HIV test.
This is not to be taken for granted, because as obvious as the disease is throughout the country, it is best to keep silent.
A king with 14 wives
"AIDS is an absolute taboo," says Annette Lennartz, "because it has to do with sexuality."
Actually strange in a country where the king officially has 14 wives.
The last absolute monarch of sub-Saharan Africa, King Mswati III, is known for his excessive lifestyle.
Polygamy instead of democracy.
Among other things, it is also due to this state-sanctioned way of life that the HIV virus has spread so rapidly in recent decades.
But also the many migrant workers who carry the virus through the country.
There are free condoms on every corner, says Annette Lennartz, "but they are rarely used.
The culture is different - flesh to flesh. "
In order to promote cultural exchange, the Imbongi ’ choir travels together every two or three years through southern Africa, singing songs full of melancholy, fighting spirit, confidence and black self-confidence that many people on the southern tip of the black continent still know from the times of apartheid.
A bus full of whites singing songs in a black language - so much recognition not only brings moods and joy, but has also washed away some tears from some fierce border guards.
The journey always leads to Esitjeni, where the singers visit their godchildren.
Even if the small village can hardly be found on maps, it is more than well known in the valley of the Ezulweni River.
"Go to Esitjeni, there is the light," say the people there.
And when you return to Heidelberg the 8733 kilometres as the crow flies, to the stomping singers in the rehearsal room on Bergheimer Straße, then you can see it shining there too.
Messenger: NASA discovers ice on Mercury
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is ice on the planet Mercury.
The ice cover may be up to 20 metres thick.
The US space agency NASA has proven the existence of ice on the planet Mercury.
Although it is closest to the sun, there is also frozen water, as three studies published on Thursday in the journal "Science" show.
The Messenger probe has found evidence that there is an ice sheet in the permanently shadowy region of the planet.
This should be at least 30 centimeters and possibly even up to 20 meters thick.
The water probably came from comets, or possibly asteroids, which have impacted Mercury.
No one links the discovery of ice to the existence of life on the planet, said Messenger chief scientist Sean Solomon.
The temperature on Mercury can reach up to 426 degrees Celsius.
However, the finds could help to clarify how water and other building blocks of life have reached other regions of the solar system.
Unnoticed by terrestrial citizens, probes, telescopes, and small robots like Phoenix are exploring the depths of space.
From time to time they send pictures to Earth: small peepholes in infinite widths.
The image comes from a camera developed by German researchers at the Max-Planck-Institut.
The eight planets of our solar system, as well as the dwarf planet Ceres.
Like Pluto, which orbits the Sun behind Neptune, Ceres is not a "planet" according to the new definition of the International Astronomical Union of 2006.
This fragment of an infrared image taken by the telescope shows a "family portrait" of countless generations of stars: The oldest stars are visible as blue dots, the pink "newborns" in the Circular Room are harder to identify.
This star-forming region, called by scientists unromantically W5, has discovered the Spitzer telescope in the Cassiopeia constellation, at a distance of 6,500 light-years.
This iridescent glow of a dying star was captured by NASA ’ s Spitzer ’ s telescope.
The doughnut-shaped ring consists of material that the star ejected during the dying process.
In the giant Trifid nebula, 5400 light years from Earth, new stars are formed from gas and dust.
This photo of the galactic nursery was taken by Nasa ’ s telescope.
The Pleiades' star cluster, also called "The Seven Sisters", can be seen with the naked eye at night.
With the telescope, however, the colors come to better advantage.
Like a red age, the Helix ’ nebula on this infrared photograph looks at the viewer.
It is located 700 light years away in the constellation of Aquarius.
Its resemblance to an earthly continent earned this nebula the title of North America.
A combination of normal and infrared photography provides the spectacular color scheme.
This baby star in its full beauty could only be recorded by the infrared detectors of the Spitzer behandlung telescope.
Saturn and its rings: How these formed is one of the great mysteries of astronomy.
They may be the remains of a Saturn ’ s moon that disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago.
One of the largest and sharpest images from Hubble ’ s telescope: The Whirlpool ’ s galaxy
Depending on the colour, images of spiral galaxies become true works of art.
The image, published by the European Southern Observatory, shows the Trifid, a nebula in the Sagittarius constellation, several thousand light years away.
The name Trifid comes from the Latin word trifidus (tripartite, tripartite), because dark dust strips tripartite the glowing heart of the stars, the birthplace.
Astronomers have photographed the harbingers of a cosmic collision in the constellation of Serpentine: 400 million light years away from Earth, the nuclei of two merging galaxies race towards each other and will inevitably collide.
The Hubble ’ s telescope in the spiral galaxy M83 recorded the birth of these stars.
Those who do not like technical abbreviations may call them by their nickname Southern Fire Wheel.
The image of the Hubble Space Telescope shows a section of the Iris Nebula in the constellation of Kepheus.
The fog, which is 1400 light-years away, consists of dust grains that are ten to one hundred times smaller than ordinary house dust.
This image was compiled from optical and X-ray images from different telescopes.
It shows a ring of black holes, 430 million light years from Earth.
This group of galaxies, called Arp 273, was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope for NASA.
Scientists call the larger spiral galaxy UGC 1810.
In this nebula is the brightest group of young stars of our Milky Way.
The Sternenwiege always produces new youngsters.
These stars, too, are connected to the rosette, the nebula, and constantly produce new baby stars - 5000 light years from Earth.
In this bright glowing galaxy with a small black hole no dust exists, but only gas.
Researchers assume that it was formed only shortly after the Big Bang, when hydrogen was predominantly found in the universe.
Our Insights into Space: The Most Important Telescopes
The telescope is said to have been invented by Hans Lipperhey in 1608 - even before Galileo Galilei used it for stargazing a year later.
Since then, the mirrors of the optical telescopes have become ever larger - and the insights they provide are ever deeper.
For 30 years, from 1947 to 1975, the Hale ’ s telescope at the Palomar ’ s observatory near San Diego was the largest telescope in the world.
The mirror, in this picture, had a diameter of five meters.
The Large Binocular Telescope is located in Arizona, USA.
It allows views into space via two mirrors, each with a diameter of 8.4 meters.
The interior of the Gran Telescopio Canaria on the Canary Island La Palma is huge - the mirror alone is 10.4 meters in diameter.
The mirror of the Southern African Large Telescope in South Africa is segmented - to save costs.
Nevertheless, it reaches a diameter of about eleven meters.
Disadvantage of the favourable design: The telescope is secured in its height angle - and thus limited in its mobility.
Also the hobby "Eberly" telescope in Texas is fixed in the altitude angle.
Its special feature: the high light-gathering power.
This reaches - despite a comparatively small mirror diameter - to the world's largest mirror telescopes.
With the help of a radio telescope in Arecibo (Puerto Rico), researchers are listening to space for extraterrestrial signals.
The radio telescope has a diameter of 305 metres.
With the "Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence" (SETI), every computer owner can help by providing computing power.
View of the observatory of the European Observatory (ESO) in the Chilean Andes.
This is where the Very Large Telescope stands - a telescope that lives up to its name.
With its total of four mirrors, the telescope can also illuminate the middle infrared spectrum.
The European Extremely Large Telescope is also being planned at the ESO in Chile.
Its main mirror should cover a full 42 meters - and be put together from scarcely 1000 mirror elements.
But we expect pictures in 2018 at the earliest.
Until 2007, the two Keck telescopes on the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Kea were considered the largest in the world.
They offer two mirrors with a diameter of ten meters each.
Keck ’ s telescopes are part of Mauna ’ s Kea ’ Observatory, which also looks into the sky with the Subaru ’ telescope and the IRTTF.
Also on the Mauna Kea, a new, huge telescope is to be built - with a mirror, a diameter of thirty metres.
Here it can be admired on an illustration.
The most important impressions from space, however, are provided by the Hubble Space Telescope.
Since April 24, 1990, it has been delivering images of distant worlds.
Since March 2009, the Kepler Space Telescope has been searching for extrasolar planets - primarily those that are habitable.
On February 2, 2011 NASA announced that 1235 planetary candidates had been identified since the start of the mission.
The last preparations for launch at the Kepler Space Telescope are documented in the image.
The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will be launched aboard an Ariane5 rocket in 2018 at the earliest.
The primary mirror of the space infrared telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres.
One of the tasks of the telescope is to search for light from the first stars and galaxies after the Big Bang.
Scientists assume that ice also exists at the south pole of Mercury.
However, there is no reliable data, since the messenger orbits far closer to the north pole around the planet.
Radar measurements have indicated for decades that there is ice on Mercury.
With the launch of the Messenger in 2004 - the first probe to orbit Mercury - the scientists now have certainty.
Drinking butter every day - and living to the age of 168
In the south of Azerbaijan many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for clues in the country where 97 year olds are still comparatively young.
In the south of Azerbaijan many people reach a biblically old age.
There is even a museum for longevity.
A search for clues in the country where 97 year olds are still comparatively young.
The ride through the Talysh Mountains can be called wildly romantic.
The minibus rumbles along the winding road, past densely wooded hills, tearing rivers and simple farmhouses.
Everything is green and juicy, you might think you are in the Black Forest.
But this is the deepest south of Azerbaijan, the border with Iran is only a few kilometers away.
The Caucasian Talysh people live here, of whom not much is known, except that they speak Persian and Azeri perfectly and are very durable.
The last stop is Lerik.
The small town boasts too bulky architecture from Soviet times, which does not want to fit into the picturesque mountain landscape.
Tourists from Europe hardly come here, the journey from Azerbaijan's capital Baku is too arduous.
For the 323 kilometers you need eight hours, because the road is only one lane.
The fabulous wealth that the country owes to its oil in the Caspian Sea has not yet arrived here in the province.
But Pilata Fatulayeva (48) is convinced that Lerik has what it takes to be a tourist attraction.
"Baku became famous in May with the Eurovision Song Festival - and next year we have here a festival of the oldest people in the world," says Fatulayeva.
She is the director of the Museum of Longevity, probably the only one in the world.
Here is documented the vita of about eight dozen Talysh from the area, which is older than 100. Fatulayeva points to a black and white photo.
This is my grandfather, he was 120 years old.
A child conceived at the age of 136
But the controversial star of the museum is the shepherd Şirali Müslümov, who is said to have turned 168 years old.
However, there is no birth certificate.
And, with the oldest person documented to be 122 years old, Mussulov ’ s age seems highly dubious.
"He was born here in 1805 and died in 1973," explains Fatulayeva.
The man was married three times and had 23 children, at the age of 136 he is said to have fathered another daughter.
Did Şirali Müslümov miscalculate his age by a few decades?
But also Rembrandt Scholz, senior researcher at the Max Planck Institute in Rostock, has heard of the elderly in Central Asia.
"There are also noticeably many very old people in some areas of China, in Japan or in the Hunza valley in Pakistan", says Scholz, "also in Sardinia live extremely many very old men".
Due to the lack of documents, however, there was no scientific proof of age, particularly as there was no civil status register.
Butter melted every day
The fact is, however, that the people of the region around Lerik strikingly often attain a biblical age.
There are currently 20 people over the age of 100.
So why do so many elderly people live here in the south?
The Azerbaijani travel guide Farid Mugimzadeh explains this with the special genes of the Talysh.
Museum director Fatulayeva, on the other hand, believes that it is diet.
But the fact that the high-calorie diet of the Talysh people, who love meat, bread and above all dairy products and many of whom drink a glass of melted butter every day, does not seem plausible from a nutritional point of view.
Or is it the original way of life that keeps people young? Rubaba Mirzayeva lives in Cengemiran, a tiny settlement not far from the town of Lerik.
With its 97 years it is still comparatively young for these latitudes.
Mirzayeva, who claims to have 143 descendants, lives in a simple wooden house, typical of the entire Caucasus region.
She sits on the floor with a butter bowl, which she untiringly rolls back and forth.
Eight people live here under one roof, including one of Mirzayeva ’ s sons and a daughter, both of whom have long been grandparents.
Also two toddlers jump around.
In the kitchen, tea is prepared for guests and served in the typical, belly shaped Armadu ’ s glassware.
Mirzayeva's white teeth stand perfectly in rank and file, under her headscarf she hides long, dark blonde braids, which her son proudly reveals before us.
I always washed my hair with milk, so they never ran out and kept their color.
"I never used shampoo either," says Mirzayeva.
Monthly pension is enough to live
She has only ever eaten what came from her own farm, tomatoes, potatoes, peas.
All my life I never bought food at the supermarket.
Then she talks about her husband, who was in the army.
It was worst in the aftermath of World War II.
But everything got better when the "beloved father" Heydar Aliyev took over the helm.
The propaganda sounds strange from the mouth of an old woman.
But the cult driven around the father-figure of the nation, who ruled his country like a dictator, knows few borders in Azerbaijan.
He was in power until 2003, when his son Ilham took over.
After all, there is no need among Azerbaijan ’ s elders.
230 Manat (about the same sum in euros), Mirzayeva receives a monthly pension, for local conditions an amount of which you can live well.
And perhaps Mirzayeva's son, who has long been grizzled, is also right: "The elderly are held in high esteem in our culture."
They live in the middle of the extended family, are loved, cared for and are happy.
If that's no reason to stay alive as long as possible
The word "human right" is missing in the Constitution
The revolution has returned to Cairo.
Rival rallies in Cairo reveal the deep division of the country.
The future constitution with the Sharia as basis is strongly disputed.
The Egyptian president did not spare with pathos.
We must make the transition.
"And it is my responsibility to succeed, before the people and before God," he said on state television.
His speech was addressed to the entire people, but above all to the Christian Copts, the liberals, enlightened Muslims and secular people.
All of them, hopelessly divided in a confused opposition, are afraid.
Fear of a theocracy on the Nile by grace of the powerful Muslim Brotherhood.
Mohamed Morsi said almost apologetically that he had temporarily curtailed the powers of the Constitutional Court and had increased his powers "in order to save the revolution".
But the world is not fully aware of what the 61-year-old engineer, who holds a doctorate from the American University of Southern California, really wants to save.
Should the judiciary be disempowered?
Indeed, the 234 articles flogged by the Islamist-dominated 100-member Constituent Assembly in a nocturnal, 15-hour parade are partly worrisome.
As in previous constitutions, the draft also states that the jurisprudence is based on the "principles of Islamic law".
But what does "principles" mean?
This was and is a matter of interpretation and it is to be feared that the Islamists will use the vague wording and the accompanying legal scope for a stricter interpretation of the Sharia.
This suggests at least one new article: In all matters concerning the Sharia, the Al-Ashar University, the country ’ s most important Islamic institution, must be consulted with great influence throughout Sunni Islam.
This does not have to be done, but it can mean that the clergy oversees the legislation, which would de facto result in the incapacitation of the judiciary.
Much of the draft Constitution is a matter of interpretation
Another problem is that the civil military jurisdiction is to be maintained.
These courts served to suppress opposition figures during Mubarak ’ s rule.
After the fall of the dictator, up to 11,000 civilians were held in military custody.
The state should also, according to the draft, "protect the true nature of the Egyptian family and promote its morality and values".
This is so vaguely formulated in legal terms that state institutions could even use this article to control the contents of film art and literature.
To put it plainly, this means nothing other than censorship.
Moreover, no article expressly establishes equality between men and women.
In return, someone else forbids insulting or slandering the Prophet Muhammad and his messengers.
But what is an insult and how it should be punished remains unclear.
Equally dubious is the formulation that "insulting people" is forbidden.
Is a caricature of the President or a joke at the expense of a lawyer enough?
A matter of interpretation, as so much in the draft, which Morsi has to sign and which, in his words, will be presented to the Egyptians for a referendum "very soon".
"The Revolution Has Returned"
The opposition has been forming for weeks against the superiority of the Islamists.
Tens of thousands gathered in unaccustomed harmony in Cairo ’ s Tahrir Square on Friday evening, vowing to topple the Charter before it can enter into force.
"The revolution has returned and we will win," said Hamdin Sabbahi, third in the presidential elections.
Nobel Peace Prize laureate and former head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mohamed El ’ Baradei, said that the draft constitution belonged “on the rubbish heap of history ”.
Via Twitter, he accused Morsi ’ s supporters of waging a “coup against democracy. ”
"If he calls the referendum, we will go to his palace and overthrow him," said opposition leader Jasser Said.
"We are not yet tired, the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for," the Egyptian media quoted the opposition politician Khaled Ali.
And several judges announced that they did not want to monitor the referendum, which would render it invalid.
"The Koran is our Constitution"
The well-organized Muslim Brotherhood for its part blew a counter-demonstration, but as a precaution not on Tahrir ’ s Square, but after a mass prayer on the other bank of the Nile in front of Cairo University.
Many veiled Salafist women and adherents participated and shouted, "The people demand the application of God's law."
They demanded from Morsi, "Clean the land!" and affirmed, "The Koran is our constitution."
A battle for sovereignty over symbolic Tahrir, where everything began, would likely have created a civil war-like state.
Obviously, Morsi ’ s supporters did not want to risk that.
The Muslim Brotherhood declared that both the opponents of the draft constitution and the supporters had expressed themselves loudly and clearly.
Now is the time to let the people decide at the ballot box in which direction the country should go.
A majority in favour of the Islamists ’ draft is considered certain.
"The word human rights does not even occur"
Hafez Abu Saeda is outraged by this forced constitutional process, which was supposed to run until February and involve all social forces.
The 48-year-old human rights lawyer and head of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) defended the Muslim Brotherhood while they were in prison or on trial under Mubarak.
Not because he would share their worldview, but because for him human rights are indivisible.
For this he was beaten, convicted and imprisoned.
"And now the word human rights is not even in the new constitution", he complains in conversation with the "Welt am Sonntag".
Morsi ’ s extension of power to all three powers in the state caused the lawyer to resign.
These measures are blatant violations of democratic rules and will lead Egypt into a new dictatorship.
"Instead of strengthening civil society, the President has de facto suspended it," complains Saeda.
But democracy cannot function without civil society organizations.
Saeda feels left alone, even by the international community, which views the ideological struggle along the Nile with a mixture of curiosity and tension.
That could take revenge.
A demonstrator on the Tahrir warns: "You breed a monster that you can no longer control."
Rakfisk from Norway: Is this the most malodorous fish in the world?
The five million inhabitants of Norway enjoy one of the highest living standards - not only in Europe, but all over the world.
Could the country ’ s secret to success have anything to do with the local appetite for pretty nauseating fish?
Take a selection of overripe cheeses.
Place them in the middle of a pile of dirty, damp sportswear.
And leave them there a week.
One has to imagine the nose-numbing smell of Rakfisk, one of Norway ’ s great delicacies.
I am in the small town of Fagernes, about three hours from Oslo.
There is snow here, spectacular landscapes - and that persistent smell in the air that just doesn't want to disappear.
Rakfisk is a salt-sprinkled trout that is fermented in water for up to a year, depending on how smelly the fish is.
When in Norway the darkness comes over the country and the weather gets colder, Norwegians flock to a festival here in Fagernes, which is dedicated to this, well, really very captivating specialty.
"You eat it raw and then rinse it down with a glass of aquavit," says Havard Halvarsen, who actually works at the local fire station, but also hosts the festival as a so-called "Rakfisk" general.
Around us, people eat small fish cubes and drink large amounts of alcohol.
"Some people like Aquavit more than Rakfisk," says Havard.
The spirit can suppress the smell.
I taste some snacks.
If you avoid bringing the Rakfisk near the nose, it is not bad - like Sushi, which has had a long bus ride.
Rakfisk is the product of a completely different, far poorer Norwegian era, when there were no cooling facilities and fish was soaked in airtight saltwater barrels in the autumn.
In the deepest winter, it was taken out after long fermentation and consumed - undoubtedly with the help of senses steamed with alcohol.
A generation ago, thousands of Norwegians were forced to leave their country in search of work, and emigrated mainly to the US.
Today the population is growing rapidly - more than 13% are immigrants, attracted by a flourishing labour market, high wages and comprehensive health care.
Even Sweden, the old rival that not so long ago was far richer than Norway, is pouring in immigrants.
Rakfisk is considered an important part of Norwegian history - an essential, if strong smelling, part.
It is one of the more expensive dishes you can buy here.
But actually everything here is expensive - a small glass of beer or a sandwich costs 10 Euros.
Norway doesn ’ t make it into the world press often, and most people don ’ t seem to mind.
They still hate to call Anders Breivik by his name - the racist right-wing extremist who shot 77 men, women and children last year.
Instead, reference is made only to the "22 July incident".
Norwegians have a hard time accepting that someone in their peace-loving country is capable of such brutal murders.
Since the early 1970s, the growth of one of the world ’ s largest oil and gas industries has been largely responsible for Norway ’ s current wealth.
"But oil is not the only reason why we are doing so well," says Anna, our waitress, who distributes round trays with ripe rakfisk and embodies the Nordic ideal with her long blond hair and piercing blue eyes.
We are, as they say, a prudent people.
Her English, like that of most people here, is flawless.
We are not very pretentious, we do not like boasting.
Norway has been very careful with its oil wealth – a large proportion of the industry ’ s earnings will be invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations.
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, when everyone threw money around that they did not have, Norway kept its purse tightly closed.
"As long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer, we are happy," says Anna.
"And of course eat Rakfisk," she adds with a carefree laugh.
I stand in the snow and line up for another court - I have had enough of Rakfisk.
So a moose burger is definitely something else. I like the juicy meat.
But in the evening the stinky fish is on the menu again.
The hotel I ’ m staying at is one of several venues that organize a Rakfisk ’ s dinner where guests can vote for the best – or perhaps the most aromatic – fish.
There is a Live 'TV' circuit to a bow-clad showmaster who is surrounded by dishes with rakfisk.
The spectacle is similar to the Eurovision Song Contest.
"What score do you have up there in the mountains for the best fish, Thor? Jürgen?"
"Here are our points, Havard".
One claps and laughs.
A man falls from his chair, possibly overwhelmed by the aquavit.
But perhaps it is the severe haze of the whole fish.
Mexico ’ s Enrique Pena Nieto Faces Difficult Start
As Mexico ’ s future president, Enrique Pena Nieto, prepares to take office, the BBC ’ s Will Grant analyzes the challenges ahead and the mixed feelings of his people.
Currently, traffic in Mexico City is particularly bad.
Even on better days, this is an ever-congested city, but on Monday, a steel ring was erected that closes off several important traffic routes into the capital and causes chaos on the streets.
The aim, however, was not to disrupt commuters on their way to work, but to prevent demonstrators from reaching Parliament.
On Saturday, Mexico ’ s new president, Enrique Pena Nieto, will receive the presidential bandage and take over the leadership of the nation.
It faces a complex task.
Mexico has been economically successful under Felipe Calderón ’ s outgoing government, but the country is gripped by a drug war that has already claimed 60,000 lives in the last six years.
"My government is strongly committed to reducing violence," Pena Nieto told US President Barack Obama at the Oval Office earlier this week.
I will propose a new security strategy that will enable us to achieve this objective.
Before joining the US president, Pena Nieto served as governor of his home state of Mexico.
In this densely populated, sprawling part of the country surrounding the capital, opinions about the new head of state are divided.
A Direct Man
In the remote small town of Valle del Bravo, for example, people like to remember him.
Residents attribute to him the development of tourism and the development of infrastructure.
To reach the city, you can take one of the motorways that Pena Nieto had built, which are a great improvement over the brittle, bumpy roads that once existed here.
Plaques bearing his name also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum on climate change.
"We expect real and lasting changes from him," said his friend and political ally Gabriel Olvera Hernandez, who works as a congressman for Pena Nieto's party, the PRI.
In particular, as regards security and the economy, we hope for an interesting and real change, which our country so badly needs.
After 81 years in power, Vicente Fox replaced the PRI in 2000.
Congressman Olvera admits that after 12 years outside the presidential palace of Los Pinos, the party has high expectations of Enrique Pena Nieto.
He rejects the opposition ’ s accusations that the new president lacks substance.
He is a very direct man, very committed and has big plans for the country.
He is an excellent statesman, but above all he is also someone who can listen.
But, on the other side of the state, not many people share this view of their former governor.
In Nezahualcoyotl, also known as Ciudad Neza, the contrast to the cobbled streets of Valle del Bravo could not be greater.
The place is hidden under highway overpasses and is in many ways a suburb of Mexico City itself.
And the problems in the community are decisively urban.
Earlier this year, the military was turned on to fight the drug gangs operating in the neighborhoods, and violence against women is a particularly acute problem.
In the last two years alone, the corpses of dozens of murdered women have been left on a wasteland near a large landfill.
During Governor Pena Nieto's term of office, more than 1,000 women were murdered in the state of Mexico - a statistic that surpasses even that of the city of Ciudad Juarez, notorious for its violence and the murders of innocent women.
Pena Nieto ’ s critics believe that he has at least not adequately addressed the problem of feminicide during his tenure.
But in the worst case, his government has closed its eyes to the problem.
In a concrete building, typical of the rundown neighborhood, Irinea Buendia struggles with tears as she shows me photos of her deceased daughter Mariana Luna.
According to the official version of the events, Mariana committed suicide in 2010.
But her family believes that she was murdered by her partner.
"When I arrived at her home, it seemed as if her body had been washed," recalls Senora Buendia.
There were signs that she was beaten, and the rigidity of the corpses had already set in.
While her mother is telling her story, a picture of Mariana looks down on us from the wall, next to a cross bearing a single word: justice.
But it is exactly this, according to the family, that she has been denied so far.
The authorities have treated me as if I were a gossip, a troublemaker, a nagger.
They want their verdict to be simply accepted and shut up.
“But that ’ s not possible when there were so many mistakes and omissions, ” she says.
When President Pena Nieto receives the presidential bandage on Saturday, he is also taking on a great responsibility.
Tens of thousands of Mexican families have been affected by violent crimes over the past six years, and the new president has promised to pay particular attention to this problem during his tenure.
"As president, I hope he is as he was as governor," says PRI Congressman Olvera in Valle del Bravo.
But that is what the families of the victims in Ciudad Neza fear most.
The prosecution claims that Bradley Manning did not complain of mistreatment
The prosecution contradicts Bradley Manning ’ s allegations that he was mistreated in prison
The hearing is about Mannings time in the military prison in Quantico, Virginia
The defence seeks to dismiss the charges on the basis of excessively harsh prison conditions
The corporal of the U.S. Army is accused of having stolen thousands of confidential documents
The prosecution tried on Friday to find out that army mate Bradley Manning - accused of the largest disclosure of confidential information in U.S. history - missed several opportunities to complain about his alleged mistreatment in military custody.
During a cross-examination of Mann during a pre-trial hearing in Ft. Meade, Maryland, Maj. Ashden Fein stated that there was no complaint about his treatment on records of weekly visits made by prison officials during Mann's nine months in Quantico, Virginia.
One day before the cross-examination, which was held on the basis of a defence motion to dismiss the indictment - Manning had already been punished sufficiently by the harsh prison terms - Manning testified that he had considered suicide in prison.
The US intelligence analyst, who was arrested in June 2010, is accused of stealing thousands of confidential documents while on duty in Iraq.
The material was then published by WikiLeaks on the Internet.
WikiLeaks has never confirmed Manning as the source of the information.
In Friday ’ s hearing, Fein went through with Manning the forms that officials had filled out after meeting Manning during his detention in the Quantico military prison, where he had been detained from July 2010 to April 2011 under intensified detention conditions.
The officers asked Manning questions and wrote down his answers.
When asked about the forms on Friday, Manning admitted that he had judged the treatment by his guards to be "excellent" and the treatment by the institution as a whole to be "very professional".
The forms, Fein said, contained no complaints of abuse, even though officers had directly questioned Manning about his treatment.
Manning replied that he had expressed his concerns orally and that the officers had discussed them with him and indicated that they would deal with them. However, they had not been recorded.
“They wrote down (after discussing the concerns) ‘ no problems ’, and that didn ’ t necessarily mean that I didn ’ t say anything at all, ” Manning said.
The judge, Colonel Denise Lind, also asked Manning why he did not complain about his treatment when he met with a committee in January 2011 to investigate the suicidal thoughts he had mentioned on a form several months earlier.
Manning replied that his intention during the meeting was to downgrade his observation status on "injury prevention".
The military said that it had assigned him this restrictive status - which is one step below suicide risk - to protect him and others.
"I wanted to convince employees that I was doing well and get rid of the status of observation on injury prevention (...) in order to achieve a higher quality of life in my view," Manning said.
Manning testified on Thursday about his arrest and transfer to Kuwait, where he was held for nearly two months before being transferred to the Quantico Naval Base in Virginia in July 2010.
He said that in Kuwait he had considered suicide and was unconscious because of the heat.
Not being allowed to know what is happening to him or to the outside world was a burden.
"My world shrank to Camp Arafjon, to that cage together," Manning said on Thursday.
I thought I was going to die in that cage.
When he was transferred to Quantico, Manning spent most of his days in a small cell - at least 21 hours and often more than 23 hours - and without company.
They only allowed him a mattress, a blanket, flip-flops, clothes and glasses.
Manning said he had tried to keep moving, because during the day it was forbidden to sleep or even to lie down.
He had always had to sleep with light that penetrated his cell from the outside.
When he turned around at night and guards could no longer see his face, he was woken up to turn back.
In January 2011, Manning ’ s lawyer formally objected to treatment.
In April 2011, Manning was transferred to the Fort Leavenworth, Kansas military prison.
On Friday, the judge also questioned Manning about an accusation he had made in his statement on Thursday - he had to sleep naked one night in his cell in Quantico and stand naked in front of guards and other prisoners during a morning count.
Manning had testified that he had never had the opportunity to cover himself with his blanket during that count.
During Friday ’ s interrogation, Manning stated that he had concluded from an order from his guard that he should drop the blanket he could have covered himself with. However, he admitted that no one had asked him to do so.
On Thursday Manning had testified that he had been forced to sleep naked the previous night. He had previously tried to show an official that he was no danger to himself.
Manning told the officer that he could use the waistband of his underwear or his flip-flops to hurt himself, but did not do so.
That night, Manning said, his underwear, flip-flops and glasses had been removed from his cell.
His lawyers hope that the judge will at least take his experience into account and drastically reduce his detention if he is convicted at his trial before the military court, which is scheduled for early next year.
The defense has indicated that Manning will plead guilty to minor offenses, while other charges considered to be too extreme are to be challenged.
The hearing is scheduled to continue this weekend and the prosecution is expected to justify the conditions of detention.
The Pentagon maintains its position that Manning has been detained in accordance with the regulations that apply to all detainees under the highest security measures in Quantico.
Manning was charged with favoring the enemy, illegally publishing intelligence on the Internet, transmitting national defense information, and stealing public property or documents.
If he is found guilty on all counts, he faces a life sentence.
My Mexican-Based American Identity Crisis.
Many people are forced to leave Mexico due to lack of opportunities
Mexicans tend to blame the emigrants - they remind them of hard times, he says
Navarrette believes that Mexican Americans are caught between two worlds
On a recent trip to Mexico City, I had just passed through the hall and arrived at the passport control, as perplexity set in.
Signs pointed to two queues: one for "Mexicanos" ("Mexicans"), another for "Extranjeros" ("Foreigners").
I stood there for a few seconds, unsure where to go.
I grew up in Central California and was called "Mexican" all my life.
An ethnic abbreviation - just as my friends in Boston call themselves' Irish 'or my friends in New York call themselves' Italians'.
Later, I decided to go for "Mexican-American".
But this was Mexico.
And in my grandfather's homeland there was no need for abbreviations or hyphens.
I was just American.
I speak Spanish, at least good enough to assert myself in that language at both ends of an interview.
But I do not have the vocabulary of a native speaker, nor do I get rid of my American accent.
So I took my American passport and queued up for extranjeros.
I was thinking about that moment this week when Mexico ’ s future president, Enrique Pena Nieto, visited the White House to meet with President Obama.
On the agenda were all the issues that one would expect when the heads of these two countries meet: immigration, drugs, and trade.
Pena Nieto was also keen to talk about the growth of the Mexican economy, which is one of the reasons why Mexicans today are just as likely to stay in Mexico rather than migrate to the United States.
He wants to ally himself with the United States and Canada and create a North American trading bloc on the model of the European Union.
And Pena Nieto swore to continue Mexico ’ s war against the drug cartels, even if he didn ’ t give any details.
Mexico ’ s relationship with the United States is complicated and resentful.
Most Americans probably never give a single thought to the fact that the United States invaded Mexico in 1848, forcing the country ’ s leaders to surrender more than half of their territory at gunpoint.
But for Mexicans who think in centuries, not minutes, memories of that event cannot be overlooked.
So, whenever a US government official makes the slightest criticism of Mexico, one hears complaints – in the Mexican press and among the country ’ s elites – about Americans ’ harassment of their neighbor ’ s sovereignty.
And the children of Montezuma set out on the path of war.
And yet Mexico ’ s greatest challenge lies in its relationship with the more than 35 million Mexican Americans who live in the United States.
Desire to talk about resentment?
There is more than enough.
Mexico has winners and losers. People for whom the country offers opportunities, and others for whom it does not.
The only reason why so many people of Mexican descent live in cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, Denver, or San Antonio is that at one point in our family tree, a person - perhaps a parent or grandparent - was not given a chance in Mexico and emigrated northward.
And in most cases this person corresponded to a profile - dark-skinned, uneducated, from a poor village, etc.
We are the descendants of these people and we are faithful to them.
Not Mexico.
And while we may have lived the American dream, attended good schools, and got good jobs, we must never lose sight of the fact that it is the American dream that we are living - not the Mexican one.
Our identity may sometimes be blurred, but as for our loyalty, it is not.
This clearly applies to the United States.
We are also aware that many members of the Mexican leadership do not like us.
This is based on reciprocity.
They see us as a monument to a humiliating defeat and look down on us because we are not Mexican enough.
Our Spanish will never be good enough, our ties to Mexico will never be strong enough.
In their opinion, our existence is a symbol of failure.
If our families had not failed in Mexico, they would not have gone.
And then we would not find ourselves trapped behind the silk curtain - with a pleasant life in the United States, but somehow lost.
My wife, who was born in Guadalajara and immigrated legally to the United States as a child, reminds me that there is tension between Mexicans and Mexican Americans because Mexicans have a clearer idea of who they are - and Mexican Americans resent that.
While she is a US citizen, she sees herself as part of two countries.
But many Mexican Americans I know feel that they belong neither to nor to the country.
We love the Mexican band Los Tigres del Norte, but also Bruce Springsteen.
One enjoys the best of both worlds, but none of them is rooted.
In Mexico we are seen as Americans.
And in the United States we are seen as Mexicans.
As I should learn during my trip, there is something that makes this relationship even more complicated: some Mexican leaders and sections of the educated middle class want to reconnect with the diaspora.
They want to use Mexican Americans as provisional "ambassadors" for Mexico, representing their interests in the United States.
We should tell our American colleagues how great a visit to this country is and put pressure on the political leadership to intensify their ties with Mexico.
Now.
That will not happen.
Too many hurt feelings.
And, given the unfair distribution of income, rampant corruption, and drug violence, many of us are not so sure that this is a great country.
I'm afraid you have to go through it alone, Amigos.
That is fair.
If at least some Mexicans are not yet willing to forgive the United States for dealing with Mexico a century and a half ago, they must accept that some Mexican Americans have resentment of how their family members were treated not so long ago.
Hmmm.
Maybe we are more "Mexican" than I thought.
Old Skirmishes, New Middle East
The ceasefire between Israel and Hamas may prove to be an unexpected pillar of peace
Can there ever be lasting peace between Arabs and Jews in the Middle East?
Recent bloody events seem to nip such hope in the bud.
Amidst the usual blame game, countless buildings have been reduced to rubble, more than 140 Palestinians, most of them civilians, and six Israelis have been killed - and for the first time rockets from Gaza have struck near the Israeli metropolis of Tel Aviv and the holy city of Jerusalem.
But, while Israelis and Palestinians seem trapped in their historic conflict, the Middle East around them is changing.
The Arab Spring has created a new, uncertain situation, and whether they like it or not, Palestinians and Israelis have become part of this turmoil.
Perhaps this will only lead to more bloodshed.
But there are reasons to believe that the deadly stalemate may finally come to an end.
A war that is neither lost nor won
At first glance, optimism seems far from appropriate given the current situation.
Even if the ceasefire agreed on 21 November continues, this week ’ s fighting has strengthened the hardcore on both sides.
The leaders of Hamas, the Islamist movement that has controlled the Gaza Strip since 2007, will claim to have pushed back the Israelis, even though its faction has suffered great losses.
Although several Hamas leaders are being killed and the 1.7 million Gazans are being crammed into one of the most desolate and densely populated corners of the planet, Israel has so far failed to destroy Hamas.
Indeed, Hamas is gaining ground in the West Bank, which is controlled by the rival, moderate Palestinian Fatah group.
And Hamas ’ s leaders might conclude that they have time on their side.
As Islamists have gained influence in the Arab world, Hamas has attracted powerful and rich friends to its side.
Turkey, a resurgent regional power that was once Israel ’ s closest Muslim ally, has sided with Hamas – as has Qatar, one of the richest and most dynamic Gulf states.
Cheering Hamas supporters believe that an Islamist crescent is forming around Israel – from Lebanon in the north, where militant Hezbollah holds power, to Syria, where increasingly Islamist rebels could face the toppling of Bashar Assad, to Jordan, where Hamas allies threaten the king.
Especially the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood under President Muhammad Morsi in Egypt - by far the most populous and important Arab country - on Israel's southern flank has changed the balance of the region.
Hosni Mubarak, the secular despot who ruled Egypt for 30 years until his fall in 2011, had little time for Hamas.
By contrast, the Brotherhood is allied with Hamas, and its leaders are more dependent on popular views.
In future diplomatic negotiations, Hamas may prove to be an actor that cannot be pushed out even by Israel and the United States.
Israeli hardliners, on the other hand, draw the opposite conclusion.
Militarily, Hamas is no longer a danger.
Israel's Iron Dome missile defense system has proved its worth, and many of Hamas' rockets have been destroyed.
At least for a while, Israel will be able to sleep more calmly.
Diplomatically, the United States remains steadfast in its position, and many European countries have blamed Hamas for the latest escalation of violence.
Israel has fared well in recent years, especially under Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, who has largely ignored the peace process.
Although rockets from the Gaza Strip have killed about 30 Israelis since 2004, the country has remained relatively free of suicide bombers - not least thanks to the barriers that run into the West Bank and thus into the main part of a possible Palestinian state. These protect the Jewish settlements, which were declared illegal under international law, but are still being expanded.
Netanyahu is doing well. His Likud, a party allied with an even more militant group ahead of the election on January 22, led by Avigdor Lieberman.
Why pamper these deceitful Palestinians and give them their own state?
If they really had control of the West Bank, would they not be firing rockets, just like their comrades in Gaza?
No, it is better to keep them in check behind the wall and punish them if they dare to raise their heads.
Perhaps the hardliners will prevail, but the Arab Spring could thwart them.
Even if the Islamists now in power in Egypt and elsewhere have little left for Israel, they will initially focus on the difficulties at home.
Israel ’ s defense budget is larger than that of its four Arab neighbors combined.
A war with the local superpower will do little to help the new Arab governments restore their economies.
The fact that the pragmatic President Morsi joined forces with Barack Obama to achieve a ceasefire may be a promising sign – perhaps symbolizing the beginning of a new era.
Israelis, too, should think longer.
As the rest of the Arab world takes tentative steps toward democratization, Palestinians continue to be deprived of their right to self-determination - a powder keg that will undoubtedly explode one day in the Israeli occupied territories, just as a bus exploded in Tel Aviv this week.
The oppression is already undermining democracy in the Jewish state, and this situation will only worsen with the growth of the Arab population.
Bloody missions to push back Hamas in the Gaza Strip will increasingly take their diplomatic toll over the years.
Both sides need a push from the outside
The correct answer is the one represented by the more reasonable representatives of both sides, the majority of the rest of the world, and by this newspaper: two states in which Israel cedes territories for security purposes.
The hope - small for the near future - is that the ceasefire will give outsiders more leverage to enforce this solution.
Egypt, together with Turkey and Qatar, must now stop arms deliveries to the Gaza Strip and is better positioned than ever to convince Hamas of the idea of a Jewish state based on the 1967 borders, supplemented by territorial exchange and a common Jerusalem.
Outside Arab nations should also persuade Hamas and Fatah to reach an agreement.
This would do more to create a Palestinian state than the upcoming application for UN observer status.
Obama, too, must play his part in getting Israel to negotiate.
During his first term, he failed to present his own peace plan.
Far away in the White House, he also seems unwilling to participate.
But this is an unfortunate, short-sighted prospect.
The United States has a vital interest in a stable Middle East.
This includes a peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
Australian laws on unified cigarette packaging enter into force
Health warnings and diseased body parts on neutral green packs that are the same for all tobacco brands
The world ’ s first laws for standardized cigarette and tobacco packaging have come into force in Australia. Brand logos and colors are replaced by neutral, olive green lids, which are also printed with drastic images showing sick body parts and cigarette smoke infected infants and children.
Apart from the different health warnings and pictures, the only difference between the packages in the brand names, which are printed in identical, small font, is from next Saturday.
This means that Australia is introducing the strictest regulations for tobacco packaging in the world.
The Australian federal government wants to dissuade young people from smoking by eliminating the glamorous image of tobacco use.
The government is working on the basis of studies that have shown that people who have not yet started smoking at the age of 26 are 99% likely to stop smoking afterwards.
"You can see in children of young age that they understand the message that tobacco companies are trying to promote with their brand image," says Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek. She cites studies that have shown, for example, that children associate the crown of a logo with the idea of a princess.
Although Australia has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world and the changes will have only a minor impact on the profits of the multinationals, other countries are already considering similar steps.
The tobacco lobby fought hard against the laws.
It was said that the laws would favour black market trade, leading to cheaper and more accessible cigarettes.
"The laws will have serious, unintended consequences," says Scott McIntyre of British American Tobacco Australia.
Chinese and Indonesian counterfeiters will offer far greater quantities of these products on the roads of Australia.
Others, on the other hand, say that the laws have boosted their business.
Sandra Ha of Zico Import Pty Ltd, a small family-owned company, notes that demand for cigarette cases and silicone caps to cover the intolerable packaging has soared since British American Tobacco, Britain's Imperial Tobacco, Philip Morris and Japan Tobacco failed to challenge the law at the Australian Supreme Court two months ago.
Zico has sold up to 6,000 units to wholesale stores and is waiting for new stocks.
For us, this is a good business.
According to experts, the catch in the popularity of social media is precisely the population targeted by the plan.
A number of Australian laws have banned tobacco companies from TV advertising, prohibited them from sponsoring sports and forced most retailers to stop displaying cigarettes in stores. Now, tobacco advertising has switched to the Internet.
The Australian government has banned Internet advertising by local companies and sites, but has no influence on international sites.
“If you market tobacco and have only a small area left to promote your products, you can ’ t get around the Internet, ” says Becky Freeman, a healthcare researcher at the University of Sydney.
On social media such as YouTube, Twitter and Facebook, Freeman has noticed an increase in experience reports on brands written by "ordinary people".
One has to ask oneself the question: Is this just a private person who likes Marlboro so much that she even makes a video for it - or does a marketing agency have something to do with it?
British American Tobacco Australia says that instead of focusing on marketing, the industry is focused on dealing with the new laws.
It has even gone so far as to pay Ukraine, Honduras, and the Dominican Republic to challenge the new rules - those countries complain to the World Trade Organization about unfair trade restrictions, even though none of them is doing much trade with Australia.
A WTO ruling is expected in mid-2013.
According to Plibersek, the government has held talks with other countries that are considering similar packaging laws.
Canada was the first country to impose photographic warnings in 2001.
These have now been extended to more than 40 countries, including Brazil, Turkey and Ukraine.
Tougher laws are being considered in the UK, New Zealand, South Africa and India.
Many Australian smokers are defiant.
The pictures do not affect me.
I simply ignore them.
"You simply take a cigarette and put the box away," says Victor El Hage when buying a cigarette box with a photo of an oral tumor on it.
Frankly, there is only one reason why I would stop, and that is my little girl.
James Yu, the operator of the tobacco trade "King of the Pack" in downtown Sydney, says that the uniform packaging has made it difficult to fill his shelves.
"It used to take me an hour to sort one shipment, now I need four," Yu says.
"The government should have banned cigarettes completely - then we would have said to ourselves okay, that's it, we'll close down," he adds, obviously angrily.
In a constantly electrified world it is nice to be bored sometimes
This Thanksgiving I unexpectedly spent five hours at the airport when our plane failed due to mechanical problems and we had to wait for another plane.
So I had enough time to think a bit about boredom.
I don't wanna lie
Waiting half a day at the airport for a flight is pretty annoying - even if books, magazines and iPhones (and of course tax-free shopping) are available.
But more and more academics and child development experts cite boredom as something positive.
When it comes to them, it is okay for us - and our children - to be bored occasionally.
This forces the brain to get lost in interesting thoughts, which may encourage creativity.
And because most of us nowadays almost constantly stare at one screen or another, we no longer benefit from the advantages of boredom.
So should we welcome boredom with open arms?
Yes.
And no.
I will come back to that.
Like many people, I have always assumed that boredom is a relatively recent phenomenon that has developed with increasing leisure time.
But Peter Toohey, professor of Greek and Roman history at the University of Calgary in Canada and author of "Boredom: A Lively History" (Yale University Press, 2011) doesn't see it that way.
"In fact, boredom has a very long history," he says.
Latin graffiti about boredom, dating back to the first century, adorns the walls of Pompeii ’ s house.
And then there is the question of how we actually define boredom.
According to John D. Eastwood, an associate professor of psychology at York University in Ontario, Canada, the problem is that boredom has been defined and discussed in many ways.
After reading research literature for a long time and presenting the idea to a focus group of about 100 people, Professor Eastwood and his colleagues came to the conclusion that boredom can be defined as the experience of "wanting to do a satisfactory job, but not being able to do it".
Boredom differs from apathy in that the person is not busy, but wants to be.
With apathy, on the other hand, there is no need to do anything.
The key experience of boredom, he says, is a "disturbance of the attention process, coupled with a bad mood and the feeling that time passes slowly."
Boredom can almost sound like depression.
But Professor Eastwood believes that although these two states may be related, bored people see the problem in their environment or in the world, while depressed people see the problem in themselves.
Sometimes we think that we are bored, even if we just have difficulty concentrating.
In their study "The Unengaged Mind: Defining Boredom in Terms of Attention", published in September in the journal "Perspectives on Psychological Science", Professor Eastwood and his colleagues refer to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a volume in which a person read a magazine article.
Some groups listened to a loud TV programme from the neighbouring room, which had nothing to do with the content; others listened to it at a low volume, so that it was barely perceptible, while the third group did not hear these noises at all.
The people who heard the barely audible television said they felt more bored than the other two groups - they had trouble concentrating, could find no reason for them, and attributed their difficulties to boredom.
Trying to focus on a difficult or strenuous task can lead to boredom, says Mark J. Fenske, Associate Professor of Neuroscience at the University of Guelph in Ontario and one of the authors of the study.
On the other hand, if you do a monotonous job - "like looking for faulty products on a factory conveyor belt, music can distract you and help you not to feel bored".
In fact, he says, we now know that wriggling and scribbling, often interpreted as a sign of boredom, can even combat it by keeping people physically alert.
"Studies have shown that children who are allowed to walk around learn more and keep more information than those who are forced to sit still," said Professor Fenske.
We all get bored at some point - my delayed flight, a roaring loudspeaker, a particularly tiring film.
But some people get bored more easily than others.
To measure these differences, researchers in the 1980s developed a "scale of vulnerability".
On the scale are statements like "Many things I have to do are repeated and are monotonous" and "I have so many interests that I don't have enough time for everything".
Using such scales, researchers have found that boys are more likely to get bored than girls, according to Stephen Vodanovich, Professor of Psychology at the University of West Florida – especially when it comes to the need for more and a greater variety of external stimuli.
But, in general, teenagers are a pretty wicked bunch.
In 1991, Reed Larson, Professor of Human and Community Development at the University of Illinois, conducted an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents with a pager seven to eight times a day.
He found that 32% of adolescents at school and doing homework were bored, while 23% said they were bored when they were not at school.
But only 3% of parents said they felt bored.
Professor Larson says today, 21 years later, he does not know whether the percentage of boredom has increased or decreased.
However, he is certain that "the youth is felt to be particularly boring", mainly because children and teenagers do not have much influence on their everyday life.
So back to my original question: Is boredom healthy?
Sometimes not, because in extreme cases it leads to people taking extreme physical risks and falling prey to gambling or drugs in order to alleviate them, as studies have shown.
On the other hand, many philosophers and authors investigate the relationship between boredom and creativity. This is the opinion of Professor Vodanovich, who has been researching the subject for more than two decades.
"With boredom, the brain wants to tell you that you should do something else," says Gary Marcus, Professor of Psychology at the University of New York.
But the brain does not always know what to do best.
When you are bored and you use this energy to play the guitar and cook, you become happy.
But, while television can provide happiness in the short term, it will evaporate in the long term.
So if you give your bored child an iPad, it can dissuade them from boredom, but it has not taught them to talk or control themselves, says Professor Fenske.
And he adds: "Self-control transfers from one situation to another".
The child not only learns to converse, but also gains more self-control in other areas.
I do not believe that we should celebrate boredom.
Nor should we be too critical of them.
Instead, our aim should be to feel at home away from the constant flow of activity and technology.
Professor Eastwood agrees.
"It sounds like we often have to be bored, but boredom is the agonizing, incessant desire to do something meaningful," he says.
He believes that people are really looking for only one way to unwind and relax.
"In an environment in which we are constantly overstimulated, it is difficult to occupy oneself once the noise has stopped."
Colorado has no clear guidance on the new marijuana law
19-year-old Anthony Orozco, a college student and soccer player, is standing trial in southeastern Colorado for an offense that will soon be legal in that state: owning a few marijuana smokers and a pipe with which he smoked them.
According to Orozco, he and some friends were driving in Lamar near the Kansas border on a September day when they were stopped.
After the police officer found marijuana in the car, Orozco was summoned for possession of drugs and drug utensils - cavaliers punishable by 100 US dollars each - and was given a court term.
"We are treated like criminals," says Orozco.
But is he also one?
In the uncertain weeks following the state ’ s decision to legalize small amounts of marijuana for personal use, the answer to hundreds of minor drug offenses depends less on the law than on the location.
Hundreds of misdemeanors revolving around marijuana are already being dropped here and in the state of Washington that approved similar measures.
Police authorities are no longer persecuting adults over 21 for small-scale possession, which will be allowed by law as soon as the new laws enter into force in the coming weeks.
But prosecutors in the more conservative districts of Colorado have announced that they will pursue existing marijuana cases and are still citing people in court.
At the same time, several cities, from the suburbs of Denver to the Western Mountains, are voting to prevent new government-licensed marijuana shops from opening in their communities.
“This situation is developing so fast that I don ’ t know what will happen next, ” says Daniel J. Oates, chief of police in Aurora, east of Denver.
And Washington state regulators, too, scratch their heads helplessly.
They are waiting for guidance on setting up a licensing system for the production, production, distribution and sale of the drug - with a deadline of 1 December 2013.
Washington believes that in any case Colorado is ahead of most states when it comes to regulating marijuana, where the drug was first legalized for medical use and then legalized for personal use.
"Colorado has a more regulated market, so the state is a good source of orientation," says Brian E. Smith, Washington State Spirits Regulator.
But Smith also admits that no place or system can do more than serve as a rough guide.
"We do not have a real precedent to follow," he added.
The Washington Act, known as "I" 502, comes into force on December 6th, marking the end of a grey area in which the state licensing system does not yet exist, but ownership is legalized.
And unpleasant practical questions need to be clarified at this time - such as how the state requirement of "adequate access" to licensed marijuana should be reconciled with the ban on cannabis shops within 300 meters of schools, parks, playgrounds, and childcare facilities.
"Nowhere will it be more difficult to find a site for a licensed cannabis business than in urban areas, especially in the Seattle metropolitan area," said Ben Livingston, spokesman for the Center for Legal Cannabis, a recently formed research group.
On 21 November, Chief Oates sent an e mail to his Aurora staff stating that the prosecutor would no longer prosecute minor marijuana offenses against people over the age of 21, and that the police would not "immediately" seek criminal charges for these offenses.
Chief Oates added that the police will continue to enforce municipal regulations to regulate growers of medical marijuana and continue to prosecute drug traffickers.
In Weld County, northern Colorado, District Attorney Ken Buck takes a stricter view.
After the vote, he said his agency would continue to pursue cases of marijuana possession, mainly to persuade consumers to withdraw.
Currently 119 people are being tried for possession of about 50 grams or less of marijuana, although many have been charged with other offences.
"Our authority has a duty to prosecute violations that were criminal offences at the time of the crime," Buck said in a statement.
Reactions are ambivalent even in places like rural Mesa County, where voters rejected the marijuana initiative.
Police in Grand Junction, the county's largest city, no longer report adults for possession of smaller quantities.
District Attorney Pete Hautzinger supported this decision, but also decided not to abandon all pending ownership procedures.
“I don ’ t think I ’ m wasting my time enforcing the law until it changes, ” he says.
Although 55% of Colorado voters supported the measure, it was clear from the outset that it would not be easy to reconcile personal use of marijuana with the complexities of the government and legal system.
And contradictory reactions across the state exposed a profound dichotomy among local officials over the great green experiment.
District prosecutors are a "cultural barrier," says Sean McAllister, a lawyer from Denver who represents defendants in court for marijuana crimes and serves as a local spokesperson for the national marijuana law reform organization.
"They have spent so much of their lives prosecuting people for not accepting legalization," he believes.
Colorado and Washington are the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol as a national model case for legalizing drugs.
While advocates and state officials are preparing for an age of legal sales, they are also nervously waiting for instructions from the federal government that will continue to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as a federal offense.
Advocates of the legalization movement hope that the Ministry of Justice will yield.
Despite several high-profile arrests of consumers and medical marijuana vendors, the federal government has allowed the sale of medical marijuana in Colorado, Washington, and 16 other states for the most part.
Kevin A. Sabet, former drug policy adviser to the Obama administration, believes that, while detectives are unlikely to open doors to seize smaller quantities of drugs, they are likely to resist condoning legal, state-regulated marijuana deals under the new legislation.
Several cities in Colorado do not even wait for the federal authorities to act.
Before election day, some local governments approved moratoria for new marijuana, although it may not open until about a year from now.
Last week, Montrose, a city in the West, adopted a six-month ban that is expected to be adopted next week.
“We don ’ t want to get into a position where we license someone and then face a big problem at the federal level, ” said Bob Nicholson, a member of the city council.
Our community voted against this change in the law.
We are guided by what the community has chosen and not by what the state has chosen.
Many questions remain unanswered.
Petronella Wyatt: I was bullied from Oxford because I'm Tory
Not only university students today are being attacked for their views
It has always been my greatest dream to get a place at Oxford University.
Both my father and my older brother had attended what I once thought to be the greatest temple of knowledge in the world, a modern Greek symposium that promoted the great pillars of civilization — free thought and tolerance.
But within two weeks of my arrival at Worscester College at the end of the eighties - where I had planned to study history - I had packed my bags again and thus caused the first scandal of my life.
My father collapsed in tears.
My friends were confused.
In the Evening Standard it was said that I would have left, because I would have had a problem with fellow students having sex in the adjacent room.
Author A N Wilson mischievously explained that I had left university because I was forced to drink from damaged cups.
But the truth was less amusing.
I ran away.
Yes, I did, because I suffered from systematic bullying and threats.
Not because of my quite unusual name, or because I came from a private school.
I was harassed for just one reason – one that seemed all the more narrow-minded and cruel in this supposed cradle of enlightenment: my late father, Woodrow Wyatt, had been an important adviser to Margaret Thatcher, and I had been an advocate of the Conservative Party.
Why do I mention this now?
Now, according to recent reports, a new generation of center-right students is suffering similar persecution.
The organised and rising hatred of Tory ’ s Oxford students has now grown to such proportions that one group of them last week called for the same equality protection that benefits gays, the disabled, and ethnic minorities.
Conservative members of the Junior Common Room (JCR) of Corpus Christi College claim that they are "often actively isolated, personally attacked and declared undesirable" because of their political views.
They demand a place on their college ’ s equality committee to ensure that their opinions can be expressed freely.
Their situation was aggravated by a recent documentary about political students on BBC Two, "Wonderland: Young, Bright and on the Right", which portrayed Tories as eccentric and neo-Nazi.
Among the exhibits was graduate Joe Cooke, former president of the University of Oxford ’ s conservative student association, who rode a Rolls-Royce and boasted a silver-colored suit and silver cane.
In other universities, conservative students say they are seen as' scapegoats for the introduction of higher tuition fees'.
Luke Black, 20-year-old vice president of the University of Nottingham's conservative student association, said in a Sunday newspaper: "There is a growing leftist tendency in universities.
People think we are like the Bullingdon Club, without even getting to know each other. "
Samuel Roberts, 21, and a history student in Corpus Christi, who initiated the petition for greater protection, believes that such a climate is “unpleasant. ” 19-year-old Stephanie Cherill, president-elect of the conservative Oxford Student Association, says she has observed growing disapproval among JCR members of students of the moderate right.
"This is a danger to intellectual discourse and to the well-being of its members," she says.
In my first few weeks in Oxford, I belonged to such a minority.
An incredibly shy 18 year-old, I arrived in September 1986.
Hatred of the Conservative Party had peaked.
Last year, the university voted not to award Margaret Thatcher - a former student - an honorary title because of cuts in higher education.
The atmosphere would have frightened even Stalinists.
In the first days of the freshmen ’ s week, during which new students get to know each other and the tutors, I got a foretaste of what will happen in the future.
My experience was that the tutors not only tolerated Tory ’ s mockery of students, but even gladly took part in it.
Political issues such as the miners ’ strike, privatization, and rejection of the government ’ s sanctions against South Africa ’ s apartheid regime found their way into the wood-paneled rooms of the tutorial.
At my first of these events I was supposed to translate French texts from the 18th century into English. I had not been prepared for what was to come.
"Miss Wyatt," said tutor Harry Pitt (now deceased), "please translate the first paragraph."
I stumbled upon it.
Pitt was a little man with a face like cake dough, and quite spiteful.
"Do Thatcher's supporters refuse to learn French, or are they just stupid?" he asked me.
The other students giggled.
Tears rose in my eyes.
"I suggest that you take a few French lessons in your spare time - so if you're not too busy with your social activities," Pitt growled at me.
I returned to my room with my head hanging down.
That evening, I was sitting alone at dinner in college when someone lightly tapped me on the shoulder.
It was an English student from the second year named James who introduced himself as a member of the conservative student association.
"I know who you are," he said kindly.
Unfortunately, it is as it is.
Anyone suspected of being Tory is harassed.
It is bad enough for me, but they know that your father is close to Margaret Thatcher, so it will be worse for you.
Most Tory Tory first-year students pretend to be Labour Party supporters.
In a local pub I later tried to disguise myself.
I insisted that I did not agree with Mrs Thatcher on all points.
This trick proved unsuccessful.
A young student in philosophy, politics and economics, who ironically attended Eton College, which is considered to be conservative, said to me: 'You are the daughter of a fascist pig'.
You are polluted.
Other students shared his opinion.
I was perverted and dirty.
"How do Tories have sex?" one asked me.
They hit each other, right?
I felt like homosexuals must have felt before the more liberal legislation of the United States.
Would I ever manage to lead a normal life at Oxford University?
Would I be able to meet like-minded people only after dark?
Should I turn to the Labour Party and suppress my natural inclinations?
The three years that lay ahead of me expanded into a purgatory of ostracism and isolation in my mind's eye.
The only tutor who openly proclaimed himself Tory was Norman Stone, a professor of contemporary history based in my college.
He was hated not only for being a Conservative, but also for advising Thatcher on foreign policy and writing speeches for her.
He was rarely there.
He hated the place, found it provincial and petty, and rejected it for its Marxist, deterministic historical perspective.
In 1997 he accepted a professorship at Bilkent University in Ankara, Turkey.
"You won't be happy here," he told me.
I began to commute between Oxford and my parents ’ house and found refuge with more open-minded friends and family members in the city.
I told my father that I hated Oxford and why I did it.
He seemed unbelieving.
During his forties, all political views were accepted.
"But it's the best place in the world," he said timidly.
They would never do that, not in my city of dreaming spires.
Even my Communist friends always showed impeccable manners.
His wet eyes clouded.
Give it a chance.
I'm sure they just tease you.
It would break my heart if you left.
Exhausted by my frequent trips to London, my emotional resistance weakened.
One of my male friends, also Tory's supporters, had yielded to the pressure and renounced his convictions.
During a tutorial the following week, in which another history tutor seriously claimed that I was "an enemy of the people," I decided to do the same.
Although I secretly faded away in shame, I admitted that my parents had "brainwashed" me and called them "old idiots."
The relief lasted only a short time.
It was my father who nailed the last nail in the coffin of my Oxford ’ s career.
At the time, he wrote two columns a week in the Murdoch newspaper.
My door was locked.
I hid in my room, and after five minutes my pursuers gave up.
When they left, I packed a suitcase and took the first train to London.
I never returned.
You are welcome to call me a tearful flip-flop.
But no 18-year-old should ever have to endure such intimidation and malice in an educational establishment.
More tragically, it was Oxford - a university that not only spawned 14 Tory Prime Ministers, but hides behind an undeserved reputation for equality and freedom of thought.
"Valentino prefers elegance to celebrity"
On the occasion of the exhibition "Valentino - Master of Couture", which opened this week in London, ABC talks to Naty Abascal, Fiona Thyssen, Bornemisza and other famous customers of the Italian fashion designer.
Somerset House, the former residence of Isabel I of England, is the only place in the British capital worthy of hosting an exhibition of Valentino Garavani.
This was acknowledged by the designer at the opening of "Valentino - Master of Couture", a magnificent retrospective for which more than 130 dresses of haute couture have been assembled, created by his "Maison" in the last 50 years.
"I love this palace," he says with his distinctive Italian accent.
This exhibition concludes a story whose only protagonist is "il signore" Garavani, but which could not have been written without his distinguished clientele.
Valentino has always been fascinated by the stuffy and distant world of the nobility.
In the first room of this exhibition, which will be on view until 3 March, there is a large number of private letters and photos signed by the most exquisite aristocracy, from Princess Salimah Aga Khan to Princess Marie Chantal of Greece and Margaret of England to Lord Snowdon.
Valentino shows these personal memories as trophies of his social ascent from modest fashion designer in the town of Voghera in northern Italy to the idol of the international jet set.
Being in love with the nobility does not have to be a disadvantage.
“At least they don ’ t kick their butts on your magnificent carpet, as some beautiful celebrities from pop music do, ” says Baroness Fiona Thyssen, Bornemisza.
In the 60s and 70s they lived in the Alps and were good friends.
Valentino is a spectacular, generous and elegant host.
"We were all delighted when we were invited to his house in Gstaad," explains the ex-wife of "Heini" Thyssen, who is a close friend of forgotten beauties such as Marella Agnelli or Eugenie Niarchos.
Valentino has always preferred elegance to celebrity.
And yet he is a star.
Valeria Mazza in a dress by Valentino
Also the Argentinian model Valeria Mazza does not forget the charisma of the fashion designer.
Many years ago, after a fashion show at the Piazza di Spagna in Rome, we went to his home for dinner.
We were about 20 people, including Sharon Stone and John Kennedy Jr.
From every detail of his apartment, the decoration, the food and the music, one could recognize and feel his influence.
"Everyone who was invited felt important and loved," recalls the "TOP" model, which began her career at the 1995 Week of Haute Couture in Paris.
"He never goes out of fashion because his designs are works of art," she concludes.
Fashion Show of Origin
The life of Garavani is not a story of obsession, rather of mutual love.
He likes people with good education and the highest titles, and they love him.
One of the galleries at Somerset House has been transformed into a glorious 60-metre-long catwalk that suggests a role change: the user takes the model's place and walks along the catwalk to admire a dreamlike "audience" wearing Valentino's masterpieces, such as the dress Jackie Kennedy chose for her wedding to Aristóteles Onassis, the costumes that Monica Vitti wore in "La Notte", or a wool and leather coat that belonged to Empress Farah Diba.
In this audience of fashion dolls, names such as those of Sibilla de Luxemburgo, Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, Mette xen Marit of Norway, Rosario of Bulgaria or Sofía von Habsburg shine.
Naty Abascal and the Fashion Designer, 2006
Many of these customers say that the first Valentino is like the first love, "unforgettable".
I can still remember perfectly.
There was a pair of pants, a shirt, a vest type "Gillette" and a jacket from the autumn / winter "collection" 1971 "1972.
"It was a gift from him," says Naty Abascal, one of the designer's muses.
"I prefer him to everyone else because of his great love for women and because he emphasizes our beauty," adds the former Duchess of Feria.
I like the colors he uses very much; they have a lot of light and underline the face.
The proportions are perfect.
Also the princess and opinion leader of the fashion Patricia della Giovampaola d'Arenberg cannot forget the first time when she wore a Valentino.
When I lived in Italy as a teenager, I dreamed of finally having the age and the opportunity to wear one of his evening gowns...
At the end of the nineties it finally came to that.
I bought my first Valentino for a party in the castle of my cousin, Prince Edouard de Ligne.
It was a red dress with a flying skirt and a draped top with a décolleté that lives up to its name.
"It was a dream come true," says Rodrigo d'Arenberg's widow.
"Valentino does not depend on fashion, his obsession is timeless," explains this Italian aristocrat, who lives between Paris, New York and Buenos Aires.
The princess D'Arenberg keeps her evening dresses of the fashion designer "with absolute care", "because a dress is not only a dress, but also the associated memories".
The "King" of Fashion
The grand finale of the exhibition at Somerset House is the wedding dress of Marie Chantal Miller for her wedding with Pablo de Grecia in 1995.
It took four months of work and 25 "rags" (as the fashion designer called his seamstresses) to make this ivory silk dress with beads, twelve different embroideries and a four-and-a-half meter long tail.
According to journalist Suzy Menkes, the highest authority of the trade press, this dress was a milestone in haute couture at the end of the 20th century, "the return to the customers of the highest society".
For years tarnished with the elite's "savoir être", Valentino is now their best copy.
Cavaliere di Gran Croce (the highest distinction in Italy), Cavaliere del Lavoro, Commandeur de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, awarded the Legion of Honour, combines Garavani with as many honours as each of its customers' husbands.
"I have always noticed his refinement, his calm, his well-groomed and perfect appearance," admits D'Arenberg.
The last time I saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the Museum de Orsay.
He sat at the table of Countess Jacqueline de Ribes, a very good friend of mine.
"He was flawless; time leaves no trace on him".
And this says a princess...
The most difficult profession in the world: the human workhorses of Kawah Ijen
For four euros, the carriers of the Indonesian volcano put their lives and health at risk when they carry 70 kilos of sulphur over the steep, rocky paths.
There are people for whom their work is hell, and others who literally work in hell.
This is the case with Anto Wijaya, one of the 400 miners who earn their lives by extracting sulphur from the Kawah Ijen volcano in the east of the Indonesian island of Java.
To do this, it has to descend to the bottom of its crater every day, where the sulphurous gas emanating from the earth solidifies in contact with the air.
After breaking out large sulphur stones, which can weigh up to 70 kilos, he carries them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders along the steep paths made of stone.
It is only 250 meters to the top of the volcano, which rises to a height of 2386 meters, but the exhausted porters need more than 40 minutes to climb at turtle speed, keeping their balance and carefully setting their steps so that they do not slip and fall.
They know that every step can cost their lives, as happened to a French tourist who crashed years ago on the steep slopes of Kawah Ijen.
The miners of Kawah Ijen earn 5 euro cents for every kilogram of sulphur they extract.
Arrived at the top, they make their way between the tourists, whom they photograph like circus monkeys and walk with the tiring heavy baskets three kilometers to the scales, which a mining company has set up a little further down at an altitude of 1850 meters.
The company is PT Candi Ngrimbi, which since 1960 has been exploiting the deposits in the volcano and (never better said) its workers, paying them 662 Indonesian rupees (5 euro cents) for every kilo of sulphur.
They then sell it to the petrochemical industry for 10,000 rupees (83 euro cents) each, because this mineral is widely used in everyday life and is used to produce matches, fireworks, cosmetics, dynamite and even to bleach sugar.
"Since we usually carry 70 kg, we get about 46,000 rupees (3.8 euros) for each route," explains Anto, who normally runs three routes a day.
For each route it takes three hours, after which it is completely done, but at the end of the day it has 138,000 rupees (11.5 euros) together.
What looks like a miserable reward for such an almost inhuman effort, however, is three times what he would earn with the field work.
"The daily wages of the miners here, where 15,000 rupees (1.2 euros) are paid per day in the coffee harvest and the average monthly income is two million rupees (167 euros), is very high," explains the porter, who previously worked as a bricklayer on the tourist island of Bali.
There he earned 75,000 rupees (6.2 euros) a day, and the work was not so hard, but Anto returned with his family to Banyuwangi, a nearby village, for a reason that is as important in Indonesia as sulfur: "I married a girl from Bali, where they are Hindus, and I took her to Java to convert her to Islam."
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases.
For the past three years, the 27-year-old Anto has risked his life at the Kawah Ijen, whose sulfur has already left its first traces on him, although he covers his face with a mask and special glasses.
Anto has asthma, breathes with difficulty, coughs frequently and his eyes are irritated because of the poisonous gases from the volcano.
This is the price he has to pay to achieve his dream.
"I will be working here for another two years because I want to open a shop or learn Spanish or French," he promises in a more than acceptable English.
This likeable and intelligent, but punished by life, young man could work as a tourist guide, waiter or at the reception of a hotel, but instead he does the work of a stretcher.
It shares a dirty wooden hut with other carriers and gets up every morning at two o'clock, because the sulfur also emanates at night, where its characteristic yellow color shines bluish in the darkness.
Challenging the shadows, he climbs into the crater in the light of a small headlamp on his helmet, which he bought from his own money.
Approximately 400 carriers load the baskets of sulfur onto their shoulders at the bottom of the crater.
Despite its large profits, the mining company has not mechanized sulphur mining in order to save costs and does not supply any equipment to carriers who work on their own account and are paid for by weight.
You will also not receive a share of the 30,000 Rupees (2.5 Euros) supplement per camera that the guardians of this Natural Park, together with the entrance fee of 15,000 Rupees (1.2 Euros), charge tourists who come to photograph the volcano and the human carriages.
"This work is for animals and not for humans," protests Madrusin, a sturdy, 42-year-old porter who has been working at the Kawah Ijen for three decades since leaving school.
He is able to carry up to 110 kg and assures that he will carry on "as long as he can", because he needs the money for the education of his three children between the ages of 10 and 18.
I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano has been my whole life.
Even if the sulfur burns the throat and the eyes itch, if the wind turns suddenly and the miners get trapped in the thick pillars that rise from the crater, the men are so hard that nobody complains about serious illnesses... of course except the usual breathing problems, osteoarthritis, pain in the knees and blisters on the shoulders that have deformed from the weight of the baskets.
With the basket on his back, Unainik is only able to carry 50 kg at the age of 53.
Every day, he and his companions break 15 tons of sulfur from the volcano, which are transported by three trucks on a goat trail between the bushes to the camp in Tamansari, 18 kilometers away.
"I will not retire, I will die here, because the volcano has been my whole life," Unainik explains, opening his mouth wide with some teeth missing.
Of his five children, the oldest, aged 30, also works as a sulphur carrier.
Time passes, but misery continues generation after generation in one of the hardest professions in the world: that of those who work as human donkeys at the Kawah Ijen.
Singapore needs babies to save the economy
The Singaporeans blame the fact that they have no children on the career, the stress and the cost of the real estate and the raising of children.
"The population of Singapore must grow."
I am a patriotic husband, you are my patriotic wife: let us fulfil our civic duty and let us create life!
It seems unbelievable that the verses are part of an advertisement for mint candy, but nevertheless - or precisely because of this - they became a viral video on YouTube at the beginning of this year in Singapore.
The phrases are part of a rapper ’ s song that features local sayings such as “Push a bao ” (loaf) into the stove to make fun of the low birth rate in Singapore.
The advertising company BBH, which shot the video, preserves the hope that the commercial reaches in a funny way to draw attention to the problem.
Its creative director, Douglas Hamilton, says that he wanted to use the power of music to get people to do their "national duty".
This is something for the internet only, so we had to make it fun and funny.
This is the biggest problem in that country.
When it comes to reproduction, we are the worst in the world, so we realized that this is an issue that we had to deal with.
We knew that the government had tried many things, such as marketing perfume with pheromones or organizing speed dancing evenings (quick flirts).
It is possible that many of these ideas were creative, but they did not necessarily lead to success.
So we thought: why not do something as creative as possible to tackle this problem, such as composing a rap?
1,2 children
Those who do not take this issue lightly are the Singapore government.
Every year, it spends $1,300 on policies to encourage citizens to have more children.
A government package for married couples and parents grants up to $15,000 per child, extends maternity leave, and distributes tax benefits.
But everything has had little success so far.
Singapore is a rich, high-tech city-state in Southeast Asia, also known for its rulers ’ conservatism and strict social controls.
According to its national population authority, the birth rate currently stands at 1.2 children per woman.
The last time this rate was over 2 - also known as the replacement rate - was in 1976.
So why don ’ t Singaporeans have more children?
Tan Wei Ming, Director of Marriage and Family Policy at the National Population Agency, says that this is due to "better education" and "greater career opportunities."
“This has enabled people to get married and form a family, and to have many more options in terms of life goals and priorities, ” she explains.
These changes in social conditions have contributed to the higher number of single people and to the delay of marriage and births, the result of which is a reduction in the birth rate in Singapore.
Meanwhile, an immigration policy aimed at drastically increasing immigration in order to counteract the reduction of the population has led to resentment among the local population.
In Singapore, there are websites where the little-concealed xenophobia flourishes against many new immigrants, especially the Chinese, who are criticized for keeping wages low and not integrating.
The rise in immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why Singapore ’ s ruling party achieved its worst election result since independence last year.
Since the elections, an attempt has been made to correct the problem with higher contributions and contributions for foreign workers.
Unexpected consequences
While the falling birth rate has the well-known impact on a nation ’ s economic growth, tax revenues, health-care costs, and immigration policies, Singapore ’ s example also has unexpected consequences.
The government is trying to ensure that not so many small apartments are built.
It is already having an impact on the housing market.
The Department of Urban Development has begun to control the number of small apartments known as "shoeboxes" that can be built in certain areas of the city.
These apartments have a living area of 46 square meters and show a great sales success.
However, there is concern that they can promote the lifestyle of the single and that they discourage the construction companies from building large dwellings for families.
But Lim Yew Soon, general director of real estate company EL Developers, says that his "shoeboxes" sell much faster than larger residential units.
They are so popular, and the units are sold out days and even weeks faster than the larger residential units.
This means that they are much better for our cash flow.
He admits, however, that the new standards give developers clearer orientations that were previously hampered when they wanted to build too many small housing units within a project.
Too much stress
Singapore is a city-state.
Even if these new rules could pave the way for an increase in the national birth rate, talks with Singaporeans working in the financial district show that they will have little impact.
"People are very stressed, apartments and education are expensive, which is why many postpone it," says a young manager.
The children can get others.
"It is important for me to have my own money and time," says another man, about twenty years old.
Men and women cite their careers, the stress and cost of ownership and education as reasons for not having children.
That is why the Singaporeans have the final say when it comes to having children - the government can do so much about that.
The offline private offline is private online
Privacy
According to the dictionary, this is the property of private or "that area of private life where one is entitled to protection from any kind of interference".
What is private for someone under 16?
How is this definition applied to his everyday life and social networks?
Does he understand the dangers to which he exposes himself if he publishes situations on the Internet that he would not share in real life?
El Periódico interviewed five young people between the ages of 10 and 15 who are frequently online.
In four of the cases, they associated the term with "something very distinct" on a personal level and "to the password and the user" when applying it to social networks.
"I wouldn't reveal my deepest secrets in a post," says 10-year-old Jorge as he tries to explain the meaning of "private" in websites such as Facebook, Twitter, Hotmail and Windows Live Messenger, where he has accounts for two years.
"These are very confidential secrets, my mother may know them, but not the whole world," he confirms.
On FB I upload beautiful pictures of games.
I also spend my time with friends.
"I wouldn't share a photo that isn't of me, or of someone doing the fool," he says.
The boy is aware that it is wrong to publish obscene photos, of nudes, of crimes, or to write insulting or violent comments.
Jorge assured to know 35 friends he has in FB and nine followers in Twitter.
Most of them are relatives.
Including the mother who has the password to one of the accounts.
I signed up on Twitter to express myself and post interesting tweets.
"I don't know if anyone answers me, I just upload them," he adds.
"The social networks are entertaining, I can talk quickly with relatives in the distance or with friends," he says.
Asked, he answers that he would never accept an invitation from an unknown person.
Even if someone recommended a stranger to him, he would ignore it.
The case of 14-year-old José is different.
The teenager has user accounts in Hotmail, Facebook, My Space and Ask. In Ask he admits not to know 20 of the people he added to his friends list.
"That doesn't scare me, because we have something in common, for example music," he says.
According to the boy, no one gave him any hints or asked him for his address or telephone number.
"If someone harasses me or requests it from me, I will simply remove them from my account," he admits.
José contacted Ask after reading a recommendation on Twitter.
Experiences known today as cyberbullying are not unknown to the boy.
A friend's acquaintance was blackmailed in a social network.
They threatened him and demanded money.
"He never knew who it was," he said.
According to José, the victim has not closed his account.
"He only did it privately."
He then explains a number of steps to configure a user account securely.
Unlike Jorge, this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing situations.
Yes, I would do that if he was unpleasant to me or if I wanted to wipe one out of him.
"But I know this is cyberbullying," he explains.
Key issues
Marielos Porras, a teacher of English with a university degree in education and learning, believes that in order to guide children and young people, it must be understood that the purpose of social networks is to inform.
"The Internet emerged as a medium for searching for information, but with the appearance of these pages, the rules of the game have changed," she says.
Porras explains that academic Marc Prensky, holder of a Master ’ s degree in Pedagogy at Yale University and author of the work “Digital Natives and Immigrants ”, used these terms to explain the phenomenon.
The digital natives are they, the children and young people who have grown up with this technology.
"We are the digital immigrants who are supposed to teach them, when we are still learning," he says.
He explains that this is a complex issue "because we require them to have a defined criterion for what may be disseminated, published or said, and this at an age when maturity is not sufficient."
"They should also be selective when it is most important for them to be popular, to have thousands of friends without thinking about the consequences," he adds.
According to the expert, the most effective way to teach children and young people what privacy is, is to ask them questions that make them think.
"Telling them not to do it doesn't work," he says.
Porras then mentions some possibilities: There are things you would not tell a stranger, so why do you do it on the internet?
Or: Would you like to have a photo of yourself published, like the one you published about a friend?
Do you know what the others publish about you?
Did you ask other people for permission beforehand if you tagged photos of celebrations?
And one more question: Do everyone need to know what you are doing at every moment?
Another point is to make them understand that they must act online, as they do offline.
They are the same rules.
“Someone outside the Internet acts with respect, morality and other principles, and the same must apply to social networks, ” he explains.
Monitoring
Estuardo Guardia, university professor, primary school teacher and educational adviser, commented that it is indispensable that parents read the guidelines of social networks carefully.
When they understand all the sections, they have solid foundations to talk to their children about the importance of opening a user account on the Internet.
"For example, the age, or what you can share or publish," he explains.
According to Guardia, the children must be reminded of the lesson "You shall not talk to strangers".
Conclusion of the Unasur Summit without publication of the Lima Declaration
The 6th Summit of the Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) ended today in Peru without the publication of the Lima Declaration, which was announced beforehand and was to be signed theoretically by the seven leaders present.
Efe repeatedly sought access to the signed document at the Sixth Ordinary Session of the Heads of State and Government of Unasur. Sources in the State and Presidential Chancellery initially announced that they would hand it over after the enclosure, but then stated that it would be published at some time on the Peruvian Government website.
On questions about the text, they indicated that the content was set out by the President of Peru, Ollanta Humala, in brief statements to the press.
Journalists' access to information about the summit was limited at all times.
During the day, in the press room, only the picture of the presidential meeting without sound was broadcast with the message "private session, limited audio".
The little information circulating among the journalists was obtained from the press spokesmen of some of the Unasur governments present at the meeting, but not from the Peruvian press secretary.
The only document circulated during the day was the list of participating presidents, which caused discomfort among the hundreds of journalists from various national and international media who demanded more information.
Subsequently, the Presidency of Peru sent the media an e-mail with the "Final Declaration" of the Summit, which was the Humala Declaration and not the official document concluding the Summit.
Last October, Peru hosted the Third Summit between South America and the Arab States (ASPA), and yet again, despite strong press demands, the so-called Lima Declaration, which had previously been announced, was not published.
On the official ASPA website, you can see for yourself that the document was published last Tuesday.
At both international meetings, the Peruvian authorities stressed that the information systems were in place for journalists, but that they severely restricted access to information.
The Summit also concluded with a joint commitment by Chile and Peru to accept a ruling by the Court of Justice of The Hague settling a border dispute between the two countries.
The presidents of Peru, Ollanta Humala, and Chile, Sebastián Piñera, met during the regional meeting and confirmed that they would accept the decision of the ICJ, which begins on Monday in The Hague, to listen to the pleas of both sides in the trial that Lima initiated against Santiago.
"We will follow and execute the judgement on the differences that we are currently bringing before this international court", said Humala together with his Chilean counterpart.
"Chile has been, is and will continue to be a country that adheres to international law, seeks peaceful solutions to disputes, concludes agreements and submits to the international courts," adds Piñera, greeting Humala with a handshake in front of the flags of both countries.
The confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the ICJ came after Colombia brought an action against the Bogotá Agreement following a decision on the maritime borders with Nicaragua, which it considered to be a serious error, in which it agreed to submit to the judgments of this international court.
Present at the summit were the Presidents of Brazil, Dilma Rouseff, of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, of Bolivia, Evo Morales, and of Argentina, Cristina Kirchner.
Paraguay, which has been excluded from Unasur since 2011 following the removal of its President Fernando Lugo, did not participate in the meeting.
The host, President Ollanta Humala, opened the talks in the morning and concluded the summit shortly after lunch in Lima.
The head of state read the final document, in which he announced that 16 decisions had been made and that the lines of action for 31 projects between the South American countries for a total investment of 17 billion dollars had been defined.
Commenting on the decisions taken, he said that the countries of Unasur "will take significant steps towards the goal of South American citizenship, for which we are extending the decisions on residence rights."
He said that measures would be taken to "improve cooperation in the fight against insecurity in cities and organised transnational crime, as well as measures to improve access to medicines and the Internet at low prices in all areas of South America and to act jointly and efficiently in the event of natural disasters".
With the crisis in Europe, "economic consolidation (in Latin America) must not be allowed to take on triumphant features, but should serve to increase our output and show our peoples a better future," added Humala.
"We have decided to give priority to a series of 31 emblematic projects aimed at improving the spatial connections in South America and especially in rural and border areas... thus uniting our countries and opening up new forms of economy", said the Peruvian president in a read out statement.
Among these projects, five are Peruvian, located on the transverse axes of its territory from the coast to Brazil, two of which are intended to provide a better connection with Ecuador, although he gave no further details.
The final document also referred to the political situation in Paraguay.
"We hope that the electoral process in that country will serve for its readmission to the Union of South American Nations", from which it is currently excluded.
The need for Latin America to remain an integrated region for prosperity and peace and with good neighbourly relations was another aspect emphasised at the summit.
In this sense, before beginning his participation in the regional meeting, the President of Colombia, Juan Manuel Santos, said that he expected a meeting in Mexico on Saturday with his Nicaraguan counterpart, Daniel Ortega, in order to treat the maritime conflict with respect, following a judgment of the ICJ challenged by Bogotá.
"Maybe I'll meet with President Daniel Ortega tomorrow (Saturday)," Santos said.
"We will review all these avenues - they are not exclusive, and the agreement with Nicaragua also makes talks with Nicaragua necessary", he underlined.
"I hope to be able to tell President Ortega that we will treat this matter as civilized and respectful as possible," Santos added.
Santos and Ortega would meet on Saturday in Mexico, where they intend to attend the inauguration of the country ’ s new president, Enrique Peña Nieto.
As part of the Summit, the Defence Ministers of the bloc also met ahead of the Summit to adopt the 2013 Action Plan to strengthen dialogue and consensus on the defence of the region.
Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Brazil, Uruguay, Venezuela, Chile, Guyana, Suriname and Paraguay are members of UNASUR, although the latter is currently excluded.
Peru holds the presidency for the period of the regional bloc.
"South America must learn from the integration of its citizens", says Rafael Correa
The President of Ecuador, Rafael Correa, confirmed today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal in which "South America can indeed learn something from Europe."
Correa, who took part in the 6th Summit of Presidents of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur), which took place in Lima, told the state television in Peru that the Europeans "perished in the Second World War and in other conflicts" and "are now practically a fatherland."
In this sense, he defended the project to create a South American citizenship, which will advance the member states of Unasur.
"Free movement of citizens and workers must be achieved in all South American countries, as is already the case in the Andean Community, but there are still reactionary sectors that want to return to the past," he warned.
The President of Ecuador also advocated the reorganization of the Organization of American States (OEA) with a view to reducing the influence of the Anglo-Saxon states and taking into account those who signed the San José Convention on Human Rights.
Those who teach never commit themselves to anything, and in return we the South Americans always sign everything.
"It is incomprehensible that the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is based in Washington and funded by the United States," he said, alluding to the political asylum granted by Ecuador to the founder of WikiLeaks, Julian Assange.
Correa asserted that he did not regret this decision, because he had not betrayed his principles, but had complied with his "deep democratic values and views on human rights."
He added that there were "reasonable suspicions at the time that Assange would be extradited to a third country and that his case would not be followed."
He also criticised the Swedish judiciary for requiring him to be interrogated on his territory for an alleged sexual offence, while "Swedish case-law allows for this by means of a videoconference that could have been carried out through the Ecuadorian Embassy in London."
Correa said that there was a risk that Assange's health and mental condition would be compromised.
"Since he has been in our embassy, I have not spoken to him, but the Ambassador has informed me that he has a slight problem with his lungs, but not a serious one," said the Head of State of Ecuador.
There was, however, a danger that he would suffer physical and psychological damage because he was trapped in a confined space and could not do any physical exercises outdoors.
"That would affect everyone's health," he added.
Correa said that the solution to the asylum granted to Assange at the Ecuadorian embassy in London since June was to grant him a free pass to travel to Ecuador, and that this was in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judicial authorities. He underlined that there had been talks with London to find a solution for the imprisoned founder of WikiLeaks.
We are not dealing with human rights, we are not using that word in this case, but there have been constant talks.
"The solution to this problem lies in the hands of the UK, Sweden and the European judicial authorities, because Assange's lawyer, Baltazar Garzón, is conducting a series of proceedings at various European levels," he said.
And "if Britain grants this carte blanche tomorrow, I think it will be done."
And if Sweden interrogated Mr Assange at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London or via Skype, as Swedish law allows and has been done in other cases, the problem is over.
Correa took the opportunity to affirm himself as a defender of press freedom, saying that what he did not tolerate was "the mediocrity, the evil intention and the lie that invalidate freedom of expression."
"The biggest enemies of press freedom are not the wicked and perverse politicians, but bad journalists who seek profit and blackmail," he said.
In this sense, he congratulated himself on the fact that Ecuador is no longer dominated by such journalists "nor by bankers or hegemonic and petty-bourgeois countries," and anticipated that if re-elected, he "will deepen the revolution in order to continue the path in this right direction."
Correa also supported the decision to maintain the veto on Paraguay in Unasur at least until his next election, arguing that the organism "must be tough and not allow any opportunism and a coup d'etat disguised as legal" because it "destroyed the legitimacy of democracy in Paraguay."
The President of Ecuador also considers the desire of his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to negotiate with Nicaragua the maritime borders between the two countries "absolutely legitimate" now and after the judgment of the International Court of Justice in The Hague, which favoured the maritime sovereignty of Nicaragua.
At present, this judgment is not being implemented.
It is a problem between a South American and a Central American state.
Conflicts are inevitable, but they must be overcome in the pursuit of a common path.
They must be dealt with comprehensively so that they can be overcome and forward-looking.
He also relied on a good conclusion to the disputes over the maritime borders between Peru and Chile before the same court, stating that "it is right for Latin America to appeal to international bodies if both countries undertake to accept the judgment, even if it is very harsh."
With regard to the possibility of running as a candidate for the next presidential elections in Ecuador to achieve his third consecutive mandate, he stated that he sees this possibility "with much optimism and joy, although it is sometimes very difficult."
Correa assured that if he lost the elections in February 2013, he would withdraw from political life.
Power has never interested me personally, but in such unfair circumstances as in Ecuador, this socio-economic poverty can only be corrected by political power.
"My political movement had the belief that it was I who guaranteed this likely victory, so I must shoulder that responsibility," he said.
If I were to win, it would be my last term as President, after which I withdraw from public life.
This also applies if we lose.
"That's decided," he said.
Correa also referred to the treatment of the health problems of the President of Venezuela, Hugo Chávez, in Cuba.
I have just spoken to the Vice-President of Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro, who told me that he had gone there for planned, routine treatment and that it was expected that he would be able to return to Cuba after the election campaign.
"It does not in any case mean a relapse in the state of health of President Chávez," he commented.
The Ecuadorian Head of State today took part in the 6th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Union of South American Nations (Unasur) in Lima, which ended with a call for greater regional integration to ensure sustainable progress, equality and security.
The cause of death from AIDS today is too late recognition
Fabrizio was 21 years old when he was confirmed as HIV positive.
"It was as if a bomb hit," he says of the moment when he received the diagnosis, which the doctor tried to "weaken" without apparent success.
He hid it from his family.
He decided to take care of his illness on his own and began to learn about it, with such commitment that he was celebrating his 43rd birthday.
He is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients of the HIV unit of the Hospital Civil de Guadalajara (HCG), where he came after several fights in 1994.
Fabrizio has been living with the human immunodeficiency “virus ” (HIV) for 22 years, which was hard to imagine at the beginning of the 1990s, when there were many doubts, few treatment options and more stigmata.
At the time, even the director of an IMSS clinic avoided saying goodbye "because it led to an impasse."
At the time, AIDS was synonymous with death.
Today, it is also possible to survive this syndrome with quality of life.
However, there are still many people who come to the clinic who are unaware of their illness and who have already been damaged by the virus and have exhausted their immune system and are victims of opportunistic infections.
31 years after the appearance of AIDS in the world, i.e. after the appearance of the first reported cases, "the great success today means that the survival of a patient receiving treatment on time is exactly the same as the survival of the general population," said HCG HIV unit head Jaime Andrade Villanueva, stating that this information was supported by a respected scientific publication in April this year.
The specialist in infectious diseases and HIV / AIDS, Andrade Villanueva, commented that since 2008 scientists have concluded that while AIDS is not a death sentence, the years of survival and quality of life depend on the degree of impairment of the immune system of the individuals at the beginning of treatment, and that those who are not addicted to drugs have greater chances: up to 30 years at a count of 200 CD4 and 50 years at a count of 500 CD4.
Simply put, the above means that those who receive a positive diagnosis of HIV at the age of 25 can "easily live to 75 as long as they are under control", the skilled person explained.
To understand this progress properly, it is important to remember that Mexicans today have an average life expectancy of 76 years.
Even if mortality has declined significantly in recent years (in Mexico, the number of people dying from AIDS has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 (ONUSIDA annual report)), it is nonetheless true that, since the appearance of AIDS, 60% of the patients recorded in the national database have died.
In Jalisco alone, 255 people died in 2011, and by the month of May this year, there had been 187 deaths, although it is claimed that since 2005 there has been universal access to antiretroviral drugs.
- So why do people still die from it?
- In my opinion, the problem is not access to treatment.
This is my opinion, and so is in our hospital.
At least for the past 12 years, we have not had any problems with medication, and the problem is that people come in a very advanced state because they do not know their infection status, that is, in very late stages of the disease.
He makes a striking statement: "Nine out of ten patients come to us if they already have an accompanying infection. In order to be able to influence the global mortality rate, earlier diagnoses are required, which is why all persons who require this must be offered massive detection tests."
This proposal is supported by the experts and officials of the Consejo Estatal de Prevención del Sida en Jalisco (Coesida) and also by patients such as Fabrizio, who had his test done in a private laboratory, for the sole reason that it was done by a friend of his who, despite his young age, was already in the AIDS phase and even had Kaposi ’ s sarcoma (a cancerous tumour), which is one of the usual complications.
Everything is different when you know you have AIDS.
Some think that they will die and do not want to hear anything.
"If I have to die, I'd rather burst three times," they say in my case.
The change was towards improvement, I eat well, exercise and take the medication.
Today his parents only know that he had cancer.
I live a normal life like everyone else.
"I work, I do a lot, I have an active but responsible sex life, I take care of my health and that of the other person", explains Fabrizio, who agreed to share his intimate details with MILENIO JALISCO, in order to animate with his testimony those who are afraid today within the framework of the worldwide AIDS day.
They should take the test if they belong to the risk group. The earlier they know whether they are HIV positive, the better, and if they already know the diagnosis, they should learn how to live responsibly like everyone else.
His message is a summary of the fight against AIDS in 2012.
Condoms behind the counter
There are big gaps between the health programmes and the ordinary citizen, explains Ricardo Salazar, a journalist from Guadalajara who has taken up the cause of HIV.
And the most important thing is prevention.
In the places designated for this, "the distribution of condoms has actually been increased; previously they were handed over individually, now they give us packages of a hundred pieces, which is already good, but there are still people who do not have access to a condom," he said.
Young people are among the people at risk for new infections.
"What do you need them for?" is a common mockery of social workers, orientation staff in schools, employees in pharmacies and in the health care system, to whom young people do not want to expose themselves, the correspondent assured.
He proposed to reorient this inefficient distribution; the condoms should not only be behind the counter, but in dispensing devices in public toilets of facilities frequently visited by young people.
Promiscuity should not be promoted.
They should not be paid the beer and motel, as Governor Emilio González replied when asked if condoms would be distributed under his administration.
"Sexuality does not look like this; it is best to bring the condoms closer to those who already engage in sexual activity," he summed it up.
Key data from Jalisco
There are 13,435 cumulative cases (12,158 AIDS and 1,317 HIV).
Nationally, the state is ranked fourth in new and cumulative AIDS cases, and 13th in HIV cases.
92% of infections occur through sexual intercourse, 6% through the blood and 2% perinatally.
It is estimated that there are 50,000 people living with HIV, because for each registered case there are 4 or 5 people who do not know.
Since the Court of Appeal of the United States has upheld a judgment that does not recognise the restructuring of the liabilities of the Vitro Group, which was achieved through a commercial exchange rate in Mexico, a disastrous precedent is being set for any national company with branches in the neighbouring country that has payment problems.
It could be said, therefore, that the procedures for the survival of the companies that allow Mexican laws do not apply in the land of the stars and stripes, contrary to international agreements.
In practice, the recognition on 15 June of Judge Harlin Hale ’ s judgment at the Northern District Court in Bancarrotas in Texas has left Mexican companies helpless in the face of confiscation of their property across the Bravo River.
However, the decision opens the door for the largest glass manufacturer in Mexico to refer three inconsistencies to the United States Supreme Court.
While the judge of the case points out that the creditors must be subject to the bankruptcy laws of the United States, the Court of Appeal of the Fifth Circuit, based in New Orleans, initially states that the main proceedings are the trade discourse dealt with in Mexico.
The first point would mean that international cooperation in insolvency proceedings of companies with a transnational profile is not known.
Indeed, to this end, the United Nations Model Law for the Unification of International Trade Law was created, with the American Law Institute as the arbitrator.
Secondly, the judgment stipulates that, without the votes of the companies, the necessary majority for the restructuring of the liabilities would not have been obtained after recognition of the liabilities of the assets held by the branches of Vitro with its parent company.
However, this possibility is recognized by Mexican law.
In fact, Vitro is not the first case where this scheme has been approved.
There are half a dozen examples, including Agremex and Comercial Mexicana, whose liabilities among the group ’ s companies have been confirmed by the Instituto Federal de Concursos Mercantiles.
It is also true that, after deducting the votes of the branches, the creditors of Vitro, the creditors who brought actions against Vitro before the courts of the United States, i.e. the vultures, funds such as Aurelios Capital, Aurelios Convergencia, Elliot Internacional and Liverpool Limited, would not have obtained a majority.
The vote would have been 45 percent against 37 percent.
This is not taken into account by the Court of Appeal.
On the other hand, Vitro is to blame for his difficult situation since 2008 in the context of the great economic crisis in the United States, which hit the country.
That is why the González Sada family appeals to the same Court of Appeal, so that the vote takes place in plenary, that is, of all the judges, because only three of them voted.
Failure to do so will result in an appeal by the Cerciorare, which requires a higher court to review the case, in this case the Supreme Court of the United States.
What is serious about this case is that the Court has set aside a document sent by the Mexican Government under the Figura amicus curiae (Friend of the Court), which describes the procedure carried out by Vitro under the Commercial Conduct Act and points out that it had adhered strictly to the agreements signed by both countries in order to comply with Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States.
It also points out that the country is subject to the principles of the United Nations Commission on International Trade, i.e. the established rules for cases of cross-border insolvency, which guarantee equality between debtors and creditors.
Two-band carambola: a hit for Vitro and for the country.
General balance
After several months without progress, the Asociación Sindical de Pilotos Aviadores (Confederation of Pilotos Aviators) has finally made progress in denouncing the former owner, Gastón Azcárraga Andrade, accused of fraudulent management.
The petition cited by Carlos Díaz Chávez Morineau has now filed a criminal case against the National Banking and Securities Commission, which is accused of obstructing the judiciary.
Subsequently, the supervisory authority has systematically refused to inform the central administration of the Republic about a transaction carried out by the entrepreneur in order to withdraw 198 million pesos from the F / 589 fiduciary account of Bank IXE under the name Mexicana de Aviación.
These funds were used for the acquisition of shares in Administradora Profesional de Hoteles (the professional hotel management).
As you know, Azcárraga Andrade is the main shareholder of the Posadas hotel chain.
Dragon Mart Is Surrounded
At a weekend meeting at a forum of the University of the Caribbean, a group of national and foreign environmentalists, academics, entrepreneurs and general members of civil society decided to create a broad front to oppose the opening of the Chinese Dragon Mart in Cancún.
As you know, we are talking about a huge sales and distribution center in Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean with products from the country beyond the Wall, supplemented by a residential area for the employees of 150 companies.
Prior to this, the Canacintra (the National Chamber of Processing Industry) managed to unite the governors of the south-east to oppose the monumental structure that destroyed some protected areas and is the mother of all the threats to industry.
ACTA Is Dead
Because the government did not comply with a request from the Senate to explain the conditions and circumstances under which the Mexican ambassador to Japan signed the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement known as ACTA, the matter has already been filed according to the Mexican Institute of Intellectual Property.
As you know, these measures were taken even though the Senate had not considered the possibility because it considered them to be an infringement of freedom of expression on social networks.
Homex Long-Term
In an effort to pay long-term liabilities without compromising short-term liabilities, the construction company Homex is putting over 500 million pesos of stock exchange certificates on the market.
The issue is the first of four identical issues promising an interest payment every 28 days.
Founding of Competival
Formed by NYCE, Quality and Kernet, leading companies in information technology, a group of companies was founded under the name of Competival, whose goal is to serve the software cluster market in Central and South America.
The corresponding investments amount to more than 1.5 billion dollars.
Héctor "Hetin" Reyes: "Basketball was my life"
The globetrotter of basketball, Héctor "Hetin" Reyes, has been associated with basketball for more than 60 years and has travelled the world.
Few in Puerto Rico have such a large intellectual collection of the history of basketball in the country as Hector "Hetin" Reyes.
Before being tied to the wheelchair by a stroke in 2008, Rexes was part of this sport for 6 years, whether as a player of lower classes, player of the first national league, representative and manager in the BSN with the Vaqueros de Bayamón or president of the basketball federation.
"All my life I put on many hats in basketball, even several at the same time, when I was president of the BSN, general manager of the national team and president of the association in the 90s," Reyes remembered during a visit of Primera Hora to his home in Bayamón, where he lives with Isabel, his faithful wife for more than 50 years.
"Basketball was my life."
Reyes does not exaggerate with this statement.
The walls of his house are almost all decorated with photos and memories of his long career and bear witness to them.
Bayamón in the Heart
The most emotional memories are those of his time with the Vaqueros from the mid-1950s as a player until 1982, when he celebrated his 15th anniversary as co-managing director of the club.
"These were my best years, which I enjoyed the most, because I could be part of eight championships of the Vaqueros since 1967 as a managing director, co-managing director or coach.
There were many fulfilling years, including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975.
And then I said goodbye to a championship in 1981, the year Jerome Mincy debuted at BSN.
From then on, "Cuco" took over Ortiz, who was a very good administrator, "says Reyes.
I remember that Gene Bartow, who worked as a coach here and was employed at the University of Alabama (Birmingham), said to me: "I have a very strong player, 2 metres tall.
Do you want him? "
And that was the beginning of Mincy, one of the best players Puerto Rico ever had.
Bartow then recommended the free-throw specialist Raymond Gausse, who became naturalized and was one of our best throwers.
I remember how he said that if Mincy had enabled a championship for Bayamon, Gausse would provide another.
The championship of the Vaqueros with Gausse was granted to him, but already from a distance, because he was already in the top position of the federation in 1988.
At this time he preferred to enjoy his executions and that of Mincy in the national team.
I remember when we won the pre-Olympic tournament in Mexico against the USA for the first time.
Then came the World Cup in 1990, where we took fourth place, which should have been bronze, if it hadn ’ t been for this Canadian referee who made us repeat the last move for the second time, said Reyes.
Was this group of the 1990 World Cup the best national team you have ever seen?
She is one of the best, as well as the one who won at the Olympics in 2004 against the Dream Team.
But my favorite is the team from the 1991 Pan-American Games in Cuba, where we won gold and offered a fight to the US team, as they did when they won bronze against us at the World Cup.
In this team were not only Mincy, Gausse, Ramon Rivas, Fico López and "Piculín" (Ortiz), but also the young players (Javier) "Toñito" Colón and James Carter, the brothers León (Francisco and Edgar) and Mario "Quijote" Morales, who could not be there in 1990 because of a knee injury.
A team that was perhaps not the best in terms of personalities, but with which we won a gold medal and which gave us great pleasure, was that of the pre-Olympic tournament in 1995 in Neuquén, Argentina.
With players like "Canito" Nieves, Pablo Alicea and the young Rolando Hourruitiner replacing the banned players due to the events at the Pan American Games in Mar del Plata, we won the gold medal against every forecast.
Who was the best player in Puerto Rico?
That was without doubt Piculín Ortiz.
His numbers at the level of international tournaments are impressive.
No one in Puerto Rico has dominated this level as much as Piculín.
And this without considering his career in the various leagues in which he played.
Who was the best coach in Puerto Rico?
This is a difficult question.
We had a number of good coaches like Julio Toro, Flor Meléndez, Carlos Morales, Raymond Dalmau, Armandito Torres.
Of the boys, I like the work of Leo Arill.
What do you think is the best thing you have achieved?
I was part of the most successful era of the national team from 1988 to 1995, which at the beginning of the 1990s included up to 17 teams in a single season.
What do you still have to do?
There are things I would have introduced, such as the regionalisation of the lower categories.
That the boys in Ponce, for example, only play in their area and only meet teams from other corners of the island in the national playoffs.
Today the children make unnecessary many trips and games.
At least I see the result of prescribed training and courses for coaches, table, officials and referees.
I am proud of that.
What are you doing today?
I like listening to music, watching videos of music from my time on YouTube, enjoying my grandchildren and occasionally going to a basketball game.
And of course I enjoy the company of my wife Isabel, who has always been at my side.
Larry Hagman is Dead
Larry Hagman was born on September 21, 1931 in Forth Worth (Texas) and became famous worldwide with his role as John Ross Ewing, better known as "J.R." in the television series "Dallas", where he played an unscrupulous, insidious and manipulating businessman.
Larry Hagman, whose role as the oil magnate J.R. Ewing in the television series "Dallas" became a symbol of greed in the 80s, is dead.
He was 81 years old.
Hagman, who returned this year as J.R. in a new season of "Dallas", died Friday afternoon due to cancer complications according to a family press release to The Associated Press by Warner Bros., producer of "Dallas".
"Larry was back in his beloved native Dallas, where he once again played the iconic role he liked most," the family said.
Larry ’ s family and his closest friends were with him in Dallas to celebrate Thanksgiving.
Linda Gray, who played the role of his wife in the original and subsequent series, was with Hagman when he died in the Dallas hospital, her publicist Jeffrey Lane said.
He gave joy to all who knew him.
He was creative, generous, funny, funny, loving and talented, and I will miss him very much.
"He was an original person and lived life to the fullest," Gray said in a statement.
Hagman was diagnosed with liver cirrhosis in 1992, and he admitted drinking a lot for years.
In 1995, a malignant tumour was diagnosed in his liver and he underwent a transplant.
In the years before "Dallas" Hagman became known on TV as a nice guy in the years 1965 to 1970 with the sitcom "Bezaubernde Jeannie" of the TV station NBC.
There he played the astronaut Tony Nelson, whose life is turned upside down when he meets an attractive "Dschinn" (played by Barbara Eden), who will live with him at home.
He also starred in two short-lived comedies, "The Good Life" (NBC, 1971 "72) and" Here We Go Again "(ABC, 1973).
To his cinematical works belonged well-judged roles in "The Group", "Harry and Tonto" and "Primary Colors".
But it was his masterful interpretation of the enchantingly despicable J.R. that made Hagman a superstar.
The CBS series about the Ewing Clan and other characters in its vicinity was aired from April 1978 to May 1991.
The slogan "Who shot at J.R.?", intended to create anticipation for an episode full of emotion where the character of Hagmann was almost killed, led to international speculation, and millions of dollars were wagered in betting houses.
The series thus reached a record attendance at that time.
When the answer became known in a chapter in November 1990, it was seen by an average of 41 million viewers, who turned "Dallas" into the second most watched entertainment program since the end of "MASH" in 1983, which had 50 million viewers.
It was Kristin, the sister-in-law of J.R. (interpreted by Mary Crosby) who had shot.
J.R. had made her pregnant and threatened to portray her as a prostitute if she did not leave the city. However, others also had reasons to see him dead.
Hagman interpreted the role of Ewing as a corrupt, insatiable man with a charismatic smile: a sneaky businessman and unfaithful husband who strove to implant his alcoholic wife Sue Ellen (Linda Gray).
"I know what should be written on the gravestone of J.R.", Hagman said in 1988.
It should read "Here rests the honourable citizen J.R. Ewing".
This is the only deal he has not won.
Victoria Principal, co-star in the original series, recalled Hagman on Friday as an "enormous personality on and off the screen."
It is unforgettable and irreplaceable for millions of worshippers in the world, and it remains in our hearts for those of us who have been fortunate enough to know and love it.
Ten episodes of the new edition of "Dallas" were broadcasted a few months ago with great success on the TV channel TNT.
The recording of five chapters for the second season was completed, and a sixth chapter was being filmed, informed the station.
There was no immediate explanation from Warner or TNT of how the loss of Hagmann would be handled in the series.
Born in Fort Worth, Texas, he was the son of actress and singer Mary Martin, who played classical works such as "South Pacific" and "Peter Pan".
Martin was still a teenager when she got Larry during her marriage to lawyer Ben Hagman.
He tried his luck on the theater stages in New York at the beginning of the 50's, afterwards he served in the air forces in England from 1952 to 1956.
There he met and married the young designer Maj Axelsson.
The couple had two children, Preston and Heidi, and they lived for a long time in the Californian city of Malibu, where many celebrities live.
In 2001 he titled his memoirs "Hello Darlin: Tall (and Absolutely True) Tales about My Life".
“I didn ’ t write anything that I thought might harm or in any way affect someone, ” the Associated Press said at the time.
After the liver transplant, he campaigned for liver donations and worked as a volunteer in a hospital to assist anxious patients.
"I advise them, I encourage them, I meet them when their operations are imminent and after," he explained in 1996.
I would like to give them some comfort, such as' do not worry, it is a bit uncomfortable the first time, but you will be fine '.
He also campaigned against smoking and participated in several campaigns.
Beginning of the course that studies the "End of the World"
Each week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
Every semester, when the religion professor decided to hold a course on the end of the world, he knew that he had an irresistible hook at his disposal: the end of the "long backward count" of the Mayan calendar on December 21, which many people believed meant the end of the world.
But Charmé had no idea what to expect in the following two months: the destructive hurricane Sandy, which some have called "Deudarmaggedon", and a growing conflict involving Israel, the place that Christian theorists believe the Apocalypse will begin.
“I didn ’ t realize that this would be the most apocalyptic semester ever, ” Charmé told Rutgers University students this week in Camden, New Jersey.
If someone analyses what has happened in the world today as if we were thirty days away from it, it would be a really good period.
And he reminds us that evil is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality.
And he is not the only professor to offer courses on the "end of the world" this semester, which is supposed to be the last in history.
In Temple, Associate Professor Barry Vacker gives the course "Media, Culture and the End of the World."
Each week, students study apocalyptic topics such as nuclear war, zombies, virus and germs, and global warming.
"We are analyzing why these ideas spread over time," he said, as well as the way hypothetical scenarios are offered that lead to a certain human behavior.
For example, if nuclear material falls into the hands of terrorists, war could break out.
This month, the students analyzed films with apocalyptic content and examined how they could be compared to real life.
"I have tried to inform the students about what is possible, probable, credible and impossible," said Vacker.
On the main campus of the University of Pennsylvania, the professor of Latin American history Matthew Restall and his colleague Amara Solari, an associate professor of art history and anthropology, have formed a team to offer a course with the simple title "The End of the World".
“We won ’ t take up 2012 so that we can always keep the option of setting a new course in case the world doesn ’ t go down, ” said Restall.
Despite the 'imminent doom', students have to study, create projects and take final examinations.
In Penn State, the final exam is held on the eve of the Apocalypse, so students have no other chance than "to continue working until the night when the world is supposed to end," said Restall.
The courses were very popular.
"There were no more places in two hours," said Restall about his course for high-average students, which was filled with 35 students.
For weeks before the start of the semester, we received emails from students asking if there were still places available.
For their part, the students assure that the course is among the most interesting.
“It ’ s fascinating to see what people are doing to comfort themselves, ” said Bridgid Robinson, a 23-year-old student in Rutgers, Camden for Religion and Sociology from Haddonfield, New Jersey.
The apocalyptic mentality of sects or religions is really only a question of comfort or its absence.
25-year-old Will Wekesa, a student of psychology and nursing, claims to have seen all the apocalyptic films.
"I have never heard of teaching where this is taught," he said.
I enjoy it.
But none of the students questioned - much less a professor - claimed to believe in the last date of December 21.
"Our first project dealt with the Mayan prophecy, and in some way we discredit it," said Julie Zeglen, a student last year in Temple, 21 years old and from West Chester.
The Mayans never predicted the end of the world; it is only a key point in the calendar, said Restall.
But he notes that there is an apocalyptic fear in Western society that goes back several centuries, when people responded to changes in their environment by predicting the end of the world.
The Internet has increased this speculation.
"Elsewhere people don't think that way," he says.
This is mainly the case in the English-speaking world.
Joseph Dougherty, a professor of religion at La Salle University, who teaches in the Philippines this year, quickly answers the question of whether he would know a course on the "End of the World" there.
"The Philippines do not participate in the end of the world," he wrote as an allusion to an exception by a higher authority.
We have a pardon from the Pope.
Restall pointed out that over the years the Last Judgment spoke for many days, saying that if nothing happens on December 21, "people will immediately think of a new date," or philosophizing that December 21 is the beginning of a seven-year period after which the end of the world will come.
Students and professors take this date lightly.
Several said that they wanted to go to celebrations about "the end of the world".
“Maybe I ’ ll call some friends so we can laugh together, ” said Samira Ford, a 20-year-old communications student.
