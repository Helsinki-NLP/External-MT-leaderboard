28-year-old chef found dead in San Francisco Mall
A 28-year-old chef, who recently moved to San Francisco, has been found dead in the staircase of a local mall.
The victim's brother testified that he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm him. "At last he went uphill again."
The body, found Wednesday morning in the Westfield Mall, was identified as 28-year-old Frank Galicia from San Francisco, the San Francisco Forensic Department reported.
The San Francisco Police Department said that the death was classified as murder and the investigation is ongoing.
The victim ’ s brother, Louis Galicia, told ABS station KGO in San Francisco that six months ago, Frank, who used to work as a chef in Boston, got his dream job as a chef at Sons & Daughters Restaurant in San Francisco.
A spokesman for the Sons & Daughter said that they were "shocked and devastated" by his death.
"We are a small team that works like a close family and we will miss him painfully," the spokesman continued.
Our thoughts and condolences are with Frank ’ s family and friends at this difficult time.
Louis Galicia stated that Frank initially lived in hostels, but that, "things went up the hill for him at last."
"He found an apartment, he had a girlfriend," Louis Garcia told KGO.
Louis Galicia said that he could not imagine anyone wanting to harm his younger brother.
He was a kind person with a big heart.
His way of connecting with his family was to always cook something for us, to prepare dinner for us, "said Louis Galicia.
He never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation.
He was the brother who swam with the current.
"In all that goes wrong in the world, he was that rough diamond that shone brightly every day," he said.
Anyone with information about the case is kindly requested to call the SFPD ’ s telephone number 415, 575, 4444.
Jennifer Aniston: I'm always put in drawers
Jennifer Aniston doesn ’ t always have to be perfect or successful.
The Hollywood Star has now made it unmistakably clear in an interview.
"I am always put in drawers or get labels glued on from the outside, which usually have little to do with me and reality."
"I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful."
"Honestly, these things tend to smelt to me."
Jennifer Aniston (47) can only laugh that she is considered "Miss Perfect", as she explains in the current "Cosmopolitan".
According to the magazine, the actress prefers to spend her time at home, watching TV with a relaxed bun and Mexican food.
"We women don't have to be married or have children in order to be perfect," says the Hollywood star.
In her new movie "Mother's Day - Liebe ist kein Kinderspiel" Aniston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons.
The film will be screened on the 25th of August.
Golfer Langer receives the sport pyramid
His experiences on the horse are manageable.
At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer and a few colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.
It was a premiere for the 58-year-old.
CHIO: "Golden Sport Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer
After a few minutes the horses remembered their closing time, they galloped quickly home to the feeding troughs.
One kilometer at this speed, I was scared.
"It was not a good experience," says Langer.
And that was the end of the riding career.
On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all times - 101 tournament victories - was again close to horses.
He let himself be led with his family over the plant of the ALRV, on a horse he swung himself not even for photo purposes.
Langer was in Aachen for the first time and thus also at the CHIO.
The reason was quite convincing.
The German Sports Aid presented the man from Anhausen with the Golden Sports Pyramid at a small gala.
The likeable sportsman does not lack awards.
German Federal Cross of Merit, Silver Laurel Leaf, Champions' Tour, Player of the Year...
Even the British Queen has already ennobled him.
Langer is the 18th winner of the Sports Pyramid.
In Aachen on Saturday he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler.
"This award means a lot to me", says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting success, but also for social commitment".
Langer has been promoting young talent for decades.
And so he immediately passed on the prize money of 25,000 euros.
With 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US Masters winner was admitted to the "Hall of Fame of German Sports" on Saturday.
The award winners include the track and field athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnast Eberhard Gienger, the fencers Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the rower Peter ܢ Michael Kolbe, the bob-bob rider Meinhard Nehmer, the judoka Frank Wieneke, the show jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handball player Erhard Wunderlich.
Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.
After the official part, the illustrious company went to the show jumping stadium, where the Lavazza Prizes ran.
Bernhard Langer kept his distance from the big animals.
Comparing Clinton and Trump ’ s Economic Policy: It ’ s all about the money
Investing in infrastructure and preventing the TTP is what both Clinton and Trump want.
But the two US presidential contenders disagree on tax and energy policy, as well as on a fundamental issue.
The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is fundamentally philosophical.
The, on the role of the state.
Trump wants to keep them small if in doubt and warns how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate it to death, he says.
He himself, however, would be very different, Trump claims.
He said he would massively reduce regulations and advocate far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies.
Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to perform, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open up and needs money for this.
That is why taxes on the rich would be increased, she says.
Interestingly, both are very close to the issue of infrastructure.
Trump and Clinton say they must invest in them almost word for word.
The democratic candidate even announces the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.
Government infrastructure investment programs are classic Democratic policies, and are strongly opposed by, say, the Republican wing ’ s critical Teaparty.
So Trump may face intra-party discussions.
The differences in energy and climate policy are clearer.
Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and restart coal production in the US.
Oil extraction should also be possible in so far protected areas, he wants to cancel the Paris climate protection agreement.
Clinton, on the other hand, explicitly wants to expand renewable energies with her investment program and demands: "One country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."
"It will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."
But not only in terms of infrastructure - the two competitors are not too far apart in international trade agreements either.
Neither wants to sign the TPP, the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement.
At the same time, they do not want to isolate the US from international trade - they simply want to protect American jobs better.
Clinton calls for them to be paid better.
The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a pittance.
She wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.
What Trump wants to do on this issue is not entirely clear: he says that the minimum wage must be raised, then he says that it must not be changed.
But the big discussion in the coming months is likely to revolve more around the tax policies of the two camps.
On the one hand, there is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth.
His critics reproach him that this would only increase the budget deficit.
On the other side is Clinton, who wants at least the rich to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.
Escape: "Every refugee woman has experiences of sexual violence"
For women fleeing alone, sexual violence is almost part of everyday life.
When they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized.
A house offers refuge.
Four women sit in a large kitchen.
Each of them has a baby who is at most one year old.
One of them has put her little son in her arms.
He looks curiously into the room with big eyes.
His mother stares at the tabletop.
Until she realizes that she is being watched.
She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.
The scene seems normal.
Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.
She is the managing director of Condrobs, a provider of social assistance in Bavaria, and deals, among other things, with the topic of women on the run.
The four women in the kitchen are refugees.
They live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for single women and their children in Bavaria.
In January, Condrobs opened the facility together with Pro Familia and the Münchner Frauenhilfe.
It was officially opened recently.
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.
There are no men - not even as visitors.
The exception is a guard at the door.
"It is no exaggeration to say that every woman who arrives here has experienced sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr.
"Men flee because of wars, because they are politically persecuted, because they are threatened with torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as bearers of hope," she says.
In the case of women, other reasons for fleeing predominate: "Many steal away secretly because they see no other way out."
In their homeland they have experienced sexual violence, forced marriages, honour killings, slavery or forced prostitution.
That drives them away.
On the run it goes on.
"It is not uncommon for tugs to demand a sexual act for a bottle of water, for example," says Bahr.
And the women are alone, they are not protected by their families.
Those who believe that the end will come as soon as they arrive in Germany are wrong, says Bahr.
Here, too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and abused at worst.
As a result, approximately 90 percent of the women living in their accommodation in the north of Munich are traumatized, she estimates.
"Some of the children were certainly not born voluntarily".
Many women are so accustomed that they say nothing.
"Or they dare not speak openly about what they have experienced, because the shame is too great."
Since they often do not know how to help themselves, Bahr demands that they need more accommodation just for them.
In Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for housing refugees.
When asked whether they knew of a project similar to the one in Munich in their area of responsibility, some answered no.
In the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in government accommodation.
Also in Swabia alone refugee women are not accommodated separately, say Karl Heinz Meyer, press speaker of the government.
In Upper Bavaria, Lower Franconia and Middle Franconia there are floors or houses for single women and their children.
The exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central accommodations exclusively for women.
The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality in the European Parliament also calls for women to be housed separately from men.
According to a study published for the Committee, 'It is very important that men and women are housed separately'.
'If there is a lack of privacy or if men and women are accommodated together, there may be - more persistently - violence against women '.
Especially the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, the study says.
How much the women feel this need for protection can be seen in the crowds that come to the house in Munich.
“Since word got around that we exist, we have a long waiting list, ” says Bahr.
One could easily open a second house.
Assistant doctors on strike: demands for new industrial action
Assistant doctors ’ deputies have called on their union to approve new industrial action in their disputes over a new contract.
The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire council to approve more industrial action from the beginning of September.
The JDC stated that ministers had failed to address the treaty ’ s concerns.
Assistant physicians and medical students voted in July to reject a contract that was agreed with the BMA.
It was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.
In a letter to members posted on Twitter Thursday night, JDC Chairman Ellen McCourt said that the government had remained "persistently calm" on issues, leading to the rejection of the contract.
She said, "In view of this, the JDC Board has voted to reject the proposed new treaty in full and to request formal renegotiation of all your concerns."
In response to the government ’ s silence, the JDC Board today formally requested a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve an ongoing program of escalating industrial action that begins in early September.
The disputes led to a six-time strike this year, the first total loss in NHS history.
The director / conductor of the BMA Assistenzärzte Dr. Johann Malawana resigned after the choice to the refusal of the agreed upon contract conditions, which had been recommended by the BMA.
He told BMA members during the meetings, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted.
After the vote, Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for doctors would be enforced in England.
Russia and Turkey: An "Alliance of Outsiders"?
It was a gesture that ended a crisis.
The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to shake hands and announce an official end to the eight-month-long war of words and economic sanctions.
But when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most.
There was the handshake, yes.
But Putin ’ s smile was narrow-lipped, and he radiated little warmth, even by his restrained standards.
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - five times, according to a report.
I couldn't count it anymore.
He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their pre-crisis level, but would even improve.
The next day, a newspaper described Erdogan as behaving as if nothing bad had ever happened.
His enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.
But a sustained coolness radiating from Putin showed that Russia ’ s leader had forgotten nothing.
Rather, the root cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory remarks: Turkey ’ s shooting down a Russian warplane on the Syrian border.
Moscow ’ s reaction at the time was furious.
Putin passed out, accusing Ankara of having stabbed Russia in the back.
The crime was even greater because it was committed by an alleged friend.
Restoring confidence will be difficult, if not impossible.
Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.
For months, the state-controlled media carried out a violent, unqualified attack on Ankara.
Suddenly it seemed that the Turks were to blame for everything.
Most serious were allegations by senior officials that Erdogan ’ s own family had benefited from illicit oil trading in areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.
He denied this vehemently.
But in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look ahead.
After all, that meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan that he wanted to hear.
Russia has achieved some sort of victory.
For Ankara, the benefits of a ceasefire are clear.
Erdoğan needs, first and foremost, all the friends he can get after he was almost ousted in a failed coup last month.
Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shocked him.
But there are also economic motives.
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.
The number has fallen by almost 90%.
In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when flights are resumed.
They are counting on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.
This week, state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables once Turkish agricultural imports are allowed again.
A report in Vedemosti put it like this: "Tourists there long, tomatoes here long."
But the visit had an added political value for Moscow.
Ankara is angry with the West, because it views its response to the attempted takeover as a weak response.
Add to that continuing resentment at the EU ’ s snail ’ s pace of accession negotiations and Putin – eager to capitalize on the cool mood and reduce Turkey ’ s relationship with the West.
The Russian leader certainly won a bonus in Ankara for demanding support for the elected authorities after the attempted coup.
This is self-evident for Moscow, which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.
The summit meeting in this splendid palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray what one analyst once described as an 'alliance of outsiders': two countries that feel excluded and ill-treated by the West and are now allied.
Yet, despite public reconciliation, there are still major differences between the two.
The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role of peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.
It may be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents said at the press conference that they had not even touched on the issue.
Turkey ’ s president deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin chose to emphasize them.
There is no clear consensus on where to find a common denominator on Syria.
But, after months of open hostilities – and given the potential for a complete disaster when NATO member Turkey shot down the Russian fighter jet – it is surely better that the two leaders at least talk to each other again.
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to customers outside Scotland
According to the CEO of the bank, the RBS brand is to be reduced to a back office role.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland.
Ross McEwan informed BBC Scotland that the RBS brand was linked to the global ambitions of the bank.
The bank has distanced itself since when it nearly collapsed and had to be rescued eight years ago.
During this time, brand strategists have used "RBS" to protect other consumer financial brands.
She has supported international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship, from Six Nations Rugby to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.
But now it has decided to focus more on national brands.
The Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to clients in Scotland, but will not be initialized.
In England and Wales, all RSB references, the decentralised headquarters and the stock exchange listing will be transferred to NatWest.
The Ulster Bank brand is already in use for clients in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.
There are other smaller retail brands that will get more prominence - Coutts, Adam & Co, Drummond and Holt's Military Bank.
McEwan was interviewed during a tour of Inverness shire by clients and staff.
He told BBC Scotland, "The RSB brand will become our investor brand, as well as the brand that will employ our staff, as we become more of a bank of brands."
When the bank itself became a global brand, RBS became a global brand.
Let me say now that we are not pursuing global objectives, but local ones.
Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with customers under these brands.
RBS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsorship and that it will increase the visibility of the various brands in its sports sponsorship.
"It is time for us to become the bank of brands, because how do we focus internally (we asked) on making this a better bank for customers?" said the CEO.
It would have been very cynical three years ago if we had said that we would be a great bank for our customers and had launched these brands.
But with our work, the focus on customer needs and not our own, I think, you will see many changes.
We can re-launch these brands, so I think the time has come.
Frankie Dettori achieves its 3,000th Newmarket profit on Predilection
Dettori sprays champagne after a double at Newmarket, which brings him 3,000th profit
Jockey Frankie Dettori secured his 3,000th British win at Newmarket on Friday.
He set a milestone on Predilection, which is trained by John Gosden, on his local race track with his second win of the night.
The 45-year-old Italian is the sixth jockey to reach the milestone in flat racing.
He succeeds Sir Gordon Richards, Doug Smith, Lester Piggott, Pat Eddry and Willie Carson.
The three-time winner Dettori, who had previously won on Ghayyar, said, "It is something special."
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at Newmarket because I ended up here 30 years ago.
It's not a big meeting, it's not Royal Ascot - it's a banal Friday night with 20,000 people.
I am relieved and very modest.
Dettori picks up the cheers when he wins on Predilection
Two jockeys have reached the steeplechase milestone – jockey Richard Johnson and retired 20-time winner Sir Anthony McCoy, who has achieved more than 4,300 wins in a record-breaking career.
Lester Piggott, the nine-time Derby winner had 4,493 career victories
Frankie is one of the best jockey of the modern age and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him.
He has style and is strong, but it is his tactical intellect that distinguishes him from the others in the weight control room.
He is a fantastic ambassador for racing, his enthusiasm and charisma have been inspiring fans for years.
I told Frankie a few weeks ago at Epsom that he would have won 6,000 if he wasn ’ t just a weekend and big tournament jockey!
Frankie has ridden in the UK for almost 30 years, which is great.
He has a lively personality, which is good for a British race, but beyond that he is an incredible jockey.
Frankie Dettori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dismount
From Flying Finishes to Flying Dismounts, Frankie Dettori has been the figurehead of British flat racing for two decades.
It was nerve-wracking.
A number of major tournaments were won, including his famous "Glorious Seven" at Ascot in 1996, but he also survived a plane crash and got a drug ban.
Three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six-month lockout, but he showed an impressive character strength to defy his doubters and return to his best form.
And it is far from over - Dettori once said that he wants to continue in competitions until he is at least 50 years old.
Russia's Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has unexpectedly fired his chief of staff, Sergei Ivanov.
For many years, Ivanov was part of Putin ’ s closest circle of confidence.
The 63-year-old has been appointed Special Representative for Environment and Transport.
In a Kremlin statement, Putin "ordered the dismissal of Ivanov from his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration" without giving any reason.
Anton Vaino, who had been Ivanov ’ s deputy since 2012, was appointed his successor.
Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.
Born in 1972 in the Estonian capital Tallinn, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow State Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo.
According to the Kremlin website (in Russian), he later became chief of protocol and head of government staff.
Regarding his appointment, he said to Putin: "Thank you for your trust."
I think that the most important task of the government is to support your activity as a head of state with regard to bills and controls to implement your instructions.
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov had asked to leave his post and had recommended Vaino as his successor.
Convince the smiling faces?
This step has made Moscow secretive.
Sergei Ivanov has long been one of Vladimir Putin ’ s closest confidants and, like him, works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB.
As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.
At a televised meeting with President Putin, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned at his own request.
But despite the smiles for the cameras, few here are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.
Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?
Nobody knows that at the moment.
But the official claim – that a man once touted as a potential president suddenly wanted to lead Russia ’ s environmental policy – met with deep skepticism.
In his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said, "It is true that in early 2012, in a conversation, I asked you to entrust me with this very complicated post, you could almost say burdensome, for four years.
As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian presidential administration for four years and eight months.
Ivanov took up the post in December 2011.
He was previously Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.
He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, like Putin, a former member of the KGB State Security Service.
In the late 1990 ’ s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), which replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.
When Putin came to power, he named Ivanov as one of five people he trusted most.
Ivanov was once thought to become president of Russia after Putin ’ s second term, because a third Putin term would have violated the constitution.
But this post was occupied by another close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.
Putin became prime minister before becoming president three and a half years later.
Criminal Minds star Thomas Gibson fired after beating producers
Gibson was involved in a physical confrontation on the Los Angeles set last month.
ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios, which produce the series, announced in a joint statement his dismissal.
Gibson, who played Special Agent Aaron Hotchner, publicly apologized on Thursday before announcing his dismissal.
On the set there were artistic differences and differences of opinion.
I regret the incident, "he said in a statement.
Details of how Gibson's character will be written out of the series, which follows a team of FBI agents, are expected to be released at a later date, according to ABC Studios and CBS Television Studios.
The 54-year-old, who previously played in the sitcom Dharma & Greg, has been in the show since the series ’ first season in 2005.
"I love Criminal Minds and have put all my heart and soul into it for the past twelve years," Gibson said in a statement published on Friday.
I had hoped to be there till the end, but that will not be possible now.
I would just like to thank the writers, producers, actors, our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you can wish for a show.
The scheduled airing of the twelfth season is scheduled for September 28.
Mystery of fish that landed in the garden in Banff
A resident of Banff called for help identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Banff.
Kevin Bain thinks that the 75 fish could be sandeels eaten from a fountain.
Mr. Bain, who lives about 500 meters from the sea, published a video of the spectacle on Periscope in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two-inch-long fish.
Queensferry Crossing: Bridge now connected to Fife
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017
Engineers have connected the north deck of Queensferry Crossing to the viaduct - meaning the bridge is now connected to Fife.
It is the first of four closures of the "ventilators" approaching completion around each of the three towers of the bridge.
The bridge section at Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tonnes.
It has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete as well as 46 helix cables.
The £1.35 billion project is expected to be completed by May 2017.
Minister of the Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the land to the bridge.
He said: "This is a historic and symbolic moment in the building of Queensferry Crossing.
We are all witnessing an engineering art of truly epic dimensions in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used for this part of the bridge alone.
Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate task requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.
In total, almost 79% of the entire bridge decks are in place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete cast for the deck in Rosyth today, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted into place on the bridge.
Michael Martin, Project Leader of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said: "The first closure is a significant milestone in any bridge project.
In this fantastic project, the closure represents pioneering construction and civil engineering.
After the installation of the last road deck section and its connection with the Nordturmdeck, which is currently under construction, we then had to close the remaining gap on the north or land side.
This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.
This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.
Massive, because the viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%.
Delicate, because the tolerances the team was working towards were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters.
Fortunately, everything went very well.
Rescue at Moelfre Bay: Three men are "lucky to be still alive"
Three men are "lucky to be alive" after being thrown off Anglesey by their fishing boat.
The Moelfre RNLI rescue station sounded the alarm on Friday at 13: 20 BST after a crew watched the event in Moelfre Bay.
The three men had difficulty swimming in safety, while their boat moved on by itself.
"We saw the boat turn around near them and imagined the worst," said Moelfre rescue station manager Vince Jones.
"Fortunately, the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach until we let it into the water," he added.
Two of the men were rescued by a local fishing boat, while the third man, aged 60, was exhausted and found hanging from a buoy without a life jacket.
They all came aboard the lifeboat and were taken back to the rescue station
Mr Jones said: "The three men thrown into the water are lucky to be unharmed and still alive.
The boat engine had an emergency stop line, but this broke loose when capsizing the boat from the person who controlled the boat.
Someone has been watching over these men today.
Severe Injuries - Man Stings on His Ex-girlfriend
A man has his former girlfriend in Hamburg, Harburg attacked with a knife and seriously injured.
As the police announced yesterday, the 50-year-old had received the key to the apartment to get his personal things.
Instead, the alcoholized offender cut his ex ’ s clothes.
When she came into the apartment, he stabbed her twice.
The 44-year-old was injured in her hand and body.
The police were able to arrest the perpetrator.
While the 50-year-old was destroying his ex ’ s clothes, he called his mother.
She then alerted his sister.
Together with her partner, the 45-year-old wanted to calm her brother.
But she could not persuade him to leave the apartment.
That is why she left the house with her partner.
On the street they met the man ’ s former partner.
When the two women re-entered the apartment, the 50-year-old pushed his sister aside and attacked his ex-girlfriend.
Who builds Braunschweigs cheap apartments?
The SPD and the Greens are of the opinion that investors should be made much more responsible in the future.
How to react to the bad news, that Braunschweig will lose in the next few years almost 1300 Cheap apartments?
The SPD proposes to the next council meeting an "action concept living".
But dispute is programmed.
In the first place it concerns the question: Who is to build the favorable dwellings actually?
So far, there has been no regulation.
Social Democratic Party (SPD) parliamentary group chairman Christoph Bratmann said: "We agree with the Greens: If you want to build on urban areas, you will have to designate 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."
The favorable dwellings can develop however also in the existence.
According to Bratmann, however, the big point of contention in the town hall is: "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"
"We want investors to build at least 10 percent, but preferably 20 percent, of housing as social housing in such areas."
A new urban housing development support programme, which will cost millions and has yet to be financed, will provide incentives.
The problem, according to Bratmann: "There is currently no agreement between the political groups."
The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.
The left still wants tough conditions for investors.
In spite of this, according to Bratmann, the situation on the housing market is getting worse.
If the action plan is implemented, it will provide for additional tasks in the construction management.
More staff is needed.
It is unclear whether we will get skilled workers.
But the program is not yet complete: The 1260 new apartments were to be built anyway.
But how do you compensate for the loss of another 1,300 low-cost housing units, which will be phased out in the next few years?
By 2020 alone, there will be 500 homes.
In order to prevent this, according to the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, expiring ties should now be purchased by the city.
Consideration should also be given to bringing homes back to fixed prices.
This is possible in the western city.
The problem could be solved in one fell swoop.
In the Weststadt, deadlines expire at the end of the year.
Approximately 1800 apartments could be fetched there back into the price maintenance for favorable dwellings.
But that is not what the owners, the housing associations, want.
Because if the number of the social housing in the west city is again drastically increased, one moves away from the goal of the so-called mixing.
A concentration of socially disadvantaged people in only a few districts should no longer exist.
The Greens expect that there will still be movement in the discussion.
Party leader Holger Herlitschke says: "For a broad majority, the CDU must be on board."
They have concentrated on more building sites for single-family houses.
This does not mean, however, that a compromise cannot be found after all.
Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.
The fact that teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring at screens, has been deplored by many in the last decade.
Pokemon Go is about getting people off the sofa and getting more active.
The time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and finally to smartphones.
It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive.
I refer of course to the Pokémon Go ’ s mania, an app based on the characters that were first created for the video games in the 1990s (which later became an animated series, playing cards and other spin offs).
Like many pop culture phenomena, interest declined slightly before the game was released in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July.
The launch in other countries was delayed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.
Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.
How does it work?
In short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémons that can be tracked with a GPS and, once found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the phone) or "captured".
A generation that played the game when she was younger joined the madness and jumped off the sofa to search.
In the U.S., the game led to a significant increase in steps the "average" person takes every day.
Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch that tracks 35,000 users, recently told the Washington Post that within two days of the game ’ s launch, the number of people being tracked who train for 30 minutes each day jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.
The company doesn ’ t know who is playing Pokémon Go – it just sees the raw data to improve performance.
Many public health education campaigns aimed at getting people to "take 30 minutes off the sofa" and "be active every day" fell on deaf ears because many public health messages are boring and come from people who look miserable.
However, the importance of sport cannot be overstated.
Those who exercise regularly reduce their chances of contracting cancer or depression.
Physical activity helps with weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to list here.
But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it makes people do something outdoors that they enjoy.
Thus three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.
Some people even make new friends while hunting.
As always, there are grumpy spoilers who always have to complain about something.
And yes, someone could run against a door.
What's the matter?
There has been a breakthrough.
Even though smartphone ’ s apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to exercise like this game does.
The new will lose its appeal and use will diminish over time.
Due to Pokemon ’ s success, however, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with getting active in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.

Simone Biles creates gold in women's gymnastics
Forget the pressure.
Forget the hype.
Simone Biles is immune to all this.
Dynamic on the jumping horse.
Effortlessly on the beam.
Breathtaking on the floor.
All along the line brilliant.
And now also Olympic champion.
The 19-year-old American gymnast made the all-around title on Thursday and widened the gap between herself and the rest of the world in front of everyone under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.
Her overall score of 62.198 was clearly ahead of silver medallist and final five teammate Aly Raisman and Russian bronze medallist Aliya Mustafina.
The American Simone Biles is performing on the balance beam during the women ’ s singles all-around competition in gymnastics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.
Biles is the fourth heterosexual American to win an all-around title, and the fifth overall, while solidifying her reputation as the best of her generation, or even the best of her generation.
She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey came to an end at that moment.
This success places them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:
Biles has dominated her sport for the past three years, winning 15 World Champion medals - including 10 Gold Medals - with such amazing exercises, which include a blend of ambition and precision that the 1984 Olympic champion, Mary Lou Retton, said of her that she is "the best gymnast I have ever seen."
A final test awaited them in Brazil, a competition that went not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between them and a load of oversized expectations.
Not to return with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas, would be considered a disappointment.
The Americans Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman hugging each other after winning gold and silver in the women ’ s singles all-around finals in gymnastics at the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday
Biles won the first medal on Tuesday while serving as an exclamation mark at the farewell party of retired team coordinator Martha Karolyi.
Although Biles insisted on never planning the future during her long journey to the top, this is not really true.
Part of their floor exercises - which include their typical Tumbling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.
This is no coincidence.
This girl, adopted by her grandparents as a small child and discovered by coach Aimee Boorman ’ s mother during a school trip to the gym where Boorman trained, became a force.
It has not lost an all-around competition since the summer of 2013, a winning streak that will last as long as Biles wishes.
Even if Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture was deceptive.
Balance beams and floor gymnastics - in which Biles holds the world title - lurked.
She caught up again with 15,433 on the balance beam - and placed another 15,933 on the floor.
Raisman gently hugged her as she awaited her end result - a mere formality - and tears streamed down Biles shiny red, white and blue eyeliner as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.
Raisman ’ s performance was a revenge for the last time she fought for third place four years ago, but the bronze medal in a tie-brake went to Mustafina.
This time the 22-year-old team captain, who is called "Grandma" by the Americans, had a head start.
After her floor exercise, she threw kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback that sometimes seemed dubious.
As far as biles are concerned, the fast-spreading tweet by 19 year-olds earlier this week has a whole new meaning:
Police: 3 victims in serial murder case while listening to music in the car shot
According to police reports released on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the most deadly attacks in a decade in Phoenix ’ s first serial murder while talking in the car and listening to music.
Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis ’ daughter Maleah were shot dead on June 12 while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.
The offender fired eight shots from a handgun while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle, the report said.
The police reported that the triple murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900 that were in the possession of one of the adult victims.
Police spokesman for Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led investigators to take a closer look at whether it was associated with four previous attacks.
In total, seven people were killed and two others injured in nine attacks, mainly in Hispanic residential areas, over a period of four months.
"It's happening in a residential neighborhood in front of a house," Howard told KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, earlier this month.
The suspect is believed to have used several vehicles, including a brown Nissan from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s, and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.
The investigators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to conclude that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.
Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to her injuries and died later.
Liner, 31, and Ellis daughter Maleah died on the spot.
A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.
The authorities also released a police report on the shooting aimed at an empty pickup truck half an hour before the triple murder, which is believed to have been the work of the serial killer.
Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a bullet from the seat and fragments of balls from the engine compartment.
Mother of a 6-year-old with microcephaly: "It's getting better"
Like most 6 year olds, Edmund Picciuto loves singing, toys and of course his mother.
But like few of his peers, Edmund has microcephaly, the result of a genetic disorder about which his mother Elizabeth Picciuto knew nothing during her pregnancy.
When he came home for the first time, my first thought was, I can ’ t do it.
I cannot do that.
I did not accept that.
Which is not true at all -- of course they got involved, "she said.
Her husband Vincent and she were told that Edmund might never be able to recognize her and that he might not even survive.
Some doctors even went so far as to suggest institutionalizing him.
"My first answer was' I didn't know people were still doing that '," Picciuto explained.
Edmund can walk with a walking aid.
Edmund could neither sit nor crawl until he was three years old, and he still cannot speak.
But it is slowly making progress.
He can run and cycle with support.
He also loves to play and sing with his two brothers.
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Edmund came up with for "Please sing something in front of me."
"We teach him sign language," Picciuto told CBS News.
But it's not a typical sign language -- she says. Edmund invented some characters alone.
Microcephaly has a variety of causes: genetic ones like Edmund ’ s and infections with viruses like measles or the Zika virus during pregnancy.
Symptoms and predictions can vary widely.
It is too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zika virus.
Picciuto remembers the emotional cost of an uncertain future.
I kept asking, what's going to happen?
What will happen?
And she still doesn't really know.
I have not asked for the prognosis for a long time, because I do not expect that someone can really tell me.
But Picciuto has some hopeful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zika virus.
It is getting better.
You know that it will be better for you.
You will love your child and your child will love you.
Heavy rainfall, floods give rise to rescues in Louisiana, Mississippi
Heavy rainfall and large-scale flooding in Louisiana forced the governor to declare a state of emergency on Friday. More rainfall is expected throughout Saturday.
Numerous rivers in southeastern Louisiana and south of the Mississippi flooded their shores and threatened extensive flooding after extreme rainfall, the National Weather Service reported.
The governor of Louisiana, John Bel Edwards, said that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and that assistance to affected communities is already underway.
Mike Steele, a spokesman for the Governor ’ s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, said that requests for flood vehicles, boats, and sand bags were increasing.
Steele said that the municipality of Tangipahoa alone had ordered ten thousand sandbags.
A flood warning system will be used over large parts of southern Louisiana until Saturday.
The weather service announced that an additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area.
In southern Alabama, a flood early warning system was put in place on Friday, while it continued to rain in the Mobile area.
The Comite River near Baton Rouges and the Amite River near Denham Springs, both located in Louisiana, will most likely reach record levels over the weekend.
Metereologist Alek Krautmann says both rivers could flood many houses in suburban areas near Baton Rouge.
He also said that a downstream flooding in Ascension Parish is a danger, as these will flow slowly into Lake Maurepas via the trodden rivers.
The Tickfaw River, south of the Mississippi state border in Liverpool, Louisiana, reached the highest level ever recorded at 9 a.m. on Friday.
Rescue teams were still plucking people out of the floods in the Amite and Wilkinson counties of southwest Mississippi.
Leroy Hansford, his wife and stepson were among those rescued near Gloster on Friday.
Hansford, 62, says that water from Beaver Creek, usually more than 400 feet from his house, rose sharply overnight.
He said that another stepson, who lives nearby, had warned him.
"We woke up and the water poured in," said Hansford.
It reached my waist.
His wife told Hansford that in the 48 years she lived there, she had never seen such a high level of the river.
Hansford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he was the only one who could swim.
Hansford said that emergency workers had rescued all three of them in a large military truck and taken them to the next fire station in Gloster, where they were housed until Friday.
Krautmann said that the flood had "spread rapidly" as heavy rainfall continued and that the authorities were considering evacuation orders.
According to Krautmann, an observer near Livingstone reported 13.75 inches of rain from midnight until Friday morning.
Krautmann said that the soil has been considerably soaked by the rain since Wednesday.
The authorities said that heavy rainfall and road flooding caused the rescue of residents from their homes in Tangipahoa Parish and school failure in five school districts.
CBS ’ s WWL subsidiary reported that an alderman in Tangipahoa reported 200 flooded houses.
The inhabitants were evacuated in two churches, which were now both flooded.
The head of the community, Robby Miller, said that the authorities had rescued 72 people and seven pets that had been flooded.
In the cities of Amite and Hammond, temporary shelters were set up to accommodate the evacuees.
"As soon as the water starts to return, they will be able to go back to their homes," he said.
In the town of Hammond in the municipality of Tangipahoa, nearly two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sandbags were provided for the residents to take with them, who hope to be able to keep the water from their homes and shops.
"The last major flood we had was in March," said Lacy Landrum of the city administration.
This seems to be a similar incident.
In Mississippi, the Harrison County's emergency manager Rupert Lacy said it continued to rain on the Gulf Coast.
According to his information, a handful of houses were reported as being flooded on Thursday, but none has been reported on Friday.
Keith Townson, manager at Shopper Value Foods in Amite, has lived in the area for 40 years.
"I've seen water in places I've never seen it before," Townson said, "and it's still coming."
Mahaj Brown, 6, "riddled with bullets", survives shootout in Philadelphia
Police report that the 6-year-old boy was shot in Philadelphia, this week already the second time that a 6-year-old child is shot.
The boy ’ s grandparents identified him as Mahaj Brown for CBS Philadelphia.
Grandparents said that Brown suffered several bullet wounds, including in the loin, leg, arm, and abdomen, but that he was conscious during his transport to the hospital.
"He went through a lot, his small body was riddled with bullets," his grandmother Delores Melendez told the station.
I just can't believe it.
The boy ’ s condition was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations.
The boy ’ s family told the radio station that he was likely to recover.
He should have started the first grade in a local primary school.
Brown was one of four people shot in Germantown.
Three men were also shot: two aged 29 and a 32 year-old.
One of the 29-year-old men is in critical condition; the other two victims are in stable condition, according to CBS Philadelphia.
The boy was found shot on the front seat of a car together with the 29-year-old, who is in a critical condition, reports the transmitter.
The other two victims were not in the car and the police are investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetrator.
Investigators told CBS Philadelphia that there had apparently been a crossfire between several shooters.
Cartridge shells for assault rifles traced back to various assault rifles littered the scene.
It seems that this was clearly an ongoing struggle.
On the street, on both sides of the sidewalk, there were shells.
So it seems that there have been several armed fighters here who have been very actively involved, "police chief Anthony Ginaldi told the Philadelphia police.
Several houses and vehicles were also hit in the area.
There were no arrests and the police are reportedly reviewing the surveillance video.
On Tuesday, another 6-year-old girl was hit by a ricochet on her arm as she played in front of her home in the residential West Oak Lane neighborhood.
She is recovering and the police are still looking for a suspect.
Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie
That is what I imagine under the women's Olympic team in gymnastics and for more than one reason.
First, I ’ ve been at every summer Olympics since 1984, and the US has never been so dominant.
And secondly: This team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who were inspiring for many young girls of different skin colours.
The structure of this team, completed by Aly Raisman, who is Jewish and Madison Kocian, who is Catholic, makes everyone proud.
This team finally reflects the United States.
It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the forefront of this sport.
For the last four years, the number one female gymnast has been an Afro-American.
Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2
This shows strength.
At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic winner and America cheered.
Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez in delivering unexpected but masterful gymastic routines.
On Thursday, Simone became the fourth heterosexual American to win gold at an individual women ’ s all-around event.
Team member Aly Raisman won silver.
We experience the top of this sport, but this is not how gymnastics classes look all over the country.
Simone, Gabby and Laurie all followed the same path as Aly and Madison to join the Olympic team.
They are the "last five", because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts on the team. Moreover, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as coach.
But the reality is that gymnastics is an expensive sport, and gymnasts are primarily in private gymnastics clubs maintained by parents who pay for training, furnishing, travel, clothing, competition and hotel expenses (for the coaches and their gymnasts and families).
The majority of these gymnastics clubs are located in wealthy suburbs that can support the business.
In these clubs the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for the families.
Aimee Boorman, coach of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, coach of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started gymnastics.
We must make it possible for the communities of innumerable young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie to train in gymnastics at a more affordable and accessible level.
I founded my Turnstiftung 20 years ago.
At my events, we have provided free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.
In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high quality gymnastics to young people who deserve the opportunity to learn and take advantage of this great Olympic sport.
Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.
This combination offers lifelong health benefits as well as educational and professional success.
It is the inspiration of this team that makes thousands of young girls interested in gymnastics and that is great.
It is so important to participate in sport, especially for girls.
This is such an exciting time.
Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real representation of "Girl Power" by getting the Olympic team gold and thank you, so many young girls from different backgrounds motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.
Assistant doctors want to organise further strikes after rejecting Jeremy Hunt ’ s proposal
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58% of the 37,000 assistant doctors who voted in an election rejected it.
In July, Hunt unveiled plans to introduce the contract by force, saying that the NHS was in a 'no man's land' and that any further delay would be harmful to staff and patients.
The first assistant doctors are to receive a new contract, which includes changes to night and weekend work to improve care at inhospitable times.
Dr Ellen McCourt, Chair of the BMA Assistant Physicians Committee, said in a statement last night: "Assistant physicians continue to have serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will fuel the current staff crisis and fail to treat all doctors fairly."
With only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors are covered by the new contract, progress must be made and time is running out.
Efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through dialogue have met with reluctance by the government to participate, and sometimes deafening silence.
That happened to a promise Jeremy Hunt made only last month that his door would always be open.
"Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift the imposition and address the concerns of the assistant doctors".
If he does not do so, the assistant doctors have made it clear that they are prepared to take further industrial action.
The last strike, at the end of April, provided for a delay of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to provide coverage for doctors on the picket line.
Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adopting the reformed Treaty with the functionaries of the British Medical Association.
The BMA wants a better remuneration for the 54,000 assistant doctors who will be subject to the contract.
Daniel Mortimer, director general of NHS staff, called on assistant doctors to end the strike.
Mortimer said: "Industrial action achieves nothing of the little, but burdens already overburdened teams and service providers and causes patients, nurses and their families only concern, need and interruption."
Over the past two months, we have spoken to the Assistant Physicians Committee and responded positively to concerns about guardianship and whistleblowing with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.
Employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important issues - such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those returning from a career break, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training leave and the gender pay gap in medicine - was a sign of how serious employers, Health Education England and the Ministry of Health were about meeting the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.
£2 per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
Thousands of myocardial infarction patients will benefit from one £2 a day, after the authorities have recommended giving it to more people for a longer period of time.
The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.
The drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack, reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack.
NHS regulator NICE has recommended four years of use to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
NHS regulator NICE has recommended four years of use to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.
Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack every year, and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke.
Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the arterial walls that form deposits.
When the plaque breaks apart, it can cause a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart, causing a heart attack.
When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the blood stream and block blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.
People who have already had a heart attack are at higher risk of having another one.
Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots less likely.
The draft guidance of NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg of Ticagrelor followed by 60mg with a twice-daily intake of Aspirin for the next three years.
Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: "Despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have had a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke, often with disastrous consequences."
The fear of a new heart attack can have considerable negative effects on a person ’ s quality of life.
Experience shows that Ticagrelor in combination with aspirin is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.
With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from them.
Information about the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years. No treatment beyond this period is recommended in the draft guidance.
Political Correctness culture makes electoral fraud flourish in Muslim areas
The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutfur Rahman was removed from office last year at the instigation of a government report on corruption
A culture of political correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities being knowingly ignored, as a devastating government report revealed today.
Former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls for ignoring evidence of abuses due to "ethnic and religious hypersensitivities".
The former Minister of Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that intimidation of voters for religious motives was so bad that the police should be allowed to put barriers outside electoral booths to protect intimidated voters.
He recommends that voters should carry an identity card with them to prove their identity in elections.
At present, all a voter has to do is give his or her name and address.
The report proposes to put non-removable ink on a person's finger when they vote, to prevent someone from voting twice.
Whistleblowers should be given more protection, says Sir Eric.
He demands that the press should have more access to community records and decisions by unofficial committees or working groups.
"This not only serves to prevent electoral fraud, but also to protect the local government from the broader culture of corruption and financial fraud that goes with it," he said.
The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlet election scandal in East London.
Last year, a special electoral court ruled that incumbent Mayor Lutfur Rahman should be removed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices.
The court found that Rahman had "cynically perverted" the religious feelings of his Muslim community and that he had silenced his critics with accusations of racism and Islamophobia.
Rahman is said to have "conducted his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to elect him."
Up to 300 votes were either dubious or the result of imitation, with one person voting as another.
Sir Eric said that there is evidence of fraud throughout the country.
He was particularly alarmed by the fraudulent postal ballot – in which older members of the Muslim community put pressure on people to vote for a candidate of their choice.
Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean up the electoral system, including holding identity cards to prove identity
His report says: 'Proof that pressure has been put on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, in particular women and young people, to vote in accordance with the will of the elderly, particularly communities of Pakistani or Bangladeshi background, has been put in place.
"There were concerns that... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behavior because of" politically correct "hypersensitivities to ethnicity and religion."
Sir Eric made 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including a ban on political activists processing postal ballot papers to stop 'election yields'.
The report, considered by Theresa May, also calls for tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral register from being used for immigration and social fraud purposes.
Consider options to ask voters for your ID before voting.
Use non-removable ink on a person ’ s finger once they have cast their vote to prevent someone from voting twice.
carry out systematic checks on the nationality of a person to ensure that they are entitled to vote.
A three-year limit on applications for automatic postal voting.
Prohibited that political activists process complete envelopes and postal ballots.
Give the police authority to set up barriers around polling stations.
An amendment to the law that facilitates a charge of intimidation under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Ban on photographing in polling stations.
Requirement that only English may be used in polling stations (except Wales).
Intensify training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go into the voting booth alone.
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlet case no criminal charge has been filed.
"The Electoral Court has declared Lutfur Rahman and his deputy unfit for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," he said.
He was found guilty for a number of reasons, in accordance with the high requirements of criminal proceedings.
He also criticizes the ineffective "check off" of the election registration departments of the town halls.
Sir Eric said: "Last year's Tower Hamlets court ruling was a warning signal.
Our country has a proud legacy as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial by some authorities threatens this good reputation.
Crazy about Kate's cyclist, doppelganger and other famous doppelganger of Olympic athletes in Rio
Fans of the Rio 2016 Olympics have been racked up this week by French cyclist Pauline Ferrand ’ s Prevot, who has proven to be an impressive double for the Duchess of Cambridge.
But the 24-year-old Olympian is far from the only gold-fighting athlete with her own famous doppelganger this summer - at least not if you believe social media.
In honour of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are currently flickering on our screens, FEMAIL has compiled a list of Olympians that bear more than a certain resemblance to Hollywood celebrities.
The Hunter and the Wolf: Team member of the US Archery Team Brady Ellison, left, is compared to Leonardo DiCaprio since childhood
Except for Kate ’ s doppelganger on the racecourse, many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain archer could be the twin of A ’ celebrity Leonardo DiCaprio.
Brady Ellison, a member of the US archery team, has caused a run on Twitter after images of him resembling the Wolf of Wall Street star.
Indeed, the archer witnessed the madness in social media and admitted that he has been hearing since childhood that he looks like Leo.
"I don't see much similarity, except for facial hair," Brady told the Huffington Post.
"He's a handsome guy, so I think I take that as a compliment."
One of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly come to the fore this year: the striking similarity between the British long jumper Greg Rutherford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris.
The Russian gymnast Aliya Mustafina with her large, expressive eyes should be able to pass as a double for the Cuban American singer Gloria Estefan.
And in the swimming pool, the South African swimmer Cameron van der Burgh has been compared to the Glee star Matthew Morrison for years.
A step up: This user believes that Nathan is the "athletic version" of the Inception actor
Another persistent comparison was made between tennis star Rafael Nadal and actor Josh Hartnett, who has similarly heavy eyebrows and lips.
Russian silver medallist Yulia Efimova has more than just suntanned skin and blond hair like actress Annalynne McCord, while American Nathan Adrian has been attested by fans to resemble an "athletic version of Joseph Gordon Levitt."
Strong women: soccer star Hope Solo, left, and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter, right, have a similar face shape and eyes
Not the only one: One Twitter user was very happy that others noticed the similarities
Theory put into the space: According to this user there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple
One of the Twitter users explained her satisfaction that "the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Carpenter are almost identical."
Indeed, US football star Hope Solo and Dexter actress Jennifer Carpenter have incredibly similar facial shapes and eyes.
Other popular comparisons included Kerri Walsh ’ s Jennings and her smile, which is almost identical to that of actress Laura Linney, and Gymnastics gold medallist Gabby Douglas, who has her own beautiful broad smile, similar to Bring It On Star Gabrielle Union.
CBC ’ s Olympic Commentator apologizes for saying that Chinese swimmer “died like a pig ”
Byron MacDonald ’ s analysis of the fourth place finish of 14-year-old Ai Yanhan at the 4x200m freestyle swimming relay indignant spectators at the CBC ’ s live broadcast of the Olympic Games on Wednesday
The Canadian broadcaster CBC had to apologize after one of its commentators said that the 14-year-old Chinese female swimmer "died like a pig" during the race.
The commentator Byron MacDonalds thought that his microphone was turned off when he gave his own opinions at the end of the 4x200m freestyle relay.
MacDonald, who had been brought on board the CBS commentary team to add "color," could be heard saying, "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost touch, baby."
Too excited, went off like mud, died like a pig.
Thank you for that.
Chinese swimmer Ai Yanhan, 14, swam the second stage of the relay 1: 57.79 - 1.61 seconds slower than Canada's Taylor jerk, allowing the Canadians to close the gap to China.
Viewers across Canada reacted quickly online after being shocked by the sound and language
Emmett Macfarlane tweeted, "Did the CBC commentator just say that the 14-year-old swimmer from China" died like a pig "????
The idiot didn't understand that they were still on air. "
At the final 4 x 200m freestyle swimming relay for women, Ai Yanhan from China was described as follows: "This little 14-year-old Chinese has lost the connection, baby."
Criticism of Byron MacDonald on Twitter came quickly and hard, with many taking him to task
Twitter ， Users did not hold back when they heard how insensitive Byron MacDonald was
Another Twitter buddy user Sarah Paradis wrote: “Wow, # ByronMacDonald.
You represent the CBC and Canada and make us all look like racists. # disgusted.
A short time later, Scott Russel, who hosted the CBC show, apologized live for MacDonald's comment, saying, "We apologize that the comment was broadcast over a swim."
It was an unfortunate formulation, we are sorry it happened. "
CBC apologized at the end over 90 times to the people who have responded to the notice via Twitter
Commentator Scott Russel had to apologize on behalf of MacDonald
CBC copied and added its apology to more than 90 other Twitter users who complained about MacDonald ’ s comments
The network also apologized quickly and issued a notice.
We sincerely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast.
Last night we quickly apologized to our viewers on air and our followers on social media.
To make one thing clear, Byron ’ s comments related to the swimmer ’ s performance and not to her as a person.
However, they were inappropriate and an unfortunate phrase, and Byron is very sorry for what he said.
On Thursday afternoon, MacDonald apologized on the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention to interpret it as a personal attack.
"I would like to take a moment to apologize for the comment I made after the women's relay in the CBC Olympic broadcast, he said.
"I have referred to the performance of the swimmer and not to her as a person."
Of course, no disregard was intended and I am very sorry. "
Buyer in Primark outraged at woman shamelessly trying on underwear in the middle of the store
The buyers did not know where to look when a woman took off her clothes in the middle of a primark to try on underwear.
To make the situation worse, she took a look at what she looked like in it, took it off and put it back on the shelf.
She continued to browse and tried on four pairs of underwear in a shop at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone.
The Primark store at the Bouverie Place shopping centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried on her underwear before putting it back on the shelf
A mother of two, Jenny Davidson, who was in the store at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman tried on her underwear, "she put on again and left the store without buying anything."
She said, "People couldn't believe what they saw."
Standing in the middle of the sales floor, she took a pair of underwear from the display, took off her own tights and pants and tried them on.
"She didn't even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky as Oskar."
"Everyone stared when she took off the underwear again, which she obviously didn't like because she put it back on the shelf."
She repeated the same thing with three other underpants before she finally decided that she didn't like anything, put on her clothes and went out.
"She didn't seem to mind that someone was watching her - or thinking about the person who might buy the underwear she had tried on."
Mrs. Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said, "How disgusting to think that someone would take home underwear worn by another person and not washed."
The incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon.
Ms. Davidson added, "As I have noticed, the staff have tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she left - which is just as good."
"I would hate to go home with a new pair of underwear and find out that another woman had them on and took them off again and they weren't washed."
A spokesperson for Primark said: "Primark is aware of the incident that occurred on Tuesday, August 9th in our Folkstone branch."
All eligible products were withdrawn from sale.
How to protect yourself from gun attacks with Krav Maga
The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video from Dailymail.com could make it a little safer for you.
We talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close range.
Regardless of whether you are approached from the front or the back, this video will show you how to turn the tables for your predator.
When approached from behind, the first thing you should do is turn around so that you can see your attacker and "get out of the line of fire," says Mizrachi.
Grab the weapon between your forearm and shoulder before slapping it in the face with your free elbow.
Then hit him in the groin with your knee and twist the weapon out of his hands while the attacker is bending in pain. Hit him in the face with the barrel and move backwards while pointing the weapon at him.
For attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the line of fire, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker cannot shoot.
At the same time, shift the weight onto the weapon and hit the attacker's chest, then twist the weapon out of his grip before moving backwards and pointing the weapon at him.
Sounds difficult?
Watch the video to see exactly what Mizrachi is doing.
But remember that in a robbery it is safest to hand over your money - unless you are a Krav Maga Grandmaster.
Traveler Ian Wright scrapes his tongue for a guide in the dirtiest places in Europe
A British traveler seriously tested his immune system and gag reflex by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.
Host and travel writer Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scraped his trains on a Euro banknote, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a flush button on a train toilet, and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system.
Before licking any object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he was going to get into.
But the experiment, filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", brought some surprising results to light.
The idea of licking the flush button of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be utterly repulsive, but there are actually more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.
On his tour of Europe, Mr Wright spoke to doctors and health professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health.
Fortunately, nothing he licked left more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.
Mr. Wright became known for testing his intestinal resistance by traveling the world and eating strange and wonderful things.
From public railings at railway stations to toilet flush buttons, the task definitely put his immune system under a test
In the film he said, "Even as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."
In the film he lived up to his reputation in any case.
The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.
His sample smear showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.
In comparison, the number of luminometers of freshly washed hands is less than 60.
But there was a Russian toilet he refused to lick after its luminometer count exceeded 4000 units, while freshly washed hands had one of less than 60 units.
Mr. Wright and the Finnish dairy producer Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength", which shows the bacterial count in different places like the bathroom.
In the film, he says, "This comes close to the worst I have smelled in a toilet."
There is nothing dirtier than that!
I will not lick anything here, because it is disgusting inside.
"The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.
The company is equipping Mr Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamins C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system.
Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Juices and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says: "We really wanted to offer consumers something new.
Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.
We did some crazy brainstorming and ended up saying, "Let's call Ian."
They claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
Instead of just talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a broader context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system.
The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information about it in an interesting way.
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!
Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added, "Let me put it this way - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had licked some of the things I instructed him to lick, such as the disgusting Russian toilet shown in the film."
Of course, there were things where it was easier to get Ian to lick them and others where it was quite difficult.
I'm glad we shot some of these dirty goodies on film. "
In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria with the well-being of the stomach and intestines in particular, and 58 percent said that they use products containing added lactic acid bacteria at least occasionally.
Asocial family destroyed before delogation Social housing in Saltash, Cornwall
An anti-social family left their social housing after a delogation with a loss of £50,000 for terrorizing their neighbours.
Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown off their property in Saltash, Cornwall after a long list of complaints.
After being forcibly removed from their homes, cooperative workers found the property in irreparable condition.
The walls had gaping holes, wooden boards were torn up, garbage was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.
The family have been resettled and it is assumed that they now live in a private accommodation
Donna McEvoy, who works for property management at Cornwall Housing, said she was concerned that the apartment could not be repaired.
She said, "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I don't think people have to live this way.
There are many things to consider as this property will probably not be considered as such a beautiful part of Cornwall.
The family is notorious and so is their reputation.
The couple had three sons who had lived in the apartment in the meantime, and the police said that the terror the family had inflicted included street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of local residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, quarreling, and swearing.
Skeldon, 47, whose name was on the lease, received an order for antisocial behavior in June.
In some rooms of the house, which may be demolished, old garbage was found
Wooden floorboards were torn up in the property where drugs were traded in the past
Neighbours testified that they saw them fighting on the street and that the police needed to be called regularly
Cornwall Housing forcibly delegitimized her and her partner from the estate this week after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily move out.
The delegation was cheered by relieved neighbors who said that their lives were made to hell.
One said, "They didn't care about anyone."
We lived next to them for 20 years and it was always bad.
The countless times that we say to the police here are incredible.
"This morning we couldn't sleep."
We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!
Now that they are finally gone, it will be beautiful.
Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, said that the family had failed to cooperate with the local authorities.
The family lived in the house to which the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years.
Garbage and old toys were thrown down the overgrown side of the parish hall
He added: "It is a shame that the tenant failed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, as a delogation is always the last step that Cornwall Housing is considering.
This was a very difficult case, as the behaviour was extreme and their actions had to be terrible for their neighbours.
I appreciate all the work done by my team, Devon and Cornwall police and members of the community who have courageously approached us and provided us with the information.
I hope that this development will comfort some of our neighbours and send the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.
Fitzpatrick said that all three sons lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.
A dirty mattress left on the floor in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation
Property management workers will now have to clear away piles of garbage surrounding the house
In 2014 the police raided the house and found over 70g of cannabis and £1,700 worth of scales, paraphernalia and cash.
Skeldon received a fine after pleading guilty to the possession of a Class B drug for commercial purposes.
She claimed that the money for a gravestone of her son was Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.
After being without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner now live in private accommodation in Plymouth.
Many of the walls of the house were covered with graffiti.
Police say they will deloge tenants who do not comply with house rules
Angela Crow of Devon and Cornwall Police said the delogation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not comply with the house rules.
"This goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproach, and to those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said.
Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour, which will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.
Tourists in Portugal in panic after a low-flying military jet flies over the beach
Sun worshippers in Aveiro, Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
A portuguese plane of the Orion Air Force made an incredible dive
The Air Force stated that it was on a training flight, but insisted that there was no safety risk
This was the moment when frightened tourists begin to panic after a low-flying jet crashes over a full beach.
Dramatic video recordings showed how the military airplane flew almost within reach over the sun worshippers on the beach section in Aveiro in the north of Portugal.
The holiday-makers jumped up when they understandably began to worry about the noise of the jet engines, without first seeing what was coming to them through the clouds.
The incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova, near Aveiro.
Daniel Fernandes, one of the many holidaymakers who posted videos on social media about the dramatic fly “By, ” said,“ It really flew by very deeply twice and there was a moment when it looked like it was crashing. ”
Nuno Arroja added: "I was just surfing and it felt like the plane was falling down on me."
Tourists on the beach of Aveiro were in panic as the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly low
The Portuguese Air Force today reported that the pilot of the P ’ 3C Orion aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast, flying so low that it was the only way to detect them.
The spokesman said that due to poor visibility, the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to nearby wildfires, but the Air Force insisted that safety was never compromised.
This summer, wildfires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland, killing four people on the island of Madeira.
The Portuguese Air Force said today that due to the conditions - strong fog and smoke - the pilot had to fly so low, which limited his vision
The plane was on a training flight, where the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super Cup: Barca with worries against Seville
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona is fighting on Sunday for the first step to winning the first title in the new soccer season.
The Catalans compete against Seville in the duel for the Spanish Supercup away, the return match three days later at Camp Nou.
The double winner will have to abandon Neymar, who plays the Olympic football tournament with Brazil, in a showdown with the defeated Cup Finalist and reigning Europe League champion, among others.
Also missing is goalie Marc, Andre ter Stegen.
The German suffered in training a ligament compression in the knee, which is the first question with Barca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bravo clarified.
The Chilean International and Ter Stegen have been vying for number one status in Barcelona for two years.
Coach Luis Enrique refrained from making a clear decision and left Bravo in the league, but Ter Stegen in most of the other competitions.
Before the first compulsory game of the new season, the Spanish champion has doubts about the fitness of the team, which was humiliated 0-4 on Saturday in a friendly match in Liverpool.
Lionel Messi and Co. didn ’ t really convince at the 3-2 test session against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Seville in turn has to digest the 2-3 defeat after overtime in the European Supercup against Real Madrid and aims at the second triumph at the "Supercopa de Espana".
With eleven successes so far, Barcelona is the record winner in this competition.
Ma Long in a league of her own to play table tennis
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new Olympic Table Tennis champion.
The 27-year-old defeated his compatriot and "defending champion" Zhang Jike 4: 0 (12,5,4,4) in a one-sided final on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro.
Thus, the world ranking leader has won the "Golden Grand Slam" with successes at World Cup, World Cup, World Team Tour, final tournament and the Olympics.
Bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mizutani.
The two Chinese have made it to the final as expected and made up the title among themselves.
Thus it was clear, that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the singles title under the sign of the five rings.
Last non-Chinese on the top of the Olympic podium was the former SVS NÖ, Legionnaire Ryu Seung, min from South Korea.
Ma and Zhang were left alone on the record, they had no coaches between the sets and in the time out.
They had withdrawn to the tribune and let their protégés loose on each other in a fair competition.
"The matches up to here I played for my country."
"I'm playing for myself in the finals," Zhang said logically.
After the match, gold and silver medal winners posed with the Chinese flag.
The match itself was unexpectedly one-sided.
Ma had to fight with his 28-year-old opponent only in the first set really.
After that he set the tempo on the record and left Zhang only a total of 13 points.
Due to the superiority of Ma, the expected thrilling match did not develop.
But nevertheless enough breathtaking rallies were to be seen.
Mizutani won the bronze game against 40-year-old Vladimir Samsonov 4-1.
The Belarusian had suffered a rib injury in his quarterfinals against the German European Champion Dimitrij Ovtcharov, was then under medical treatment, had to be satisfied "in the end" with Blech.
By the way, in the same high table tennis age, the Swedes Jan ￣ Ove Waldner (38 / 2004) and Jörgen Persson (42 / 2008) had finished fourth in Olympia.
Donald Trump admits “huge problems ” in the election campaign
The leadership of the U.S. Republicans is plagued by massive concerns about losing their majority in traditionally conservative states.
Presidential candidate Donald Trump now admitted weaknesses in his campaign in the previous Republican stronghold of Utah.
A rare moment when the normally boastful and self-confident multimillionaire expressed something of a concern, as correspondents reported.
After knocking out 16 rivals within his own Republican camp, doubts about his success in the White House battle are growing.
“We have huge problems in Utah, ” Trump told evangelical Christians, who he asked for support in key states like Ohio, Florida, and Virginia.
He took up his well-known media scolding again, claiming that false reports about his candidacy were to blame.
Republican strongholds wobble
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Republicans.
According to a June SurveyUSA poll, Trump and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, were on an even keel.
Other institutions view Trump as the leader, but not as far apart as Republican candidates in the state.
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered.
In an interview with CNBC, Trump responded to the question of how he would stop Clinton ’ s advance: “Just as I have done so far. ”
And shoved afterwards: This will be "either successful, or I will make a very very nice, long holiday".
He did nothing but "tell the truth".
If, for reasons of political correctness, it is not enough for him, Trump said.
Then I return to a very good way of life.
According to press reports, the Trump party threatened to cut funds to support his campaign if he could not present better polls.
Instead, they want to give greater support to Republican Congressional candidates.
Olympia: Darkest Scam in Doping Test
The IOC wants to set up a disciplinary commission on the case.
Kenya ’ s track and field athletes face hardship following the second doping scandal at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.
After a fraud attempt at doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya has sent a coach home.
The International Olympic Committee announced that it would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.
A Kenyan official had announced that former sprinter and current coach, John Anzrah, had given a urine test in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-metre runner Ferguson Rotich.
This was reported to the Kenyan team management by the doping examiners.
The IAAF has asked the IOC for information on the case in order to initiate its own investigation, an IAAF spokesman said.
"Depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent actions of the IOC, the IAAF will make an assessment," it said in an IAAF statement.
"He (Anzrah) went to the doping control station and pretended to be Ferguson Rotich, gave the sample and signed it," explained Kenya's head of mission Stephan Arap Soi.
He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete, who was on the list for the training controls of the world - the Anti-Doping Agency.
Ferguson Rotich finished fourth over 800 meters in the 2015 Beijing World Cup.
Four days earlier, Kenyan track and field leader Michael Rotich had been removed from the Rio games.
He is said to have informed his country ’ s athletes about upcoming doping tests in exchange for money.
According to media reports, he was arrested on his return from Nairobi airport.
Kenya has been under special surveillance at the IOC for some time after numerous doping offences.
When announcing the more than 2000 doping tests launched by the IOC prior to the Rio Games, it was unusually pointed out beforehand that athletes from Kenya and Russia in particular would be targeted.
Before the summer games in Brazil, the world ’ s anti-doping agency exerted a lot of pressure on the African country to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.
The law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics began.
Subsequently, WADA removed Kenya from the list of countries whose doping measures conform to WADA rules.
Kenya is considered to be a great runners nation.
The country ’ s athletes won the most medals at the 2015 World Championships in Beijing.
A number of ARD television reports have repeatedly complained that funding for doping in Kenya is readily available and that there is a significant mentality of sports fraud.
IOC member Richard Pound recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had done in Russian athletics.
It could be proven that in this sport comprehensive and systematically was doped.
As a result, Russian athletes were excluded from the summer games.
Salzburg "West Side Story" with Cecilia Bartoli
In Shakespeare ’ s Year, the Salzburg Festival presents the “West Side Story ” with Tony and Maria as tragic lovers, similar to Romeo and Juliet.
With a surprising Cecilia Bartoli.
A musical conquers Salzburg: the "West Side Story", Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece.
The artistic director Cecilia Bartoli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and fulfilled a childhood dream with the role of Mary.
In the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchestra under the direction of the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel: "This music is full of rhythm," he enthuses.
We always say that it is very Latin American.
There are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody.
It is a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra.
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood!
In this production Bartoli plays an older Maria.
She remembers with melancholy her love affair with Tony, while the younger Maria plays and dances.
The role of Mary has always fascinated me.
First of all, because it is musically extraordinary!
And then there is Mary ’ s personality.
She says it in her song: "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright".
So she is smart, of course naive, and very passionate.
"She is very similar to me, to the Italian character that I have as a Roman," Bartoli laughs.
Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist."
It is such an honour for us to work with her.
She is a tremendously generous person.
And Bartoli returns the compliment: "Dudamel is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate!"
Conducting is a necessity for him.
You see it in every movement, in his gaze, it's his life!
It is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him.
We both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and also a cheerful approach to life, that is very important at all!
For American director Philip Wm. McKinley, the "West Side Story" is highly topical: "This play is about prejudice and fanaticism."
Today we have the refugees, at that time the Puertorians went to New York and the New Yorkers did not want them.
They are the same issues, and they are as meaningful today as they were then.
59 years later the piece is still relevant.
London schoolgirl who joined ISIS killed in Syria
Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join ISIS, reportedly died in Syria.
Attorney Tasnime Akunjee said that her family learned of her death a few weeks ago in Raqqa, Syria.
It was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the stronghold of the group in the country, reported ITV News on Thursday.
Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England.
"One can only hope that the only good thing is - as a warning and warning to others that these are the risks involved in going to a war zone - to prevent people from ever making that decision," Akunjee said.
In February 2015, Sultana and two other schoolgirls from East London boarded a plane bound for Turkey and then boarded a bus to the Syrian border.
Sultana ’ s family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria – and became a widow within a few months.
Reid says Clinton will remain a Supreme Court candidate if Garland wins
Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the Democratic presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, will nominate Judge Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court.
Senate Republicans have blocked Garland ’ s endorsement since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the late Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia.
Reid said on Thursday during a conference call that he expected Clinton to select Garland “with some degree of certainty ”.
A Reid spokeswoman later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton about whether she would nominate Garland and he was speculating.
He praised Garland and said Clinton ’ s team would not cause trouble with a new candidate.
Garland is the chief judge for the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.
Raid said Republicans blocked Garland ’ s nomination were lackeys and accomplices of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
He also found Donald Trump unfit for the presidency.
Treats wants nude calendar for "women and for men"
Treats magazine is working with photographer David Bellemere to bring out a 1970s Pirelli ’ s inspired calendar for 2017.
But instead of famous naked people, they want to find the next generation of top models for their 2017 NU Muses calendar.
At the beginning of this year, the editor-in-chief of Treats, Steve Shaw, told us that his nude magazine was different from Oldschool, because "Playboy is for men".
I do it for women.
Apparently he thinks that the calendar does too.
"We need to return to the representation of timeless and classic nakedness, where both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body," Shaw said in a press release on the publication of the Calendar.
Women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art.
Models can submit their images online or in person to an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York.
Turkey: Kurdish community expects mass exodus
"Anyone who does not conform and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases," says Ercan Karakoyun, chair of the Gülen Region Dialogue and World Foundation.
The Kurdish community in Germany is expecting tens of thousands of people fleeing from Turkey to seek protection in the short term.
In the medium term it could even be "several hundred thousand", believes the association chairman Ali Toprak.
Due to the harsh actions of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community in Germany expects a mass flight to Germany.
"In the short term I expect tens of thousands, in the medium term with some hundred thousand protection seekers from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition", says the association chairman Ali Toprak of "Die Welt" from Friday.
Because the government had already covered Kurdish strongholds with punitive actions months ago, 500,000 Kurds are on the run within Turkey.
After the thwarted coup, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks would be added.
Many in Europe will want to start afresh if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey.
"It is not acceptable for a state that itself takes in refugees to produce refugees in its own country," said Toprak.
The head of the association deplored the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in Alevi cities.
With it Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds.
“They are the last large minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks were already in the past hundred years exterminated or expelled ”, said Toprak, which is also CDU member.
The head of the association demanded that the federal government "position itself as sharply as Austria against Erdogan and his supporters".
Also in Germany a "witch hunt" is taking place against Erdogan's critics.
I don ’ t feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months.
The German branch of the Gülen Movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.
More Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and opponents.
Branding as Gülen ’ s followers destroys teachers and other academics ’ professional existence.
"Whoever does not conform and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases, incidentally also the Kemalists and secularists", said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen related Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World".
As the newspaper reports, citing figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks were already the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup.
As of 30 June, this was 11,386 people, i.e. just under 29 per cent of all persons recognised as entitled to asylum (39,625).
In this uprising there are not those fleeing from war, poverty or lack of prospects.
The right to asylum under the Basic Law is exclusively political, i.e. individually persecuted by the state.
Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: "Going there, where it hurts"
Strange Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania: The locals get nothing from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia may not vote for the state parliament.
In Mecklenburg, Western Pomerania they have understood.
In 2021 the state election will not take place again directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin parliament already decided at the beginning of the year.
Because it does not go more stupid than so far: Summer holidays, heat and state election campaign - that bites.
The locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on holiday.
The vast majority of holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee on the way, are not natives, so may not vote for the state parliament.
In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and, in the end, count votes are only laborious to find.
Until 4 September 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg Western Pomerania has to endure yet another election campaign just past the people.
The hot phase, if it can be said at all, has just begun.
And it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear for his office.
The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.
What is exciting is how strong a newcomer AfD is and what is left of the coalition.
Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, is campaigning in an almost inconspicuous way, apart from his billboards.
He travels through the country, distributes roses and talks a little with the people, just like his legendary taciturn predecessor Harald Ringstorff did.
Otherwise, Seelering has gotten cold feet, blaming Chancellor Merkel for the AfD ’ s blossoming.
Their refugee policy, their "we can do it", has accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will now probably cost him his fine post.
The CDU with its leading candidate, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced what it is like to campaign at the right place at the right time.
It has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large rallies; Merkel's parliamentary constituency is in the northeast.
But the target group was not right, there were more North Rhine Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony there than Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania.
"There was probably the majority from other federal states," complained Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg, Western Pomerania, recently in NDR.
But it also does no harm to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.
Otherwise, the Northeast CDU largely dispenses with the usual campaign stalls on market squares and in front of shopping centers with umbrellas and balloons.
According to Kokert, this only plays a "subordinate role".
The Union, too, has realised that it is crumbling away from its rural base, that it must make a great effort to reconnect with the people.
You are like the left, the SPD, the Greens: barely present in the vastness of the country.
However, the advice of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow campaigners is also self-revealing: "They must go where it hurts, namely where people are: Village festivals, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used".
Because there is a lot at stake, Sellering has now called on his SPD to conduct a particularly committed election campaign.
In recent polls, the Social Democrats were 22 Percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).
In the 2011 election, the SPD clearly won with 35.6 percent over the CDU (22).
The Greens, small party with seven per cent in the inquiries, might create the jump into the federal state parliament.
They make a modern virtue out of holiday necessity and largely transfer their election campaign to the Internet.
"Online" election campaign, it calls the chairman Claudia Müller.
Otherwise, green campaigners are looking for local voters among the vacationers.
Silke Gajek, the leading candidate, curves straight with a houseboat by the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it also still beautiful.
Her impression: "Vacation in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment".
B27 gebiete Renovation: Restaurants suffer from closure
There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is being renovated.
There is praise everywhere for those responsible for the construction work, which begins at 5.30 a.m. and does not end until around 8 p.m.
"They have made everything quite ragged", tells Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet-station.
This is a super team.
Nor is there any delay.
The construction site could be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week at the half-time as planned, everything should be ready by the end of October.
There is also praise for the courtesy of those responsible for the construction work, for example when it comes to setting up makeshift driveways.
Since the construction site moved south on Monday and the closure of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and the connection to Rottenburg was restored, the traffic situation within the town has eased.
Citizens can now drive on both sides of the B 27 from Ofterdingen.
The alternative traffic through the place seems to decrease.
"There were sometimes considerable complaints," says Deputy Head of the Office, Florian King, who is responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment.
The residents of Bachsatzstrasse, Steinlachstrasse, Hafnerstrasse and Weiherrain had to struggle with more traffic noise because many people were looking for hidden routes and were more familiar with their navigation than with the signs.
As a result, some lorries were lost in residential areas.
Since also the speed limits were not kept, the municipality demanded strengthened the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.
"There have been significant transgressions," says King, who himself once learned about the situation on the ground.
Two or three flashes per minute have already been made.
The fastest was 77 km / h at the speed of 30 km / h zone.
Since the construction site has moved on, however, it has become quieter.
For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rottenburg the street is now again open.
Businessmen do not like to look at the maps.
But the fact that the B 27 is refurbishment has led to sales slumps for them, lets anyone ask, look.
However, some are more and some less affected.
If you have less to do with the "end customer", i.e. if you produce for other companies, the refurbishment has hardly any consequences for you.
Also at Autohaus Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a "at most slight decline", but also admits that "the running customers are missing".
The pubs along the street are the hardest hit.
J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly Krone, finds clear words.
This is already threatening our very existence.
Not only him, but all restaurants were "hit hard".
The customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.
We have to be happy about every Euro turnover.
He puts the loss of sales at "well over 50 percent".
The street rehabilitation had "set back two years".
He had to lay off half of his employees.
If I had a company with 4000 employees and half of them would have been fired, politics would have reacted differently.
Instead of it district president Jörg Schmidt answered to a inquiry of Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the reference, the restaurant profits otherwise from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. Now it must carry evenly also the disadvantages, which result from the reorganization.
Göhner knows of other counties where something like this was handled more generously.
With all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist.
After all, the family business has been located here since 1715, pointing to its long history.
He can understand that other regular guests now stop by less frequently because of the complicated traffic routing.
If you can't drive here, it's nice somewhere else.
Göhner has no doubts that his regular clientele will return after the end of the renovation work.
Despite the BSE and avian influenza crises, Göhner considers the impact of the B27 construction works on his customers to be the biggest crisis his restaurant has experienced in its long history.
Six months of construction, that ’ s brutal.
Legislation is constantly being screwed up in the name of the fight against terrorism.
Following the recent attacks, Minister of the Interior de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package.
But what does toleration have to do with terror?
And what does the coalition partner say about all this?
Thomas de Maizière gives the reconciliator.
All his proposals are "politically reasonable" for the coalition partner, says the Federal Minister of the Interior when presenting his new security package.
They do not overtax anyone.
Other, more far-reaching points would first be discussed within the parties.
I am also involved in this.
As Minister of the Interior, however, he is interested in results and in an "attainable consensus" within the coalition.
Following the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, De Maizière took a little time before presenting his conclusions on security in the Republic.
But they are all the more extensive.
Some things are already known, announced, and aimed at: It is not new that a new security authority should take care of cracking encrypted communications.
Nor does the fact that Germany has to implement several EU requirements on passenger data and gun law.
The call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is also not surprising.
In part, de Maizière is launching a second attempt at proposals that could not be made with the SPD so far: he wants to criminalize propaganda for terrorist groups and remove the German passport from jihadists with dual citizenship.
"These will be difficult points for the SPD," admits the CDU.
He nevertheless considered this to be reasonable and did not demand anything that would have no chance with the coalition partner anyway.
De Maizière also presents a few new ideas.
Some of these are quite intrinsic: he is planning fast-track procedures for deportations and more opportunities to arrest people before they are deported.
Refugees who are specifically brought into the country are to have their smartphones checked first and disclose social media accounts for a security check.
When it comes to tolerating rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse off than before - for example, those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to conceal their identity.
Some of this is politically and legally sensitive.
Some things still seem half-baked and leave open questions.
And on a number of points, such as the unequal treatment of those who are tolerated, the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?
Yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror.
But it cannot be denied that the assassins of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.
In addition, many people were concerned about security, given the high numbers of refugees.
And things that deeply preoccupied people could not be left out of election campaigns.
Internal security has come under enormous scrutiny.
First the attacks in the neighbourhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice.
Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.
The uncertainty is great.
And yes, there will be election campaigns.
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly positioning themselves on the subject of internal security.
In recent days, the two parties have been at loggerheads.
First a gruelling dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then a collection of ideas on security policy by some Union interior ministers, in which the department heads also demand a burqa ban and a renunciation of dual citizenship.
Here, too, De Maizière strives for conciliatory tones.
He did not want to turn away from the double pass.
We have pacified the discussion in Germany.
It makes no sense to reopen them.
And he has constitutional concerns about a burqa ban.
Whether his own package is constitutional at all points and whether it is really "reasonable" for the coalition partner remains to be seen.
There is a lot in it that could cause controversy.
But the SPD is also currently trying to make a name for itself on the subject of internal security.
Party leader Sigmar Gabriel first cautiously signals willingness to talk and says: "The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increasing security."
Volkswagen is still coming through lightly.
Despite diesel scandals, deliveries are increasing worldwide.
But things are not going well in all markets.
In the recall campaign, there is a vortex around a term.
Volkswagen is starting into the second half of the year with more restrained deliveries.
In spite of the diesel affair, Europe ’ s largest car maker can still show a plus so far this year thanks to its many brands and some well-running markets.
But in July, the core brand VW weakened, especially in Western Europe, putting a strain on the overall sales again, as the Dax listed company announced.
Worldwide, the VW brand sold 449100 cars in July, 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the same month last year.
In Western Europe alone, the second most important market after China, sales were 14 percent below the same month last year.
Deliveries in Germany, our home market, plummeted by almost one-sixth.
Brand sales manager Jürgen Stackmann attributed the weaker figures from July above all to two fewer sales days in Europe.
In addition, there had been a reluctance to buy in some core markets due to "changed economic conditions".
In addition to the situation surrounding the attempted coup in Turkey, the British vote to leave the EU was also a burden, explained a spokeswoman.
In the USA, where the exhaust gas affair first escalated, there is also a minus.
The big support for VW is the Chinese market.
Altogether the mainly concerned house mark of the Lower Saxony comes anyway far glimpsibly by the Diesel scandal: After the first seven months only a delivery minus of 0,9 per cent on 3,37 million vehicles is written down.
Fred Kappler, Group Sales Director, reported a further increase in sales from January to July.
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles during this period, 5.904 million worldwide.
Volkswagen had manipulated emission tests with a software.
In Germany alone, VW calls for around 2.5 million cars to be converted into workshops.
In the course of the conversion VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects.
After the conversion of vehicles there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance.
After the conversion, the carmaker issues the customer a "guarantee equivalent" certificate, but does not speak of a "guarantee", as it was called in corporate circles on Friday.
Reason are legal subtleties.
The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen is now offering its German customers a guarantee for converted diesel models.
This would have been confirmed last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport.
The Ministry of Transport confirmed that this meeting had taken place.
"VW has to comply fully with the requirements of my investigation commission and the KBA."
According to the ministry, "deviations from this will not be accepted", explained Federal Transport Minister Alexander Dobrindt (CSU).
VW has taken over the warranty that with fuel consumption, CO2-emissions or engine performance after the conversion no deteriorations take place and all type-approval-relevant vehicle values have unchanged existence.
However, Volkswagen itself does not use the term 'guarantee', as it was called in business circles.
With the broad term "warranty", Volkswagen sees the possibility that, for example, half a year after the conversion, customers could come to a workshop with an engine failure - and could attribute this to the new software, even if the damage has nothing to do with it.
In the interest of the customer, it is also important to avoid that any other damage, which has nothing to do with the exhaust gas scandal, leads to uncertainty regarding possible warranty regulations, as it was said.
Therefore VW do not use the term "warranty".
The Raiffeisen bank Gmund at the Tegernsee demands punitive interest from rich savers in the future - as second institute in Germany.
Bankchef Josef Paul said on Thursday: "It is only about 139 Customers, the 40 Million euro on current or overnight accounts park".
The Federal association of German banks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it: Normal savers would not have to fear to pay penalty interest for their Spargroschen “.
If banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank (ECB), they will have to pay 0.4% interest.
Starting in September, Raiffeisenbank Gmund will demand the return of this fee from private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros in current or overnight funds accounts.
"The first 100,000 euros are free."
"The next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year," said Paul.
He has been guarding EUR 40 million for some time, which could be taken from one day to the next and which he could not use.
"They are in my central bank account and cost 0.4 percent," said the bank boss.
"I can't put down 4000 Euros for every million."
He will now pass on the costs in accordance with the polluter pays principle.
Simply leaving the cash in the safes of the Raiffeisenbank would be far too dangerous: "I've already experienced four raids, I don't want the fifth!", said the bank's executive board.
Most clients would understand and switch to other forms of investment.
Few migrated to other banks.
The Cooperative Association of Bavaria declared: "The extreme monetary policy stance of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks".
To carry it alone, "economically permanently not possible".
Some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management, credit cards or bank transfers.
The Thüringer Volks- und Raiffeisenbank Altenburger Land made the headlines with their 2014 Skatbank, a branch of the bank, with interest on deposits of three million euros or more.
Michael Kemmer, Managing Director of the German Banking Association, said: "We do not expect private customers to have to pay deposits all over the country because competition among banks and savings banks in Germany is far too strong for that".
One banker said that there is "a clientele at the Tegernsee that is more lavishly endowed with wealth".
"This can be a problem for a small bank", if it is free money beware.
The Gmund Cooperative Bank was founded in 1911 and has branches in Bad Wiessee, Rottach, Egern, Kreuth and Tegernsee.
Well-known actors, sportsmen and entrepreneurs live in the region.
The cooperative association Bavaria “are at present no further banks well-known, which compute an expense replacement for deposits of private customers ”, said speaker Ernst.
At the end of June, Uwe Fröhlich, President of the Bundesverband der deutschen Volksbanken und Raiffeisenbanken (BVR) (Federal Association of German Cooperative Banks and Raiffeisen Banks), declared: "The threshold of going into the negative towards private customers is very, very high."
The competition is hard, and it threatens the migration of investors to the competition.
Customers in Germany will not tolerate this in its breadth.
Destination records: who actually buys records?
Lone middle-aged men love records.
Before you hurry to the comment section to fill it with harsh insults under the pseudonym NichtAllEinsamenMännerMittlerenenalter, this statement is derived from current data.
According to YouGov, the much discussed resurgence of records is not due to a boom in millennials who want to welcome the novelty of physical objects, but to Midlife ’ s nostalgia.
Those who have recently bought a record are most likely between the ages of 45 and 54.
In fact, the age group of 18 to 24 is the most unlikely buyer group.
It is also not a horde of hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers rather keep their feelings to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).
But are the results of YouGov correct?
If this blog were a news report on TV, the camera would follow me as I walk in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and wildly gesturing before I stop, hold my hands and say something profound like: "So, let's take a closer look."
So, let us have a look at that.
Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings that once housed independent sellers - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops.
I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part, in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mood through observation.
Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (number of data: eight middle-aged men, one woman, presumably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.
Is he a collector, I ask?
"I guess so," he says.
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 records.
These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e mail, I didn't follow him home), line the walls of his living room.
The reason why he owns such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records that he could not afford when they appeared and re-buy items that he sold when he was young and broke.
"Many of the things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. Things I was probably a little too young to buy," he says.
He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.
This is my vice.
Wez, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many of the customers he meets apply to YouGov ’ s profile.
But he has also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media hpe, people who have heard about the comeback and see themselves forced to buy their old records again.
From the conversations I had, people usually got rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.
Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again, "he says.
That would explain the boom in followers of the record revival of a certain age.
But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?
It only takes a few seconds in a store like Phonica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like-minded people.
According to Wez, some of the older customers took offense at the contactless payment system.
Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to retreat to the stability of familiar record covers, objects that evoke happy memories of youth.
“I think sometimes it can be filling an emptiness or possessing material possessions as a kind of consolation, ” says Wez.
This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is the case with many people.
It is an easy way to occupy oneself spiritually.
"We are like their social workers!" one co-worker flushes out of a pile of records.
A survey by the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month have not listened to it.
The survey also found that 41% own a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record do not own a record player.
At this point in the news coverage, I would probably look very worried as I flip through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations.
Jonny, 42, who works on Sounds of the Universe, has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.
"Someone came in recently and said," I don't have a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead record so I can put it on the shelf, "he says.
This is not a large percentage, but it definitely happens.
More product heavy, less music heavy.
We have people who say, "I don't have a record player."
These are younger people, not older, who are only slowly coming in.
Fopp, who has dedicated almost an entire floor to the records, has a more colourful audience as I enter.
There are couples around 70, tourists who take photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.
Even if the atmosphere is a little less relaxed than in the above mentioned stores - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz roars from the speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.
None of them looks particularly lonely, but gnawing psychological traumas are hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.
Elanora, 27, has been in business for a few minutes now, looking at the variety of records on sale.
It is more like window shopping than large-scale shopping.
She doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says.
It costs a lot.
It's easy to hear music from a computer or in any other way, but the beauty of records is "... she goes with a sigh in love.
I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.
My last stop is a shop that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: Urban Outfitters.
While I give the appearance of patterning the jeans, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouped around Polaroid cameras for a moment, before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player.
On the left is a staircase, a wall full of records by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential records for an average collection.
No one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so high up that it is impossible to touch them.
It is pure "record art".
But given that any attraction to these items could mean more money for the industry and send some customers to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.
It is no surprise that a population that has more time and money than others is also the one that spends the most on luxury items like tiles.
Although my research has shown that the results of YouGov are correct, they do not take into account, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record lovers that exist in reality, record stores and online forums.
These people probably work hard at school or in offices.
They certainly don ’ t spend their Thursday morning strolling through the record stores of Berwick Street and browsing through records, while avoiding the staring gaze of an eerie, 30-year-old false host who towers over the shoulders of middle-aged men who don ’ t know anything.
The Greenland Shark is the longest living vertebrate - Video report
More scientifically, the Greenland shark has the longest life span of any vertebrate on the planet.
Julius Nielsen, who is investigating sharks, says that the record was set by a female who is assumed to be between 272 and 512 years old and five metres long.
French court refuses offer on demolition of businesses in the jungle refugee camp
A French court has refused an offer by the authorities in Calais to tear down dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, home to thousands of refugees.
At a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should have the power to tear down 72 provisional stores in which people inside the warehouse sell goods, from cigarettes to energy drinks, offer hairdressing services, or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.
The Calais Prefecture argued that these places should be demolished because they would constitute a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would carry a fire and sanitation risk.
Humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important because the free meals offered by the state-sponsored association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.
They also pointed out that the temporary shops and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.
A court in Lille ruled that there was no legal basis for the expulsion of people running the 72 provisional businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the Calais prefecture were "perfectly understandable."
Judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafés and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely feeding people "who live in extremely precarious conditions."
He said that the areas provide quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.
One of the places threatened by the demolition was the camp's Jungle Book Kids' Café, which is run as a non-profit and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, and advice on asylum cases for the camp's hundreds of vulnerable unaccompanied minors.
More than 170,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.
A letter to the Guardian said that the closure "would be a disaster for these children, the youngest of whom are eight years old."
The two relief organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp has risen to over 9,000 - the highest number so far - after a steep increase of new arrivals during the summer.
Despite Olympic disappointment: Martin remains combative
Despite his disappointing performance in the Olympic time-trial, cycling pro Tony Martin does not want to be defeated.
"I keep an eye on the World Cup, remain confident and continue to fight," wrote the 31-year-old on Facebook on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro.
He has no explanation for his miserable twelfth place on Sugar Loaf.
"To be honest, I find it difficult to comment on yesterday's time trial", said Martin.
He had to analyze calmly which reasons had led to the debacle.
In the time trial of the World Championships in Qatar in October, Martin wanted to fight for the title.
"I'll take a close look at everything we've changed lately."
"This includes my position", wrote the triple time-trial world champion, who had lost more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fabian Cancellara (Switzerland) on Wednesday.
Olympia: Tennis pro Siegemund missed semifinals
Laura Siegemund ’ s winning streak ended in the quarter-final of Rio: The world ranking ranked 32 from Metzingen missed by 1: 6, 1: 6 against Monica Puig (Puerto Rico / WTA
34) the semi-final of the Olympic tennis tournament.
Siegemund, who was plagued by back problems, could only pass her serve once and seemed powerless compared to the previous rounds.
On Thursday Angelique Kerber (Kiel / No. 2) had the chance to make it into the qualifying round.
The Australian ’ s “Open ” winner met the British Johanna Konta (No. 10).
Tommy Haas was the last German professional tennis player to win a silver medal in Sydney in 2000.
Two German DTB Starter in the quarterfinals of summer games there had been last 1992.
Never before has a German duo been in an Olympic singles semi-final.
Group launches launch of live video games
Watching other people playing video games is a huge trend - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it.
The technology group buys the Start up Beam, which specializes in this hobby.
How much money flows for the acquisition, Microsoft did not say on Thursday.
Beam went with its offer only in January to the start and has already more than 100,000 users.
You can watch others play, but you can also intervene yourself.
For example, they can give up missions, face enemies, and provide equipment.
Game giant Activision Blizzard is launching a new high-definition video service for the booming world of eSport.
Facebook should help on the way to a global media event.
The advertising industry is already listening.
The employees of the start-up, which is currently based in Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington, move to Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, California, as Beam announced co-founder and CEO Matt Salsamendi.
The transaction is not intended to change anything for customers.
Beam is, according to Microsoft, integrated into the video games department around the Xbox, console.
The market for live streaming of video game activities is growing rapidly.
Well-known platforms are Twitch and YouTube Gaming.
Twitch was purchased in 2014 from online retailer Amazon – for nearly a billion dollars.
YouTube gaming is part of Google ’ s native alphabet.
Here comes the Enforcement Trailer
Germany ’ s speed sensors have to adapt to the next generation of speedometers: In various federal states, including Hesse and Brandenburg, new flash devices are being tested that are designed to transmit speed signals particularly effectively.
The futuristic-looking Enforcement Trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident focal points, where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police.
For example, at highway construction sites or bridges to be rehabilitated with temporary speed limits, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with the speed limit with a stationary speed camera.
A permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or complex.
The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days without interruption in measuring operation, the case data are transmitted encrypted via a modem.
In addition, all vehicles over several lanes can be simultaneously detected with laser measurement technology.
Variable speed limits and drive-through bans by time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.
According to the manufacturer, the trailer can be moved with any car with a towing hitch when it is raised.
So that it is not simply stolen, it is lowered in the measuring operation, so that the wheels disappear in the armoured and, by the way, bullet-proof outer shell.
In addition, a built-in alarm system should protect the camera against vandalism.
According to Vitronic, the trailer has been tested in various federal states since 2015 and is now also in use.
Foreign authorities are also flashing with the new technology: France recently ordered 100 units, following an order of 150 last year.
Great Britain wins silver in 7 Rugby after Fiji Masterclass wins gold
Britain ’ s impressive performance in the 7-man Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final on Thursday night at the final hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were defeated with a score of 43 ’ 7 at Deodoro Stadium here in Rio.
Fiji gave a master class in handling, side stepping, moving up, line running and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour.
The defeat was sweetened by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.
The clear defeat of the Boks, 7 and 5 in the semi-final on the same day could fall back on them in the final.
Regardless of this, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man team in top form.
It might be a consolation for the UK - but it probably won't - that at least one Briton will have a gold medal hanging around his neck tomorrow: Fiji's head coach Ben Ryan, the former Wimbledon boss for England.
The UK had a difficult road behind it.
Eight years ago they lost under Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.
Here they lost only one.
This setback will hurt, but the progress is amazing.
Fiji started wonderfully and let the attacks of GB bounce off for fun.
It felt as if the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. were running into busses, and the World Series Winners went up 5: 0 when Osea Kolinisau raced over the corner.
With only four minutes left Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right, which he converted.
12 and GB has hardly touched the ball.
An excellent tackle by Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.
In the seventh minute, Jasa Veremalua led a touchdown in the right corner, and it was 0: 17 for GB.
Nakarawa added a new one since the restart and there was still over a minute of play … in the first half.
Vatemo Ravouvou raced through further weak tackles of the GB team and stormed up to the line to score a goal.
The conversion brought a 29-0 to the pause.
It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while the UK is still learning.
So it is.
GB made fundamental changes at halftime and closed the fijian gap... for four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Josua Tuisova went through after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji.
Dan Norton started an attempt for the UK, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game has long been in favor of the South Seas Islanders, whose fans sang, waved flags and danced in the stands.
It was not difficult to admire the playful approach of Fiji.
Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the final seconds.
The whistle rang out, the Fijis hugged each other and GB kicked into the grass with a crushing punch.
Earlier that day, Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi-final with 20, and Britain pushed South Africa out of the race in a close semi-final match - Britain's transformation of the difference.
Kyle Brown brought the Boks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with impressive footwork and scored a goal under the post in the second half.
A brilliant late Tackling of Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15 Aside Team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.
Helen Glover and Heather Stanning inspired to rowing victory by fighting the coach's cancer
There will be no more emotinal gold than in these games, and that means something.
From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard strikes that go down in history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.
Even if it was only the two who were at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. The echo of coach Robin Williams was omnipresent when they rowed to the second Olympic gold medal in a row without coxswain, the first women in the history of British sport to set such a standard.
Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39th undefeated bet, which is also unparalleled.
What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not fully reflect the nature of triumph.
Behind every gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make all the difference, and there was no one more helpful than the coach who, 30 months ago, did not know if he would survive that day when he was diagnosed with cancer.
As he said, he was risky.
I had bladder cancer that was operable and they did.
If you do not, it will spread everywhere.
It would have been quite a bad situation.
It changes the outlook a bit.
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.
The trio were lucky that he could start his treatment in early 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term at all in such circumstances.
I needed money, so I had to get better soon.
It was an incentive.
I was in the hospital and was walking around the ward - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said a few steps would be enough.
That is how it starts.
Rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it even bigger.
In the immediacy of victory, her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-racking morning talking a little more than usual, trying to come to terms with his own fears.
Stanning, who served as Captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in an operation in Afghanistan, said, "I was an emotional wreck this week. That may be a bit extreme, but it means so much."
It just repeats how much this means to me, how much I and Helen and also Robin have worked.
It was three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.
Without Robin we would be nobody, so a massive thank you goes to him. He is the best coach in the world.
I could not have asked for a better person to train or a better trainer.
Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.
The pair had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.
Even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.
We were very caught in the moment.
Helen called "stay in the trial, stay in the trial".
It is really important not to get carried away.
We had a good start and at the same time we were not out to do something great.
We didn ’ t want any fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.
The couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future.
Glover has to appear next week at a wedding, of her own with the TV ’ s adventurer Steve Backshall.
Now she just wants to enjoy the moment.
I didn ’ t want to say that this was my last race.
That would have meant too much pressure.
It took me about six months in London to realise that I was an Olympic champion.
It was all so new to me and I was so stressed.
Here it took about four minutes.
It feels so much better, "she said.
31 years of exemplary clarity
The managing director of the water purpose association "Veitensteingruppe", Ruppert Göller, goes into retirement.
The association is considered to be "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.
This was said some time ago in the original sound in a broadcast of the Bavarian Radio.
A little later the water forum of the government of Lower Franconia appreciated the Zweckverband.
The work of the Veitenstein group is considered "exemplary throughout Bavaria".
Behind all this stands Rupert Göller, who worked for 31 years in the Zweckverband, 28 of them as managing director.
Now he was retired at the age of 65.
The drinking water association of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality Breitbrunn, annually extracts about 150,000 cubic meters of water and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with about 5,500 inhabitants.
Its member municipalities are Kirchlauter, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.
Water supply contracts exist for other towns and municipalities.
The current chairman, Breitbrunn ’ s mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was employed as a water attendant in 1985 and appointed Managing Director of the Association as early as 1988.
"His tasks have been very diverse, ranging from water pipe construction and maintenance to office and organizational activities, budget planning, fee and contribution calculations, and weekend emergencies," the chair said.
Among the most notable events were the opening of the new wells (1994), the purchase of land in the area of the new wells (1998) and the compensation of farmers, the rehabilitation of the elevated reservoirs (1999), the purchase of a new central computer system (2004) and the partial renewal of water pipes.
There had been no standstill and one had again and again taken up innovations, because water means life and drinking water was the most important food.
In her laudatory speech she praised Göller ’ s faithful, reliable and correct service over a period of 31 years.
He has campaigned passionately for his Water Purpose Association and he has lived the Water Purpose Association as if it were his own business.
A few weeks ago, as a real practitioner, he was allowed to present the successful concept of the Veitenstein group for reducing nitrates in front of the water forum of the district of Lower Franconia.
He had received a great deal of recognition and praise for this.
Rupert Göller for his part praised water warden Alfons Griebel, who has worked with him for 28 years.
He is the best water warden and he was a loyal squire.
Together we were an unbeatable team.
He described the building of wells and the restructuring of the Zweckverband as highlights from his point of view.
But the biggest challenge and the most difficult use was the pipe burst at the elevated tank near Kirchlauter on 3 January.
Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.
Even the supply of Neubrunn could only be maintained once, because the elevated tank from Pettstadt was filled with hoses.
The management of the Drinking Water Association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.
Soprano Anna Netrebko deals openly with the autism of her son Tiago - and addresses other affected parents: "You must have the courage to talk about it."
"Medicine has made great progress," the 44-year-old told the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera.
When the disease was recognized in her son, she believed that she must die.
But the now eight-year-old Tiago has made good progress and is now learning privately in New York, where there are the best therapists.
"To give an example: when I ask him something that happened two years ago when I sang at La Scala in Milan, he doesn't remember anything," Netrebko said.
But he is the happiest man on earth.
Tiago comes from Netrebko's connection with the bass-baritone Erwin Schrott.
She is now married to the tenor Yusif Eyvazov.
Beziehungstat in Bargteheide - Man shoots on life companion
A 35-year-old man shot at his partner in an apartment building in Bargteheide (Stormarn district) at 10.45 a.m. on Friday and fatally injured her.
"The man himself called us and said that he shot his partner," said a police officer.
The perpetrator is on the run, he is being searched for publicly.
Meanwhile country widely, because Sven S. could be on the way with the car.
The man is about 1.80 meters tall, muscular, tanned and has a bald head.
Meanwhile the police have published a photo of him.
However, it is a few years old.
Meanwhile the man wears a bald head.
The man should not be addressed directly.
He could still carry the weapon with him, according to the police.
Who sees Sven S., should call the 110.
The police speak of an "act of relationship".
The victim was born in 1988, the perpetrator in 1981.
At first, the police in Lübeck did not want to give any information about the course of events or the relationship between the perpetrator and the victim; however, they confirmed that a person had been killed.
"It is a homicide."
"We are not saying more at the moment," said a police officer in Lübeck.
According to eyewitnesses, a Special Operations Command (SEK) was on the scene.
Steel - bright spots for the German steel industry
The crisis-stricken and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared additional costs amounting to millions.
Financial burdens that threatened the industry with green electricity production are off the table.
It remains to be exempted from the renewable energies levy on existing plants for the so-called self-generated electricity production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister of Economics Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday edition).
"I am really glad that we were finally able to achieve this after two years of tough negotiations."
Accordingly, the European Commission had initially planned to make the steel producers, who use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption, pay for it.
According to the German industry association, the steel industry was threatened with additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year.
Gabriel told the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the EU Commission after talks with Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.
Only when the generators in the steelworks are replaced will an EEG of 20 per cent be charged.
But even this is not charged in the steel industry.
IG Metall welcomed the agreement between Germany and the EU Commission on self-generation.
Thus the status quo of the past regulation is to a large extent fixed.
Gabriel ’ s successful efforts for the steel industry were of particular importance.
"This is a first step in our 'steel is future' campaign."
"Others must follow."
"Also with the reform of the emission right trade climate and employment goals are to be weighed", explained industrial union metal boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt.
The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the 2008 financial crisis.
The situation worsened further last year, when the world ’ s largest producer, China, threw steel on the world market en masse in the face of weakening domestic demand.
European producers accuse Chinese steel companies of price dumping.
In the course of this spring, the situation has eased somewhat.
On the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel are having an effect, and on the other, the economic outlook in China has brightened.
It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.
German industry leader Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.
In the end, prices would have tended to stagnate again.
The industry is reacting to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.
Thyssenkrupp did not want to rule out the closure of individual plants.
Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.
In July, German steel producers remained cautious, despite rising prices and increasing orders.
At 3.4 million tons, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the same month last year, according to the trade association Stahl on Friday.
After a short increase in May, the manufactured quantity decreased for the second month in a row.
Since the beginning of the year, production has been two percent down on the previous year.
The association expects an increase in output in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation.
Community, spirit, health: Singing is good for seniors
The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: As a young girl she was in the school choir, in the teacher's degree, she took the subject of music, and today the 78 Jahre sings in a senior choir.
"Singing moves me - emotionally and physically", she describes.
After a rehearsal she feels balanced, happy and altogether more alive, she says.
By the way, she does something good for her health and her spirit.
Because singing is from several perspectives a mad hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the German senior league.
Most seniors sing in a choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, Hackler describes.
By the regular being together seniors can attach and maintain social contacts.
Because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.
Ursel Kipp also had this experience in her choir: "To coordinate and organize oneself, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together".
Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.
Because seniors train deep and controlled breathing.
If you regularly require your lungs, you will not lose your breath so quickly in everyday life.
Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an optimal hobby.
Singing often has a very special effect on older people, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Association of Senior Citizens.
In the older generations, communal singing had a much higher value, it was part of everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains.
Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening to songs awakens many memories in older people, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.
Through song lyrics and especially melodies, even people suffering from dementia remember events long ago.
When singing, the head is also required to perform a special feat, explains Lenz.
Concentrating on your own voice and a given rhythm at the same time and adapting to the other singers - that is a great cognitive challenge.
Elderly people, in particular, who live alone, practice not to concentrate solely on themselves.
Another positive aspect is the recognition one receives from singing in a choir, says Hackler.
An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.
Self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.
To show oneself: If I practice for a long time, I become better and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens.
So there are plenty of good reasons to start singing.
Anyone who wants to try out a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, advises Lenz.
You don't sing alone - with 50 people singing, who hears a sound going wrong?
In the search for the suitable offer seniors have different possibilities, say Hackler.
If someone from the circle of acquaintances sings in a senior choir, one can simply join.
Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.
Whoever wishes to sing in a church choir can contact the congregation or the head of the church directly.
Many senior choirs can also be found on the internet.
If you do not have access to the Internet, you can ask your family, friends or neighbours for help when searching the Internet.
Who has desire to sing, should join absolutely a choir, guesses / advises Hackler.
Singing is good for the soul and has something liberating - this applies to all ages.
Cats are more sensitive than males to the cries of kittens
In Hannover, biologists have investigated the effect of calling cat babies on adult animals.
To their surprise, the meowing did not leave the males indifferent - however, they always behaved the same in contrast to the females.
Female cats can recognize the degree of excitement of cat babies by meowing of the little ones.
They react ten percent faster to the sounds of kittens who think they are in great need, as scientists from the Veterinary School and the Hannover Medical School (MHH) have discovered.
Males also react to the calls of kittens - but always the same.
"Obviously, the acoustic differences between the miaowing of less and strongly excited young animals are either imperceptible or insignificant for the males," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding from the MHH.
She is the lead author of the study, which was published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology".
In a previous study, the research team had already found that the duration and pitch of the kittens ’ screams differ with the urgency of their need for help.
A total of nine adult males and eight females from the livestock of the MHH were observed.
On the one hand, calls were played to them by little ones, who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from their mother and siblings.
On the other hand, they were confronted with screams of more excited kittens, which were raised additionally.
The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.
"All females, even those who did not yet have their own offspring, reacted in a differentiated way to the screams," said Konerding.
They turned over faster to the loudspeaker, if this shouts of the very excited kittens played off.
This ability is possibly congenital or develops with sexual maturity.
"It was a surprise that the males reacted at all," said the biologist.
In the past, scientists have repeatedly investigated the reactions of men and women to baby sounds in humans.
Also some studies showed that women reacted more sensitively to infants, no matter whether they were already mothers or not, reported the biologist Marina Scheumann.
Podolski reaches for Supercup with "Gala"
Hakan Sükür is a legend in Turkey.
In Turkey, an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hakan Sükür.
He is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
For the first time since the coup attempt, an important football game is taking place in Turkey.
Before the duel of the archrivals between Besiktas Istanbul and Lukas Podolskis Galatasaray Istanbul about the Supercup in Konya the official line is clear: "Business as usual" is announced.
Even when the state of emergency was imposed after the coup attempt in July, the government asserted that ordinary citizens ’ everyday lives should not be affected.
But this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible for the coup attempt.
And there is no stopping the football.
The prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former star kicker Hakan Sükür.
According to this, South Africa, now living in America, is accused of being a member of a terrorist group.
Sükür is to be a follower of the preacher Fethullah Gülen, who is held responsible by the president Recep Tayyip Erdogan for the coup attempt.
Although the initial 90-day state of emergency will continue to apply until October, this will have virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks.
Erdogan declared the nightly "democracy" guards in public places all over the country to be over on Wednesday.
The sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdogan.
Especially fans of the workers club Besiktas are not traditionally friends of the president.
But what unites the majority of Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military coups.
Even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Galatasaray or Besiktas.
Lukas Podolski will once again be the star of the cup winner "Gala".
The 31-year-old from Cologne proved his sporting worth in the past season: With 17 goals and nine assists in all competitions, the 31-year-old finished his first season as the top scorer of his club.
In the final against Fenerbahce he scored the 1-0 victory goal.
The newspaper "Fanatik" praised him: "He was the best on the pitch."
He finished the season in an excellent way and secured the cup for his team.
Thanks to "Poldi" the disappointing season came to a conciliatory end for the record champions.
After the preliminary round of the Champions League, K.o, the "Lions" were eliminated early in the Europa League.
In the Süper Lig it was only enough to rank six.
The season was not good.
The cup was the only way to win anything.
“We managed to do that and that ’ s the most important thing, ” Podolski said.
For Master Besiktas the season went better.
Above all thanks to Mario Gomez, with 26 Season Meetings as the Süper ’ s Lig ’ s leading goal scorer laid the foundation for the 14th title.
This is also the reason why the fans continue to hope for the return of the 31-year-old.
After the coup attempt Gomez, who is under contract with AC Florenz and only lent to Besiktas, announced not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European Championship vacation.
"If Mario wants to come to us, he just has to say it", quoted the magazine "Kicker" Club boss Fikret Orman.
But the striker would have to be willing to give up about a third of his annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros, Orman clarified: "We cannot pay his salary at Florence".
Despite doping: These athletes still have medals and chances at the Olympics in Rio
34-year-old Justin Gatlin was banned twice due to doping (2001 and 2006).
Rio de Janeiro - Whistleblower Julia Stepanowa is not allowed to start in Rio.
Other convicted athletics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals.
The issue of doping continues to dominate the headlines at the Olympic Games in Rio.
The Russian swimmer Yulia Yefimova, who had claimed her right to start shortly before the games after a doping ban, was booed and booed mercilessly at her start (100 meters chest).
A bizarre scenery presented itself: with an attached smile she was strutting into the hall and had provoked with her appearance.
When it was clear that she would not fetch gold, the audience burst into a storm of jubilation.
But there are many other athletes who, despite doping, are competing in the past at the Olympic Games in Rio.
Here is an overview:
Justin Gatlin (100, 200, 4x100 in the team / USA): The 34 year old is one of the most controversial figures in athletics.
He has already been banned twice for doping (2001 and 2006 to 2010).
Since his spell, the 2004 Olympic champion and former world champion has run even faster than before. He is the world ’ s number one in the 100m in 9.80 seconds and is considered the greatest challenger to Usain Bolt.
In 2010, the two-time Olympic champion and seven-time world champion was suspended for six months after she was shown to have taken the painkiller oxycodon.
She had severe toothache after an operation, defended the 29 Jahre.
Sandra Perkovic (Discus / Croatia): In 2011, Olympic gold medallist in 2012, world champion in 2013 and European champion from 2010 to 2016 tested positive for the banned stimulant, Methylhexanamine.
Perkovic denied the deliberate capture and was suspended for six months.
The four farthest litters this year go to the account of the great gold favorite.
LaShawn Merritt (200, 400, 4x400 in the relay / USA): The Beijing Olympic champion and two-time world champion over 400 m, was tested positive in 2010 and banned for 21 months.
A penis enlargement remedy was responsible, asserted Merritt.
This year, the 30-year-old over 200 and 400 meters is the fastest man in the world.
Ivan Tikhon (hammer throw, Belarus): Probably hardly an athlete was deprived of so many medals afterwards.
Thus, Tikhon lost his 2005 World Cup title nine years later, after he was diagnosed with testosterone doping.
The meanwhile 40-year-old also had to Olympic silver 2004 due to steroid doping and the European Championship title 2006 due to testosterone abuse.
The bronze medal of the Olympic Games 2008, which was also revoked, was returned to him by a judgment of the International Court of Sports (CAS).
With 80.04 m he is second in the world rankings.
Liu Hong (20 km walk, China): The world record holder and gold favourite was only positively tested in May, but is nevertheless allowed to start in Rio.
The 29-year-old world champion found evidence of taking a banned dietary supplement, the ban on the World Anti-Doping Agency WADA was mild and expired on 13 July.
Bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - several dead
The Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman, said Thomas Schnöll, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, on Friday morning.
She had suffered cuts and had been treated in hospital, but had already been able to leave.
She has planned her trip home for the beginning of September.
Whether from the further explosions on the holiday-maker island Phuket as well as in the southern cities Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon likewise Austrian citizens are concerned, is for the time being still unclear.
According to Schnöll, the Foreign Ministry is in constant contact with the local authorities.
At Hua Hin, which is located about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, two bombs exploded in a nightlife area on Thursday evening.
According to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.
Friday morning, another two IEDs went up, and according to the authorities, another person was killed.
Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.
During the detonation near the beach Patong, popular with holidaymakers, a taxi driver was injured.
In Surat Thani, on the country ’ s southeast coast, another bomb exploded, killing another municipal employee.
According to the authorities, the bomb exploded in a flower bed in front of the coastal police station.
Finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the southwest coast and in Chumphon on the southeast coast caused several injuries.
One assumes a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.
"The bombings bear the same signature," Army General Danai Kritmethavee told journalists Friday morning.
"We assume that this is a coordinated attack."
It was too early to comment on possible motives - but it was probably the actions of Muslim rebels.
Thai media also wanted to see in the attacks a pattern typical of Muslim separatist bombings in the south of the country.
The Thai police, on the other hand, said that the attacks were not linked to the Islamist insurgency or to international terrorism.
"This is only local sabotage, which is limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok.
On the contrary, it is assumed that the bombs were dropped by opponents of the ruling military junta.
The authorities had received intelligence reports in recent days of impending attacks in the south of the country, but had not been informed of the exact time and place.
It was still unclear which group was behind the attacks.
Police instructed officials throughout the country to strengthen security around key government buildings, airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.
In Thailand there are again and again smaller bomb attacks, however, they are mostly not directed against tourists.
In Hua Hin there is a palace that was used for years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
After the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends on its website to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.
High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.
After clashes between security forces and Muslim populations, it is not advisable to travel to these provinces.
Increased security risk (level 2) applies to the rest of the country.
The attacks on Thursday and Friday came a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.
This gives the military great influence in the coming years.
The junta ’ s chief and prime minister, Prayut Chan, o ’ o ’ cha, said the bombs were an attempt to create chaos as the country moves toward stability, improved economic conditions, and tourism.
The military unta that seized power in 2014, following a period of bloody unrest, is to its own credit for restoring stability and order to the kingdom.
But the military has also failed to contain the rebellion of Muslim rebels that has been smouldering in the far south of the country for years.
More than 6,500 people have already been killed in the conflict.
Almost a year ago, 20 people - most of them foreign tourists - were killed in Bangkok in an attack on a popular Hindu shrine.
It was the bloodiest attack in the country ’ s recent history.
The right-wing "Identitäre Bewegung" has come under the scrutiny of the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
After several regional offices the protectors of the constitution in the federation also placed the group under observation.
"We see in the 'Identitäre Bewegung' indications for efforts against the liberal democratic basic order", said constitutional protection boss Hans with George Maaßen of the German press, agency in Berlin.
Immigrants of Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being slandered in an extremist way.
That is why we are now observing the movement.
The "Identitäre Bewegung" is a group with French roots, which has also been active in Germany since 2012.
It is directed against "multicultural delusion", "uncontrolled mass immigration" and the "loss of one's own identity through over-foreignment".
Constitutional protectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hesse, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the "identifiers".
Maaßen said that his authority had closely coordinated with the regional offices in the decision.
"Groups like the 'Identitäre Bewegung' (Identitary Movement) try to pick up their target group where it stands," said the head of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution.
Extremists generally try to address them with language appropriate to young people, often with pop music.
This would be done by Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.
This is not a pretentious advertisement for one's own cause.
The propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.
Young people are particularly vulnerable.
This is dangerous.
Recently there had been reports from several federal states about contacts of the "Identitären" to AFD politicians.
Maaßen said he had no knowledge of this.
For the protection of the constitution possible contacts of this kind are relevant only starting from a certain point.
It depends on whether the respective party - in this case the AfD - changes its direction through certain individuals who are extremist and thus becomes extremist.
The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.
This was not apparent.
With regard to the significant increase in right-wing crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee accommodation, Maaßen said that he would not yet speak of new right-wing terrorism in this context.
However, we have established in recent years that there can be legal terrorism structures.
There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.
It may well be that other right-wing terrorist groups or micro-groups are forming to plan attacks against asylum seekers, refugee homes or attacks on other right-wing extremist motives.
A Germany-wide or European-wide control of right terrorization is however not recognizable.
The previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks.
Maaßen expressed concern about the fact that many attacks were caused by people who had not previously appeared in the right-wing scene.
That is the worrying thing.
Many of the suspects in attacks on asylum accommodation were not previously known as criminals, politically motivated criminals or supporters of the right-wing scene.
"Many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent or voted for the CDU, SPD or the Left, but who then radicalized themselves through far-right propaganda."
Rio 2016: Robel Kiros Habte becomes an internet hit
Olympians or world records do not always dominate the headlines at the Olympic Games.
This is shown by the courageous appearance of Robel Kiros Habte at the Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro.
At the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmer from Ethiopia swam so slowly that he was temporarily no longer seen in the TV pictures.
He simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.
In the social networks, Habte subsequently became a viral Internet hit.
In fact, the 24-year-old finished his preliminaries with a gap of 48 seconds and finished 59th out of 59 starters.
But it was rather his not exactly sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media.
Why is the 24-year-old still taking part in the Olympic Games?
The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming federation.
This is distributed to promote swimming in under-represented countries.
Since most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte simply wanted to do something different.
Preparation is everything: Robel Kiros Habte is getting ready for the big race.
The first nicknames quickly made the rounds.
Some media called him the "Robel of the Whale".
In reference to a "belly of affluence", the English tabloid "The Sun" made fun of him with "Dad Bod".
His time, he only hit with one minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter freestyle, did not matter.
Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also made.
At the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussambani ’ s run attracted media attention.
Unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmer from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete alone in a preliminary-run over 100 meters freestyle.
At that time, Moussambani was fired with frenzy.
The then 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympics and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.

Trump Doesn ’ t See the Threat of Electoral Defeat Closely
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at an election rally in Florida.
If US presidential elections don ’ t turn out well, Donald Trump already has an alternatividee.
He then goes on holiday.
If Donald Trump loses the US presidential election in November, he wouldn ’ t care: “In the end, it will either work or I ’ ll have a very, very nice, long vacation, ” the Republican candidate said in a telephone interview with the US television station CNBC.
If, for reasons of political correctness, it is not enough for him, Trump said.
He called US President Barack Obama and Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton the founders of the Islamic State (IS) terrorist militia.
Within his party more and more resistance was formed.
Post enters the electric transport market
An electric delivery vehicle of Deutsche Post in action.
The interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great.
The Post also plans to sell its electric vehicle StreetScooter.
The company intends to start trading the transporter shortly.
Die Post wants to offer their electric transporters from next year on the free car market.
“We want to go into sales to third parties, ” said a postal spokesman on Friday.
For months, the company has been examining whether it should also sell its self-developed StreetScooter, with which letters and parcels are delivered, to other companies.
Jürgen Gerdes, Managing Director of Post, had said that there were always inquiries, for example from craftsmen.
According to information from the news magazine "Der Spiegel", the company based in Bonn intends to start mass production of the vehicles shortly.
The company is planning to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift at the post office.
Gerdes had announced that the company wanted to significantly expand its fleet of electric cars and in the long term aimed at a complete conversion to environmentally friendly vehicles.
"We will take a very, very robust step towards 2020," he said at the end of July.
I can imagine that we will convert the entire fleet.
The StreetScooter has been active on German roads since 2014.
GfK schriften Leadership resigns after disappointing business figures
The consumer research company GfK is replacing its CEO Matthias Hartmann.
The resignations came suddenly - but not completely surprisingly.
The difficult situation of the market research company GfK gave an inkling that the chair of CEO Matthias Hartmann will become more and more uncertain the longer the promised successes fail to materialize.
Turbulences at the helm of the Nuremberg market research company GfK: After another disappointing business figures and the resignation of the company management, the world ’ s number five in the industry is facing a fresh start in terms of personnel.
GfK ’ s Chief Executive Officer intends to leave the company at the end of the year.
Arno Mahlert, Chairman of GfK ’ s Supervisory Board, will leave the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12.
According to the company, the current member of the Executive Board, Gerhard Hausruckinger, will take over the leadership of the Executive Board on September 1.
He is to officially assume the function of "spokesman of the board" until a successor for Hartmann is found.
As reason for the resignation the enterprise named “different opinions ” to the long-term business policy adjustment.
A company spokesman did not want to give details on Friday.
Who will lead the market research company in the future, is currently still unclear.
In investor circles it was said on Friday, with the shareholders last the disappointment over the still missing successes of the restructuring initiated years ago was large.
Mr. Hartmann has been head of GfK since 2011.
"The fruits of the restructuring are not yet visible even after 5 years", they said.
Given GfK ’ s recent poor performance, any shareholder will eventually become restless.
"If that were the case at BMW, the Quandts would do the same," they said.
Following setbacks in the previous quarters, the company was unable to stop its loss flight in the second quarter of 2016.
At EUR 361.2 million, sales were 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable quarter of the previous year.
Compared with the first half of the year, sales declined by 3.4 percent to EUR 721.2 million.
Profit in the second quarter was negatively impacted above all by the lower value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation.
The goodwill write-downs of EUR 139 million that became necessary in the Consumer Experience division brought the Group a net loss of EUR 148.2 million.
In the second quarter of 2015, GfK generated a consolidated profit of 19.7 million euros.
Accidents - Bus slides into ditch in Krummhörn: Eight injured
In an accident of a coach with 43 seniors as passengers eight humans were injured on Thursday in Krummhörn (district Aurich).
Two of the inmates suffered serious injuries, the police said.
According to her information, the 66-year-old driver of the bus of a tour operator from Eisenach had to avoid a cooperative truck, which was partly driving on the opposite lane.
The bus came off the road to the right and slid into a ditch, a police spokeswoman from Aurich / Wittmund reported.
"Due to the location of the bus, people could not leave the bus on their own," she said.
The fire department freed the passengers.
Six ambulance and one ambulance arrived at the scene of the accident on the 2nd state road
The uninjured passengers were brought back to the Krummhörn district of Pewsum by a bus.
There they should wait for a substitute bus of the tour operator.
Investigators asked the vice driver and possible witnesses to report to the police.
From 1 October 2016, the fees per cubic metre of waste water for the area of the Neudorf / Reuth / Welschenkahl sewage treatment plant will amount to 3.44 instead of the previous 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 euros (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).
At the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater charge will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures become necessary.
According to an approximate calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic metre.
As reported mayor Bernd stone houses (CSU), with the approval of the budget by the district administration office Kulmbach it was determined that under-coverings accumulate for these waste water plants.
The Kasendorf market is obliged by law to operate the plants cost-effectively.
From 1 October 2016, citizens and businesses from Welschenkahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to dig deeper into their pockets.
Fee increases range between 48 and 67 percent.
As head of administration Herbert Schmidt pointed out to the committee, a recalculation of the fees for the waste water facilities of the municipality was necessary.
In the period from October 2016 to September 2020, excess or underfunding from the previous calculation period must also be compensated.
The serious fee increases were justified by Schmidt with the fact that all three sewage treatment plants are relatively small facilities with a very low waste water volume, which lies between 6800 and 12,000 cubic metres per year.
For example, due to the low distribution base, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.
In addition, the amount of wastewater in all three plants is slightly decreasing.
Furthermore, a considerable amount of refurbishment and repair expenditure was incurred in the past calculation period for all three plants, not least because of their age.
The plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welschenkahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system in the Azendorf sewage plant had to be replaced due to damage.
In the Welschenkahl pumping station, the almost 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be completely overhauled, and in the Lopp pond treatment plant, the first sewage pond had to be excavated after almost 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge disposed of and an additional ventilation system installed in order to comply with the requirements of water law in the future.
Schmidt: "These extraordinary expenses were compounded by the advanced support and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."
The same applies to electricity costs, which in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 were significantly below the current level.
Stone houses made clear that with the small waste water accumulation in the three plants the expenditures for the enterprise and maintenance “fully penetrate ”.
Schmidt added that the municipality had been spared from large maintenance costs for the sewage treatment plants over the past 20 years.
The situation for the plants mentioned will remain in opinion of stone houses in the long term precarious, particularly since one cannot be extended the supplying area of the waste water purpose association Friesenbachtal by these plants, because it concerns deficient mechanisms.
Bulgaria registers inflation for the first time in 8 months
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1% on a monthly basis.
This is the highest score (since June 2012) and the first above zero since October last year, when a positive 0.2% was posted.
Annual average inflation over the last 12 months (August 2015 - July 2016) was -0.8% in CPI terms compared to the previous 12 months (August 2014 - July 2015).
The consumer price index was 101.0% in July 2016 compared with June 2016, i.e. monthly inflation was 1.0%.
Inflation since the beginning of the year (July 2016 compared to December 2015) was -0.2% and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -0.2%.
In July 2016, the following groups of consumer goods increased their prices compared to the previous month: food and non-alcoholic beverages (1.7%); transport (1.8%); leisure and culture (6.3%); restaurants and hotels (1.2%); various goods and services (0.3%).
Prices fell for clothing and footwear (2.2%); furniture, appliances and routine maintenance (0.5%); health (0.1%).
Prices remained unchanged for alcoholic beverages and tobacco; homes, water, electricity, gas and other fuels; communications; and education.
Snapchat "anime" effect criticized as Asian caricature
Snapchat says that this filter is inspired by anime, but some observers say it is insensitive to races.
With its filtering tool Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in a way that borders on the absurd.
You can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Lichtenstein painting.
The filters are outspoken, feature-twisting tools that generate more than 30 million improved selfies per day.
All missteps come to light.
Snapchat ’ s filters have attracted criticism in the past, accusing them of promoting the Blackface app or promoting white skin as a beauty ideal.
When it proposed a filter to some users this week that gave them slits, false teeth, and bloated cheeks, some critics called it a racist Asian caricature - "yellow face."
They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a major problem that the company has with diversity.
The news and outrage were widely circulated on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard the day after Snapchat announced that it had disabled the feature.
The company offered an excuse: the filter was intended as an homage to anime, not a caricature of Asians.
But the filter reminded outsiders who have experienced racism of hurtful clichés.
Others strongly rejected the anime comparison.
In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, an American Korean art student whose tweet about the photos was widely circulated, wrote that the filter was "hurtful and unpleasant to say the least."
She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very disgusting Asian cartoon and the filter effects.
It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow face has been pulled to the devaluing extreme.
Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural trip-wires.
American culture seems to be engaged in an endless struggle for diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the equipment we all hold in our hands.
And Snapchat's large audience of young people - who are more racial diverse than their older adversaries - might be more likely to expect sensitivity.
When one of Snapchat's filters creates an image that is offensive to a user, "it's much more difficult for such things to go unnoticed than they used to be," 25-year-old Katie Zhu said in an interview on Thursday.
On Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and media engineer, decided to delete her Snapchat account asking others to do the same.
In an essay for media and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes that race-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in recruitment practices at Snapchat.
Zhu criticized the largely white, male-only leadership and ended her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.
“Either she doesn ’ t have a diverse representation of people with different skin colors in her workforce, so they can make such decisions, ” said the Chinese-American Zhu,“ or they have people with different skin colors who work there but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it. ”
Others share her opinion, a complaint that Snapchat left largely unanswered.
The company does not publish any figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.
On Thursday Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to one spokesperson the company has recently hired a Human Resources Officer who focuses on under-represented communities and internal integration efforts.
For her part, Zhu said that she will close her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not OK."
Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, Congressional Committee notes
Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information in order to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria than the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, reported a committee of inquiry of the Congress in a report on Thursday.
The preliminary report, prepared by a task force of Republican members of the Armed Forces Committee, Intelligence Committee, and Defense Budget Committee, reports deep discontent among Central Command intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their perceptions of America ’ s efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.
Central Command, Cencom for short, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.
"Intelligence information, typically emitted by high-ranking Centcom commanders, regularly gave a more positive picture of America's efforts against terrorism than actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, and was consistently more positive than analyses by other intelligence agencies," quoted a newspaper article.
"What happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," noted Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.
The management errors in Centcom reach up to the top of the organization.
The ten-page report details consistent problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of America ’ s efforts to train Iraqi forces.
While there is no direct evidence that senior Obama officials have given orders to change the reports, it shows how analysts have faced pressure from their superiors to paint a more optimistic picture of the threat to the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.
“During the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements to Congress were significantly more positive than factual, ” the report noted.
For example, a Centcom member publicly announced that a military recapture of Mosul could begin as early as April or May 2015.
Mosul, Iraq ’ s second largest city, remains under the control of the Islamic State.
"After months of investigation, so much is clear," Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, said in a statement.
From mid-2014 to mid-2015, Central Command leaders modified intelligence reporting to minimize the danger posed by ISIS in Iraq.
The Republicans created the task force after it was leaked that analysts were worried about manipulating reports on the Islamic State.
The report published on Thursday will be supplemented by more detailed findings as the investigation continues.
In addition, further investigations by Centcom reports by the Inspector General of the Ministry of Defence are ongoing.
Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, in line with some of the Republican Task Force ’ s conclusions.
“In 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively restricted process for intelligence assessments of ISIL and the Iraqi security services, ” the senior Democrat on the committee, a member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, announced in a statement.
This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," damaged analysts' morale, and "gave excessively little room for dissent."
But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that they had found no evidence of White House interference with Centcom analysts regarding a "certain political opinion."
The preliminary results of the Congressional investigation were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast".
Last August, the New York Times reported of investigations by the inspector general of the Pentagon, which were taken up after complaints by Centcom analysts.
According to Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, the Department of Defense would not comment on Congressional reports while the inspector general ’ s investigation was still ongoing.
But he also stated that "experts sometimes have divergent views on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense."
The investigation has repercussions beyond the question of a successful American-led air campaign in Iraq and Syria (a claim now made by a growing number of Defense officials).
Last year ’ s accusations, however, raised the question of whether President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, and other crisis regions.
Criticism of secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disagreements more than a decade ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a paper about how George W. Bush ’ s administration, contrary to many analysts ’ recommendations, planned only a small occupying force in Iraq, spending little time worrying about the consequences of the 2003 invasion.
Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State.
Last year, according to government sources, Mr. Hooker ’ s team stated that, contrary to the government ’ s statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have a significant impact on the terrorist group ’ s financial situation, as they would have put provisional refineries into operation to sell oil on the black market.
However, this finding was not published, reported The Times in September.
Centcom's former commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature for his overly positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate.
General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.
The USA win fourth match in women's field hockey, a showdown with Great Britain is imminent
One day after scoring three goals in a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also scored the first two goals for the women ’ s American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with a 3-0.
Five goals in two games was supposed to be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn ’ t remember ever having done so.
"I have no idea," she said.
I am not one of those people who remember their doors.
But she knows: The Americans are 4 at 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the British women in the first place, remain undefeated after their 2 at 0 win over Japan.
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.
Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two in their group of six teams will win first and second place respectively.
The winner will stay away from the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.
Whatever the outcome of Saturday ’ s game, the Americans have created a surprising stir with their success story, four years after they finished last out of 12 at the last London Games.
Bam was part of this team.
She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and for the first time had a hockey stick in her hands at the age of three (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), at the age of 16 she became a US national player, the youngest in the history of the team.
She missed the 2008 Olympics because she could not qualify for the squad.
Then came the year 2012, when everything went wrong for her and her team.
The following year, Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became coach of the national team and things began to change for the better.
"A change of culture, a change of mind and a change of body," Bam said.
We did not have the workload in London that we now have.
We were able to turn things around completely.
On Thursday night, Bam opened the scoring in the first half of the game with a backhand from the close range.
India had gone into the game without a win in the tournament, but the team showed up surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 “0 ” into the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.
She did a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the center and pulled the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.
Melissa Gonzalez scored the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.
The shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the goalkeeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had to score one goal in each of the previous games.
She has a run.
Just like Bam.
“We ’ re in a good position, ” Parnham said, but how well will depend on the outcome of Saturday ’ s next game.
In the midst of the rage of the Olympic Games, the zen of the trampoline
Wherever you are, however late, they are the Olympic Games.
The events in Rio de Janeiro feel constant and inevitable, a raging relay race between competition and aspiration.
It is as if the Olympic torch itself were a burning staff, passed from crossbowman to swimmer to gymnast to triathlete.
You cannot turn on the TV, read a newspaper, or listen to your neighbor in the coffee shop queue without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky, or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.
And then there is Logan Dooley.
Dooley, who participates in the Olympic Games for the first time and is a swarm of women with dimples, could have been among these well-known names, which will be broadcast at prime time, built up by sponsors and feel-good team TV, advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.
But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, is fighting for gold in Olympic trampoline gymnastics.
The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event equally.
Further from the centre, partly in the shade, there are sports that are not generally accepted: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.
We will always have the breaststroke and may it prevail for a long time.
But if I am humbly able to make arguments for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.
Although trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it has been perceived so sparsely for the last 16 years that many of those I asked didn ’ t know it was an Olympic sport at all.
This could also be regional ignorance.
Although the USA sent athletes to the competition, it has never won a medal in trampoline jumping and until 2012 it had an athlete who made it to the final round.
The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians the prices for the women.
Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.
The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds for the unenlightened ear more suitable for a clown school than for the Olympic Games.
At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but just a grounded enthusiast.
It has humorous potential - the cartoon-like trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports it essentially combines.
The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish word El Trampoline, which means "springboard".
Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to make a series of falling movements (spinning, pike and somersaults) before landing on their feet.
They are evaluated according to the official Olympic program according to execution, degree of difficulty and "flight time".
Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.
The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.
In their quest for gold, medal seekers must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.
They chase not only the finish line or the exit wall, but also another scornful goal in the television broadcast: that of the world or the Olympic record.
The purposeful pursuit is noble, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to move even a spectator to tears.
But it is also what I find somewhat tiring when watching these games.
The trampoline offers a breathing space.
The vector of the trampoline jumper is on top.
Moving forward is not the goal.
He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then up again effortlessly.
Here, too, there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the target, no vault into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant suspension of time and gravity.
It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.
The women ’ s qualifying and final rounds will take place on Friday afternoon, streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men ’ s on Saturday, also at 13.00.
NBC will air the finals as part of an afternoon block on both days from 2pm.
In the midst of the Olympia mania, they promise a quiet, pleasant moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil.
If the only way to raise awareness is through the gazing and objectification of male athletes - as the US male gymnasts recently suggested in The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley awaits his new, vaporized following.
"A Generation Protesting" in Ethiopia, Long an Ally of the USA
Violent protests in Ethiopia
Demonstrators calling for political change in Ethiopia met with violent opposition from the government.
Witnesses testify that dozens of protesters were killed in exchange of fire during clashes with the police.
Is Ethiopia about to collapse?
Over the past decade, it has been one of Africa ’ s most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a fast-growing economy.
But, in recent months, anti-government protests have shaken the country and expanded to more and more areas.
Last week, thousands of people rushed into the streets demanding fundamental political changes.
The government's response was ruthless, according to human rights organisations.
Witnesses said that police shot and killed tens of unarmed demonstrators.
Videos circulating about the protests, presumably last year or early this year, show how security guards hit young people with sticks while forcing them to make a handstand against a wall.
The head of the UN Human Rights Agency is now demanding a thorough investigation.
"It has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the Horn of Africa project leader of the International Crisis Group, a research group.
After Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is valued by the West.
American military and intelligence agencies are working closely with Ethiopians to combat terrorist threats beyond the region, particularly in Somalia. Few countries in Africa, if any, receive so much Western aid.
Ethiopia ’ s economy expanded at a respectable pace.
Its infrastructure has improved drastically - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Ababa.
The streets are generally quiet, safe and clean.
Although Ethiopia was anything but a model of democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led the government's repression - opposition in the country has been curtailed, effectively silencing dissidents.
Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.
But that could change.
“If you suppress people and they have no other options than to protest, it breaks out, ” said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopia.
The whole youth protested.
A generation is protesting.
There are numerous complaints covering everything from land use to the stranglehold on the ruling coalition ’ s power.
After a widely criticised election last year, the ruling party and its allies were given the last seat of the opposition and now control 100% of the parliament.
At the same time, tensions along the border with Eritrea are rising; a battle over this ragged, controversial line claimed hundreds of lives in June.
Analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo or the Ogaden National Liberation Front, which have been more or less defeated in recent years, could exploit the turbulence and rearm themselves.
Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness now explode beneath the surface after years of pre-simmering.
The first seems harmless: smartphones.
Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate through social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more common and Internet services have improved.
Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, which it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate over the Internet with proxies that hide where they are.
Several young Ethiopians said that they gathered to protest.
The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.
The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.
For eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethopia ’ s predominantly Christian highlands, have thrived in politics and economics, while exploiting the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims living in lowland areas.
But that, too, is changing.
"We are coordinating under one umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos.
The largest protests took place in the Amhara and Oromos areas.
Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the Tigray ethnic group, who make up about 6% of the population and dominate the military, intelligence, trade, and politics.
The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.
Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death from an undisclosed disease in 2012.
He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think around corners.
Analysts say he was particularly adept at seeing early signs of dissatisfaction and using special representatives to deal with opponents and render them harmless.
"The current regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst.
Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, has been chosen to take the position of Mr Meles for relatively obscure reasons.
Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south.
Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray-controlled security services.
Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.
The last time that Ethiopia experienced such an uproar was in 2005, after thousands protested against elections that, according to analysts, seemed to have been botched by the government and then stolen.
During the raids that followed, many protesters were killed, though less than in recent months, and that period of unrest passed relatively quickly.
Development experts praised Ethiopia ’ s leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, and for their measurable progress in reducing poverty.
But, evidently, this has not prevented the Ethiopian government ’ s internal resentment from intensifying.
And it is taking a dangerous ethnic form.
Last month, protesters in Gondar, an Amharic city, attacked Tigray-run businesses, and social media hatred of Tigrays is becoming more common.
Analysts say the protests put the US and other Western allies in a strange position.
The American government used Ethiopia as a base for drone flights over neighboring Somalia, although it recently announced that it had closed that base.
While the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.
"This," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin line."
Donald Trump explains his claim that Obama founded ISIS was “sarcasm ”
On Friday, Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the final controversy surrounding his campaign by claiming that his repeated claim that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group was not serious.
That clarification raised new questions about the Republican presidential candidate ’ s communication skills, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensibly with the American public.
It also brings his fellow combatants, who try to protect him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of having to explain statements that he could not have meant at all.
After making the insinuation at a campaign rally on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump backpedaled on Thursday ’ s claim, insisting in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.
But in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic.
The tweet was the opposite of the previous day, when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews that he meant the accusation completely seriously.
When the conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump soften the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate didn ’ t want to know about it.
The latest storm of criticism is raining down on Mr. Trump as he has tried to shift the focus of his campaign to the economic situation because of falling poll figures.
Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton made speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.
On Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to the subject.
Reporting via Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton ’ s proposals would lead to higher taxes, and that he found her speech boring.
Mr. Trump has already made sarcasm in his defense.
At the end of July he drew a lot of criticism when he said that the Russians should hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared "Of course I meant that sarcastically".
This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the language boundaries in politics and then row back as needed.
"I think one of his methods is to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "depending on how the response turns out," said Ruth Sherman, a communications expert who observes the language of both candidates.
But I also think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in different ways.
Rather than defusing the tone of the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even more caustic tone, as his poll ratings have continued to decline.
A new poll from NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a lead by a large margin in the states of North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head at a head to head race in Florida.
While Mr. Trump generally tries not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics of distorting his statements or misunderstanding his humor.
But, while he has been the focus of attention in the final months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump ’ s jokes have put his loyal fellow campaigners in the uncomfortable position of having to stand by him, no matter how provocative his statements may be.
Rudolph W. Giuliani, a former mayor of New York and one of Trump ’ s most prominent proponents, took great pains to defend the candidate in a CNN interview on Thursday.
"I believe what he says is legitimate political commentary," Mr. Giuliani said so he was asked about the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements as to whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State.
In this sense, it is true that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbenchers, completely false, and it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.
Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread by failing to aggressively control the situation in the Middle East.
Prior to the Pennsylvania campaign on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media, accusing them of leaning on every word he said and being biased against him.
He mocked the "poor, pitiful" television experts who were trying to understand him and said, "You can't!"
Some Democrats derided Mr. Trump ’ s apology as just further proof that he was unfit for the presidency.
Once ousted from the market by price, Café in Greenpoint returns
Verb Cafe was a shabby café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay in cash, which had no Wi Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.
Of course, prices ousted retail stores from his Bedford Avenue front.
The Soap Cherie store, which replaced Verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.
Locals mourned it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.
Artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, “I know New York is changing, but I still can ’ t believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel is excluded and Verb is now a soap store. ”
But if New York is change, it is reinvention.
A revived verb cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.
The new verb has WiFi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.
The coffee is also still good.
The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time employee of the old café, who is the owner and manager of the new café.
He started working with Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.
When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new field office, he was excited to do it, he said.
Rodriguez, 36, retained much.
Verb used the same distributor for the bagels bought the same espresso machine model.
It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.
But Rodriguez said that he also wanted to experiment.
He introduced new ingredients.
The menu includes bacon and cheese sandwiches and there are toppings such as capers and sautéed onions.
There are natural rice bowls.
The café no longer serves beer, but there are fresh juices.
After nine months Rodriguez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.
"Many old customers have also been pushed out of Williamsburg by pricing," he said.
Recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.
Oliveira, 34, used to live in Williamsburg and visited the verb regularly.
Even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road.
After the verb was closed, she gave up drinking coffee for a while, she said.
"I realized that it was because of the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked," she said.
Now she is drinking coffee again, even if she ordered a blended chai tea that day instead of her usual iced coffee, which is another new addition.
Since the beginning of the verb in 2003, Tom Rosenthal is another long-standing and loyal customer.
He went there before work and invariably ordered the same thing.
“I arrived a quarter past seven, every day, like a Swiss pocket watch, and they ’ re preparing my everything, bagel with butter, ” he said.
Photo Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu.
Nowadays, Rosenthal still gets his usual order, but sometimes he changes his everything-bagel to bacon, egg and cheese.
Rodriguez said he had no grudge about the soap business taking over the old business premises.
In fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered to make a special soap for verb with the café ’ s cold-brewed coffee as an ingredient.
"I think we will respond to your offer," Rodriguez said.
And the traditional Polish inhabitants Greenpoints have also accepted the café.
A new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said that he intends to issue it soon so that his new neighbours feel welcome.
The location also has other advantages.
A local juice bar wants to bottle and sell the cold-brewed coffee.
There is a chance that the café will expand to an adjacent building.
For many customers, a new verb is enough to get their old favorites.
Joseph Witt was a regular customer and said that he was devastated when the café closed.
When the new café opened, Whitt said that entering the café and ordering a new coffee felt like coming home.
"I had to smell it," he said.
The depressing eating of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"
In March 1933, shortly after his rise to the presidency, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.
As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a soft spot for refined Fifth Avenue delicacies such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland turtle soup.
His menu on that day was a little more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and, for dessert, a plum pudding.
"It was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.
Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to Americans on how they should eat."
The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.
Cee's latest book, "Chop Suey", was about Chinese cuisine in the USA, while Ziegelman, in her book "97 Orchard", talks about life in a house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective.
Her latest collaboration, "A Decent Meal," which will be published Tuesday by Harper, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression.
They showed culinary solidarity by meeting a reporter for dinner at Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop, a small, no-frills snack bar in the Flatiron District that has been in business since the stock market crash of 1929.
Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese sandwich with pieces of olive, while Coe, 57, ate turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture.
When the reporter ordered meatloaf, this found the couple fit for a discussion of food in the era of the Great Depression.
"Rich food was very popular," said Ziegelman.
There was peanut bread, meat loaf and bean bread.
They were prepared from one ingredient and something cheap that stretched the ingredient.
Imagine eating so many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.
Coe grinned.
"It must have settled in the stomach like lead," he said.
In the years leading up to the Great Depression, the table in an American household, especially in rural areas, was an all-you-can-eat buffet.
Teams of women cooked for male field workers and freshly baked pie was served for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
It was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War. "A Square Meal" describes the ways in which the country dealt with being no longer the land of milk and honey.
"It was a time when food became a central, tense topic for the Americans," said Coe, explaining why he and his wife wanted to write about it.
Equally tense was the new budget diet: Mysterious foods such as breads and casseroles became staple foods, the casserole as "a wonderful way to recycle leftovers," noted Ziegelman, as cooks could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce.
Fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper dried fruit.
Meat, which for years was the focal point of American cuisine, became a rare luxury.
Strange mixtures were tried, as a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction took precedence over taste or even healthy cooking.
During her research for the book, which includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter.
“It wasn ’ t a popular addition at lunch, ” says Coe.
Ziegelmann continues: "It was surreal."
Peanut butter and baked onions do not fit together.
It was typical of many of the home cooking recipes.
As never before or since, household economists – including Louise Stanley, who headed the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 – have been driving the country ’ s eating habits in this way.
By publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become 'fiscal policymakers' and to meet the challenge of turning pampas like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals.
"A Square Meal" is a feast of historic treats.
In particular, the reports of the government ’ s response to the starving citizens are palatable, as President Herbert Hoovers has left me the way I ’ ve been eating cakes.
While he publicly praised the simple Iowa farmhouse kitchen of his kitchen, he dined like the millionaire man of the world he has become.
"He liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.
He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.
He was wonderfully out of touch with reality.
President Roosevelt might have made the same mistake if his wife Eleanor had not asked him to set an example with his stomach.
As described in the book, the hiring of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms. Roosevelt resulted in the White House producing the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most bleak preparations. "
Many of the ways of dealing with food from the Great Depression era were discarded as soon as the country got back on its feet.
The legacy lies in our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as on how science was applied to food.
The couple claimed to have better understanding of Ziegelman's mother-in-law's eating habits when writing the book - for example, how she could not throw food away.
"She was really afraid of wasting food," Coe said.
Ziegelman remembered, "She actually made people sick."
There was the windbag incident.
After the plates were cleared off at Eisenberg's, they and Coe pulled out a dessert which they had prepared at home: the plum dessert which President Roosevelt ate at noon.
"It's called Prune Whip," said Ziegelman, adding that it was a common trick to give humble recipes a fancy name.
There was no whipped cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.
Everyone reluctantly dipped a spoon into the tough brown mica.
Amazingly, it did not taste bad.
Coe took a supplement three times.
Like a Can ’ Do budgetizer, he told his wife, “A few chopped walnuts would help. ”
Killed in a bomb attack: He was the hero of Aleppo
He risked his own life to help others: Khaled Omar.
He was the hero of Aleppo: Khaled Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria.
He risked everything to save the lives of others.
Now the 30-year-old himself has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime.
Omar was a member of the "White Helmets", a civil protection group which, according to the Bild "newspaper, has so far saved the lives of almost 60,000 people.
2900 volunteers risk their own lives to pull people out of bombed homes and to provide first aid in the war zone.
They are the heroes of the war in Syria.
Omar was the face of the group: a video of the civil rights activist, showing him rescuing an infant from the ruins of a house for 11 hours, went around the world in 2014.
It made the Syrian a shining symbol in the horror of war.
But he never saw himself as a hero, he said loudly: "For me, this is the real jihad."
"When I die saving lives, I think that God sees in me a martyr."
Shortly before Omar himself fell victim to an attack, he spoke in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria.
The helicopters dropped four barrels of bombs over the Alzadia, one of which was filled with chlorine gas.
One woman and two children died, seven people suffer from shortness of breath.
"We are now removing the toxic remnants of the bomb so that children do not play with it," the picture quotes his last words before he died.
The deadly bomb of the Assad regime was meant to hit terrorists.
Greenland shark: The oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old
Rare sight.
Greenland sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.
This shark was allowed back into the sea after an investigation on board the research vessel Sanna.
He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.
Greenland sharks only get offspring when they are 150 years old.
The Greenland shark swims leisurely along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in one hour it comes on average only 1,220 meters far.
Only when it matters, the five-meter-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed.
But this lifestyle of slowness seems to be a panacea for old age.
Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" about a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old.
"Insanity", comments Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock on this lifespan, which represents a world record for vertebrates.
The evolutionary biologist has long suspected that Greenland sharks are getting very old.
But the evidence was lacking.
Greenland sharks are difficult to observe as they live mainly in the Arctic Ocean off the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen.
Because they prefer water temperatures of around six degrees Celsius, they usually only appear on the surface in winter.
Researchers know little about the Greenland shark lifestyle.
They measured their slow motion speed when they equipped six animals with a transmitter off Spitsbergen.
These sharks still make prey: Researchers found the remains of a seal in an animal ’ s stomach, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.
Possibly they hunt sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice sea and look for cadavers, that stagger from higher water-layers downward.
Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now studied 28 Greenland sharks that fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 off Greenland or Spitsbergen as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.
The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest measured 502 centimeters.
In order to determine the age of the sharks, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks using the Carbon-14 method.
This center of the eye lens originates already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are not renewed later any more.
The two smallest sharks had remarkably much carbon 14 in the lens core.
Their birth was thus supposed to be after the early 1960 ’ s, when nuclear weapons tests threw large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.
In the third smallest animal, measuring 220 centimetres in length, the lens core contained a small surplus of carbon 14 from the nuclear weapons tests, which is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.
All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had in their lens core normal carbon-14 “quantities, which originate from cosmic rays in the atmosphere.
Indeed, the Carbon 14 Clock for a 393-centimeter Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record 502-centimeter shark should even be 392 years old.
It was known that Greenland sharks do not produce females until they are longer than four meters.
The researchers were now able to assign an age to the length.
Since one of the animals with 392 centimeters stood probably at the threshold to the sexually mature and its age with 156 years was determined, Greenland-sharks let themselves with the increase obviously at least one and a half centuries time.
This should also be the world record for vertebrates at the moment.
It is no coincidence that such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters.
The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale with a 120-year-old harpoon tip on its neck, was also caught off Alaska.
Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on low flame.
They mature later - and age more slowly.
In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals often become especially large.
Because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat.
The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than that of one gram of elephant.
Another advantage: You have fewer enemies.
"A smaller animal therefore lives more dangerously and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.
A very large animal, on the other hand, should rather invest its resources in a long life.
Baugrund im Doppelpack
In the most recent meeting, the municipal council focused on issues relating to construction.
It was with relief that the panel accepted Mayor Robert Putz's statement that "the marketing of the recently designated housing areas can finally begin".
After the questions of land, subdivision and development could be clarified and the applications for surveying could be made, nothing stands in the way of the sale of the properties in the residential areas "Strassenweg" and "Schönau" West "(area Binderstraße - expansion section 1) to interested parties.
The municipal council is convinced that the building areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schönau appeal equally to young families and energetic seniors.
As it was said, people interested in building can now report to the town hall, and the municipal council is expected to deliberate on the allocation of the parcels at its meeting in September.
In order to be able to respond to requests for the establishment of further commercial enterprises, connected with the creation of jobs, the municipal council decided to amend the land-use plan newly drawn up only in the spring of this year in partial areas.
Thus in the range Unterzeitlarn the business park already indicated there is extended by two parcels of land direction state road 2112.
Frankfurt benefits from Brexit
The city on the Main thus has the best chance of attracting jobs and companies relocated from London in competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg.
“It is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit vote, ” says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW ’ s area of expertise for financial markets and real estate markets.
After the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether financial institutions will be allowed to continue operating from London across the EU.
For the so-called EU passport they are currently sufficient for approval in the UK.
Major US banks are currently taking advantage of this.
Several banks have already announced plans to relocate jobs.
The lobby association "Frankfurt Main Finance" expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years.
According to the IW, Frankfurt is the seat of the European Central Bank (ECB), which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the eurozone, as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Supervisory Authority (EIOPA) and the Risk Board (ESRB).
While the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) had its headquarters in Paris, it was less important for the financial sector than the ECB.
"Proximity to the central bank is important for banks, as it enables them to communicate directly with the supervisory authority," says IW "Professor Voigtländer.
Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry, but, like Dublin, it is poorly performing in terms of infrastructure.
Thanks to the large airport, Frankfurt is much easier to reach.
Furthermore, the city scores with easily available commercial properties.
“It ’ s not that easy to find free, high-quality offices in Paris, ” says Voigtländer.
On the Seine, the rents for first-class commercial properties are also 50 percent higher than on the Main.
In addition, Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime.
In a ranking by the management consultancy Mercer, the city is in seventh place, Luxembourg in 19th place, Dublin in 33th place and Paris in 37th place.
Even if quality of life is a question of preferences: "With its already strong position as a financial centre for the European single market, Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors," concludes the IW.
According to economic researchers, London will remain Europe ’ s most important financial center despite the Brexit vote.
According to figures from Landesbank Helaba, around 144,000 people worked in the banking sector in London at the end of 2015, compared with 62,500 in Frankfurt.
Gilead receives legal costs from Hepatitis C patent dispute with Merck
A US judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc was entitled to reimbursement of its legal costs arising from the Hepatits C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co Inc.
In June, Gilead was exempted from compensation of $200 million for the infringement of two Merck patents related to the blockbuster medicines Sovaldi and Harvoni of Gilead, after a US judge revealed a pattern of misconduct on the part of Merck, including perjury and other unethical acts.
In filing the lawsuit on Thursday, US Judge Beth Labson Freeman said that Gilead is entitled to waive the costs incurred during the defense of the case.
Merck is trying to catch up with Gilead, which dominates the market for a new generation of hepatitis C drugs that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease.
The case goes back to 2013, when Gilead and Merck sued each other and claimed ownership of the laboratory work underlying Sofosbuvir, the active ingredient in Gilead ’ s medicines.
US-backed troops say they have regained full control of Manbij from the Islamic State
US-backed troops have retaken full control of the northern city of Manbij near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city have left, a group spokesman said Friday.
The Syrian Democratic Forces (DKS) are currently combing the city after the exodus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves inside the city.
They liberated over 2,000 civilians held hostage by the fighters, said Sharfan Darwish of the DKS ally, Manbij Militärrat Reuters.
"The city is now under complete control, but we are doing a cleanup," he told Reuters.
Clintons earn 10.75 million in 2015 and pay 34.2% federal taxes
Hillary Clinton published her tax return for 2015 on Friday, which gave the Democratic candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 34.2%.
In 2015, the Clintons donated $1 million to charity, mainly to the Clinton Foundation; former President Bill Clinton earned nearly $5.3 million in speaking fees; the former Secretary of State gave an income of $3 million from the Simon & Schuster publishing house for her book on her tenure at the State Department.
Clinton ’ s vice-presidential candidate, Virginia Senator Tim Kaine, and his wife Anne Holton have been publishing his tax returns for the past ten years.
They paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.3% in 2015.
“Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine continue to set standards for financial transparency, ” Clinton ’ s campaign assistant Jennifer Palmieri announced in a statement.
In stark contrast, Donald Trump is hiding behind false excuses and retreats over his previous promises to publish his tax returns.
It is customary for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns, although they are not required to do so by law.
Trump, a New York businessman, and his lawyers have cited a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for their refusal.
“The ball is in your court, ” wrote Clinton ’ s campaign aide Ian Sams on Twitter, referring to the release of the Democratic presidential candidate.
On Thursday, Michael Cohen, Trump ’ s special adviser, told CNN that he would not allow Trump to publish anything before tax audits are completed.
Trump ’ s critics, including Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, have already said that his refusal raises questions about wealth, his donations to charities, his business practices, and various other connections, especially with Russia.
Clinton has already pushed the issue and posted a video on the internet on Friday calling on top Republicans to release Trump ’ s tax return.
On Thursday, she also raised the issue during a speech on the Michigan economy.
"He refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns," she said to the crowd.
Politico has reported that Trump paid little or no tax for two years during the 1990 ’ s, and a New York Times business journalist quoted a number of tax attorneys and tax advisers on Friday saying that this could still be the case.
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign.
Clinton supports a scheme named after the billionaire investor Warren Buffett, which would ensure that individuals earning more than $1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30%.
President Obama also supports the proposal.
During a campaign rally for Hillary Clinton last week in Omaha, Nebraska, Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway industrial conglomerate is based here, called on Trump to meet and exchange their tax returns.
Buffett said he had also been subjected to an IRS tax audit, and Trump was “afraid ” of voters, not tax authorities.
Clinton ’ s campaign has published tax returns dating back to 2007.
The Clintons who now live in Chappaqua, New York, paid an average effective federal tax rate of about 32% between 2007 and 2014, and an effective combined tax rate of about 40.5%.
The Clintons ’ tax return in 2015 showed that they earned only $100 of their income, unlike most Americans.
Their main investment was a low-cost index fund, from which the Clintons taxed dividends and income of USD 109,000.

Condoms with chili powder, fireworks promote Tanzania's elephant protection
Conservationists in Tanzania use an unorthodox way to prevent elephants from entering man-made settlements - they throw condoms at them that are filled with chili powder.
The method has proven to be effective, and the Honeyguide Foundation, which had the idea years ago, has intensified its support, together with the U.S. Conservation Agency, by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non-violent four-step method to protect their homes and harvests without hurting animals.
Previously, many have used spears to defend themselves.
Friday is the World Telephone Day dedicated to animal welfare.
"Since we developed the... toolkit, we have seen a change in attitudes within these communities, and they are much more confident that they can keep the elephants away from their fields without harming the elephant," Honeyguide CEO Damian Bell said in a note.
The first two steps include lighting the elephant with a torch and blowing into a horn.
If he is not deterred, a so-called "chili cloud" is thrown.
Chili powder mixed with earth is packed together with a firecracker into a condom, the end of which is turned to the fuse.
When it is lit, the condom bursts open with a bang and sprays fine dust on chili powder into the air.
A touch quite usually already out to chase away the elephant.
A last possibility is a thrower, who shoots a gold rain firework into the air and causes a loud, bright explosion.
City Council resolves unanimously: No kiosk building on the banks of the St. Goarer Rhine
Usually the St. Goarer accept investment projects of tradesmen with Kusshand - nevertheless straight the retail trade in the core city is considered as clearly expandable.
However, the city council unanimously rejected the application for the construction of a new sales kiosk on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony under construction.
"Basically, we welcome new traders, but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine this kiosk does not fit", Michael Hubrath explained for the CDU parliamentary group.
Jewish director smashes Berlin hotel because Israeli area code was removed after "Arab" request - RT News
A French director with Jewish roots unleashed a media uproar after he revealed that the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin did not list any Israeli area codes because Arab guests had "requested" them, according to an employee.
Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah", released his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.
During his last stay, Lanzmann tried to find Israel on the hotel's country shortlist.
However, the country was not listed between countries that can be called directly from the hotel room.
How is it possible in 2016 in Berlin, the capital of the new Germany, that Israel was eliminated and extinguished?
wrote Lanzmann.
Instead, the Kempinksi Bristol offers a way to dial Israel via its own call center.
Searching for an explanation, the director turned to the hotel reception.
The answer he received there "shocked him," as Lanzmann wrote.
The hotel employee said that the measure was "a deliberate decision by the management of Kempinski Hotels."
The reason for this caused even more anger in the director.
"The majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the area code be deleted," the Lanzmann employee was quoted.
The Israeli ambassador to Germany, Yakov Hadas Handelsman, called this a "great shame", reports the Süddeutsche Zeitung.
We were appalled and shocked by this event.
This is really very shameful.
The fact that this has happened in Germany in this very same hotel chain is an even greater disgrace.
This needs no explanation.
We expect the hotel to "draw the right conclusions," said the official.
The incident caused quite a big response on the internet, where people called it a scandal.
Some implied that the Kempinski Hotel had "yielded" to the alleged requests of Arab guests.
"Shame on you", it said in another post, in which it was pointed out that the hotel, which is located on the noble Kurfürstendamm, is located near a synagogue.
The hotel quickly dismissed all accusations and called the incident an "oversight" and "apologized" to Lanzmann, reports Der Spiegel.
"There was never a direct order" not to include Israel in the quick list, "the Süddeutsche Zeitung quoted a spokesman for the Kempinski Hotel.
It adds that the country code has now been added.
Police use tear gas & rubber bullets against protesting Brazilian students
Students clashed with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday as they gathered to protest against the government ’ s reforms of the public education system.
The police used tear gas and rubber bullets against the demonstrators.
The trouble began when police officers tried to disperse the students, which resulted in the police using rubber bullets and tear gas.
Several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their dismay at the plans.
According to the proposals of the Governor of the State of Sao Paulo Geraldo Alckmin, slightly less than 100 public schools will be closed, while 300,000 students will be implemented to save money.
Some of the protesters saw graffiti spraying against the provisional president, Michel Temer.
The recent protests occurred a few days after crowds of demonstrators took to the streets to support the suspended president, Dilma Rousseff, who had been ousted from office by a Senate vote.
Trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71% - RT Business
With the lifting of sanctions, according to the Russian ambassador to Iran, Levan Dzhagaryan, trade between Moscow and Tehran grew by 70.9% year-on-year.
Since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted, Russian companies ’ interest in doing business in the country has grown sharply, the ambassador said.
Russian companies are opening up existing links with Iran, while new firms are ready to enter the market.
Of course, further trade expansion is one of the main priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran, "Dzhagaryan said.
He noted that trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 increased by 70.9% compared to the same period in 2015, amounting to $856 million.
In particular, Russian imports to Iran jumped by 91.5% to $697 million.
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $158 million.
The trade boom was achieved by deliveries of machinery, agricultural vehicles and weapons, "said the Ambassador.
Dzhagaryan expects a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year.
Last year, the Russian Mission abroad issued around 35,000 visas, primarily travel visas, to Iranian citizens.
In addition, Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia.
One could say that the record number of Iranian tourists in Russia last year will be broken, "he said.
At the same time, relatively few Russians visit Iran, something that the ambassador hopes will change.
"I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Isfahan, Shiraz and Yazd, which have preserved monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition," he said.
Witnesses wanted: Beverage market in Waldbröl attacked
A robbery was committed on Thursday evening on the beverage market of Rewe XXL at the Waldbröler Gerberstraße.
Three darkly dressed people, who had their faces masked, demanded that the employee of the beverage market hand over cash and then fled, first on foot and then presumably with a silver-colored Volkswagen Golf.
The police do not report how much money has been captured.
The perpetrators are said to have been between 1.60 and 1.70 meters tall, so relatively small.
The beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of Rewe ’ s market and hard to see.
The perpetrators must have run after the attack in the direction of Gerberstrasse, Frederick and Engelbert way and have fled from the opposite of the parking lot entrance located gravel parking lot with the silver-colored car, possibly in the direction of B 256 (Schladernring).
Anyone who has made observations at the time of the crime (around 7: 45 p.m.) in connection with the robbery should report urgently to the police.
Nagold: Fun and games at summer camp
The children of the social-pedagogical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nagold and their carers spent eight beautiful and happy days at their summer camp in Nussdorf, near Mühlacker.
In the quiet Freizeitheim Hardtwäldle the lively group was accommodated during the first school holiday week.
Several full-day excursions were scheduled.
On the one hand we went to Bretten with the visit of the petting zoo.
On the other hand to Maulbronn, where there was a special guided tour for children in the world-famous monastery.
The third trip led to Pforzheim.
In the Celtic Museum in Hochdorf the group learned a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Celts.
On the hot days the group enjoyed themselves at the Tiefensee in Maulbronn, which invited to jump, swim and splash around.
Culinary treats were served to children and caregivers with their home-made favourite dishes such as the Sauren Spätzle, the Seebronner Pfännle, Iselshauser ܢ Bloff, the Englischer Breakfast and Tübinger Bolognese.
In workshops was batik, beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill.
Other leisure highlights were fishing in a nearby pond, the evenings by the fire and the final "Colorful Evening".
On the day of the return home the sun was smiling and the children and young people returned home satisfied.
Haigerloch: Pilgrimage to the Gate of Mercy
The altar servers from the pastoral unit Eyachtal and Haigerloch St. Anna were on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.
Together, four stages were completed.
In order to bridge the time until the next pilgrimage to Rome of all altar servers in presumably two years, the senior ministers round decided to the preparation and execution of a pilgrimage of several days.
Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally the city of Fribourg was chosen, where this year, on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the Door of Mercy opened for this purpose, a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the Freiburg Minster.
16 Minis from Bittelbronn, Gruol, Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern set out.
The evening before, Father Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrim crosses and gave the pilgrim blessing.
From Horb we went by train to the starting point of Villingen, where there is also a cathedral of Our Lady and so the pilgrims' way from the cathedral was started.
The individual day tours were each framed morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptural texts.
But also on the way, the minis stopped again and again at field crosses, chapels or churches to sing together a song from specially compiled pilgrim song booklet.
For the overnight stays parishes of the local parishes were available.
At the stage finish Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller provided a tasty as well as strengthening dinner and breakfast.
We continued on the second day to Gütenbach via Furtwangen.
The next day you started the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous stretch of the way, because in the sultry heat you had to descend about 500 meters of altitude and then climb again.
The deserved reward was a barbecue at the swimming pond in the evening.
After the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, we went to Freiburg.
Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived late in the afternoon at the Freiburg Cathedral and passed through the Door of Mercy.
With a small impulse God was thanked here.
In the evening Mass in Münster, the Minis arriving at the pilgrimage destination were welcomed by co-operator Markus Obert.
After the service, the pilgrims could visit the sacristy and the high altar.
The next day was still time for the Breisgau metropolis.
In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.
At the end, all participants agreed that the days were marked by spirituality and a strong community experience.
Scot Callum Skinner storms home when Brit wins gold for cycling
Scotland ’ s Callum Skinner raced to glory last night in the men ’ s sprint at the Rio Velodrome when the British team defended the London 2012 title.
The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had taken on. The youngster made the legend proud when he stormed home to take a win from the favourites of New Zealand.
England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy claimed the fifth of six Olympic gold medals.
They repeated the trick after taking a modest sixth place at the World Track Championships in London in March, despite Hoys ’ resignation.
The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of driver Jamie Staff.
They did this in time when Hindes emerged.
Hoy ’ s retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.
Skinner was the man they stayed with when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.
Hindes, Kenny - who won four years ago with Hoy - and Skinner set an Olympic record in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.
And the British trio won the duel with gold.
He was a close second after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner kept it.
A change of strategy was a big part of the transformation, with Hindes driving in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep the pace.
Hoy watched from his position as the BBC ’ s expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hindes as they climbed onto the podium.
Glasgow 23-year-old Skinner said, "It's a flattering comparison."
I am here just to do my best and make a name for myself.
We set an Olympic record in the final round and defeated the world champions.
It was just incredible.
There is no better way to win.
After the triumph of 2012 at the side of Kennys and Hoys, Hindes admitted that he deliberately fell on the track after a weak start.
He later withdrew this testimony and there was no objection from England's rivals.
With such an outstanding victory, there was no such problem this time.
He said: 'It feels like London with all the GB flags in the gallery'.
We have come together as a team in the last three months.
We got away so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.
This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London.
If that is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, then five successful days in the velodrome are waiting for us.
With Kenny ’ s form, it is possible that he will repeat Hoy ’ s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.
This would mean for Kenny - who is exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a seemingly sacred date for British sport; Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were also born that day) - a yield of six gold medals and one silver medal.
That would be the same as Hoy's.
Kenny is next in the sprint, which starts today and will go over three days.
The 28-year-old from Bolton said, "I enjoy this just for the moment."
The teammate event is always best.
You can win it with your colleagues.
It feels a bit lonely to win alone.
Hindes said, "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be knighted."
It was the only medal competition of the day, but there was more good news for England.
Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-man four-kilometre race.
They arrived at the finish in 3: 51,942.
The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51.659.
The first and final round (22: 42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly be in the spotlight.
He had quarrelled with officials before the qualification yesterday, when officials called him to measure his height.
Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie advanced in world record time in 4: 13,260 in the corresponding women ’ s competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow.
The GB team relies on its strong track cycling team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and win a flock of medals.
After a truly extraordinary portrayal of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio were reduced.
Dramas took place in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sex and Mobbing-reproaches as well as the retirement of greats like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.
But if you look at the first evening of the contest at the Velodrom, it looks as if the now legendary reputation of GB, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated.
The future of the Portland foundry questionable due to the cancellation of the energy contract
The future of Portland ’ s Victoria aluminum smelter – and hundreds of workers ’ jobs – is at stake, as the plant operator will terminate the energy supply contract, thereby cancelling all supply contracts, the supplying energy company announced.
This move follows the Victoria government ’ s decision earlier this year not to grant any further subsidies to operate the plant.
A 20-year subsidy expires in November.
Up to 2000 jobs are at stake at the Alcoa plant in Portland.
No fewer than 2 000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be at risk if closed.
In addition, there could be domino effects, as the smelter consumes around 10 percent of Victoria ’ s total electricity generation.
In 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry foundry, leading to the closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.
The Alcoa smelter in Portland is losing money and risking closure.
This move follows years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and most recently due to the electricity price of the plant.
AGL, which supplies the large aluminum smelter with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that it expects three more owners to terminate their contracts.
The plant is majority-owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.
"AGL expects the Portland plant to continue to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity from the smelter," the company said.
AGL further stated that the contracts were so-called "hedging transactions", which should have entered into force from November 2016.
The contracts have a 12-month notice period, so they will end in 2017.
"From this perspective, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier.
All potential revenue implications for AGLs from FY18 onwards are currently limited by forecasts of strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.
AGL reported that it had already written off the value of the contracts in its $187 million year-end maturity "expectation of termination."
Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts did not affect Alcoa ’ s “ability to operate the smelting plant or ensure the power supply to the smelting plant. ”
The U.S. company said it had signed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have been effective from November this year, even though it still has an explanation as to why it has withdrawn from the contract.
Analysts warn against the possible closure of the Portland foundry in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle due to the industry ’ s poor economic conditions.
Referring to the statements of analysts earlier this week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland annually consumes around 600 megawatts and Tomago around 900 megawatts of electricity.
If both plants were to disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand in the electricity market.
And that would not be good for us as electricity producers, "he said.
More than just a Kardashian Reality, Kendall is on the cover of Vogue ’ s September issue
Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian Jenner ’ s clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of US Vogue.
Kendall, the brand ambassador for Estee Lauder and ran at fashion weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday.
"In a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote.
The unveiling of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians like?), scripted reality, video featuring the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of problem cases Rob and Caitlyn and in the presence of the all-popular showbiz uncle and producer of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest), forgetting their sister ’ s cover and ending with a classic twist: they all planned a surprise party.
This represents the clichéd plot of almost every birthday episode of a children ’ s show (Seacrest used the phrase, “You thought we forgot you? ” with the honesty of an animated rabbit on a broadcast slot at 8 a.m.), but Kris had to somehow let her other girls participate in this publicity.
With respect to the September issue of Vogue, a new era of Kardashians has certainly begun.
Kendall ’ s big sister Kim may have beaten her in terms of the Vogue Cover (she and her husband Kanye West were featured on the cover in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league by itself.
The September issue is Vogue ’ s most sold issue of the year.
With a volume that is more like an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the edition attracts a large number of advertisers (according to Fashionista, 615 of the 832 pages of the tome were advertising).
The unveiling of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leaked before the official announcement.
Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.
In recent years, there have clearly been more "celebrities who model" than "models who are celebrities" on the cover.
Oscar-winning artist and brand ambassador Dior Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor.
But even with the slim chance that Mrs Jenner - described by the magazine as the 'breakthrough model' of her generation - will fall into the former category, she is in good company.
These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers of today who know how to make a good Snapchat video (even if all of this applies to Jenner).
They are really talented women who excel in the entertainment industry.
Beyonce, who appeared on the final cover, had with the release of Lemonade one of the most successful years of her career.
Of course, Jenny ’ s success is not to everyone ’ s liking.
With her reality, TV, story, Renner's position in the fashion world was always a bit tense.
In June, former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the bitches of the moment."
These feelings boiled up again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenner on the Vogue cover.
But riding around on dissatisfaction seems to pass the point.
Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of Vogue.
She is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.
It runs for Marc Jacobs.
It advertises your primer by Estee Lauder.
She and all her sisters are selling you pictures of themselves on their respective Paywall apps.
She sells pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter made by her to the magazine LOVE.
And in her free time she can be seen on Reality TV. Probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.
Community law centres reject 160,000 people annually
More than 160,000 of the country ’ s most vulnerable are turned away by municipal law centres each year, while the industry is bracing itself for the impact of further cuts on already overloaded transactions.
In Queensland, three out of five people - mostly elderly people, immigrants, needy workers, victims of violence and those who do not have funds for unjust delogations and the like - have already been turned down for seeking free legal advice and counsel.
Legal services of the municipality, which are already overused, are preparing for further cuts.
Starting from June next yearly it is planned that these law centers will lose further 30 per cent of their federal funds.
Queesland Municipal Law Centers Director James Farrell said that the latest survey by the National Association of Municipal Law Centers found that thousands of people are turned away every year.
Farrell said that without a repeal of the decision of the federal government, the situation would only get worse.
"Queensland's community law centres are chronically underfunded, which means that thousands of people are turned away from the important services they need," he said.
People who leave violent relationships, people with unmanageable and crushing debts, families going through separations, workers unjustly laid off - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need.
As of June 2017, the federal government will cut funding by 30%, meaning that thousands of more vulnerable people in Queensland will be forced to deal with their legal problems without any help.
We call on Queensland Attorney General and Justice Minister and Queensland Senators George Brandis to lift these cuts immediately so that people can get the help they need in dealing with legal issues.
Last year, the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise legal aid appropriations to the national average.
It is now time to look at the needs of community law centres and their client communities, and for the Palaszczuk government to invest in this important work.
Donald Trump ’ s Campaign Accused After Employees Reportedly Pulled Weapon
New York: Donald Trump ’ s campaign has been charged with alleged inaction after she was told that her North Carolina campaign director pointed a gun at an employee in February, while they were driving in a jeep in February.
The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in the Charlotte District Court by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in that state.
Bordini claimed to have waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before realizing that “that would not happen. ”
The campaign leader, Earl Philip, "drew a pistol, put his right index finger on the trigger, and rammed the barrel into Vincent's hollow knee," Bordini said in his indictment.
After complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini found that at least four other people had had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.
"Weapons don't have to be fired to cause damage," Bordini said.
The indictment comes just two days after the Republican presidential candidate caused a stir when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the Second Amendment people - gun owners and gun lovers - should take action if his rival, Hillary Clinton, is elected and judges appointed.
Trump ’ s campaign made it clear that the media had taken his words out of context, and that he would not incite violence.
Bordini ’ s complaint claims damages from the campaign for breach of duty of care and from Philip for personal injury and permanent psychological damage.
Trump ’ s spokesperson, Hope Hicks, was unattainable for comment.
Attempts to contact Philip also failed.
WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a campaign contributor.
There was no response to calls to his consulting firm, Innovative Consulting Services.
Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has waged a controversial campaign.
The case is called Bordini v. Donald J. Trump For President Inc., 16 Stück CS 14300, Oberstes Gericht, County of Mecklenburg (Charlotte).
Berlin / Schwerin: Survey ahead of Länder elections: SPD and CDU lose
In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg and Western Pomerania (4 September) and Berlin (18 September), considerable losses are looming for the governing parties SPD and CDU.
This was the result of representative surveys conducted by the polling institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).
While the red-and-black ruling coalition in the north could continue to rule, according to the survey figures in Berlin, this is not possible.
In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to provide the head of government.
In Mecklenburg, Western Pomerania, the SPD fell from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.
According to the poll, the party would only be slightly ahead of the CDU, which could again reach 23 percent.
Third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.
The left would be 19 Percent (previously 18,4 Percent), the AFD would be represented with 19 Percent for the first time in the state parliament.
The Greens despite slight losses with 6 Percent (previously 8,7 Percent) regain in the Schwerin Parliament.
NPD and FDP would not be represented in the state parliament with 3 percent each.
According to the survey, the SPD would only reach 23 percent in the Berlin parliamentary elections (2011 election: 28.3 percent).
The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.
It would still be behind the Greens with 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but ahead of the Left with 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).
The AfD would be represented in the House of Representatives for the first time with 14 percent.
With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return, whereas the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011.
Nokia 9000 Communicator: The first smartphone
A slow-motion email and internet: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came on the market.
The successors dominate the world today - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.
The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.
It was thicker and bigger, so it didn't fit well in the hand.
On the contrary, it was rather clunky.
The built-in memory was initially eight megabytes, which would be enough today for about two selfies with high resolution.
An iPhone is now available with at least 16 gigabytes.
The "Nokia 9000 Communicator" came into the shops exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996 - and it was the first smartphone.
For a few euros lovers can still buy the devices on the Internet, but they somehow date back to the Stone Age of the Internet age.
20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation.
The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer trade fair CeBIT in Hanover as an "office in pocket format".
In fact, the new mobile phone could for then standards a lot: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax to reach the communicator.
Even access to web pages was possible via HTML, albeit excruciatingly slow.
A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.
There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be opened similar to a laptop.
Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white display.
Pretty proud was the price: 2700 D, so about 1400 Euro.
The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany in 2015 was EUR 392.
Nobody could have guessed in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.
Since then, everything has been different.
The smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia.
The mobile phone division of the Finns experienced an unprecedented disaster, was finally sold to Microsoft and settled.
The market today is dominated by providers who all came much later than Nokia.
Being online anytime and anywhere is everyday life for many people today.
In 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide.
About 1.4 billion devices were sold, of which 555 million accounted for Samsung and Apple alone.
The worldwide turnover with the devices is around 400 billion euros.
In addition, there are the ongoing business of the countless app and the telecommunications companies.
A whole industry has developed around the smartphone.
The major breakthrough to the mass market came in early 2007, when Apple ’ s CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the iPhone on the Mac “World. ”
He promised three devices in one: a music player, a telephone, and an Internet ’ s communicator, all using a touchscreen easy to use.
The triumph of Apple began, even today the iPhone is the most important product of the group.
Nokia, Motorola and Blackberry, which dominated the market, were left behind.
They eventually disappeared, Blackberry is struggling.
That say now Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung.
20 years after its invention, the smartphone is a matter of course.
Today, on average, every German looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day.
"We all have to learn to put away our smartphones," said Janina Kugel, the Siemens executive board member responsible for human resources.
Permanent accessibility is now both a blessing and a curse.
England must guide Olympic spirit and enlarge Heathrow
Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only to our local communities and across London, but across the country.
For me, this was Heathrow ’ s biggest attraction, just as it was in London in 2012, when we put a lot of effort into ensuring that all our nations and regions benefited from the Games.
The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.
And we will do that again by creating new opportunities for local residents and businesses near Heathrow.
For our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new apprenticeships, 40,000 new jobs and end youth unemployment in the airport environment.
Just as they were ahead of us in London in 2012, there will be those who think that the challenge of Heathrow ’ s expansion is too great.
I have been told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be disgraced on the world stage.
The doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong at Heathrow.
There are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question put to it.
Like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is an infrastructure project for many, not for individuals.
Enlargement is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in economic growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and across the UK.
We have a great team at Heathrow, implementing a £11 billion infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - voted the world's best airport terminal five years in a row - to the T2, built in the midst of the world's two busiest walkways.
Now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, supported by £16 billion in private investment.
The 2012 London Games have been a great success for the UK and I am confident that the Heathrow expansion will also be one.
It is time to guide this Olympic spirit and expand Heathrow, securing our future trade and creating a legacy of skills and employment of which England can be proud.
Lord Paul Deighton is Chairman of the Heathrow Board and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
Adblock Plus, Facebook in "Cat and Mouse" regarding ad blocking
For companies that make money with online advertising, according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent ad blocking are tantamount to a "cat and mouse game".
On Thursday, just two days after Facebook announced it would block ad blocking on its desktop page, Adblock Plus posted a blog post informing users that users could update their filters in the program to block ads on the social network again.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that its desktop site would change the coding of its ads to make it more difficult for ads to detect which part of the page is advertising.
But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.
In a blog post, Adblock spokesman Ben Williams wrote that “this kind of to-and-fro battle between the display-blocking open source community and the bystanders has been going on since the invention of display blockers, ” and that Facebook may soon come up with a new solution.
The fact that the world ’ s largest social media company has engaged in the fight is a strong indication of how worryingly advertisers have become industry blockers.
According to a study conducted last year by Pagefair and Adobe, around 200 million people worldwide use ad blockers; almost four times as much in 2013.
With 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook via their mobile devices, mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook ’ s advertising revenue.
The company is targeting ad blockers on desktop PCs because mobile ad blockers have no effect on Facebook ’ s mobile app for the social network and Instagram, a spokesperson said.
Advertising on desktop PCs accounts for a sufficiently large share of the revenue, so that the investment of such a step seems worthwhile to Facebook.
On Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its "ad preference tool" to give people more control over targeted advertising.
On Thursday, Facebook claimed that Adblocks were worrying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that is not advertising.
“For users, this is not a positive experience, so we plan to address the issue, ” a Facebook spokesman said in an email message.
Ad blockers are a blunt tool, so instead we focused on developer tools like Ad Preferences to put more control in people's hands.
Suspected suicide woman run over on Swiss highway
The victim was lying on the highway in the middle of the night.
The police call for witnesses after a woman was run over in the early morning hours on Thursday in a supposed suicide by several vehicles on a motorway.
The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.
A woman lay on the street in the dark "in an act of desperation" and was hit by several cars, the police in Vaud testified.
It is obvious that a Swiss woman aged 49, run over by several vehicles, including a lorry, wanted to kill herself.
She died on the spot.
Several drivers have already been interrogated, but some have still not been identified, the police said, calling on them and any witnesses to report the incident.
A preliminary investigation has been opened, which is a "logical" step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter told Le Tribune de Geneve.
It remains to be seen, however, whether one of the drivers will be indicated.
Was a collision avoidable?
This is something that the prosecutor must decide, "said Hofstetter.
Two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers are not being held accountable.
In each of the two cases - where a person was walking on the motorway in the dark - it was decided that car drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is walking on the motorway in the middle of the night, as the newspaper said.
Last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killing after running over and killing a man who was lying on the A1 near Payerne one night in August 2014.
The 22-year-old victim had drunk and lost consciousness on the street, the court heard.
The court found that the policewoman -- who had answered an emergency call -- drove in a justified manner, and that the presence of a man on the street was a "completely extraordinary and unpredictable situation," the judge said.
Anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should contact the police on 021 644 83 46 or 021 644 44 44.
NASA climate model: Venus was once habitable
According to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once habitable.
Scientists at NASA ’ s Goddard Institute for Space Studies have developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms similar to those used by climate researchers.
The model was designed to determine whether Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, may once have had earth-like conditions.
Scientists have previously suggested that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.
But the latest simulation suggests that Venus may have had a thin, earth-like atmosphere and yet was slowly turning.
The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.
The planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to harbor life and protect from rapid evaporation.
Early Venus also benefited from a Sun that was 30 percent fainter.
"In GISS's model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exposes its daily side of the Sun for almost two months," GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio said in a press release.
This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from much of the solar heat.
The result is average temperatures that are several degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.
The model produced a history of Venus that resembles evolution, which was previously suspected by planetary researchers.
Although once presumably habitable, Venus has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light for billions of years.
Their oceans evaporated and their water vapour was burnt away by ultraviolet light.
When their hydrogen escaped, all that was left was a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus as we know it today.
The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.
Patrick Roy resigns as coach of the Avalanche
Patrick Roy resigned from the Colorado Avalanche on Thursday as coach and vice president of hockey operations, and led too little involvement in the team ’ s decision-making process.
Alternatively, President / General Manager of Colorado Joe Sakic confirmed this decision and noted that the club will immediately look for a new coach.
“For the past three years, I have been fulfilling my duties as head coach and vice president of hockey operations for the Colorado Avalanche with energy, passion and determination, ” said 50-year-old Roy in a statement.
Over the summer, I thought long and hard about how I could improve this team to give it more depth, which it needs, and bring it to a higher level.
To achieve this, the vision of the coach and vice president of hockey operations must be perfectly aligned with that of the organization.
He must also have the right to participate in decisions that influence the performance of the team.
These conditions are not being met at the moment.
Sakic, who hired Roy on May 23, 2013, thanked him for his contributions to the team.
"Patrick informed me of this decision today," Sakic said.
We all appreciate what he has done for our organisation and wish him all the best for the future.
Roy was named the best coach in the league as the winner of the Jack Adams Award during his debut season at the Avalanches 2013 at 14.
He led the club to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision, but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Minnesota playoffs and missed out on the postseason in each of the last two years.
The Avalanches posted a 39394-4 mark in the 2015 season, falling five points behind the Wild for a second wildcard spot in the Western Conference.
As a Hall of Fame goalie, Roy won four Stanley Cups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadiens and the Avalanche.
North Sea oil workers resume talks, suspend strike
Labour disputes over pay for North Sea oil workers are suspended as all parties sit down for a new round of talks, negotiators said.
Strikes against the oilfield service provider Wood Group were carried out sporadically on platforms operated by Royal Dutch Shell in the North Sea.
"Wood Group as well as Unite and RMT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute", says a joint statement.
We will have some full-day meetings in the coming weeks, which will start early next year to re-address the problems.
The unions said that their last strike, the first in over 25 years, was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent.
This year Wood Group has cut the rates of its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure.
The company ’ s rate cut follows a 10% decline for onshore contractors in 2014.
The company said that additional cuts would give the company the space it needed to get through the market downturn.
Shell, for its part, has laid off thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries by streamlining its operations as a result of its mega-merger with UK energy company BG Group.
Energy companies are under pressure from lower crude oil prices, an economic situation that was exacerbated by the British decision in June to leave the European Union.
Scottish MP Dave Anderson met with labor leaders earlier this week to discuss one of the biggest labor disputes in the North Sea for a generation.
The North Sea is important for the regional economy, he said.
"In the North Sea and throughout the country, we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few," he said in a statement.
In 2016, less than $1.4 billion is expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea, compared to an average of about $7 billion over the past five years.
Kepler measures the rotation rate of stars in the Pleiades cluster
The latest mission with the Kepler Space Telescope has helped astronomers gather the most complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars in the Pleiades star cluster.
The new data helps astronomers to understand why stars in the star cluster rotate at different rates and how the rotation periods are related to planet formation.
"We hope that by comparing our results with other star clusters, we can learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age, and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.
The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light years away from Earth.
Many stars in this cluster, formed about 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood.
They are now turning the fastest.
At peak rotation rates, these maturing stars emit large amounts of stellar winds.
As these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars, they have a braking effect on the stars.
As a star ages, its rotation rate begins to slow.
Kepler measures the rate of rotation of each star by detecting the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot, such as sunspots.
The latest catalog of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars spin slower than less massive stars.
Rebull compares the stars to dancers, with larger stars turning slower pirouettes than smaller ones.
"In the Pleiades' ballet, we see that slow rotors tend to be more massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," Rebull said.
Since the star cluster of the Pleiades is so close, it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stellar qualities such as rotation rates.
"The star cluster of the Pleiades provides an anchor for theoretical models of stellar rotation in both directions, younger and older," Rebull said.
There is still a lot to learn about how, when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their "dance shoes".
Rebull and her colleagues have reported extensively in three newspaper articles on their latest analysis of the Pleiades ’ rotation rates, which will soon appear in the Astronomical Journal.
A controversial baseball busting star
The tears ran from base to base with Alex Rodriguez faster than the U.S. Baseball Star in prime days.
After his emotional retirement, the 41-year-old pro will wear his New York Yankees ’ jersey for the last time on August 12 against the Tampa Bay Rays.
"I love this game and this team."
"I'm saying goodbye to both," explained the 14-time all-star game Major League Baseball (MLB) participant.
Three times Rodriguez was elected the most valuable player of the league, in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yankees.
His signature on a ten-year contract has given him $27 million a year since 2007.
Until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017, he will serve as an advisor and youth coach - with full salary.
As a player, Rodriguez paid it back with performance for a long time.
With 696 homeruns, 3114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ("Runs") for the Seattle Mariners (1994 to 2000), the Texas Rangers (2001 to 2004) and since 2005 the Yankees he achieved some milestones.
In the Hall of Fame, members Hank Aaron and Willie May ’ s two other baseball players have similar scores in key statistics.
Nevertheless, the 41-year-old should not be admitted to the hall of fame of baseball.
Because as successful as Rodriguez - nicknamed "A ܢ Rod" - was on the field, his appearance outside the field is so controversial.
Already in 2009, the superstar of "ESPN" admitted to having taken banned steroids between 2001 and 2003.
In August 2013 he was banned from 211 games until the end of 2014 due to an involvement in the so-called Biogenesis scandal.
Rodriguez is considered the main suspect, for years over an anti-aging clinic in South Florida to have received performance-enhancing funds.
After a legal dispute the ban was reduced to 162 matches.
“The league might even have done me a favor in 2014, because I played through 20 years without a break, ” Rodriguez said smugly.
Even his farewell days do not run silently.
While many baseball legends in their recent games get the big stage again, Rodriguez often had to sit on the bench.
"My job doesn't include farewell tour."
“My job involves trying to win every game, ” etched Yankee ’ s“ coach ” Joe Girardi.
After all Rodriguez, who was married with the actress Cameron Diaz and according to the circumstances with pop star Madonna and the actress Kate Hudson, got sympathy by the fans of the Yankee relegation archrival Boston Red Sox.
"We want a" Rod ", sang the supporters at the 4: 9" defeat against the Rodriguez "team.
Olympic Games 2016: Chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekowa and Adrian Zielinski are first doping cases
Caught: Due to a positive doping test weight lifter Adrian Zielinski from Poland is not allowed to start in Rio.
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are overshadowed by the first official doping cases.
One of the athletes had almost won a medal.
Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping cases of the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro became known.
The Chinese swimmer Chen Xinyi, 3000 Meter obstacle runner Silwia Danekowa from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - just before the start of the already critically viewed athletics competitions these news come at the wrong time.
In the case of Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide, which is used as a masking agent for doping substances, was already proven last Sunday.
The International Tribunal for Sport (CAS) confirmed their exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon.
On Sunday, the 18-year-old had taken fourth place in the final of 100 m butterfly, only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.
On Friday, Chen should have participated in the preliminary rounds of 50 m freestyle.
Chen has applied to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for the opening of the trial and a hearing.
The national federation takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation from Chen in the investigation," Xinhua quoted from a statement: "We will cooperate with the International Court of Sports CAS and will accept the verdict."
For the first time in history, it is no longer the IOC but the CAS that is responsible for sanctioning athletes with positive cases.
Also on the night of Rio the news of the positive rehearsal at Danekowa seeped through, the 33-year-old went on the offensive herself.
“I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive, ” she told the Bulgarian TV station BNT.
She was innocent, "the only explanation could be food supplements," she said.
According to the report, the banned substance is said to be the blood dopant EPO.
Danekowa was suspended for the time being, according to BNT also the B "rehearsal" is said to have been positive.
Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov immediately voiced his criticism of the athlete.
"I do not understand why the athletes do not draw the right conclusions," he said. "We Bulgarians are under surveillance, so many have already been excluded."
For example, all weightlifters from the chronically doped nation are not allowed to participate in Rio.
On Friday, the case of "Adrian Zielinski" became known. Like his brother Tomasz, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positive for the anabolic steroid Nandrolone three days before.
Both deny the income, both may not start however in the class up to 94 kg.
Before the start of the athletes, the Danekova case in particular is another serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport.
The IAAF had prohibited the complete Russian team from starting, with one exception due to systematic doping, and the running nation Kenya also produced a lot of bad news in Rio.
In swimming, the earlier offences in China had also caused violent clashes between the athletes.
The Frenchman Camille Lacourt attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang harshly.
"Sun Yang pees purple."
"When I see the podium over 200 m freestyle, I want to throw up," Lacourt said on French radio.
Sun was also in the center of an argument with the Australian Mack Horton.
"I have no time and no respect for doping," he said.
Sun had been tested positive for the stimulant trimetazidine at the Chinese championships in 2014, but only had to complete a three-month suspension.
Data theft: hackers extort their ransom
Programmers of blackmail and malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.
According to a recent survey of malware defence specialists Malwarebytes among 540 Companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 Percent of the companies surveyed in the past twelve months at least once, sometimes several times victim of an attack with blackmailer software.
In Germany, almost 20 percent of the companies were already the target of a ransomware, or extortion.
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the attacked systems and data again.
The perpetrators are increasingly specializing their extortioners, according to the observations of Malwarebytes, in attacks on corporate networks.
If they are successful there, the potentially extorted ransom is much higher than with private users.
"We are currently observing an alarmingly rapid evolution of malware," explains Malwarebytes' boss Marcin Kleczynski in an interview with "Welt".
In 2008, most malware programs were designed to send advertisements.
Then, the culprits discovered blackmail and software for themselves.
At first, private users were the target, but the shift to corporate attacks has been frighteningly rapid in recent months.
Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: Once active on a victim ’ s computer, it searches specifically for recently modified files, such as Word, Excel, or database files, as well as for archives of images and videos.
These files encrypts the Ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.
The software then presents the claims of the extortionists.
In order to get the encryption code to the files, victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.
But where private users are concerned with their personal photo data base, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project data bases, without which production stops.
Accordingly, the damage is higher, if a Ransomware strikes.
22 percent of the affected German companies reported losses of sales due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to interrupt the business completely, in one case people were in mortal danger.
Several hospitals in Germany have already been the victims of attacks, whose patients may be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.
"We always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," Kleczynski explains.
But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay get their data back.
It is difficult for managers to reject the perpetrators' demands in the face of a standstill in the company.
The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build up a good reputation.
In a recent study, the security researchers of F ’ Secure have examined the user interfaces and contact with the extortionists and come to the conclusion: The perpetrators are actually trying to establish a kind of customer service to earn more money.
They explain to their victims via chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support, websites or decrypt free example, files.
And if private individuals are redeemed after payments of a few hundred euros, some companies will have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to get their data back unencrypted.
In view of the potentially high and relatively risk-free profits from the ransomware, the hackers become increasingly professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus vendor Sophos: "A single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."
It is more likely, however, that these are three or four people.
The programmers then sell their malicious software in the form of a software development kit to the actual blackmailers.
The previous malware ’ s kits were created by buying the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between $1000 and $10,000.
"The scope of delivery includes a customization tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.
The blackmailers then look for further hackers to spread the freshly bought software among the victims.
We live in a service economy.
You log into one of the underground forums, buy the set from a criminal and ask another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.
Payment is made per infected computer.
“Usually the criminals then assign spammers with the spreading ”, explains Wisniewski.
The risk of Ransomware is now known to many companies, who secure their data better.
More than 50 percent of the companies in charge of IT in the Malwarebytes “Survey ” trust to be able to fend off ransomware using file“ back ups ” and scanner software.
Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.
"If the encryption of data alone is no longer a sufficient threat to successful execution, the perpetrators instead threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," explains Malwarebytes' head Marcin Kleczynski.
Depending on the type of data, the damage potential is thus many times higher than before.
The perpetrators could also target completely new targets on the Internet of Things in the future.
At the Defcon hacker conference, security researchers demonstrated how they could get an Internet-connected thermostat under their control.
In the middle of winter, the activation of such a blocked heater could well be worth a ransom for some victims.
If the culprits then block instead of the heating in the future an entire production line in a factory, Ransomware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0.
One for all cases
HONDA HR / V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR “V ”: a little SUV, a little coupé and also the versatility of a minivan.
Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR “V ”, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.
Although the only 1.60 m high HR “V ” appears rather small, the passengers have plenty of space both in the front row and in the rear, it does not seem narrow at any point.
The materials of the interior are well finished and look pleasant, only the cockpit is a little lower.
More versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR in the storage space.
There is not only a trunk of 453 l with elevated and 1026 l with folded backrests available, but there are the "Magic Seats".
This is less magical than it sounds: the seats of the rear seat can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space that is 1.24 m high from floor to ceiling.
The boot is easy to load, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.
The tested 1.6 liters of diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR, V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerful.
However, he should be doing his job a little more quietly.
Pleasing is the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km.
There is another engine: a 1,5 liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.
An all-wheel drive is not offered.
The handling is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.
But the steering should be more direct.
The equipment in the tested top executive variant leaves nothing to be desired.
The safety systems include the city's emergency braking system (works up to 32 km / h), the collision warning system and the lane departure warning system.
The collision warning device sometimes irritates because it considers many obstacles to be "approaching objects".
The main beam assistant works very reliably.
And the intelligent speed control reacts to the traffic sign recognition and slows down the speed if necessary.
But full connectivity is only available for the top: 7 inches of touchscreen, navigation, app integration and more.
Two USB and one HDMI socket are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.
The approximately 29000 Euro for the well-equipped top of diesel are fine.
Who does not want to invest so much, receives the gasoline engine starting from 20000 euro, the Diesel starting from 23000 euro.
The engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard.
With the HR “V ” Honda offers a versatile and everyday car.
Airline is not liable: fall on passenger bridge
An airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the Passenger Bridge.
Because a liability is conceivable only with dangers, which are typical for the air traffic, argued the higher regional court Duesseldorf (Az.: 18 U 124 / 14).
The plaintiff had broken a kneecap in the fall.
The accident however could have happened everywhere - it concerns a general life risk, so the court.
The airline did not have to pay the man any compensation.
Case of illness: When does the organiser pay?
After their trip, sick holidaymakers only get money back if the cause of the illness is unquestionably to be found in the hotel.
However, this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms.
In the case in question, one family was seriously ill with diarrhea and vomiting on the second day of their Turkey holiday.
She spent almost the entire holiday in the room.
Their illness led the holiday-makers to a defective purification plant, which had allegedly polluted the sea water.
The family was of the opinion, the journey thereby was defective - and complained against the organizer.
The plaintiffs did not succeed in court.
The sewage plant was indeed defective.
But the organizer only learned shortly before departure of the plaintiffs of it.
Until then, he had to assume that the seawater was in order.
According to the verdict, he had not violated his duty to inform.
Especially since no impurities were found in the samples of the water.
The illness of several hotel guests - possibly by contagion among themselves - belongs to the general life risk.
Of the 691 guests, only 38 were ill.
De Maizière said that after the violence perpetrated by refugees in Würzburg and Ansbach in July, many people were concerned about further attacks.
The state must react calmly and resolutely to terrorist threats at the same time.
What is certain is that our country will not respond to the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division.
We will not grant the terrorists this triumph.
However, if criminals had to leave the country more quickly, this would increase safety and strengthen the population's support for refugee policy.
De Maizière wants the proposals to be implemented by the 2017 Bundestag election.
He also announced a further strengthening of the security forces, "on a medium four-digit scale over several years."
Recognition of terrorism must again be punished.
Video surveillance is to be improved and the law on firearms amended in such a way as to make the purchase of firearms on the Internet more difficult.
According to de Maizière, the much-discussed duty of confidentiality for doctors is to be maintained.
However he wants to look for solutions in the dialogue with the medical profession, how the endangerment of the citizens can be reduced, he said with view of mental abnormalities for example.
In order to counteract radicalisation of refugees, the Minister considers that better social care is necessary.
Teachers need to be better prepared to deal with traumatised people.
To prosecute criminals in specific areas of the Internet (Darknet), de Maizière plans to use undercover investigators.
Gabriel said: "The SPD is ready to talk about anything that helps to further increase security."
It was important that the Minister of the Interior had spoken out clearly against actionism.
“That was a slap in the face for the sharpeners in the CDU / CSU ”, Gabriel said to the newspapers of the“ Funke Mediengruppe ” (Friday).
De Maizière had previously rejected calls from the Union for a burqa ban and the abolition of dual nationality.
He considered a general ban on full veiling to be constitutionally problematic.
You cannot ban everything you reject and I reject wearing the burqa.
One could talk about rules for example in traffic or for witnesses in court.
Green Party leader Simone Peter accused the minister of wanting to simulate energy and ability to act with ever new anti-terror packages.
Left-wing party leader Bernd Riexinger said: "Fleet slogans and a tightening of the right of residence do not bring more security to the people in this country".
Better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
The bypass road is regularly blocked - here a picture from November.
But this is to change: the track to the right is to be extended.
This is good news for all drivers who are stuck in traffic jams on the surrounding road every evening when they are driving over the motorway feeder road (A 43).
The Landesbetrieb Straßenbau is extending the right turn lane by 700 metres next Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between Hammer Straße and the Weseler Straße exit.
Drivers can then turn right directly from Hammer Straße.
The big advantage: the traffic is divided up earlier, which improves the overall flow on the heavily used section of the Bundesstraße 51.
The idea with the extended exit had the CDU parliamentary group in the district representation Münster West.
The narrowing of the road on the feeder particularly annoys the drivers between 17 and 19 o'clock.
On weekdays, the backwater reaches the bridge over the Albersloher Weg and sometimes beyond.
Reason is the eye of a needle on the B 51 shortly before the exit Weseler road.
From here on, the traffic is only steered single-lane over the motorway bridge.
The second track had to be dismantled a good three-quarters of a year ago.
The reason: Static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load-bearing capacity to accommodate two-lane heavy goods traffic in particular.
How long this bottleneck and the associated weekday traffic jam will last, cannot be said by the responsible regional authority.
However, years are to be reckoned with: because the bridge has an official remaining useful life until the year 2034.
For the extension of the right turn lane the national enterprise selected consciously the traffic-weaker time in the school holidays, because with handicaps is to be counted.
The traffic will pass the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday with one lane.
Intercultural travel: cultural activities for schools
The international class of the Forest School attended the play "The Invisible House".
The Nima's association and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project.
The Nima's association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster.
The "Klasse International" of the Waldschule Kinderhaus attended a performance of the award-winning play "Das unsichtbare Haus" by the Junge Theater Münster.
In the context of the "Intercultural Journey" initiated by the Nima's Society, 19 pupils between the ages of eleven and fifteen visited the production in the Kleines Haus.
Since the beginning of the year, the association, which has set itself the goal of cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background, has offered schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project.
Between September 2015 and March 2016, most of the young people in the class came to Münster from countries such as Afghanistan, Iran, Serbia and Syria and spoke little German.
Thanks to the choreographies, the scenic images and video animations, they were still able to follow the plot, according to the press release of the Junge Theater Münster.
The Nima's association, founded by Dr. Tannaz Westerberg from Sprakel, and the Young Theater will work together in the coming season as part of a music theater project.
From October to December, young people with and without refugee and migrant backgrounds between the ages of 14 and 20 will have the opportunity to attend professionally supervised courses in the areas of singing, dance, drama and music.
Offers for children and families in the area of theater and theatrical language teaching are in the planning stage.
The project "Intercultural Journey" continues.
In view of the risen refugee numbers the association counts on many classes, which want to take part.
Rain instead of shooting stars: Hope for better weather
The weather has made the shooting stars in the southwest of Germany in the night to Friday a blow through the bill - but there is still hope.
Due to clouds and rain, the night was poorly suited to observe the celestial spectacle, said the chairman of the Welzheim Observatory on Friday morning.
Our hope is on Saturday night.
The weather is supposed to be good, then we certainly see many shooting stars in the sky.
The star shed are perseids, which with 216000 kilometres per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars.
They have their name because they apparently come from the constellation of Perseus, which rises in the northeast.
Restful night: tips against sleep disorders
In the evening, one rolls around forever, at night, one lies awake for hours, in the morning, even before the alarm clock rings, one no longer thinks of sleep.
This is anything but relaxing.
After all, one is in good company with such problems: According to the Robert Koch institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not recovering.
How do sleep problems or sleep disturbances manifest themselves?
There are several forms of sleep disturbances, and they can be based on a variety of causes, emphasizes Hans, Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for Sleep Research and Sleep Medicine.
But what is commonly understood by this is insomnia, i.e. a disturbance in and through sleep.
Many people find sleeping through unsatisfactory or insufficient, says Jens Wagenknecht, a board member of the German General Practitioners Association with a practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.
What is behind sleep disorders?
The causes of sleep disorders are complex.
This can be caused by organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also by medication.
Not infrequently the sleep disturbance is expression of another illness.
"Very early waking up is common, especially in a depression," says Weeß.
And it may be that different factors are interdependent.
Whoever has a herniated disc, for example, can lie badly, wakes up every two or three hours and possibly begins to ponder everyday problems and worries, Weeß gives an example.
This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.
When should I go to the doctor with sleep disorders?
Anyone who does not sleep well for at least three nights a week over a period of one month and is impaired during the day should go to the doctor, advises Weeß.
The impairment can look very different: you are knocked off, tired, unsleepy, have difficulty with attention and concentration, are easily irritable, have mood swings or physical complaints such as stomach or headache.
In order to alleviate the sleep disorder, it is important to find out its causes.
As treatment options among other things behavior changes, a cognitive behavior therapy or also medicines - classical sleeping pills only in the exception and at the most for two weeks - are applicable.
Professor Ingo Fietze, director of the interdisciplinary sleep medicine center of the Charité university medicine Berlin emphasizes that there are hardly any established sleep medics in Germany.
Therefore one should turn with sleep problems first to the family doctor, guesses / advises Weeß.
This can clarify with investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.
Who should go to the sleep laboratory, and what happens there?
For the investigation in the sleep laboratory medical profession guess / advise for example with snoring with breathing interruptions, with morbid day tiredness, with Schlafwandlern or if one does not find the cause of a Durchschlafstörung, explains Fietze.
Actually it is not necessary to prepare for examination.
You should spend the day normally.
"Please do not take an afternoon nap," says Fietze.
After the cabling, you go to bed at your normal time.
In addition to the electrodes on the body, you wear nose glasses, a chest strap and a sensor on your finger.
In addition, a camera on the ceiling records the sleeping person.
How can those affected get a grip on the problems?
There are quite a few adjustments that can be used for better sleep.
Weeß counts on: Regular sleeping and waking times, not too long in bed, not sleeping during the day, not watching TV to fall asleep, avoiding alcohol and not looking at the clock at night - then you start counting immediately, and that is not at all conducive.
What the Jungle Camp has to do with missing swimming medals
Former German swimmer Markus Deibler spoke on Facebook about the disappointing performance of the DSV team at Olympis.
In December 2014, he took gold for the first time at the World Short Course Championships in Doha and at the same time set his first world record.
Now the former DSV athlete Markus Deibler has via Facebook protectively placed himself in front of his criticized ex, teammates.
“In a country where an Olympic gold medallist gets €20,000 and a jungle king of €150,000, no one should wonder about missing medals, ” the 26-year-old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night.
The promotion system in swimming is bad, the doping controls however very good.
That is not the way to compete with countries that do a great deal of promotion and that do not look so closely or even do something about doping.
"I am not saying that the controls should be stopped here," he added.
If he wants to make a comeback, Deibler would have to be registered nine months before his first start of the National Anti-Doping Agency Germany (NADA).
It should be the same with countries.
"Anyone who cannot be checked by independent WADA / FINA controllers for a certain period of time before the World Cup / OS is not allowed to take part", demanded the election in Hamburg, which now operates an ice cream parlour.
Airport: gang of baggage thieves arrested
Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport
Civilian investigators of the Düsseldorf police succeeded in arresting two women and two men aged 50 to 61 on Thursday.
The suspects had committed several theft of bags and luggage as a gang.
Around 9.30 p.m., civil officials in the area of Düsseldorf Airport recognized a gang that the policemen knew from past theft crimes.
The two women and two men had committed several crimes since mid-July of this year, acting in a collaborative, work-sharing and particularly professional manner.
The specialists of the Kriminalkommissariat 34 can the thieves, who had entered expressly for the commission of crimes into Germany, four deeds prove.
They had captured a total of over 15,000 euros.
Old buildings, a few lime trees, in between a remnant of cobblestones: The Rigaer Street in Berlin, Friedrichshain does not seem so at first glance, but the police considers it one of the "dangerous places" of the city.
If you walk along the road from east to west, you will pass playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and an organic food shop.
Someone sprayed "ugly!" on the façade of a grey house.
Opposite a Lidl, which is soon to be demolished, construction is already underway: By 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments is to be built here.
However, articles about this "trendy district", as the real estate company responsible calls Friedrichshain, have been preferably illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks.
The reason is the house with the number 94: Once it was occupied, now the residents have leases, but on the ground floor are still occupied rooms and are used for events.
Especially the Berlin Senator for Interior Affairs Henkel had since the beginning of the year several times in favor of a tough action by the police against the project, the area as a "No-Go-Zone" for police officers and the 94 called the starting point of autonomous violence.
After the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were evacuated on June 22, the police officially patrolled with 30 to 40 officers and three crew cars on site for three weeks, cordoned off parts of the street and prevented visitors from entering the house with number 94.
In the meantime, the rooms were renovated by construction workers on behalf of the unknown homeowners.
On July 13, an administrative court in Berlin ruled that the eviction had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers left to the cheers of sympathizers and residents.
On this summer afternoon, the street seems peaceful: parents go for a walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk before late hours.
In the immediate vicinity of the housing projects are a primary school and kindergartens.
Left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in the neighbourhood since 1999, and Jana *, who raises three children here, are particularly annoyed by the police presence.
With the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern before rising rents and gentrification.
It does not sound like a neighborhood that mostly wanted police protection from vandalizing leftists.
The ditch opened by the Berlin Senator for the Interior and the police between squatters and their neighbors obviously does not exist.
Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district, which even today has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city.
The squatting of buildings and the resulting housing projects have also long been part of the neighbourhood: in 1990, numerous buildings in the former GDR were occupied, including almost the entire Mainzer Strasse near the Riga people.
While the people of Mainz were evicted in a regular street battle, many of the projects in the Riga area were legalized and are still partly inhabited by the people who occupied them 26 years ago.
At the same time, in recent years, the district has increasingly become a magnet for tourists and Berliners who choose to live in Berlin from all over the world.
This is also reflected in rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent in new rentals since 2009.
Many of the new buildings in the Riga region are attacked as symbols of this development: they are recognizable by discs thrown in or freshly painted facades that have been pelted with bags of paint.
No other road was mentioned so often this year together with the words "left-autonomous violence".
One reason that not all neighbours see this as a problem may be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: according to statistics, crimes such as assault are directed almost exclusively at police officers.
Most of the crimes are property damage, which tends to affect new buildings and newly renovated houses.
For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has lived in a tenement building next to the controversial 94 for 17 years, there can be no question of insecurity.
As far as acts of violence are concerned, it is reassuring: the people in 94 are their neighbours, they certainly were not.
Also the famous burning cars do not exist directly in the Riga for a long time.
For the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "Here you help each other, live together on the street and get more from each other than anywhere else."
Neugebauer has deliberately moved into Rigaer Straße - and remained so.
That is why it was so important to her that the residents get their street back: from the police, the politicians and the media, who all suddenly claimed the authority to interpret the district in July.
But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street continues to be taken away from them by faceless new buildings in former vacancies, which displace the old inhabitants.
"After all, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many people here - people who are not so well-heeled live here," she says.
"I absolutely cannot approve of violence and destruction."
But what to do if no one ever listens to you?
There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.
Kerstin Neugebauer has little sympathy for newcomers who are annoyed by color bombs: the house projects and the left-wing scene were part of the neighbourhood.
Anyone who pulls out should be aware of this - just like anyone who moves to a pub district and can hardly complain about noise there.

Urbach: Annika Deuschle is the new refugee commissioner
Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organizer.
She is also a local social worker.
Annika Deuschle has been the refugee commissioner for Urbach since July.
The social pedagogue supports the team of the administration around Achim Grockenberger.
She sees herself as a point of contact for all actors: refugees, the Working Group for Refugee Aid, administration, authorities and anyone else involved.
Regine Kunde of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now here, the eierlegende Wollmilchsau, which has above all a problem.
Some people - not so much mocking but aiming at the multitude of tasks they wanted - said when the administration wanted to advertise the position.
We were looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an eierlegende Wollmilchsau.
But administration is not her central area, Annika Deuschle says.
Above all it is about organisation, working with the local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities.
The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.
She has a 50% job limited to three years.
"It was high time," says Regine Kunde, that Annika Deuschle supported honorary and full-time actors.
There are big and small problems, organisational, human and communication problems.
Soon there will be new containers in Wasenstraße
Finding homes for the connecting refugees that have been recognised has been a serious problem for some time.
The municipalities are responsible for the connecting accommodation.
They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented accommodation.
The cost of building, renting or renovating these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves.
Responsibility shifts from the Landratsamt to the commune and job center.
Problem: There are free objects, however not every landlord wants to offer his dwelling.
The search has been very difficult for some time.
De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.
It does not function so far, with one is dependent on private dwellings, so Deuschle.
As the saying goes, communal housing must therefore be refurbished.
So soon new containers will be erected in Wasenstraße.
But only with dwellings it is not done.
Regine Kunde and Annika Deuschle agree that perspective is the key word.
In addition to permanent accommodation, there are traineeships, apprenticeships, school places, one euro jobs and temporary jobs for refugees and migrants, which must be found or set up.
"More places would be good", reports Regine Kunde.
Many work in the building yard or help caretakers, do charitable work - and this motivated and very neatly, as Annika Deuschle reports.
It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external effect.
This was "no occupational therapy".
Activity does not only mean work.
The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.
People need to develop a sense of belonging.
So it needs offers like sport, contacts with natives and above all language courses.
Professional courses are rare.
So here too the administration and volunteers step in.
It is essential that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.
The long duration of the proceedings was a problem.
They have to explain to the refugees that it just takes time and they can bridge the time in a meaningful way, for example with language courses.
Those who at some point develop the feeling that they cannot help anyone in Urbach, are not allowed to work and are useless will never integrate.
The clear majority was motivated.
But there are also problem cases, says Kunde honestly, "people with whom nothing works." Therefore, the work of Deuschle and Kunde is always also to motivate others.
All this was already a "mammoth task".
A difficult question: following recent events, are they afraid of radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?
"No", says Regine Kunde quite clearly, "what some may call naive", but a residual risk cannot and does not want to exclude it.
But the helpers are already sensitized.
These incidents were also an issue for the refugees.
They would fear that the assassins would bring them into complete disrepute.
"They want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Kunde.
Many would like to stay in Urbach.
So local and regional captains and volunteers must be on the lookout for activities.
They always have in mind that a new influx of refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.
Does Germany need an upper limit?
Politicians are afraid to give a clear answer to this question.
In fact, it is unfair to have them on the ground.
"In Urbach we have not yet arrived where we would like to go," says Annika Deuschle.
No new refugees, that would ease the situation.
Regine customer makes likewise clear that the Urbacher are already busy also with it to integrate the past humans sensibly.
These are currently about 100 people, mostly young men.
But when people are in need, one must help them, both women agree.
The world ’ s political situation is so complicated that there are no easy answers.
Schorndorf: Burglars with helicopters wanted
The police helicopter flew for about an hour to different areas - unsuccessfully.
Two unknown men forcibly broke into an apartment in an apartment building on Lindenweg at about 8.50 a.m. on Friday morning.
The inhabitant surprised the two and beat the bad guys to flee.
The two men were about 1.65 to 1.70 meters tall, probably masked, both wore blue jeans and black hoodies.
They fled in the direction of the city centre.
The police used several patrol crews as well as a police helicopter.
The search was unsuccessful.
Possibly the unknowns stood out before the deed near the apartment or during their escape.
