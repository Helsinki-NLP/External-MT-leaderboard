Members of the Welsh Assembly are worried about being seen as a disgrace
There was a stir among some Members of the Welsh Assembly to change the name to MWP (abbreviation for Assembly of the Parliament of Wales).
This came after a plan to change the name of the assembly to the Assembly of the Parliament of Wales.
Members of the Welsh Assembly across the political spectrum are concerned that we are not being humiliated.
One member of the Labour Party said that he was confused that the word MWP is a cognate of the English words Twp and Pwp.
For readers outside the country: "twp" in Welsh means "welcome", and "pwp" means "law".
A member of the Scottish Assembly, wearing the national dress, said the group was completely outraged and suggested other names.
The Welsh Conservative noted that his group was in favor of changing the name, but that the shortening of the word would sound like "forward".
In this context, the Welsh letter "w" is pronounced like the Yorkshire English letter "u".
The Assembly Commission, which is currently drafting legislation to change the name, said, "The final decision of the listing officers as to what the members of the Assembly are called, is, of course, in the hands of the members themselves".
The Welsh Government has authorised the Welsh Assembly to change its name under the 2017 Act.
In June, the Commission published the results of a public consultation that found the Assembly supported the name 'Parliament of Wales'.
The Commission preferred to be known as the Members of the Assembly, Members of the Welsh Parliament or "WMP", but the "MWP" proposal gained much support in the public consultation.
The Assembly Members are probably suggesting other approaches, but the struggle to reach a consensus could be a headache for the Speaker, Ellen Jones, who is willing to pass a bill to amend the bill within a week.
The reform legislation included changes to how the assembly should function, including rules on disqualifying Assembly members and establishing a commission system.
The Assembly will make the final decision on what to call the bill after the debate is over.
Macedonians go to referendum to change the name of the country
Voters are going to vote on Sunday to change the country's name to "Republic of North Macedonia".
The special election was created to resolve the long-standing dispute with neighboring Greece, because they have a region called Macedonia.
Athens has long been concerned that the name of its northern neighbor is a defamation of its territory and has repeatedly opposed its accession to the EU and NATO.
Against the referendum, the Macedonian president, Georgi Ivanov, said he would not vote.
But the proponents of the referendum, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, argued that the name change was a price for EU and NATO membership.
The bell of St. Martin's Falls has been silent since the siege of Harlem
"Old people I talk to usually tell me that there are churches on every corner", said Mr. Adams.
"Today, none of them".
He's lost everything".
People now communicate in different ways.
The bars were no longer crowded, close, and a place to relax.
In the case of the churches, the money from the sale of the property did not last as long as the leaders had hoped, and they feared that "sooner or later they would return to the same place".
He said that instead of churches, the villagers built apartment buildings that were crowded with people and did not help the rest of the shelters.
And he said, "So most of the people who buy condominiums in these buildings are going to be white".
Both churches were built by the Metropolitan Society of Harlem in 1870, ten years after St. Martin's.
The original white Methodist congregation moved in 1930.
The local religious organization had a building.
St. Martin's Black Order, led by St. John Howard Johnson, opposed the traders on 125th Street, Harlem's main shopping street, who refused to hire or transport blacks.
In 1939, a fire severely damaged the building, but members of the parish community who visited Father Johnson planned to rebuild and repair the building.
St. David Johnson, the son of Father Johnson and a follower of St. Martin, proudly called the carillon the "bell of the poor".
The expert who played the carillon in July called it a "civilization treasure" and "an irreplaceable historical instrument".
And the expert at the University of Michigan, Tiffany Ng, noted that this was the first carillon in the world played by the black musician Dionicio A. Lind, who moved into the larger carillon at Riverside Church 18 years ago.
Mr. Merriweather said that St. Martin had not chosen anyone to replace him.
In his last months at St. Martin's, there was a complex history of architects and performers, some brought by the clergy, others by the bishop's diocese.
The Ritznica is a body of local leaders that manages the church's visitors. Although the Ritznica did not hire architects and performers from the diocese, they wrote to the diocese in July asking for the costs to be transferred to the Ritz.
Some churchgoers complained about the lack of transparency on the part of the bishop.
A shark attacks and injures a 13-year-old lobster hunter in California
Officials say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy who was diving for lobster this Saturday at the start of the lobster season in California.
The attack took place at about 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammell told KSWB-TV in San Diego that while diving with friends for half an hour on a Saturday morning, he heard a boy scream for help and then he and his group drove the boat out of the water.
At first, Hammel thought the boy was screaming for a lobster bite, but later he realized that he was screaming, "He bit me!"
"I was bitten!"
"I was in a bad mood, and I was in a bad mood", says Hamel.
"I told everyone to get out of the water", said Hamel, "and I shouted, 'There's a shark in the water.'"
The baby was airlifted to Radi Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he is in critical condition.
The shark's attack was unknown.
Rescue captain Larry Gills told the media that a shark had been sighted a few weeks earlier, but that the shark had been classified as a non-threatening species.
The boy was seriously injured in the chest, he added.
Officials closed the beaches from Ponto Beach in Casablanca to Swami in Yesinitas for 48 hours for investigation and security purposes.
He said that there are over 135 species of sharks in the area, but most of them are not dangerous.
Sainsbury's is planning to enter the UK beauty market.
Sainsbury's is taking over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams with a line of department store-style cosmetics filled with professional assistants.
As part of a major push into the UK's growing £2.8 billion beauty market as fashion and three products are sold less, larger lines of beauty products are being tested in 11 stores across the country and, if successful, will be added next year.
When supermarkets started putting their shelves free of TVs, microwaves and other household items, beauty products, investments in beauty began to come.
Sainsbury's says it will expand its beauty offerings to more than 3,000 products, including Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and for the first time, Dr.PawPaw.
The existing L&#39;Oreal, Maybelline, Burt&#39;s Bees range will also be given more space in branded areas similar to stores like Boots.
The supermarket is also reopening a vegetarian coloring line for boutiques, which is more demanded by younger shoppers.
In addition, two Sainsbury's fragrance shops are in competition, one of which opened last week in Croydon, south London, and another one is set to open later this year in Sally Oak, Birmingham.
With online shopping and smaller-scale shopping in local stores, supermarkets are forced to do more to attract customers.
Mike Coop, executive director of Sainsbury's, says that Sainsbury's is offering more services and more than just food to support stores like Aldi and Lidl, which are offering outlets like department stores and supermarkets offering discounts.
Since Sainsbury's acquired both businesses two years ago, it's installed Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and added a bunch of Habitat nodes, which has saved food sales and increased revenue from additions.
The supermarket's efforts to improve its former beauty and pharmacy departments failed.
Sainsbury's partnered with Boots in the 2000s, but they broke up because they couldn't share the profits from their supermarket pharmacy.
Sainsbury's new strategy came after selling its 281-store pharmacy business to Celesio, owner of Lloyds Pharmacy, for £125 million three years ago.
Lloyds is a key player in the plan, he said, adding a wide range of luxury skincare brands to the four-year plan, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy.
Paul Mills-Hicks, chief commercial officer at Sainsbury's, said, "We've completely redesigned the look and feel of our beauty departments for our customers.
We also invested in specially trained staff who were willing to provide advice.
Our brands are designed to meet the needs of everyone, and our appeal to the environment and our positioning means we are a luxury beauty brand versus the old fashioned way of selling.
Peter Jones was furious that Holly Willowby had withdrawn the $11 million contract.
When the host Holly Willowbee was forced to accept a new contract with Marks and Spencer and ITV, apart from an 11 million dollar contract, the Dragon's Den star Peter Jones was furious.
Willoughby doesn't have time to focus on his Truly clothing and accessories brand.
They were running a business similar to Gwyneth Peltrow's Goop.
The 37-year-old host of This Morning announced on Instagram that she was leaving.
Holly Willowby, who co-founded the lucrative lifestyle brand with Dragons Den star Peter Jones, quit at the last minute to focus on her exciting new deal with Marks and Spencer and ITV.
Jones was furious when, according to sources, the winner of the competition, at a meeting at the headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, on Tuesday, admitted that her new £1.5 million contract no longer allowed the pair time to sign Truly, a clothing and accessories brand.
This business, similar to Gwyneth Peltrow's Goop, doubled Willoughby's estate of £11 million.
With 37-year-old Willoughby announcing on Instagram that he was leaving Truly, Jones flew from Britain to one of his vacation homes.
The source said, "Truly was way above Holly's priorities.
He was going to be working for at least another 20 years, and he was going to be doing it for the long term.
He made a decision to go out and open his mouth, which amazed everyone.
Tuesday was a startling day, and it was about to begin.
At Marlow's headquarters, there's a warehouse full of goods ready to go.
Experts predict that the departure of the host of This Morning, one of the highest-grossing stars in Britain, will cost the company millions because of the huge investment in products ranging from mattresses and candles to clothing, and the opening could be delayed further.
And long-term friendships are also lost.
Willoughby and his wife, Dan Baldwin Jones, have been friends with his wife, Tara Kapp, for over 10 years.
Willoughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016, and Jones, 52, joined as chairman in March.
Friends are on vacation together, and Jones has a 40% stake in Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby would become a brand ambassador for M&S and would play Ant McPartlin on ITV's "I'm Famous".
A source close to Jones said that evening, "We don't comment on his business".
We had a serious talk and fell in love.
He joked about the media criticism he received for what some people thought was "unpresidential" speech and his positive attitude toward the North Korean leader.
Why is President Trump so submissive?
Trump said in a " news-breaking " tone:
I was not obedient.
After Trump first praised the first summit in Singapore in June as a major step toward North Korea's denuclearization, Kim said he was ready for a second meeting.
But the denuclearization talks have stopped.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korea's top envoy, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that North Korea was not responding to the US's disarmament efforts.
Instead, the US continued to impose sanctions aimed at containing pressure.
Trump's speech was a bit optimistic.
He said, "We're the best with North Korea".
We were about to go to war with North Korea.
Millions would die.
We have the best relationship ever.
Efforts to improve relations with the US have yielded positive results, with the end of missile tests, the provision of free hostage assistance, and the return of American personnel to their homes.
She explained her special relationship with Kim.
"It's easy to be president, but we'd rather have 200 people here than 10,000 people out there who can't get into this square", Trump said, pointing to the crowd at that moment.
A tsunami and earthquake devastated the Indonesian island of Sumatra, killing hundreds.
After the Lompoc earthquake, for example, foreign NGOs were said to be unnecessary.
Although more than 10 percent of Lombok's population was displaced, it was not declared a national disaster, and international aid was available.
In many cases, unfortunately, it was very clear that they were not seeking international help, so it was a little bit complicated", said Ms. Sumbung.
The Children's Trust is mobilizing the community to travel to Palo, but it is not clear whether foreign officials will be able to work there.
Mr. Sotopo, a spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, said that Indonesian officials were evaluating the situation in Palo and were asking whether international organizations could help.
Indonesia is in a constant state of disaster, and the country is unprepared for the ravages of the earth.
The tsunami shelter in Ashe was unique on the coast.
In Palau, the tsunami warning siren was not enough even on the day of the warning, and many lives were lost.
Although the best season is here, traveling between many of Indonesia's islands is difficult.
Natural disasters make logistics even more difficult.
A hospital ship from Lombok sailed to Palu to provide relief to the victims, but it would take at least three days to reach the new disaster site.
President Joko Widodo has made improving Indonesia's devastated infrastructure a priority of his election campaign and is investing in improving roads and railways.
But a lack of funding is plaguing his administration as Mr. Joco is running for re-election next year.
Mr. Joko is also under a long-standing religious pressure in Indonesia, where the majority of Muslims are very conservative.
Christian and Muslim gangs fought in the streets with spears, bows, and arrows, killing over 1,000 people and forcing over 10,000 others to flee their homes.
Look at this: Daniel Sturridge of Liverpool has tied the game against Chelsea.
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool from losing to Chelsea in the Premier League at Stamford Bridge on Saturday in the final 89 minutes.
Sturridge scored a pass from Shakiri of Earth, 30 yards (27 m) from Chelsea's goal, to make it 1-0.
He took the ball to his left as he swam to a distant target.
In this attempt, the ball flew higher and landed in the right corner of the net.
They jumped over the net and caught it over the top of the hill called Cefas Arrizabalaga.
"It was a matter of getting the ball in the situation, and players like Shaq did their best, so I did my best", Starridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
"I saw Kanté coming, and I jumped at the chance without thinking".
Chelsea were leading 1-0 in the 25th minute with the help of Belgian star Eden Hazard.
Before the ball passed through the middle of the field and went to the half of Liverpool, the Blue forward passed to back-row forward Mateo Kovacic.
Kovacic caught a fast pass in the middle of the field and passed it back.
He then passed the ball to the other side of the bowl, and Hazard was eaten.
Hazard passed the defender, and then the left foot overshot Alison Becker of Liverpool and hit the net.
Liverpool and Napoli will face off in the Champions League on Wednesday at 3pm at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea and Videotron will face off in the UEFA Europa League on Thursday at 3:00 p.m. in London.
The death toll from the tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832.
The death toll from the earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia has reached 832, the country's disaster agency said Sunday.
Many people were trapped in buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude quake, which caused waves as high as 20 feet high on Friday, said agency secretary Sutopo Purvo Nugoho at a conference.
The city of Palo, with its 380,000 inhabitants, was left in ruins.
Police arrested a 32-year-old man on suspicion of murdering a woman.
An investigation was launched when the body of a woman was found this morning in Birkenhead, Merseyside.
A 44-year-old woman was found stabbed at 7:55 a.m. in Grayson Mews, John Street, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
The police urged residents to report any sightings or sightings.
Detective Inspector Brian O'Hagan said, "The investigation is in its early stages, but I urge everyone who has been to John Street in Birkenhead and seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I also appeal to everyone, especially taxi drivers, that the camera in your vehicle may have captured information that is critical to our investigation, to contact us.
A police spokesman confirmed that the woman's body was found in Birkenhead and that it was found on the property.
Friends of the woman who was found came in the morning to inquire about her whereabouts this afternoon.
The investigation is ongoing, and the police said they were preparing to inform the victim's relatives.
Grayson tried to enter the cab driver's apartment in Meuse, but the police told him that no one was allowed in or out of the building.
He was amazed at what had happened and could not speak.
Residents were told that they would be allowed to return to their homes within a few hours.
A police officer was heard saying that the entire area was now considered a crime zone.
A woman came crying to the scene of the crime.
He kept saying, "What a freak".
At about two o'clock in the afternoon, two police vans were parked inside the border and another outside.
Several police officers stood in the fence guarding the high-rise building.
People with information are asked to contact DM @MerPolCC, call 101 or Stop Clandestine Crime 0800 555 111 with the 247 log on September 30th.
The Cromwell Monument in Parliament is the latest hit in the "rewrite history" movement.
It would be fair to remove him because his puritanical fans destroyed so many cultural and religious artifacts in England, much like the Taliban.
But the Cromwell Society described Mr. Crick's proposal as "insensitive" and "a distortion of history".
John Goldsmith, chairman of the Cromwell Society, said, "In the current debate about removing statues, there is no question that the goal is to remove the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside Westminster Palace.
Cromwell neither ordered nor led the destruction of holy sites in the English Civil Wars.
Perhaps another Cromwell would have been sacrificed for the actions of his grandfather Thomas a century ago.
Sir William Hamo Thornecroft's masterful portrayal of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th-century view of history, and one that many still consider worthy of celebration.
Mr. Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph that many people, perhaps more people, in the late 19th century than today, knew Cromwell as the protector of Parliament against external pressure, of course, the monarchy at the time.
Whether or not this is really a reflection is the subject of ongoing historical debate.
In any case, the conflict of the mid-17th century was the catalyst for the subsequent development of the nation, and Cromwell was a prominent figure in one side of the divided society.
His achievements as Lord Protector deserve to be celebrated and remembered.
A pig bit a Chinese cattle herder and killed him.
Local media reports that a pig attacked a cattle herder and killed him in a market in southwest China.
A man identified only by his father's name, "Yuan", was found mutilated and bleeding in a pigsty in a market in Liupanshu, Guizhou province, reports the South China Morning Post.
A pig farmer was preparing to vaccinate pigs in Qinghai Province, China, on May 30, 2005.
He and his group were selling 15 pigs at the market on Wednesday, and they were from the neighboring Yunnan province.
The next morning, some of the men who had been sent to the pigsty found the body lying open.
There was a large male pig in the pigsty, with blood on its mouth.
The forensic evidence confirmed that a 550-pound pig had bitten a cattle to death.
"My leg was scratched and bruised", said Wu, quoted by the Guiyang Evening News.
CCTV footage showed Yuan entering the market at 4:40 a.m. on Thursday, feeding his pigs.
His body was found an hour later.
The pig that killed Yuan did not belong to him.
The market manager told Night Watch that the pig was locked up to prevent other people from attacking, while the police were gathering evidence.
Yuan's family and the market authorities are negotiating compensation for his death.
Although this is a rare occurrence, pigs have attacked humans in the past.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring a man.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig grabbed a Welsh farmer in his tractor, and his wife threatened him.
After a farmer in Oregon was eaten by his pigs in 2012, a farmer in Manitoba told CBC News that pigs are not usually aggressive, but they can't stop when they taste blood.
"They are just toys.
They're like children, they're very curious ... they don't want to hurt.
You just have to treat them with respect".
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are bringing heavy rains to the southwest of the United States.
The storm is expected to slowly subside as it moves into the cool waters off the northern coast of Mexico.
Yet, Rosa has recently brought heavy rains and floods to northern Mexico and the southwestern United States.
Rose's blast was a Category 1 storm at 5 a.m. Eastern time Sunday, 385 miles southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
Rose is expected to move northward on Sunday.
At the same time, it was forming over the Pacific and moving toward the west coast of the United States, and as Rosa approached the Baja Peninsula of California on Monday as a tropical storm, it was pushing the tropical storm northward into the southwest United States.
On Monday, the rose brings up to 10 inches (27 cm) of rain to parts of Mexico.
Then, over the next few days, tropical moisture combined with the approaching pressure will produce heavy rainfall that will spread over the southwestern regions.
Rainfall of one to four inches causes devastating floods, floods, and landslides in the desert.
Deep tropical humidity, especially in parts of southern Nevada and Arizona, results in heavy rainfall of two to three inches per hour.
Rainfall is expected to be between two and four inches in some areas of the southwest, especially in much of Arizona.
Because of the constant rainfall, there is a risk of sudden flooding.
With the threat of tropical rain, going out into the wilderness alone is the worst option.
Heavy rains can turn the canyons into raging rivers, and lightning can bring violent winds.
The upcoming cyclone is expected to bring heavy rains to some of the coastlines of southern California.
When the rain reaches half an inch, the stream brings small cracks and makes the roads slippery.
This will be the first rainfall of the wet season in the region.
Some scattered tropical showers begin to approach Arizona Sunday evening and Monday morning, and heavy rains begin to fall on Monday evening and Tuesday.
Heavy rainfall spread to Four Corners on Tuesday and continued on Wednesday.
In October, as the Arctic cools, the weather in the United States fluctuates, but the tropics remain very warm.
Sometimes this can cause a sudden change in temperature over short distances.
The sudden temperature change in the central United States this Sunday is a good example.
The temperature difference between Kansas City, Missouri and Omaha, Nebraska and St. Louis and Moine, Iowa is about 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, the summer heat will begin to recover and expand.
Most of the central and eastern United States experiences temperatures of up to 80 degrees Celsius in October, extending from the Southern Hemisphere to the northeastern part.
New York City will warm to 80 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees higher than the average.
Our forecast shows that temperatures in the eastern United States will be significantly higher than normal in the first half of October.
Over 20 million people saw Brett Kavanaugh's trial.
More than 20 million people watched on six television channels Thursday's Supreme Court case against Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of sexually assaulting Christine Blaisey Ford in 1980.
Meanwhile, as the political turmoil continues, reporters are interrupting a Friday broadcast that is broadcast live, in a project with Senator Jeff Flake that calls for an FBI investigation within a week.
Kavanaugh, who was drunk and grabbed his clothes at a high school reunion, told the Senate Judiciary Committee that he was 100% in favor of Ford.
Kavanaugh said with 100 percent confidence that it hadn't happened.
According to Nielsen, over 20.4 million people watched the broadcast that Friday.
The company owned CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
For other channels shown, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, the numbers were not immediately available.
And Nielsen doesn't know how many people she sees in the offices.
And that's the same number of people who watched a football game or the Oscars.
Nielsen said that Fox News Channel, which had strongly supported Kavanaugh's appointment, was in front of the channel with an average of 5.69 million viewers during the day's broadcast.
ABC came in second with 3.26 million viewers.
CBS has seen 3.1 million, NBC 2.94 million, MSNBC 2.89 million and CNN 2.52 million, he said.
After the trial, the interest rate remained high.
Flake was the main character of the drama Friday.
After the Republican-controlled office filed a motion to elect Kavanaugh, he was on his way to a hearing before the Judiciary Committee when he was asked to get into the elevator and was overheard screaming by protesters on CNN and CBS cameras.
He stood for a few minutes watching the fight on CNN live.
"I'm standing here in front of you", said one woman.
Do you think he is telling the truth to the country?
She said to her, "You are the weakest of women, but you are strong".
Before the doors of the Flake elevator were closed, his office filed a complaint and said that it would have more to say at the committee hearing.
Before Kavanaugh's nomination to the Senate, a judicial committee had to vote on it, and cable and live television networks were broadcasting it live hours later.
But Flake said that he would vote for him, as some Democrats have said, after the FBI had completed a week-long investigation.
Flake came to this conclusion after a conversation with his Democratic friend, Senator Chris Coon.
After consulting with Coons and a number of senators, he made that decision.
Flake's support was strong because he did not have enough Republican votes to elect Kavanaugh without a vote.
President Trump has launched an FBI investigation against Kavanaugh.
British Prime Minister May accused critics of "playing politics" by using Brexit.
British Prime Minister May accused Brexit of "playing politics" by using Brexit to undermine Britain's future and the national interest.
British Prime Minister Theresa May visited Birmingham on September 29, 2018, at the Conservative Party convention.
In his interview on the front page of the same paper, former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson sharply criticized his Chequers plan for Brexit and called the proposal that Britain and the EU should collect each other's tariffs an attack on "their negotiations".
Wade Sims shooting: Police arrested Dighton Simpson on suspicion of the murder of a LSU player.
Police arrested a suspect in the murder of 20-year-old LSU basketball player Wade Simms.
The Baton Rouge Police Department said that 20-year-old Dighton Simpson was arrested and charged with second-degree murder.
The official showed a video of a fight between Sims and Simpson, in which Sims told police he had lost his glasses.
Police found the glasses at the scene and found Simpson's DNA on them, reports WAFB, a CBS affiliate.
After Simpson was questioned, the police announced that he had confessed to shooting Wade.
His lawyer said that the pledge was worth $350,000.
The East Baton Rouge Parish Coroner's Office released a preliminary report Friday that the cause of death was another bullet to the neck.
The Department noted that the Louisiana State Police task force, the state crime lab, the Southern University Police, and the local community helped and accelerated the investigation.
Joe Aleva, LSU's athletic director, thanked the local law enforcement for "fighting for transparency and justice".
Sims was 20 years old.
The 6-foot-9-inch boy grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played for LSU's basketball team.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was in shock and dismay at Wade's death.
"It always worries me", said Wade.
Mexico City has erupted.
The eruption of the Popocatepetl volcano has reached the southern regions of central Mexico.
The National Disaster Prevention Center warned Mexicans to stay away from the volcano on Saturday, after 183 ash and gas eruptions were recorded in 24 hours.
Several thunderous sounds and tremors were observed in the center.
Images on social media show cars covered in a thin layer of sand in neighborhoods like Hoshimilco, near Mexico City.
Geophysicists have observed an increasing volcanic activity since the September 2017 magnitude 7.1 earthquake in Mexico, 72 km southeast of the capital.
The volcano has been active since 1994.
Police clashed with Catalan separatists before the anniversary of the independence vote.
On Saturday, Barcelona's independence marchers clashed with police, six people were arrested, and thousands of people joined the demonstration to mark the first anniversary of the Catalan independence vote.
Masked separatists beat the police with eggs and powder, which turned into black smoke and filled the streets with tourists.
The police used a baton to stop the protesters, and a fight broke out.
For hours, groups of people shouting "We will not forget, we will not forgive" for independence faced protesters chanting "Long live Spain".
Fourteen people were slightly injured in the clashes, and relief was provided, local news agencies reported.
A year ago, on October 1st, Catalans voted for independence, and since then, the region has been in turmoil, with Madrid denying the referendum as illegal, but Catalans celebrating with protests from separatists.
Most voters chose to be independent, but the turnout was low because they boycotted.
According to Catalan officials, police clashed with voters at polling stations in the region, which resulted in nearly 1,000 people being injured.
Pro-Koran groups joined the national law enforcement agencies in camping on Friday nights to prevent fighting.
The demonstration continued, but he was forced to take a different route.
Narcisse Termes, 68, an electrician, said he and his wife were at the rally and that he was not sure Catalonia would become independent.
"Last year was one of the best times we had.
"I saw my parents singing and rejoicing that they could vote for independence, but now we're stuck".
It's a small but important victory in the elections of December last year, where the early leaders of the Catalan independence parties are being persecuted or arrested and tried for organizing the referendum, yet they are trying to keep the momentum going this year.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic, recorded a phone call in support of the police in the conflict, saying that it was being caused by politicians on both sides.
He said, "It's getting worse".
On Saturday, Oriol Janqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders who have been on trial since last year, announced that he would be running for the European Parliament next year.
Candidating for the European elections is the best way to resist the Spanish government's repression and undermining of democratic values.
Londoners: A group of men were arrested after they drove into their home.
Three men aged 33, 34 and 39 were arrested after several car raids on a Londonerry house.
It happened at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday in Belinegard Crescent.
The gate and the building itself were damaged, said D.E. Bob Blemings.
It could have been a crossbow.
The Menangs beat the Rangers 1-0 to Livingston.
Dolly Menga scored the first goal and won for Livingston.
Livingston stunned the Rangers, losing their second 18-game series since Steven Gerrard became manager of the Ibrox.
Dolly Menga's hit was different, because Gary Holt's side moved to the second level with Hibernian.
Gerrard's side have missed out on promotion to the Premier League this season and will face Hearts next Sunday, where they are 8 points behind.
Before that, the Rangers beat Rapid Vienna in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston, meanwhile, with head coach Holt, is extending his unbeaten run to six games, and enjoying the taste of victory since replacing Kenny Miller a month ago.
Livingston avoids seeing the rude crowd.
Holt's team had a long lead ahead of the Rangers, and they had a problem before they scored.
Scott Robinson came out and stopped the ball, and then Alan Lisgow, who was pushing the ball to the side, slipped and hit Craig Haltet's head.
The Rangers were content to play in front of the home crowd, as they could distract the crowd.
And that's what brought that key goal.
The Rangers allowed a penalty kick, Livingston was ambitious, Declan Gallagher and Robinson came together to confirm Menga, and he scored.
At the time, the Rangers were dominating but Liam Kelly, a goalkeeper who knew the defense was impassable, was not often in trouble.
This pattern continued in the second half, and Alfredo Morelos actually saved Kelly.
Scott Pittman was wearing down Rangers goalie Alan McGregor, and Lithgow was defending against another Livingston.
The crosses were getting into Livingston's court, and they were getting defensive, and they were getting two penalties -- one for replacing Halkett with Glenn Middleton, and one for catching the ball.
Livingston's phenomenal analysis is a very good example.
Alasdair Lamont, the BBC Scotland correspondent, at the Tony Macarooni Arena.
Great game and the Livingston score.
For humans, they were the hardest, prolonging the trajectory of the desires that were aroused.
Since joining the elite, their playing style and personnel have remained the same, and the greatest achievement has been Holt, who has been stepping up the team since his arrival.
He had many heroes.
Captain Halkett was unable to get a hold of anyone, and he organized his best defense, which included the capture of Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall.
The Rangers lacked spirit and motivation.
They were the best in the world at the time, but they didn't reach that standard.
They didn't get the ball, and the only time they got on the other side of the field was a wake-up call for the Rangers.
Jordan Lake had a mixed reception.
The leaders of Turkey and Germany met for a breakfast in Berlin, and it was a Saturday with a smile and a blue sky.
It's the last day of President Erdogan's visit to Germany, which is aimed at rebuilding ties with NATO and its allies.
They were fighting for human rights, freedom of speech, and Turkey's membership in Europe.
He then went to Kulun to open a large new mosque.
The city became home to the largest Turkish population in the world.
The police stopped 25,000 people from gathering outside the mosque for security, and many supporters came to see their president.
Hundreds of protesters, including Kurds, spoke out, denouncing Erdogan's policies and protesting the German government's suppression of it.
This duel is a public one, and some German Turks consider him a hero, others declare him an autocrat.
Deptford car accident: A cyclist was killed in a collision with a car.
A cyclist was killed in a car crash in London.
The accident happened at 10:15 a.m. at the intersection of Westwood and Evelyn, just off Deptford Road, southeast of the city.
The driver stopped, and the paramedics arrived, but the man died on the spot.
A similar incident occurred a few months ago on Childs Street, about a mile away, where a car ran over another cyclist, killing him.
The Metropolitan Police were working on identifying the victim and informing relatives.
The roads were closed, bus routes were changed, and drivers were asked to turn around.
Long Lartin Prison: Six officers were injured in the chaos.
Six prison guards were injured in the chaos in the maximum-security prison, the prison office said.
The commotion began at HMP Long Lartine in Worcestershire around 09:30 on Sunday and is still ongoing.
Tornado officials were called in to quell the chaos, which was caused by eight inmates, and they were located in one wing of the building.
The staff are being treated for minor facial injuries.
A prison spokesman said that specially trained prison officials had come to HMP Long Lartin to solve this incident.
Six employees were injured and treated.
We do not tolerate such violence in prison, whereas those responsible are handed over to the police and spend a long time in prison.
HMP Long Lart is home to more than 500 people, including some of the most dangerous criminals in the country.
In June, the prison warden was informed that a prisoner had been hospitalized after being injured in an attack.
In October of last year, when OMOON officials were called to the prison to solve the problem, they attacked the prison staff with pool groups.
Rose is threatening Phoenix, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City with flooding (which could benefit arid areas).
Tropical depressions rarely hit Arizona, but this time as early as next week, and the remaining energy footprint of Hurricane Rosa could bring severe flooding across the southwest desert.
The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for Monday and Tuesday, which is expected to affect western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California, and Utah, Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas, and Salt Lake City.
On Tuesday, Rose continues her journey through Phoenix, arriving in the sun on Monday evening with rain.
The National Weather Service in Phoenix tweeted that 10 tropical cyclones have been maintaining tropical storm status, or cyclone status, within 200 miles of Phoenix since 1950.
Hurricane Katrina (1967) was 40 miles from the US border.
The latest national storm patterns predict 2 to 4 inches of rain, with Mogollon Rome in Arizona up to 6 inches.
In other areas of the desert southwest, including the central Rocky Mountains and the Great Basin, it is only 1 to 2 inches, and in isolated areas it can reach up to 4 inches.
The best rainfall is the pink one for areas that are not flooded by chance, because they are experiencing drought.
Although flooding is a serious problem, it has benefited some areas, perhaps the southwest, which is experiencing severe drought.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitor, 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing severe drought, the second-highest category", reports weather.com.
First, Hurricane Rosa is causing landslides in the Mexican peninsula of Baja California.
On Sunday morning, the storm rose with winds of 85 miles an hour, 385 miles south of Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and 12 miles north.
The storm is weakening as it hits the cold waters of the Pacific.
So on Monday afternoon or evening, a tropical storm will bring the landfall to Mexico.
Heavy rains can cause flooding in different parts of Mexico.
"The absolute rainfall is expected to rise by 10 inches from 3 to 6 inches from Baja California to northwest Sonora", weather.com reports.
Then Rose will move northward through Mexico as a tropical storm, before reaching the border of Arizona as a tropical cyclone early Tuesday morning, and then across Arizona and southern Utah on Tuesday evening.
The National Storm Center said the greatest threat of Rosa or its remnants is heavy rainfall in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwest desert of the United States.
The rain is expected to cause life-threatening floods and landslides in the mountainous areas.
Four suspects arrested in attempted murder in Midsomer Norton
Three suspects, a 16-year-old boy and a 20-year-old man, were arrested in Somerset after another teenager was found with a gunshot wound.
A teenage boy was found wounded on the Excelsior Terrace in Midsomer Norton at 04:00 a.m. on Saturday.
The injured man is taken to a hospital, where he remains in a "stable" condition.
In Radstock, Avon and Somerset, suspects aged 17, 18 and 20 were arrested overnight, according to the Internal Affairs Service.
Police are encouraging anyone who has captured information or an incident on a mobile device to come and cooperate.
Trump says Kavanaugh has been hurt by the anger and anger of the Democratic Party
"Vote for Judge Kavanaugh" "Vote against the brutal, brutal tactics of the Democratic Party", said Trump during his campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump said during his inauguration that Kavanaugh had suffered from the "irritation and anger" of the Democratic Party.
Kavanaugh made a solemn announcement to members of Congress on Thursday, denying the guilt of Christine Blasey Ford, who claims he raped her as a teenager 10 years ago.
Ford himself was sworn in at the hearing.
The president said on Saturday, "All Americans saw the courage and the virtue of Kavanaugh that day".
"Vote for Judge Kavanaugh, vote for the greatest lawyer of our time, a lawyer who has truly dedicated himself to public service", he told his supporters in West Virginia.
He also spoke about the significance of the Republican Party's victory in the parliamentary by-election and the appointment of President Kavanaugh.
"We're only five weeks away from the most important election of our lives.
He said: "I am running as if I were running, but I am not running.
That's why I'm fighting all over the place for good candidates.
Trump believes that the goal of the Democrats is to "stand up without a fight".
The first vote in the Senate on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected to take place no later than Friday, the Republican Party's chief spokesperson told CNN.
Indonesia: Earthquake and Tsunami Kills Hundreds of People, and the Death Toll is Still Rising
A powerful earthquake and tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi killed at least 384 people, many of whom were swept ashore by powerful waves, officials said Saturday.
On Sunday, hundreds of people gathered at a beach festival in Palo, and waves as high as six meters (18 feet) swelled in the early morning, killing many and destroying everything along the way.
The earthquake was 7.5 on the Richter scale, and it was followed by a tsunami.
"After the tsunami yesterday, people were forced to flee because they were still working on the beach", said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, secretary of the Indonesian Disaster Reduction Agency, at a briefing in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't come by itself, it brought cars, trees, houses, and hit the shore hard", says Nugroho, adding that the tsunami hit the shore at 800 km/h on the high seas.
Some escaped by climbing into a tree.
About 16,700 people were evacuated to the 24 centers in Palo.
Aerial images released by the disaster agency show many buildings and shops destroyed, bridges collapsed, and mosques flooded.
The coastal city was hit by another earthquake on Saturday.
Several earthquakes were felt in an area of 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Use and Measurement reported in a press release that the energy from the earthquake on Friday was 200 times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima during World War II.
The geography of the city, which is located on a long, narrow coast, may have increased the magnitude of the tsunami, he said.
Nugroho described the disaster as "a devastating one", with thousands of homes, hospitals, shops, and hotels destroyed.
The bodies of the victims were found under the destroyed buildings, and the number of injured was 540, and the number of missing was 29.
The impact of the earthquake could be more on the coast, in the area known as Donggala, 300 km from Palo, closer to the epicenter, said Nugroho.
"The contact with the wheels is completely lost", says Nugroho.
It's a region of more than 300,000 people, according to the Red Cross, who said staff and volunteers were sent to the affected areas.
"It's already a great tragedy, but it could be worse".
Although the agency was criticized by the public for not reporting the tsunami on Saturday, officials said that the tsunami came just as the tsunami warning was issued.
One video witnessed a man shouting from the top of a building to warn the people on the street.
The wall of water reached the shore in a matter of minutes, sweeping buildings and cars.
Reuters news could not immediately identify the person who was responsible for the video.
The earthquake and the tsunami cut off all power, cutting off communications with Palu, and making rescue efforts even more difficult.
The military division has begun sending supplies via pilots from Jakarta and other cities, officials said, but people still need food and basic items.
The city's airport is reopened for relief purposes only and will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo is expected to arrive at evacuation centers in Palo on Sunday.
The tsunami in Indonesia killed over 800 people.
This is terrible.
While World Vision employees made it safely from the ring to the city of Palo, they witnessed the aftermath of the accident on the way, said Mr. Doseba.
They told me that they had seen many cows being destroyed.
This is terrible.
Although relief workers have begun efforts to mitigate the effects of the disaster, some have reported that foreign aid workers have been hampered in reaching Palo.
According to Indonesian law, foreign aid, aid, or personnel can only come to the area of a disaster if the disaster has been declared a national disaster area.
So far, that has not happened.
"It was only declared a local disaster", said Auliya Aryani, a spokeswoman for the Indonesian Red Cross.
The government says, "Okay, national disaster", and we're open to international aid, but we haven't become that.
On the second night of the week after the earthquake and tsunami, the friends and families of those who disappeared in Palau still hope that they will be found as a rare miracle.
On Saturday, a young boy was pulled from the water pipe.
On Saturday, rescuers pulled out a woman who had been dead for two days with her mother.
Gendhon Subandono, the Indonesian national parachute team coach, was training the missing parachutists for the Asian Games, which ended earlier this month in Indonesia.
Mr. Mandagi and his students were among those who were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel.
"As someone who has worked a lot in planning, this is a particularly challenging challenge for me", he said.
Mr. Gendon told me that before the Roa Roa Hotel collapsed, he sent a WhatsApp message to other paddlers at the Palo Beach Festival.
But instead of the two blue signs that his report had been removed, there was only one gray sign.
"No one", he said.
In the town of Newport Street, thieves filled ATMs and stole $26,750.
While Levi was filling up a Brink's ATM on Newport Street on Friday, thieves stole $26,750, according to a news release from Newport Police.
The driver was preparing to take more money while clearing the ATM at the casino, detective Dennis McCarthy said in a statement.
While he was filling up the money, another man ran after the Brink's employee and stole the money for distribution.
Witnesses reported seeing several suspects, but the police did not say how many people were involved.
If you have information about a criminal, please call the Newport Police Department at 859-292-3680.
Kenny West: Rapper changed his name to Ye
Kanye West changes his name to Ye.
He tweeted the name change on Saturday, saying: "Formerly officially known as Kanye West".
West, at the age of 41, also known as Ye, released his eighth album in June under that moniker.
The change is expected before her appearance on Saturday Night Live, where she is expected to announce her new album, Yanni.
She will replace singer Ariana Grande, who is not performing for emotional reasons, according to the show's executive producer.
West said that the new name, which is also a shortened form of his current professional name, had religious significance for him.
"Ye is a word that is used a lot in the Bible, and it means 'you,'" West said earlier this year in an interview with radio host Big Boy about his album.
So I am you, I am us, we are all us.
The first is from Kanyé, which also means one, so my name is Ye, which is our good, bad, dizzy, all of us.
And the album is who we are.
He's one of a number of rappers who have changed their name.
Sean Combs, also known as Puff Daddy, P. Diddie, or Diddie, has announced this year that he prefers the name Love and Love Brother.
JE-ZIE, a colleague of West's, also changed the spelling of his name to make sure it was capitalized and crossed out.
Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised that he will not use the military against civilians.
Mexico's President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has promised that the country will never use the military against civilians, even as the 50th anniversary of the bloody student repression approaches.
Lopez Obrador promised Saturday at Tlatelolco Plaza that he would "not use troops against civilians".
On October 2, 1968, the military shot and killed about 300 people at a peaceful rally in the Plaza, one of the largest leftist student demonstrations in Latin America at the time.
Lopez Obrador convinced young Mexicans that they would be able to pay their students during their studies and open more free universities.
He said that unemployment and lack of educational opportunities lead young people to join gangs.
The U.S. should double its investment in artificial intelligence.
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence, the U.S. needs to double its research funding, says Kai Fu Li, a developer who has invested in the field and previously worked at Google, Microsoft and Apple.
There's been a lot of criticism of AI from all over the U.S. government, and there's been a lot of criticism that the U.S. has no AI strategy.
And so, China announced its plan last year: it aims to be the world's number one in AI innovation by 2030.
"Doubling funding for AI research would be a good start, considering other countries are far from the U.S. in this regard, and we're looking forward to the next breakthrough in AI", Lee said.
Doubling the funding would double the chances that the next big breakthrough in AI would be in the US, Lee said in an interview with CNBC.
Lee's book, "Special Powers of China, Silicon Valley, and the Creation of a New World", was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, who is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures and invests in China's leading Face++.
In the 1980s, he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that was bigger than an American Othello player, and he was a research associate at Microsoft and president of the Chinese branch of Google.
Lee talked about previous technology challenges from the U.S. government, like the Defense Research Projects Agency's Robotics Call, and asked when the next one would be to determine the future audience.
Lee said that researchers in the United States have to work hard to win government grants.
"It's not China that's hiring the academic leadership, it's corporations", Lee said.
Facebook, Google, and other tech companies are hiring university graduates to work in AI.
Changes in immigration policy could also affect the U.S. Immigration Service's efforts, Lee said.
"I think everyone with a PhD in Gender Equality should have a green card", he said.
The Chinese government announced the next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
The National Science Foundation and other government agencies provide funding to U.S. researchers, and the National Natural Science Foundation of China provides funding to people in academic institutions, but the quality of their academic work is lower in China, Li said.
Earlier this year, the Department of Defense launched the Joint Center for Artificial Intelligence, which aims to bring together business and researchers in the field, and the White House announced the creation of a Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
And this month, DARPA announced that they're going to give $2 billion to a project called AI Next.
The National Science Foundation has so far funded more than $100 million in AI research.
And the U.S. legislation that created the National Security Committee on Artificial Intelligence has been stalled for months.
Macedonians vote in referendum on changing the country 's name
Macedonians will vote on Sunday in a referendum on whether or not to change the name of the country to the Republic of North Macedonia, ending a decade-long dispute with Greece that does not include Macedonia's membership in the European Union or NATO.
Greece, whose territory is Macedonia, vetoed NATO and EU membership, saying it believed its northern neighbor was claiming its territory.
The two governments are stuck on the new name proposed in June, but nationalist citizens say the name change will have a negative impact on the ethnic identity of Macedonia's Slavic inhabitants.
President Georgi Ivanov has said he will not participate in the referendum, and it is estimated that such a boycott of the draft will bring less than the 50 percent required to make the referendum legal.
The question on the ballot is: "Do you agree with Greece's membership in NATO and the EU?"
Supporters of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, have opposed the name change as Macedonia, one of the newly formed states after the collapse of Yugoslavia, is celebrating its accession to the EU and NATO.
"I am here today to vote for the future of the country, for the younger generation in Macedonia, for the chance to live in the European Union, because that means a safe life for all of us", said Olivera Georgievska, a 79-year-old resident of Skopje.
Although it's not legally binding, a lot of members of parliament have said they'll vote yes and make it legal.
The country's name change requires a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission reported that no illegal incidents had occurred as of 1 p.m.
Despite this, turnout is still only 16 percent -- compared to 34 percent in the most recent parliamentary election in 2016, when 66 percent of registered voters cast their ballots.
"I'm here to vote for my children, for our place in Europe", said Gjoze Taniewski, 62, a voter in the center of Skopje.
In Strumica, Macedonia, on September 30, 2018, Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and their son Dusko participated in a referendum on changing the country's name, which is expected to pave the way for Macedonia's membership in NATO and the European Union.
In front of the Parliament building in Skopje, Vladimir Kavardarkov, 54, was preparing a small picket scene to boycott the referendum.
"We are not against NATO and the EU, but let's join with our heads up, not through the back door", Kavadarkov said.
We are a poor country, but we have dignity.
If we as Macedonia are not wanted, then let's join others like China and Russia and become part of the Euro-Asian integration.
Prime Minister Zaev said that NATO membership is expected to bring Macedonia the necessary funding, and the unemployment rate in the country is over 20%.
"I think the majority will agree with this proposal, because more than 80% of our citizens support the EU and NATO", Zaev said after casting his vote.
He said, "Yes, the result will strengthen our future".
A poll conducted by the Macedonian Institute for Political Research last Monday found that between 30 and 43 percent of voters would participate in the referendum, which is less than the required number.
In another poll conducted by Macedonian TV's Telma, 57 percent of respondents said they planned to go to a referendum on Sunday.
Seventy percent said they would vote yes.
A successful referendum requires 50 percent and one more vote.
If the referendum fails, it will be the first major policy failure by a Western-backed government since May.
Watch: Sergio Aguero scored a goal through the whole Brighton defence
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling overcame the defence of Brighton to secure a 2-0 win over Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester, England on Saturday.
Aguero scored in the 65th minute, which seemed too easy.
The Argentine striker started the line in the half and caught a pass.
He passed three Brighton defenders before shooting into the open.
Aguero was then surrounded by four players in green shirts.
He passed a defender and ran faster than the rest of the team on the edge of the Brighton box.
Then he passed to the left and Sterling took it.
The English forward used his first touch in the box and gave it back to Aguero, who beat Brighton goalkeeper Matthew Ryan and hit the ball with his right foot to the right of the goal.
Aguero is having a bit of a leg problem, City Manager Pep Guardiola told reporters.
We talked about playing for 55, 60 minutes.
We did.
And that's when he scored -- our goal.
But it was Sterling who gave the Sky Blues the first priority in the Premier League.
That goal came in the 29th minute.
Aguero took the ball deep in Brighton.
Leroy on the left, who gave Shane a fantastic shot.
Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy, Sturdy
Sky Blues scored just before the forward was out of the lineup.
City will face off in the Champions League group against Hoffenheim on Tuesday at 12:55pm at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play a spoiler against the Rockies.
There wasn't much reason to play hard with the national playoff losers starting over.
But Scherzer, who has always been competitive, is expected to take the lead against the Colorado Rockies on Saturday, but only if the playoffs are meaningful for the Rockies, who are one step ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the National League West.
The Rockies won the National Games 5-2 on Friday, and they're the No. 1 seed, but they're still trying to win the division title.
"If we lose, not much will change, but at least we're playing well knowing what kind of supporting atmosphere we're going to have here in Denver and knowing that the other team is going to play at the highest level I've ever seen this year.
Why wouldn't I want to play?
The National League is supposed to announce the start on Friday, but Scherzer is said to be given a chance at this event.
Scherzer, who will make his 34th start, plays a bowl session on Thursday and plays normally on Sunday.
The right-hander from Washington has compiled an 18-7 record with a 2.53 ERA and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
A Trump campaign in West Virginia
The president talked about the importance of the Republican victory in the midterm elections and he talked about the story of his election of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.
Everything we do is at risk in November.
Five weeks to the most important election of our lives.
It's important, it's broad -- I don't campaign, but I'm running, so I'm fighting for good candidates everywhere.
"You're seeing a bunch of bad, very bad Democrats, you're seeing what's happening now", Trump continued.
The decision to use whatever means necessary to regain power is a firm one. Have you seen the corruption, the evil?
They don't care who gets hurt, who gets trampled, who gets control, they just want what they want, and we don't give them that.
Democrats, he said, mean "not allow, resist".
"Did you see him for the last four days", he said, "describing the Democrats as demons, bad, disgusting, and liars?"
When he spoke about the Senate Judiciary Committee, he spoke for Democratic Senator Diane Feinstein, and the audience was very unsatisfied.
Do You Recall the Answer?
Did you give the document illegally?
Oh, oh, what.
No, no, no, I'm waiting -- that was the worst body language -- the worst body language I've ever seen.
The Labour Party is no longer the church of the people.
He Defies His Own Thoughts
It was no surprise when the Momentum activists in my local party pressured me to speak.
After all, a number of Labour members - we all said our own thing - made the party look bad.
My parliamentary partner, Joan Ryan, was treated the same way because she was a staunch opponent of anti-Semitism.
In my story, I was criticized by the lexicon for not agreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, all of which, unfortunately, Jeremy himself disagreed with the previous presidents.
The announcement for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday said, "We want the groups to be inclusive and productive".
This is exactly how the Friday meetings were held when I was a local Labor Party representative for about eight years.
But today, that's not the way most gatherings are, and the politics of the soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft, soft
There is no room for dissent in the Labour Party, and every dissent is criticized by the party leadership.
It started shortly after Jeremy became CEO, whether it was national security or the EU's general trading system, and my colleagues who had previously agreed with me were expecting me to agree with things I never agreed with, and now I'm supposed to agree with things I never agreed with.
When I speak to the public, I'm always on social media, and I'm always complaining about the politics of the centre, about the fact that I'm not a member of the Labour Party.
And that's not my only experience.
And to be honest, I have a better story than some of my colleagues, because my stories are all about politics.
I admire the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who face racial and sexual abuse every day but never shy away from it.
One of the most disappointing aspects of the politics of this era is that evil has become the norm.
Jeremy Corbyn said last week that Labour should develop a culture of tolerance.
The truth is, we're not a church anymore, and the whole anti-democracy movement or the party voting rules have changed, but the party is getting smaller.
I've had a lot of people tell me over the last couple of years to keep your head down, to say nothing, "It's going to be okay".
But that's not why I'm in politics.
Since I joined the Labour Party as a student 32 years ago, and I was so displeased with the Thatcher government that my school's classroom was in a state of collapse, I've been in the public service for the underprivileged -- whether as a local government official or a minister, whatever.
I've never hidden my politics from anyone, not even in the last election.
No one in the North East would say that my political views and disagreements with the current leadership were unclear.
I'm going to tell those who support the movement on Friday that with our country heading towards Brexit and the impact it has on families and businesses and public services, I don't see why I should waste my time and energy on doubting the leader of the Labour Party.
But I can only say this, not to Nottingham Moment, to my constituents, whether I'm a Labour Party member, to everyone: I'm proud to serve you, and I promise you that no threat of re-election or political attack will ever distract me from my job.
Chris Leslie is the Representative for Nottingham East.
Air 38  17 Melrose: Genilbec Air is up
The last two attempts seem to have changed the final outcome a little bit, but Air, certainly, deserved a triumph at the Tennant Premiere in today's great game.
Now they're at the top, the only thing that's unbeatable in the top 10.
Right, he had a great defense, but they took every chance to support the home side, and Peter Murci had every right to be grateful.
"We've been tested in our games before, and we've still not lost, so I have to be grateful", he said.
Robin Christie from Melrose said, "They've used their chances better than we have, in the air".
In the 14th minute, Grant Anderson's shot by Frazier Climo took the lead, but Scottish captain Rory Hughes was given a yellow card, which was taken out of the game by the Warriors, giving Melrose a chance to score, and Jason Baggott fought back.
Climo took the lead with a penalty, and before that, in the middle of the game, he had a solo spin to win, and he led Air to 17-5 in the penalty shootout.
But Melrose started the second half well, and Patrick Anderson's effort, turned by Baggott, cut the score by five points.
Then Ruarid gave way to a long wait for a serious injury to Knot, who, after a slight contraction, pushed Air back forward at the start, passing the effort given by Stafford McDowall to Clima.
And then the captain, Blair McPherson, got a yellow card, and then again, Melrose was rewarded by Bruce Colvin's unyielding effort, and he was under a lot of pressure.
The home side came back, yes, but Struan Hutchison got a yellow card for hanging on to Climax without a ball, and he finished the penalty shoot-out with a touchdown behind Air, who had been led by McPherson.
Turning the air conditioner around, and starting it almost again, Kyle Rowe was hit by David Armstrong's boxing and sent Gregor Henry home for the fifth attempt.
Still Game star looks to have a new career in restaurant business
The rumor that the Steel Game star Ford Kieran would continue his career in the hotel industry came after he was named CEO of the official restaurant company.
Jack Jarvis, 56, stars in the popular BBC show, writing the script himself, and performing with his longtime colleague Greg Hemphill.
It's been announced that the upcoming ninth season will be the last, and it's clear that Keeran is planning another life after Craigslist.
According to official records, he is the CEO of Edriftmoren Ltd.
The actor declined to comment on the incident, but a source for the Scottish Sun reported that Kearney was planning to take part in Glasgow's "Famous Restaurant Business".

The naval headquarters in La Paz is guarded by sailors.
Blue flags fly like an ocean in public buildings.
Naval bases from Lake Titicaca to the Amazon are being written with the slogan: "The sea is ours".
It's our duty to get it back.
In the landlocked Bolivia, the 19th century war with Chile for a coastline is still alive, and the desire to go to the Pacific remains.
The hope is probably the highest in years, because Bolivia is waiting for the decision of the International Court of Justice, which will finally deliver its verdict on October 1st, after five years of constant eclipses.
"We think Bolivia has the potential, with unity and determination, and of course we expect the right outcome", said Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians watch the International Court of Justice ruling on national television in the hope that the tribunal in The Hague will hear Bolivia's case, and that Chile should give Bolivia an independent sea route after years of negotiations.
Evo Morales, the charismatic president of Bolivia, who is not expected to easily win re-election next year, will also have a decisive day on Monday.
"We're too close to the Pacific to go back", he promised in August.
But some analysts agree that the court will not take Bolivia's side, and even if it does, it will make little difference.
The United Nations headquarters in the Netherlands has said that it cannot make decisions about the territory of Chile, and that it will not decide the outcome of these talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice has decided that we will only be able to take action in six months proves that the case is not too difficult, said Paz Zarate, an international law expert from Chile.
The last four years have probably pushed her backward, though she has not moved far from her goal.
"The issue of access to the sea is being exploited by the current Bolivian government", Zarate said.
He suggested that Morales' military promises had destroyed all remaining goodwill in Chile.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to talk without tricks, but it will be very difficult.
The two countries have not appointed ambassadors since 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodriguez Velze, Bolivia's representative in The Hague, rejected suggestions that the court could take a faster than normal decision.
On Monday, he said that Bolivia would "open the door to a new era of relations with Chile, and that it would bring mutual benefits and end 139 years of discord".
Calzadilla da Morales disagrees with the idea that the most famous Latin American president is still using the maritime question as a political game.
"Bolivia will never give up the right to enter the Pacific Ocean", he added.
The court decision  is an opportunity to see what we can learn from the past.
North Korea says it won 't get nuclear disarmament until it trusts the US
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that if Washington can't be trusted, the nation will never give up its nuclear weapons.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday.
The leaders of the two rival countries called on the United States to honor the promises made in Singapore.
US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the remarks as he reopened North Korea's nuclear diplomacy, which had been stalled after a meeting with Kim Jong-un in Singapore.
Ri continued with sanctions and called the US's refusal to declare the end of the Korean War a "dream" that would not bend the North's knees.
Washington is reluctant to agree to a declaration until Pyongyang takes serious disarmament steps.
Kim and US President Donald Trump are about to hold their second summit.
But there is also widespread skepticism that Pyongyang really wants to give up its weapons, and it seems to see its arsenal as the only guarantee of security.
Pompeo is coming to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show has unveiled the latest line of hats that will soon be on your street
If you want to add new hats to your collection or if you want to hide from the sun altogether, look no further.
In their stunning fashion show at the Paris Fashion Week, designers Valentino and Thom Browne announced a large, diverse line of hats for the 2019 collections.
This summer, the no-fur headgear took over Instagram, and these designers sent out their most stunning pieces to the public.
Valentino's most prominent outfit was a wide-brimmed hat with a gray bird's-hair pattern on the top of the models.
Other great accessories include jewel-studded dresses, a pear hat, and a pineapple - but they don't keep your head warm.
Thom Browne has even put out a list of weird Halloween masks.
Most of the masks of different colors had a mouthpiece, and they looked more like Hannibal Lecter than a fire-breathing fashion.
One of the helmets was a scuba diving machine with glasses and a breathing tube, while the other resembled a melting ice cream.
If you want to be a big fashion star, you have a treasure.
Fashion experts are expecting hats that will soon be on the streets of your neighborhood.
The two-funny "La Bomba" straw hat was worn by everyone from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski, followed by the larger-sized hats.
This social media craze was followed by another product -- a large, medium-sized straw bag that a model would wear on the beach.
The burnt purple bag, with a white belt around the handle, was the highlight of the Jacques La Rivière SS19 collection at the Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL, 'I expect big hats and beach bags to hit the streets next summer. With the influence of designers so strong, it's hard not to notice the demand for big accessories.'
John Edward: Language is essential for the citizens of the universe
Independent schools in Scotland have been achieving excellent academic performance, and this is continuing in 2018, with another remarkable test of school performance, further bolstered by individual and community achievement in sports, art and community activities.
With around 30,000 pupils in Scotland, the Scottish Council for Independent Schools (SCIS) is committed to providing students and parents with the highest quality of education.
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further and higher education, their chosen careers, and their place as citizens of the universe.
As a school system that plans and implements school curricula, we see that today's language learning is still a required part of schooling.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you speak to someone in a language they understand, they will get stuck in their head".
When you speak to someone in their own language, it stays in their heart.
This is a powerful reminder that we cannot communicate with people from other countries by using English alone.
And we can see from the most recent test of this year that those who took language lessons in independent schools scored the highest.
68 percent of students who learn a foreign language score A.
According to the data collected by SCIS from 74 schools, 72 percent of students in Chinese, 72 percent in German, 69 percent in French, and 63 percent in Spanish scored A's.
This data shows that independent schools in Scotland support foreign languages, which will be crucial for children and young people in the future.
Languages are just as important as STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) in independent schools or elsewhere.
In a 2014 survey by the Employment Insurance Commission of England, 17 percent of those asked for a reason for limiting their employment said they did not know the language.
The need for language skills is growing as a means of preparing young people for their future career.
In a globalized world, learning another language opens up more opportunities for employment.
Whatever career they choose, if they learn another language, they will enjoy a lifelong advantage over others.
Speaking directly to foreign guests can give a multilingual person an immediate advantage in the competition.
A YouGov survey in England found that out of 4,000 people, 75% couldn't communicate in a foreign language, and the top 15% knew only French.
Thus, spending time learning a language is vital for children.
Learning more than one language, especially from the developed world, can help children to find better jobs.
In Scotland, each school has a different language curriculum.
While some schools may choose classical modern languages, others may teach languages that are expected to be important in England in 2020, such as Chinese or Japanese.
It doesn't matter what your child is interested in, because in independent schools, they can choose any language from a range of languages, and their teachers are experts in that field.
Independent schools in Scotland are committed to providing the best possible education to ensure that students are prepared for and successful in a diverse future.
And it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time, and it's a time.
The truth is, modern languages are the art of global communication.
Independent schools continue to offer this diversity and excellence to the youth of Scotland.
It must be done well.
John Edward  Chairman of the Scottish Independent Schools Council
LeBron makes his debut with the San Diego Lakers on Sunday
The fans were looking forward to LeBron James making his debut for the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton James announced that he will play the Denver Nuggets in San Diego on Sunday.
But we have not yet decided how long.
"More than one, but less than 48 minutes", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers secretary Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play for a limited time.
After practice this week, James was asked about the Lakers' plans for six preseason games.
"I don't need a pre-season game to be ready for my current career".
Trump's campaign in West Virginia, YouTube channel
President Donald Trump will begin his campaign tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
This is the first of five early Trump campaign dates for next week, including a stop in the more favorable Tennessee and Mississippi.
The vote on the Supreme Court nomination has been postponed, and Trump is aiming to support his November semi-annual election, as the Republicans may lose their majority in Congress.
What time is Trump's West Virginia campaign today, and how can you watch it online?
Trump's campaign in Wheeling, West Virginia, is set for Saturday, September 29, 2018, at 7:00 p.m.
You can watch Trump's West Virginia campaign live on YouTube right now.
Trump may also be talking about the Supreme Court hearing this week on Brett Kavanaugh, whose appointment was postponed by a week pending an FBI investigation into a rape lawsuit.
But the primary purpose of these campaigns is to help the Republican Party gain some leverage in the November election.
Trump's campaign is thus providing a boost to voters and supporters who plan to run five campaigns next week, while the Republican Party is trying to expand its majority in the Senate and House of Representatives, reports Reuters.
"The majority of Congress is very important to the president, so he's going to travel as many states as he can, and we're going to have a very tough season", Trump's campaign secretary, who declined to give his name, told Reuters.
Today's campaign at the Westbank Arena in Wheeling could draw supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and get the attention of Pittsburgh news, according to West Virginia Metro News.
Last Saturday was Trump's second visit to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percent of the vote.
Trump is trying to help his Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, Patrick Morrissey, who is a little behind.
"The president's presence is not a good sign for Mauritius", said Simon Heather, a scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA says they will fight without losing hope
After a three-way session, playing golf in pairs on Saturdays may be just what Ryder Cup needs.
The power that is exchanged between players is a concept that is unimaginable in sports, but it is something that players actually believe in, even more so in these matches.
So who has the power now?
"They were ahead by six points, but now they are four points, so we have a little bit of power", said Jordan Speet at the start of the day.
Europe has the advantage, of course, with 12 games to go, but they're four points ahead.
Americans, Speet says, think they're a little bit of a bully, for a lot of reasons, like Speet and Justin Thomas, who played together all day, got three out of four.
From the beginning to the end of his life, Spieth set a fine example of playing hardball.
When it was time, the ceremonial pictures continued, and the tribe of goats reached a square, and he and Thomas were two after another.
The game, which he won in the 15th, was also stopped by a punch, which suggested that the U.S. team still had a chance.
"If it works, you have to dig deeper and think about your match", said Spieth.
All of these players have now quit.
18 holes to score.
Speet and Thomas scored the most points, with Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood the Ryder Cup champions.
Europe's most interesting but favorite players are four out of four and can't make a mistake.
It was the only place in Hollywood where they didn't have any shootings on Saturday afternoons, but they didn't shoot on Saturday mornings, on Friday afternoons, and on Friday mornings.
That run and the energy that flows in and out of them means they're going to be tough on Sunday, and it's clear that Fleetwood or Molinari are the only players with a chance of winning at sunset over Le Golf National.
They're both in the other hole at the same time.
It's too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson, the four main characters of Morning, did a short piece of Sergio Garcia with Alec Norén.
The first-born and second-born never made it out of the top nine, beating the Spaniard and the Swede.
On Sunday, no one helps you get out of the hole.
It's great to watch golf in pairs and with four balls, because people playing in a team can change their gameplay, tips, or strategy in an instant.
Europe has been better as a team, and they've made some significant progress in the last few days, but those who doubted that the U.S. could play a decent game of golf in these two-two games have been ignored, especially by the Stateside.
Europe 10-6 in Ryder Cup final day
On the final day of the European Ryder Cup, the four-round and two-two Saturday golf match was tied 10-6 over the United States.
The powerful duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the struggling Tiger Woods with two wins, their best ever at La Golf Nacional by four points.
Thomas Bjorn, on the European side, was trying to win back the trophy he lost two years ago at Hazeltin, and he beat the Americans in the morning in four hard rounds, finishing with a score of 3-1.
In the two-to-two round, the U.S. offered a stronger opponent, won two matches, but could not match.
Jim Furyk needed eight points from 12 Sunday singles matches to keep the lead.
Fleetwood is the first Eurasian to score four points in a row, and with Molinari, they become the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four matches.
Woods and Patrick Reed defeated Woods and American player Bryson Deschambon by 5-4 to win the match.
Woods, who played two matches on Saturday, sometimes had a great game, but he's now lost 19 of 29 matches in a row, seven of them by four balls to two.
Justin Rose, after a break in the morning four sets, returned to his teammate Henrik Stenson and beat first and third-place finishers Dustin Johnson and Brooks Kopka 2-1 in the final.
Europe didn't win as much as they wanted, but it was a cool, pleasant day south of Paris.
Three-time major winners Jordan Speet and Justin Thomas set a tough example for the Americans on Saturday with two points.
The Spaniards lost to John Ram and Jan Poulter 2-1 and, more recently, Poulter and Rory McIlroy came back from a 4-3 defeat, but lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup have teams lost the right to continue with only four points to spare, although Furyk's side had to make a small effort to win the trophy.
But after two days of being the second best, the counterattack on Sunday is expected to be more difficult.
North Korea claims 'complete' disarmament without faith
North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that the sanctions that were imposed on Saturday were deepening mistrust of the United States and that under such conditions the country would never give up nuclear weapons.
Ri Yong Ho told the annual UN General Assembly that North Korea had taken "significant steps" last year, such as halting nuclear and military tests, eliminating the nuclear test site, and pledging not to develop nuclear weapons technology.
"But we haven't had a decent response from the United States", he said.
"Without trust in the United States, there will never be trust in national security, and we cannot disarm under these conditions".
While Ri echoed Washington's earlier claims that North Korea was opposed to a gradual nuclear disarmament, (Washington said that North Korea would be rewarded for any move), his words were significant because Pyongyang did not reject unilateral nuclear disarmament as it had done before.
Ri referred to the joint statements made by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at their very first summit as president, and the North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12, when Kim promised to lead the disarmament of the Korean peninsula, and Trump promised to guarantee North Korea's security.
North Korea was seeking an official end to the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United States insisted that Pyongyang be the first to deliver its nuclear weapons.
Washington was also slow to lift the tough international sanctions against North Korea.
"The United States is demanding disarmament first, and increasing pressure with sanctions and refusing to declare the end of the war", Ri said.
The idea that sanctions can affect us is a pipe dream of nations that know nothing about us.
The problem is that the continuing sanctions are deepening our distrust.
Ri did not mention his plans for the second summit between Kim and Trump, which Trump had already announced at the United Nations a week earlier.
The minister instead pointed to three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months, adding: "If it wasn't for South Korea and the United States, the Korean Peninsula would not have reached this impasse".
Even so, Ri's words were very different from what he said at the UN last year, "The bad Mr. President Trump, after calling Kim a killer missile man, should have dismantled the conspiracy theory that North Korea was planning to launch missiles at the United States".
At the United Nations this year, Trump threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea last year, praising Kim for his disarmament efforts, but he said there was still much work to do and that sanctions should remain in place until North Korea disarmed.
On Wednesday, Trump said he didn't have time for this, and it didn't matter if it took two years, three years, or five months.
China and Russia have discussed the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
And yet, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council on Thursday: "The enforcement of Security Council sanctions must continue vigorously and continuously until we achieve complete, final and verified disarmament".
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 in an attempt to stop Pyongyang's funding of its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.
Pompeo met with Ri at the UN General Assembly and finally informed him that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for the second summit.
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year, but his last visit was not good.
He left Pyongyang in July, saying that within an hour, he had achieved success for North Korea alone, to test his gangster demands.
North Korea promised to dismantle its missile facilities and nuclear complex if the United States took the necessary measures".
He said that Kim was willing to seek the "precautionary measures" that Trump promised in Singapore, the security guarantees, and the normalization of relations with Washington.
Harvard students take a course on rest
This year, a new course has forced all high school students at Harvard to spend the night drinking caffeine in an effort to combat the culture of feeling bad.
At the number one university in the academic world, students were unqualified in how to provide basic care for themselves.
Charles Chase, a professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and an expert at the Women's Hospital and the Bryan Hospital, believes that the course is the best in the United States.
She gave a talk about the effects of sleepless nights on reading, and she was inspired to start the course.
'Finally, a girl came to me and said, 'Why did I only learn about this when I was a senior?
He said that no one had told me about the importance of sleep, and that surprised me,' he told the Telegraph.
The first course this year was a course that taught students how good sleep habits can help them study and exercise, but also improve overall well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and executive director of the university's health service, said that he decided to start the course after learning that students had been sleep-deprived for a week.
The one-hour course consists of a series of interactive assignments.
One section is a dorm room where students choose coffee cups, curtains, trainers, books, and read about how exercise affects sleep deprivation, and how sleep is important.
In another section, participants were told that prolonged sleep deprivation may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression, and cancer.
The interactive campus map with its signs encourages participants to reflect on their daily lives.
'We know that student behavior does not change overnight.
But we think they have a right to know, just as you have a right to know about the bad effects of smoking,'" Professor Chaseler adds.
"We still have a culture that prides itself on working all night", he added, and the growing problems of sleeplessness due to modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students indicate a growing problem.
He said that adequate and quality sleep should be the secret tool for a student to deal with stress, weight gain, anxiety, and not just lose weight, because lack of sleep puts the brain in a hunger mode, and you're hungry all night.
Raymond Saw, a 19-year-old California chemistry and physiology student, helped Professor Chase develop a course last year, and he helped lead a class of professors during his freshman year at Harvard.
And she said that this course opened her eyes, and inspired her to do this course all over campus.
She hopes that the next step is to encourage all graduates to complete a similar program before they join a competing institution.
Professor Chaseler suggests that students calculate the time to go to bed and wake up, and set a wake-up clock to take into account the harmful effects of blue light from LED displays and electronic screens, which can disrupt your daily rhythm by causing you to fall asleep too late.
Livingston 1 - 0 Rangers: I got a man from Gerrard 's team
The Rangers suffered another defeat as the visitors, Dolly Mangi's strike went to the side of the deranged Stephen Gerrard, and they lost to Livingston 1-0.
The Ibrokes hoped to secure their first win after a 4-1 win at St Johnstone in February, but Gary Holt's Ladbrokes Hearts team hit a second strike in Game 18 as manager to give them 8 points in the leader's streak.
I had the ball seven minutes before the game, and the Rangers were tied.
At the time, Rangers had dropped to sixth, and Livingston had moved up to third, behind only Hibernian in goals scored.
The Rangers had another problem, when an object from a distance hit the head of Abriter Callum Spence, and he had to have his head treated.
Gerrard made eight substitutions for the Air side, which was heading into the semi-finals of the Bethfred Cup.
On the other hand, Holt was scoring from the same Hearts last week with a Livius 11, and he was hoping his well-trained team would beat his opponents at every turn.
Maybe the Rangers dominated the field, but Livingston had the ball as far as he could.
They were two minutes away from scoring, and in the first play-off of the season, they were sent through McGregor's goal to Scott Pittman, but the midfielder missed the opportunity.
Keegan Jacobs' strong penalty kick caught team captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow only hit the back row.
The Rangers took two strikes, one run, but in the last third, there was more hope than faith.
Alfredo Morelos and Stephen Lawless collided, but when the referee, Stephen Thomson, withdrew from the Colombian's appeal, Morelos felt that, of course, there should have been a penalty in the quarter.
The Rangers only scored two goals in the first half, with former Iberox goalkeeper Liam Kelly hitting Lassan Coulibaly and not thinking about Ovie's punching.
Levy's goal in the 34th minute could have been a game-changer, because they were not going to be able to deny that they had been bribed.
Again, the Rangers failed to match Jacobs' set.
Declan Gallagher sent the ball to Scott Robinson, who was trying to take Menga for a simple finish, and Scott Arfield did not react.
He replaced Coulibaly with Ryan Kent, and Gerrard tried the tapping, and the replacement had an immediate impact, as he collided with Morelos, but Kelly was surprised to see him run for his line.
But Livingston, Lithgow, and Halkett, they cleared the ball and they brought the guests into their favorite game.
In the final stages, Holt's side would have probably taken their lead, but before Lithgow hit the ball from a wide angle, McGregor was in a good position to block Jacobs.
The Rangers' replacement Glenn sued Middleton late for another penalty, which ended in a collision with Jacobs, but Thompson turned back.
The Almanac Collection: The inventor of the Geiger calculator
And now, a page from our calendar: 136 years ago today, on September 30, 1982, the day the future German physicist Johann Wilhelm Hans Geiger was born.
Geiger developed a method for measuring and measuring radioactivity, and this led to the creation of the Geiger calculator, which eventually became known as the Geiger counter.
Since then , Geiger 's calculator has become a staple of pop culture , as has the unrealistic science-cowboy Roy Rogers and Dale Evans in 1950 ' s " The Bell Tolls " .
Man: "Where did this come from?"
Rogers: "This is a Geiger counter that we use to display radioactive minerals like uranium.
When you wear a headset, you can hear the radioactive effects of atoms in the mineral".
"He's going to shoot himself!" Evans said.
Hans Geiger died in 1945, just days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name still lives.
New cancer vaccine can push the immune system to detect foreign cells
New cancer vaccine triggers the immune system to detect foreign cells and kill them
As part of the treatment, vaccines train the immune system to recognize foreign cells
This involves modifying them in the lab and removing immune cells from the patient.
They can see a protein that looks like most cancers.
Then, a re-tested vaccine showed patients the long-awaited results of treating a number of cancer diseases.
A woman who received a vaccine that taught her immune system to recognize foreign cells saw her ovarian cancer go away for more than 18 months.
The method involves removing the patient's immune cells, changing them in the lab to detect proteins that are similar to many types of cancer called HER2, and then inserting the cells back into the patient.
Jay Berzowski, a professor at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Maryland, U.S.A., said: "Our results confirm that we have the most promising vaccine".
"HER2 controls the growth of several types of cancer, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and colon cancer", explains Professor Berzowski.
This approach, which is to take immune cells from patients and "screw" them, has also been used to target cancer cells and has worked to treat certain types of leukemia.
Kanye West wore a MAGA cap after his speech on Saturday Night Live (SNL) to defend his outrageous speech about Trump.
It didn't go very well.
Kanye West heard a lot of screaming during Saturday Night Live when he announced that he was running for president again in 2020 and that he didn't like his unrelated speech praising the United States.
Kanye West wore a cap that read "Make America Great" and sang his third song, "Ghost Town", in an anti-Democratic speech and in support of Trump.
"I've talked to white people a lot, and they've been asking me, 'What do you like about Trump? Isn't he a racist?'"
If racism were a concern, I would never leave America".
SNL started the show with a parody of Matt Damon, a parody of Hollywood star Matt Damon mocking Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee about the sexual assault of Kristen Blaze Ford.
Although it was not publicly released, a video of Kanye West speaking was uploaded by comedian Chris Rock on social media.
It remains unclear whether Chris Rock's posting of the video was an attempt to mock.
West also scolded the audience for hearing bad language about wearing a cap on the outside of the curtain.
"They were so hard on me.
They said, 'You'll never go on stage in this.'"
They made fun of me!
"They told me that you were in a "dump zone", reports the Washington Examiner.
West went on to say, "Do you want to see the end of the world?" In other words, "I'm going to wear my Superman costume, because it means you can't tell me what I'm going to do".
So, enjoy it".
His speech was met with at least two unpleasant shouts from the audience, and the staff of Saturday Night Live were confused, and according to Variety, one of the attendees said, "The whole studio was quiet and quiet".
West was invited to replace Ariana Grande, who was unable to attend because her ex-boyfriend, Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West performed "I Like It" dressed as a Perrier bottle, and he surprised people.
West was supported by Candice Turner of the conservative organization TPUSA, who tweeted: "To one of the bravest: THANK YOU FOR STANDING AT THE TOP OF THE WINNER".
But Karen Hunter, the host of the talk show, tweeted, "West is just who he is, and it's awesome!"
"But I decided not to reward anyone who supports an ideology that is harmful to my community (by buying their songs, or their clothes, or their art).
He is a free man.
He was a free man, just like us.
At the beginning of the show, the rapper announced via Twitter that he had changed his name to Kanye West.
He's not the first artist to change his nickname, and he's also a fan of the likes of Puff Daddy, Puffy, P Diddy.
Another rapper, Snoop Dogg, changed his stage name to Snoop Lion, and legendary music legend Prince changed his stage name to a symbol, and then to the artist who was later known as Prince.
Accused of murder in Belfast restaurant
A 45-year-old man has pleaded guilty to attempted murder by stabbing a man in a restaurant in east Belfast on Friday.
The police were informed that the incident had taken place in Ballihakamore.
The case is expected to go to the World Court in Belfast on Monday.
The prosecution will be prosecuted.
The star of " Game of Thrones " , Keith Harrington , is a male
Keith Harrington is best known for his role as John Snow, the swordsman in the HBO medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor said that the stereotypical view of the "make-believe" of young people on screen often suggests that they must be tough to be respected.
In a speech for The Sunday Times Culture, Keith asked how to address the issue of over-exaggerated heroism in the #MeToo era, which he felt was "something went wrong".
Keith, who recently married his 31-year-old co-star Rose Leslie, admitted that he felt "too strong" for this over-the-top issue of heroism.
Now, he said, personally, I feel pretty strongly about where we're doing the wrong thing with courage.
In view of the matter at hand, where did we go wrong in raising children?
Keith also believes that television may be responsible for the rise of the over-masculine man with his over-masculine characters.
He continues: What is there that is natural and what is there that is taken from the outside?
What does television and the street teach children to feel that they are a certain type of independent man?
I think it's the single most serious problem we have right now -- how do we solve this problem?
Because there's something really wrong with young children.
He also stated in an interview that he would no longer be involved in the prequel or sequel after the end of Game of Thrones in the summer. He announced that he would stop fighting and horses.
Starting in November, Keith will star in Sam Shepard's "The Real West", a game about a film producer and his pirate uncle.
He said that his meeting with his wife Rose at the "Game of Thrones" was the best part of his career.
"I met my wife on this show, and with it, my future family and my life were born", he said.
In the Emmy-winning fantasy series, Rose Keith played the role of Igrit, the lover of John Snow.
The couple married in June 2018 at the Leslie Family Estate in Scotland.
HIV-AIDS: China reports 14% of new outbreaks.
China reported a 14% increase in the number of people diagnosed with HIV and AIDS.
Health officials estimate that more than 820,000 people in the United States will be affected by these diseases.
In the second quarter of 2018 alone, there were about 40,000 new cases.
Most were sexually transmitted, which shows a change in statistics from the previous year.
In some parts of China, HIV has spread rapidly through transfusions of infected blood.
Chinese health officials said at a conference in Yunnan that the new HIV infections had been reduced to almost zero.
But in China, the number of people infected with HIV and AIDS is increasing by 100,000 a year.
Sexual transmission of AIDS is a major problem in China's LGBT community.
Homosexuality was legalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against LGBT people is still said to be ongoing.
In view of the country's conservative values, studies show that 70 to 90 percent of men who have sex with men end up marrying women.
Many diseases are transmitted through sexual misunderstandings.
Since 2003, the Chinese government has promised to make HIV drugs available to the public as part of its efforts to address these problems.
Maxine Waters denies the "conversation theories" and "dangerous disinformation" leaks by Republican senators.
On Saturday, Representative Maxine Waters of the KS accused a staff member of posting the personal information of three Republican U.S. senators on the Wikipedia page of a lawmaker.
A Los Angeles Democrat noted that the claims were made by radical reformist governments and websites.
"Lies, lies, and the most hateful lies", Waters tweeted.
The information released indicates phone numbers and home addresses for U.S. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both from Utah.
An anonymous tip on Capitol Hill leaked online on Thursday during the hearing of the sexual assault charges against Senate Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
It was only after three senators interviewed Kavanaugh that the leak began.
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState have published Waters employee data that links the IP address to Waters' office, which identifies the source of the messages, reports The Hill.
"This unverified account is completely false and absolutely false", Waters continued.
"My staff members - whose identity, personal data and security are compromised by fraudulent and false credentials - are not responsible for any leakage of information.
This unverified report is completely false and absolutely false".
Waters's appeal was immediately criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ari Fleisher.
"This is a furious cancellation", wrote Fleischer.
"It's a sign that he doesn't have the temperament to be a member of Congress.
When someone is criticized for something he did not do, he should not become angry.
They should not be rude.
They should not allow the accuser to question his motives.
They need to be calm and quiet".
Fleischer seems to have compared Waters' reaction to the Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who appeared to be very angry during Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Republican Party candidate who voted for his candidacy in the midterm elections, also tweeted his opinion.
"Great, if it is true", he tweeted.
In his complaint, Waters' office warned the relevant authorities and law enforcement agencies about these fraudulent claims.
"We will ensure that the perpetrators are exposed", he continued, "and that all members of my staff are held legally accountable for their actions, which will be dangerous and ridiculous to all".
Johnny Ehrlich strikes again - Not so strong by Rowan Atkinson
Now we can see the meaning of Brexit in a new British film, and this is the re-release of the Johnny Ehrlich action-comedy franchise, which started in 2003, and then returned to theaters in 2011 with Johnny Ehrlich's Re-creation.
Could self-deprecating satire be the new export opportunity of this country?
Any minute now, the big-eyed, rubber-faced Johnny Ehrlich will be back for a second time, and the name of the actor who plays Johnny Ehrlich is a signal that this is the best comedy ever made, and the most interesting film ever made in a non-English speaking audience.
He's obviously a stupid undercover agent, but despite his ridiculous demands for glamorous smoothie, he took a little bit of Cluzo, got the character of Mr. Bean, and put a note on the London 2012 hit "The Car".
It is also based on the international mystery traveler Atkinson, who starred in the now-forgotten TV show Barricard, and left a mess behind.
There's one or two good things about the last Johnny Ehrlich trip.
I liked the way Johnny Ehrlich, wearing his medieval helmet, approached the helicopter and whistled through the helicopter's wing handle to the top of his head.
Atkinson's talent is demonstrated as physical comedy, but the lack of humor seems poor and excessive, especially when serious film brands like 007 and Mission Impossible present comedy as an ingredient.
I think humor is more for young children than for adults, and the bad stories of Johnny Ecklish, like the "Bob in the Prologue" in Atkinson's deaf film, are less skillful.
The United Kingdom is in a serious crisis.
With all the British agents in the area exposed, the hacker infiltrated the top-secret British network and took the heart of the acting agent, a sadly minor role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for the arrogant, controversial figure, the politician who has suffered a complete defeat: Emma Thompson, in this quasi-Theresa-May, does everything possible, but there is nothing special about the script.
His intelligence advisers had a bad reputation for any active spy, and he had to resign.
And it turns out that Johnny Enlish was actually a schoolteacher at some incredibly wonderful institution, but he was giving an informal lesson on how to be a secret agent: a good joke here, and Enlish is making the spy academy look like rock.
Eunlish returns to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with her patient ex-husband, Ben Miller, who is playing Boff again.
Boff is now married to the captain of a submarine called "Road-Hockey-Club", and the role he played as Vicky Pepperdine is somewhat of a flop.
After a major mistake at the Secret Service, Batman and Robin went back to work, until they met the powerful Olga Kurilenko and Ofelia Bulletova.
In the middle of it, the Prime Minister is exposed to the dangerous influence of charismatic billionaires who solve computer puzzles in the UK.
Ehrlich and Boff begin their odyssey with a few silly jokes: they dress up as waitresses and set fire to a French restaurant; they create chaos on board Volta's luxury yacht; and Ehrlich tries to create pure anarchy by using a virtual headset to explore the interior of Volta's house.
All the effort was certainly put into making the final episode, but as fun and as noisy as it was, there was plenty of children's television in it.
Enough of the staff.
And like all the other Johnny Ecklish films, I couldn't help but wonder: How could the British film industry not give Rowan Atkinson a role that was perfect for his talent?
Labour denies that they are working on a plan for a four-day week for British workers, but a five-day wage.
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party should consider a radical plan where the British work four days a week and get paid for five days.
The party reportedly wants the leaders of companies to give the money they have made from the artificial intelligence revolution to the workers by giving them an extra day off.
As a result, the workers enjoy three days of rest, but they return home with the same amount of money.
Sources say the idea is in line with the party's economic agenda and plans to turn the country in the workers' favor.
The four-day workweek was approved by the trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of the benefits of a changing economy.
The Labour Party's top party told The Sunday Times: 'The policy review is expected to be published by the end of the year.
It's not an hour, but a four-day work week. It's a commitment to rebalancing the economy in favor of the worker, which is embedded in the party's approach and the party's overall industrial strategy.'
The Labour Party was not the first to support the idea, the Greens were the first to introduce a four-day work week during their 2017 election campaign.
But right now, the Labour Party is generally not in favor of that.
A Labour Party spokesman said: 'The four-day work week is not party policy and has not been considered by the party.'
Treasury Chancellor John McDonnell used a Labour conference last week to articulate his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr. McDonnell said that he was determined to take back the power from the unqualified directors and speculators in the utilities.
The Treasury Chancellor's plans also explain that current shareholders of hedge funds may not be able to recover all their shares because the Labour government may conduct a write-off based on suspected breaches.
He also approved plans to put workers on the boards of directors of companies and to create inclusive private equity funds to give employees 10 percent of the shares of private firms, which would receive dividends of up to £500 annually.
Lindsey Graham, John F. Kennedy on "60 Minutes", where the FBI investigates whether Kavanaugh will change his mind.
The latest Federal Bureau of Investigation indictment against Judge Bretta Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court's vote on her nomination has been postponed by at least a week, and the question is whether the Bureau's findings will influence Republican senators to support her.
In an interview that aired Sunday, reporter Scott Pelley of 60 Minutes asked Republicans John F. Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would force them to reconsider.
Kennedy, from South Carolina, was much more open than his peers.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
"I said I was going to the trial, and I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh.
And I called him after that happened, and I said, "Did you do that?"
He was determined, he was determined".
Graham's voice sounds like a rock carving.
"I've made a decision about Brett Kavanaugh, and it's a dynamite charge", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett was denying it, and Graham added it because of Christine Blaze Ford.
"It is impossible for those who know it to confirm its authenticity.
She is 36 years old.
I didn't see anything new".
What is the World Citizen's Festival, and what has it done to reduce poverty?
This Saturday in New York City, the World Citizen's Festival is an annual musical event that brings together some of the most impressive stars and performs an impressive mission: to end poverty in the world.
Now in its seventh year, the World Citizen's Festival brought tens of thousands of people to Central Park, not just to have fun with Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Sean Mendes, but to learn about the true purpose of the festival: to end global poverty by 2030.
The 2012 Global Citizen Festival is a continuation of the Global Citizen Festival on Poverty, which was started by an international information and propaganda group with the aim of eradicating poverty by increasing the number of active people.
To get a free ticket (unless you're willing to buy a VIP ticket), you'll need to do a series of things that are critical to ending poverty, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, making a phone call, or doing other important things.
But, in the 12 years before the end of the year, how successful has the Global Citizen Festival been?
Is giving people free concert tickets a real call to action against poverty, or is it just another example of click-activism - people really feel like they're making a difference just by posting online petitions or tweeting?
Since 2011, the Global Citizen Festival has inspired more than 19 million supporters to take action for a variety of causes.
It says that these actions have helped world leaders to announce commitments and policies worth more than $37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
At the beginning of 2018, the group had already referred to at least $10 billion in funds paid or withdrawn, including 390 liabilities and claims arising from its operations.
The estimated resources have a direct impact on nearly 649 million people worldwide today.
Some of the key initiatives include the UK-based partnership of investors and performers that Power of Nutrition has supported in helping to grow Xenenranni fully by pledging $35 million to Rwanda to help end malnutrition after more than 4,700 tweets from countries around the world.
"With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and citizens, we can make social injustice the first song in history", said Tracy Ullman, ambassador of Power of Nutrition, during a live concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that after more than 5,000 initiatives were taken to improve maternal and child nutrition in the UK, the government announced funding for the Power of Food project, which involves around 5 million women and children through nutrition initiatives.
Answer one of the frequently asked questions on his website, What makes you think we can end poverty forever?
 A global citizen responded by saying, "It's going to be a long and difficult road.  Sometimes we fall and lose.
But like the great civil rights movements that came before us, we will succeed because we are strong together.
Janet Jackson, The Weekend, Sean Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Mona are among the speakers at this year's event in New York City hosted by Deborah-Lee Ferness and Hugh Jackman.
The US Navy could use Russian exports of energy-saving materials for space", the interior minister said.
Washington could rely on the Navy to prevent Russian energy from entering the market, including the Middle East, if necessary, said U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, writes the Washington Examiner.
Zincke argues that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially at the invitation of its legitimate government, is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
"They're in the Middle East because they want to trade in energy, just like they do in Eastern Europe, in Southern Europe", he reportedly said.
And the spokesperson said that there are ways and methods to solve this problem.
"The United States has the ability, with our Navy, to keep the sea lanes open and, if necessary, block them to ensure that their energy does not go to the market".
Zincke was addressing participants at an event organized by the Consumers Energy Alliance, which describes itself as the "voice of the U.S. energy consumer".
He compared Washington's approach to Russia and Iran, and said they were equally effective.
"The economic choice for Iran and Russia is to use and replace fuel with less and less", he said, noting that Russia is a country whose economy depends on oil and has no other resources.
The statement comes as the Trump administration is working on a plan to export liquefied natural gas to Europe and provide cheaper energy to European consumers instead of Russia.
To achieve this, officials in the Trump administration, including US President Donald Trump, are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the "inappropriate" Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says has made Berlin a "captive" of Moscow.
The $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which will increase the current capacity of the pipeline to 110 billion cubic meters, has been repeatedly cited in Moscow as a clean-economy project.
The Kremlin said Washington's fierce opposition to the project was driven by economic reasons and was an example of unfair competition.
After a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak said, "We believe that energy should not be a tool of pressure and that consumers should have the right to choose their suppliers".
Germany, which had confirmed its support for the project, reacted negatively to the US position.
The German Federation of Industries (BDI), the leading industrial organization in Germany, has called on the US to stay out of the EU's energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
After the recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin, the head of the Federation of German Industries (BDI), Dieter Kempf, said, "I have a big problem with third-party interference in our energy supply issues".
A Massachusetts senator says Elizabeth Warren is preparing to run for president in 2020.
Elizabeth Warren, a senator from Massachusetts, said she was preparing hard to run for president after the midterm elections.
At a meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren said that he would consider running.
"It's time for women, including the lady above, to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government", she said, according to The Hill.
"I am preparing hard for the election after November 6th".
During the regional meeting, Warren said that President Donald Trump was "leading the region in the wrong direction".
"I'm really worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy", he said.
Warren has been outspoken about his criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, Warren tweeted that "the FBI should definitely check before we can comment".
But a poll released on Thursday showed that Warren's voters think he should not run in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University Center for Policy Research/Boston Global Poll, "possibly" Massachusetts voters say she should not run.
Thirty-two percent voted in favor of voting.
The poll showed that voters were more likely to support former governor Deval Patrick, with 38 percent voting in favor and 48 percent against.
Other prominent Democrats were also named in the 2020 election debate, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
The Associated Press reports that Biden will make an official decision in January.
Sarah Palin at a rally for Donald Trump, talking about PTSD
After joining the army in September, 26-year-old Treacy Palin spent a year in Iraq.
She was arrested on Monday night and charged with domestic violence
"I can tell you what my son went through, what he went through when he came back, and I can tell you what other families were affected by post-traumatic stress disorder and soldiers who came back wounded", he told a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, against Donald Trump.
Palin said that her son's incarceration was a big problem and shared her thoughts about her son and other veterans, "they come back a little different, they come back strong, and wonder if fellow soldiers, pilots, and every member of the military will be so appreciated for what they did for their country".
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Monday and charged with domestic violence, based on a report by Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, that he had used a weapon in a state of intoxication to commit domestic violence.
18 states and the District of Columbia support a call for a new asylum policy
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have voted in favor of a bill to challenge the new U.S. policy of refusing asylum to victims of domestic violence and flight.
NBC News reported that on Friday in Washington, D.C., representatives from 18 states and counties wrote a letter in support of asylum seekers as "court counsel".
The plaintiff, whose full name is Grace W. Sessions, is suing the American Civil Liberties Union for failure to disclose its August federal policy lawsuit.
She was abused by her boyfriend and her "violent gangster children", but U.S. authorities rejected her asylum application on July 20.
She was arrested in Texas.
Lawyers who supported Grace described El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala, which had the highest number of asylum seekers in the United States, as the countries with the highest rates of gang violence and domestic violence.
The new asylum policy overturned a 2014 decision by the Immigration Appeals Board that allowed undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
In a statement Friday, District of Columbia Attorney General Carl Rassipp said the new policy "ignores decades of government, federal and international law".
"Federal law requires that all asylum applications must take into account the facts or circumstances of the request, and this prohibition is contrary to that principle", the statement said.
Lawyers say that the immigration policy is hurting the U.S. economy because immigrants often do business or "provide the necessary workforce".
In June, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued an order to immigration courts to stop accepting victims of domestic violence or gangs.
"Asylum is available to people who have been discriminated against in their country on the basis of race, religion, national origin, or because of their membership in a particular social group or political opinion", the session said in its July 11 policy statement.
Refugees are not designed to solve all the problems, not all the big problems that people around the world face in their daily lives.
The number of deaths in the forced rescue effort in Palo has doubled
For those who survived, the situation became more and more dangerous.
"The situation is very difficult", says 35-year-old Risa Kusuma, a mother, as she consoles her bereaved son in the evacuation center of devastated Palo City.
"Every minute, the ambulance was bringing bodies.
There's too little clean water".
Residents returned to their ruined homes, searching for their underwater belongings, trying to save at least some of them.
Hundreds were injured, and the 7.5 magnitude earthquake devastated hospitals, leaving no room for any.
Some of the wounded, including Dewey Harris, who had broken his spine and shoulder, were in the Palouse Army Hospital, where the patients were overcrowded, and many were treated in the open air.
He wept as he remembered the earthquake that had struck the fifth floor of the hotel where he was staying with his wife and daughter.
"We had no time to save ourselves.
I feel like I'm stuck in a wall that's falling down", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family is in town for a wedding.
"I heard my wife crying for help, and then I felt better.
I don't know what happened to my wife and daughter.
I pray that they are safe".
US official accuses China of "joking" with "propaganda"
After the official Chinese newspaper in the US ran a four-page weekly advertisement about the mutual benefits of US-China trade, the US ambassador in Beijing accused China of using the US press to spread propaganda.
After the US accused China of interfering in the November 6 congressional elections, which China denies, President Donald Trump last week cited paid supplementary data from the China Daily in Register De Moines, Iowa's largest newspaper seller.
The accusation of Beijing's meddling in the US election is a new phase in the US pressure on China, as US officials told Reuters.
It's common for other countries to promote their products, while Beijing and Washington are in a position to wage a trade war, and as a result, they're imposing uniform tariffs on each other's imports.
Chinese and American experts say that the new tariffs, which China introduced in response to the start of the trade war, are aimed at hurting states like Iowa, which is supportive of Trump's Republican Party.
Terry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China and former governor of Iowa, one of the largest exporters of agricultural products to China, said Beijing has caused massive damage to American workers, farmers, and businesses.
In the Sunday newspaper De Moyne, Branstad said that China "is duplicating this ridicule by advertising in our own Free Press".
"By paying De Moyne for advertising, China is using the American tradition of free speech and a free press to spread its propaganda", writes Branstad.
"And here in Beijing, where there are so few people who think differently, you don't see the contradictions that reflect the true Chinese view of China's peaceful economic direction, because the mass media is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party".
He added, "One of China's leading newspapers refused to publish", without specifying which newspaper.
After the fall of Kavanaugh, Republicans banned women voters from the midterm, analysts warn.
Analysts warn that despite multiple sexual assault allegations, many Republican members are standing aside and supporting Brett Kavanaugh's candidacy for the Supreme Court in the upcoming midterm elections.
The emotions were so strong that many Republican members expressed a desire to continue voting.
"It's a story that cannot be undone", said Grant Richer, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, in an article published in The Hill on Saturday.
Richer said he was not sure that the last-minute investigations by Senator Jeff Flay of Arizona and the Federal Bureau of Investigation were sufficient to crush the voters.
"Women are not ready to forget what happened yesterday, even in November", Karine Jean-Pierre, senior adviser and national representative of the progressive group MoveOn, said Friday, according to the Washington, D.C., newspaper.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming", and members of the Republican Party who led the Judiciary Committee reportedly sang the same song in the corridors of the Senate when they wanted to move forward by elevating Kavanaugh themselves despite instructions from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
"Democratic enthusiasm and motivation are growing beyond normal", says Stu Rottenberg, a political scientist who is not a member of any political party, on a news website.
"People say it's higher than ever, and it's true.
But it can be even higher, especially among women voters in the suburbs and younger voters, 18,29 years old, who don't usually vote for a president even if they don't like him".
Before Ford's public accusation of sexual assault against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts predicted that a retaliatory response could be forthcoming if Republicans presented evidence.
Earlier last week, according to NBC News, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Steele, said, "It's been a chaotic and chaotic process for the Republican Party".
"It's not just about the primary or the final vote or whether Kavanaugh will be prosecuted, it's about how Republicans are dealing with it and how they're responding", said Guy Cecil, director of Priorities USA, a group that helped elect Democrats.
Nevertheless, after the testimonies of Ford and Kavanaugh, Americans are divided into two groups about who to believe, with just over half backing Kavanaugh.
According to a recent YouGov survey, 41 percent of respondents believe Ford's testimony is either true or false, and 35 percent believe Kavanaugh's testimony is true or false.
Meanwhile, 38 percent said that Kavanaugh was either implicitly or explicitly deceived in his presentation, and another 30 percent said that Ford was deceived.
Following Flake's attack, the FBI reported to The Guardian that Ford and at least one other prosecutor were investigating the killing of Deborah Ramirez.
Last week, Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Kavanaugh assaulted her when she was 17 years old, while he was drunk.
Ramirez said that a Supreme Court nominee showed him her genitals at a party in the 1980s while he was a student at Yale.
The man who invented the World Wide Web is going to create a new Internet for Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is about to start a startup that will compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project from the tech legend is called Inrupt, a company based on the open platform Berners-Lee Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where their data is stored and which people have access to it.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee joked that Inrupt's goal is "global dominance".
"We have to do it now", he said about the startup.
"This is a historic moment".
The app uses Solid technology, which allows people to create their own "personal online data storage" or POD.
It contains a contact list, a to-do list, a diary, a music library, and other personal and professional tools.
It's like Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack, and Spotify all being available in one browser at the same time.
The uniqueness of private online storage is that it is completely dependent on the user who has access to the information.
The company called it "personalization of rights and access through credits".
According to CEO John Bruce, the main goal of Inrupt is to provide the resources, processes and expertise to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company now includes a security platform that was acquired through Berners-Lee, Bruce, IBM, and a group of full-time programmers and volunteer programmers who were contracted to work on the project.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world can build their own decentralized apps using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team "didn't talk to Facebook and Google about introducing things that would change their business models instantly.
"We didn't ask their permission".
In a statement on Medium on Saturday, Berners-Lee wrote that Inrupt's "mission is to provide commercial energy and ecosystems to help protect the integrity and quality of the new grid built at Solid".
In 1994, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by founding the World Wide Web Consortium at MIT.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a powerful voice in the debate over net neutrality.
After launching Inrupt, Berners-Lee remained the founder and CEO of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Foundation, and the Open Source Institute.
"I am very optimistic about this next era of the Internet", Berners-Lee added.
Bernard Vann: A Saint Victoria ' s Cross worshiper during World War I
The only pope in the Church of England who fought in World War I and won the Victoria Cross, and this was the first time in 100 years that it had been commemorated in his city.
The honorable Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann was awarded the award for the attack on Belenglish and Leucur on 29 September 1918.
But he did not know that he had been awarded Britain's highest military decoration four days later, when he was shot by a sniper.
On Saturday, a memorial stone was presented to two of their grandchildren during a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire.
One of his grandchildren, Michael Vann, said that the discovery, exactly 100 years after his great-grandfather was honored, made it "a real symbol".
On September 29, 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion through the Saint-Canthe Canal "in a fog and rain of field guns and machine guns", reports The London Gazette.
Then he turned on the shells, "bravely" leading his troops forward, single-handedly throwing a field gun, and destroying three detachments.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4, 1918, about a month before the start of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, said of his grandfather's act: "I could not do such a thing, and it was a disgrace".
He and his uncle, Dr. James Vann, conducted the Brentwood Imperial Youth Orchestra, and they placed flowers after the parade.
Michael Vann added: "It is a great honor to be in the parade" and "the support of so many people proves that my grandfather is a true hero".
MMA fans stayed up all night waiting for Bellator 206, but instead they watched a cartoon of Peppa the Torpedo.
Imagine staying up all night to watch Bellator 206, but this long-awaited event is not shown.
The San Jose match had 13 matches, including six on the main map, and the match was broadcast live on Channel 5 throughout the UK.
At 6 a.m., Haggard Musashi and Rory McDonald were getting ready to meet each other, and the British audience was shocked to see Toropy Peppa on the screen.
The people who waited until dawn to see the battle felt bad.
One Twitter fan called the transformation of the children's program into a cartoon "a sick joke".
"The state decreed that 6 a.m. was not the right time to show this content, so we had to switch to a children's program", Dave Schwartz, senior vice president of marketing and communications at Bellator, said in response to a question about the promotion.
"'Is that Peppa, yeah?'"
Scott Coker, president of Bellator, said that they're planning to create a schedule to add the audience to the network in the future.
"I think we can probably solve this problem when we play the next game", Coker said.
"But it's Saturday morning, and we can't do it until Sunday, and it's only Monday.
But we're working on it.
And believe me, when it was translated, there were a lot of texts that went back and forth, and not all of them were pleasant.
We tried to fix it, thinking it was a technical malfunction.
But it wasn't, it was a state problem.
Trust me, this will not happen again.
We're going to do five fights instead of the usual six fights, and we tried to do it for the fans, but it didn't work.
This is not the case".
The Desert Island Disc: Tom Daly feels sexually "not cool"
Olympic diver Tom Daly felt bad about his sexuality, but it motivated him to succeed.
I was 24 years old and did not realize that "everyone is not like me" until I was in high school.
Speaking at the premiere of Radio 4's Desert Island, hosted by Lauren LaVern, she said that they shared ideas about gay rights to give people "hope".
He also said that after becoming a father, he had stopped thinking about winning the Olympics.
Christie Young, the longtime host of the show, took a few months off due to illness.
Daly, who starred in LaVern's program, said that she felt "relatively incomplete" because "love of children and girls is socially unacceptable".
She said: "Until that day, the feeling of being incomplete and different was real, and it gave me the strength to succeed".
She said that she wanted to prove that she was "something", because she thought that if people knew she was sexual, they would support her.
A two-time Olympic bronze medallist and a prominent LGBT activist, she used her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality.
She said that she felt successful because she lived a life that was open and without consequences, and she wanted to give others "hope".
American director Dustin Lance, who met the three-time world champion in 2013, described my falling in love with Black as "a surprise".
Last year, Daley married an Oscar winner 20 years her senior, but she said that age difference was never a problem.
"So many hardships at such a young age" -- who went to her first Olympics at 14 and her father died of cancer three years later -- she says it's hard to find someone at that age who has experienced so much good and hardship.
In June, the couple became the parents of Robert Ray Black-Daley, who said that "my whole outlook" changed.
"If you asked me last year, I would have said, 'I just want to win the gold medal.'"
"You know, there are things more important than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
Robert was named after his father, who died of brain cancer in 2011 at the age of 40.
Daly said that he had not accepted that his father was dying, and one of his last words was about the London 2012 match, when he asked him if he had tickets and wanted to sit in the front row.
"I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you're not sitting in the front row.'"
"I held his hand when he couldn't breathe, and when he couldn't breathe at all, and when he went to the other side, I finally knew he was invincible".
The next year, 2012, she competed in the Olympics and won a bronze medal.
"To dress in front of my people at the Olympics was something I'd wanted to do all my life, because it was the most beautiful feeling I've ever had", she said.
And it inspired him to choose the first song, Proud by Heather Small, which inspired him during the Olympics and still moves his body.
The discs on Desert Island are streamed on BBC Radio 4 on Saturdays at 11:15 (London time).
Mickelson lost his form on Saturday at the Ryder Cup
Phil Mickelson of the United States set a new record in the 47th Ryder Cup game on Sunday, but he needed to get in shape to stay in the game.
Mickelson was in his 12th year of the biennial tournament, and in Saturday's game, captain Jim Furyk put him on the bench.
The five-time winner, who is always the center of attention in America, spent the day as a fan and working on the game on the field in an effort to correct his mistakes.
Even at the peak of his career, a 48-year-old driver who hadn't driven relatively straight for drivers couldn't have done so well on the long-range Le Golf National.
Although the track itself is not so dangerous, on Sunday Mikelson will face British Open champion Francesco Molinari in his ninth match, who has teamed up with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four matches this week.
If the Americans, who have scored four times in 12 singles matches, start the game well, Michelson's game could be decisive.
Furyk said that he trusted the man, and he said nothing more.
"He understood his role today, so he patted me on the shoulder, hugged me, and said I'd be ready tomorrow".
"She's very confident.
He's a Hall of Famer himself, and he's done a lot of work on these teams before and this week.
I never saw him play two matches.
I had a lot of imagination, but that's what happened, and that's what we thought we should do.
He wants to be there, just like everyone else".
Mickelson surpassed Nick Faldo's record for most Ryder Cup matches played on Sunday.
This could have meant the end of his Ryder Cup career, which never matched his personal records.
According to Furyck, Mikelson's presence brought immaterial assets to the tribe, and Mikelson finished with 18 wins, 20 losses, and 7 draws.
"He's funny, he loves to joke, he's smart, he likes to make fun of people, and he can be a great member of any tribe".
"The young players were very excited to see him play that week, and it was really fun.
It was more than just a game".
European captain Thomas Bjorn realizes that the ultimate advantage may soon be lost
European captain Thomas Bjorn knows from his own experience that leading on the final day of the Ryder Cup doesn't guarantee victory.
In 1997, a Danish player played his first match in Valderram, where the side captained by Seve Ballesteros scored five points ahead of the Americans, but tied the score at 141⁄2-131⁄2 in the final game, winning by one point.
"You keep telling yourself that we're dominating in Valderram, we're dominating in Brooklyn, but we lost in Brooklyn, and we lost in Valderram, and it was fair", Bjorn said after watching the 2018 5-3 Friday night and the 10-6 Le Golf National.
So history shows me and my team that this is not the end.
Tomorrow you will leave.
Go and do as he tells you.
It's not over until the score is on the board.
We have a goal, and it's to win the prize, so we have to keep the focus on the game.
I put my trust in the 12 players who played for us, but we all know who was on the other side -- they were the best players in the world".
Bjorn, who admired the way his players played on the golf course, said: "I could never lose to myself.
Tomorrow is another day.
Tomorrow's game is all about playing by yourself, and that's something else.
It's nice to play when everything is good around your product, but when you're alone, you're completely disqualified as a golfer.
Playing as fully as possible should be the main message that gets stuck in the minds of the players.
Now you're going to be out all the time, and she's going to have to go out and do her best".
Unlike Björn, his rival Jim Furyk is looking for other players who are better than the team players to play solo, and Jordan Spitzer, who scored three points in four, is not a replacement for Justin Thomas.
Furyk himself was involved in both of the events of the last days: he was part of the winning team in Brooklyn before the Europeans lost the "Miracle at Medina" once and for all.
"I remember every accusation that was made against him", said Ben Crenshaw in 1999, when asked how he had gathered his gang members on his last day.
"Tomorrow we have 12 important matches, but you want us to start quickly, as you saw in Brooklyn and Medina.
When the momentum is one-sided, it puts a lot of emphasis on the midfield matches.
And we've been preparing our team, and we've been giving the players the inspiration that they need to feel like they're trying to do something magical tomorrow".
Thomas was given the control of the match and played against Rory McIlrath in the main match, and in the first half against Justin Rose, John Ram, Tommy Fleetwood, Ian Poulter and other European players.
Bjorn said about the way he selected individual players, "I started with this group of players in exactly this order, because this order will cover every dangerous moment in this game".
A new German battleship is delayed again
The new German fleet frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging Cold War fleet, but due to system failures and related problems, it will not be commissioned the following year, local media reported.
According to the military spokesman Die Zeit, the commissioning of the new Baden-Württemberg-class frigate flagship Rhineland-Palatinate was delayed until the first quarter of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to join the fleet in 2014, but the severe consequences of the delivery complicated the fate of the ambitious project.
The four Baden-Württemberg-class frigates commissioned by the Navy in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen-class frigates.
They have powerful armour, many anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, and invisible technologies such as miniaturized radar, infrared, and acoustic signatures.
Other important features include an even longer service life. The new frigates should be able to operate away from their home port for up to two years.
According to Die Zeit, the constant seizures would make the modern warships that would help Germany establish its power abroad obsolete by the time they were commissioned.
The unsuccessful frigate F125 made headlines last year when the German Navy officially refused to put the ship into service and returned it to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had ever returned a ship to a shipbuilder.
The reasons for the withdrawal are not well known, but the German media has warned that if the ship was used in combat, its crucial "software and hardware flaws" would render it useless.
The software flaws are particularly significant because the Baden-Württemberg class ships are operated by 120 workers - twice the number of crews that operated the Bremen class.
The ship's weight also reduced its productivity, and the Navy could not improve it in the future.
The 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is said to be twice as heavy as the German ships of the same class used in World War II.
In addition to the hardware failure, the overall project cost is high, and training the team is a big challenge.
The total cost was a staggering 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), but it was originally estimated to be $2.2 billion.
Recent warnings about the reduction of the German Navy have made the introduction of new frigates critical.
Earlier this year, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, admitted that the navy was "considerably outnumbered".
According to the official, the old ships were being scrapped but not replaced by new ones, so the situation is getting worse with time.
Sadly, no more Baden-Württemberg-class ships were ever commissioned.
The National Trust is monitoring the privacy of cockroaches
A recent study in Scotland shows how cockroaches use the landscape to search for food.
The researchers hope that the findings will help them to learn more about the behavior of these unique flying mammals and to help with future conservation efforts.
The study, conducted by researchers at the National Trust for Scotland, examined the common and soprano pipistrels, as well as the brown, long-haired gargantuan and dobbentonian in the Inverwe Gardens of West Riding.
Special recorders are installed in the main areas around the hotel to monitor the movement of the frogs throughout the season.
National Health Service workers and volunteers also use hand-held cell phone scanners.
An expert voice analysis of all the recordings analyzes the frequency of the call of the beetles and determines which species are making the call.
Map and report their habitat to create a detailed picture of their behavior at the landscape level.
Rob Dewar, a conservation consultant at the National Testing Service (NTS), hopes that the results will reveal which habitats are most important to the frogs and how each species uses those habitats.
This information can help to determine the priorities of environmental management, such as how to create grasslands and conserve forest masses for grasshoppers and similar species.
In Scotland and Great Britain, the number of cockroaches has declined over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development, which has led to environmental damage and loss of their livelihoods.
Chemical cleaning of paper and building materials, as well as wind turbines, lighting, and animal attacks can pose a threat.
The lizards are not blind.
But because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when they catch prey.
To avoid getting lost and hitting objects while flying, they use sophisticated echo-location techniques.
The National Inspection Service, which is responsible for the care of 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land throughout the country, takes the problem of cockroaches very seriously.
It is staffed by ten trained experts who conduct frequent surveys, survey the fields, and in some cases, rescue animals.
The organisation has set up the first and only conservation area for Scottish grasshoppers at Trive Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, where eight of the ten species of Scottish grasshoppers live.
David Thompson, a real estate manager, said that the area was ideal for mosquitoes.
"We have a great area for cockroaches in Trive", he said.
"We have old buildings, old gardens, and a perfect environment for them to live in.
But there is still much unknown about the beetles, and our work in these and other areas will help us to understand what is needed to replicate them".
She also mentioned the need to check for cockroaches before any repairs are made to the property, since the destruction of one or more of the nurseries could result in the death of up to 400 female and young cockroaches, and could lead to the extinction of the local population.
It is illegal to kill, abuse, harass or violate protected habitats.
Elizabeth Ferrell, of the Scottish Lark Conservation Society, called on the community to help.
He added: "We still don't know much about our larvae, and we don't know how many species survive".
Ronal's rape claim was rejected because the lawyers were suing the German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape charges against him "fake news" and said people were using his name to "make themselves known".
His lawyers are suing the German news outlet Der Spiegel, which has been accused of the crime.
The Portuguese and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman, Catherine Majorga, in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009.
Der Spiegel reported on Saturday that she had paid $375,000 to keep quiet.
Hours after the allegations were announced, 33-year-old Cristiano Ronaldo described the news as "fake news" in a live video on Instagram to an audience of 142 million.
"No, no, no, no, no. I was like, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What they're saying today is fake news", the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
"They want to be called by my name.
This is normal.
They want to be known by my name, but that's part of my job.
I'm a happy man, and everything is fine".
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are suing Der Spiegel for "infringing privacy by making a life-saving statement".
Christian Schertz, an attorney, said the player "may be one of the most serious violations of privacy in recent years and will be required to pay compensation for moral damages equivalent to the difficulty of a breach of the peace".
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a room at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
According to documents filed in Clark County Court in Nevada, after meeting at a nightclub, Ronald and Majorga returned to the player's room, where the player allegedly raped her anal.
According to Majorga, Ronaldo got down on his knees after the incident and said that I was "99 percent" a "good guy", but the "one percent" was dominant.
The documents claimed that Ronald had had sexual relations with the girl, but that both parties agreed.
The major then went to the police and photographed his wounds, but then, "out of fear of reprisal" and "public humiliation", agreed to an out-of-court settlement.
The 34-year-old woman said she wanted to overturn the settlement because the alleged incident was still traumatizing her.
Ronaldo was about to leave Manchester United for Real Madrid at the time of the alleged rape, and this summer he joined Italian giant Juventus for €100 million.
Brexit: If Britain loses its car industry, it will regret it forever
Business Secretary Greg Clark said that if Britain loses its global automotive leadership after Brexit, "it will regret it forever".
Toyota's UK headquarters told the BBC that if the UK did not withdraw from the EU without signing the deal, it would stop production at its Bernaston plant near Derby.
"We need this contract", said Mr. Clark.
A Japanese carmaker said that if no action is taken after Brexit, there could be job losses due to border arrests.
Burnaston, the factory that makes the Toyota Auris and Avensis, produced almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to the rest of Europe.
"I think if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, we'll stop production at our factory", said the Toyota executive in Burnston.
Other manufacturers in the UK have expressed concern about how they will sell their products across borders if Britain leaves the EU without a deal, including Honda, BMW, Jaguar Land Rover and others.
For example, a month after leaving Brexit, BMW announced that it would close its factory in Oxford.
Carmakers fear that a no-deal Brexit could have a negative impact on their supply chains.
Toyota's production line is "on time" and every 37 minutes, the vehicles are built using parts from both the U and UE.
If the UK leaves the EU on March 29 without a deal, the border parts could be blocked and the overall production affected.
Toyota's Derbyshire parts supply is limited to one day, and production will be halted after that, the company said.
According to Mr. Clark, Theresa May Shakers' future relationship with the EU was "carefully regulated and would not allow any border arrests".
"We need this deal. We want to make a great deal that not only helps us succeed at this moment, but helps us seize this opportunity", he said on BBC Radio 4 today.
"Not just Toyota, but all manufacturers, we need to continue to build a successful supply chain".
Toyota couldn't say how long production would stop, but said that in the long run, the rising costs would reduce the factory's competitive advantage and lead to fewer jobs.
Peter Tsvallaris, a union organizer who has worked in Bernaston for 24 years, said that the frustration of the union members is growing day by day: "My experience is that once these workers leave, they never come back.
A government spokesman said: "We have given them a clear and precise plan for our future relationship with the EU".
The White House says Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be postponed
Donald Trump's meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein may be "postponed to another week", as Brett Kavanaugh's bid for the Supreme Court continues, he said in a statement to the White House on Sunday.
Rosenstein oversees the work of special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump and Russian aides, and future obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether Trump's firing of the deputy CEO would threaten Mueller's independence has been a source of rumors in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had wiretapped Trump and discussed the possibility of removing him from the presidency under the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein rejected the message.
But he went to the White House last week despite reports of his firing.
Instead, it was announced that Trump would meet with him this Saturday at the UN in New York.
Trump said he would "preferably" not fire Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee, because both Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, who accused him of sexual assault, gave instructions at the hearing.
On Friday, Trump ordered the FBI to investigate the allegations against Kavanaugh, which delayed the Senate vote even further.
Trump's press secretary, Sarah Sanders, was on Fox News Sunday.
He said of the meeting with Rosenstein: "We have not set a date, but it may be this week, and it may be postponed for a week because of the proceedings in the Supreme Court.
But we're still going to see it, and we're going to be in touch with the press".
Some reporters disagree with this report: Sanders has not held a White House briefing since September 10.
The presenter, Chris Wallace, asked why.
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not because TV reporters disliked "the over-the-top reporting", but he added: "I can't say that they didn't over-the-top reporting".
He then suggested that Trump and the press be given more direct contact.
"The president has more Q&A sessions than any of his colleagues before him", he said, without any evidence.
Sanders briefings are the same as before, but "if the press has the opportunity to ask the president of the United States directly, it would be better than talking to me.
We do this often, and you've seen us do it many times over the last few weeks, and these events will replace the press briefings that allow me to talk to the president of the United States".
Trump is always answering questions when he leaves the White House or attends public hearings or press conferences with people in high office.
Press conferences for one person are rare.
This week in New York, the president seems to have shown why he might be able to create a disgusting and shocking image in the press.
Health Minister sends letter to EU staff at NHS Scotland about concerns over Brexit
The Secretary of Health wrote to the National Health Service in Scotland expressing the country's gratitude to EU workers and expressing its wish to remain independent after Brexit.
Jean Freeman, a member of the Scottish Parliament, wrote a letter six months before the EU left.
The Scottish government has agreed to pay the costs of their civil servants' transition to EU citizenship.
In her letter, Mrs. Freeman wrote: "The negotiations between the EU and the UN continued throughout the summer, leading to a decision expected this autumn.
But the U.N. government is also preparing for a non-deal scenario.
I know this is going to be a difficult time for all of us.
I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contributions of all the workers, regardless of their nationality.
UE and our colleagues beyond strengthen healthcare, provide valuable expertise and skills that improve the quality of their work and benefit the patients and communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we're very happy to have you here".
Christy Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery after a head injury
Michael Organ: Christie Abercrombie of the Tennessee State Tigers suffered a head injury that required emergency surgery after Saturday's 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Tennessee head coach Rod Reed told reporters that his injury was premature.
"He went out on the side of the road and fell down", Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff put Abercrombie in a crate, put him on the sidelines, and gave him oxygen until he could be evaluated.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had not had surgery at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that there is "no information on the type/degree of injury" and that the state of Tennessee is trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a red-shirt sophomore, is playing his first season in Tennessee after transferring from Illinois.
He scored five points before the game on Saturday, and 18 points in total this season.
Foreign buyers are taxed more when they buy real estate from the U.S.
Tory's new plan is to collect a stamp from foreign buyers when they buy real estate from the U.S. and use that money to help the homeless.
This move will negate Corbyn 's efforts to attract young voters
Increased stamp duty will be charged to non-taxpayers in the UAE
According to the Treasury , the event will raise up to 120 million pounds to help homeless people .
Foreign buyers who buy real estate from the U.S. will pay more for the security deposit, and that excess money will go to the homeless, Theresa May said.
This was seen as an attempt by Jeremy Corbyn to reverse his success in providing young voters with cheaper housing and then attracting more income.
The higher stamps are collected from individuals and companies who do not pay taxes in the U.S., and the excess funds go to the government's efforts to help those who are sleeping in the door.
The current mortgage, including the two-year second and rental house, will be increased by a total of three percent.
The Treasury hopes to increase its revenue by 120 million pounds a year.
Approximately 13 percent of new homes built in London are purchased by non-EU residents, which leads to inflation and makes it harder for first-time homebuyers.
Many areas of the country, especially the capital, have become "crowded cities", as many foreign buyers live outside the country and visit occasionally.
The new policy came after Boris Johnson proposed lower mortgage payments to make it easier for young people to buy their first home.
He accused the large construction companies of taking up land and over-holding the number of properties and suggested that Mrs. May remove quotas on affordable housing to end Britain's "housing stigma".
Mr. Corbyn announced a series of great housing reforms, including controlling rent and preventing wrongful evictions.
He also wants to give the councils more authority to build new houses.
Mrs. May said, "This year, I want to dedicate my premiership to restoring the British dream of a better life for every generation.
And that means fixing the broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to people who want to live, work and make a living here.
But it's not right for people and companies who don't live in the UK to buy houses on the same terms as hardworking British citizens.
For many, a home is an impossible dream, and for those who live in a house, it is a very difficult dream".
Jack Ross: "My ultimate goal is to rule Scotland".
Jack Ross, the manager of Sunderland, said that his "top goal" was to be the manager of Scotland in some way.
The 42-year-old Scot is currently enjoying a third-place effort to rebuild the North-East club, three points behind the top-flight side in the Premier League.
He managed the Scottish Premier League last summer, and this summer he moved to the Lightning Stadium.
"I wanted to play for my country.
I took the B cap and that was it", Ross told BBC Sportsound in Scotland.
"As a child, my father and I traveled frequently from Hamden to Scotland, and I was always attracted to that place.
But I'm only going to be able to do that if I manage the club".
Before Ross, the rulers of Sunderland were Dick the Lawyer, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keene, Gus Poyet, and Paulo Di Canio.
The former manager of Alloa Athletic is happy to have taken over such a big club after having previously turned down offers from Burnsley and Ipswich Town.
"If I can bring this club back to the Premier League, that's a success for me.
"Given the structure and potential of this club, it should definitely be in the Premier League", he said.
"It's not easy to get him back in the league, but I feel successful only when I get the club back in the league".
Ross has only been in management for three years, and was previously an assistant manager at Dumbarton and the Bears for 15 months on the coaching staff.
He then led Alloa to promotion to the third tier, and won the championship the following season, when Saint-Miren was relegated.
Ross now feels better than he has ever felt in his playing career with Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
"I think it's a set of nine real paths", he said, remembering that he was taking responsibility to God.
"I was convinced that management was better for me than gambling.
It sounds strange, because I was good at it, and I made good money and enjoyed it.
But it can be difficult to play.
I have a lot to do each week.
I still have stress and pressure at work, but I'm still managing.
I've always wanted to lead, and I'm doing it, and I'm lucky to be in my own skin when I'm an adult".
The full interview can be heard on Sportsound on Scottish Radio on Saturday 30th September from 12:00 to 13:00 London time.
The best time to drink a pint is 5:30 p.m., according to the polls.
The hot summer has boosted sales in British pubs, but it's been a tough time for restaurants.
The statistics show that pubs and bars increased their sales by 2.7 percent, while restaurants declined by 4.8 percent.
Peter Martin, a spokesman for the CGA, a business consultancy that compiled the statistics, said: "The good weather and England's longer-than-expected World Cup run mean pub sales rose 2.8 percent in July, while restaurant sales fell even further.
In June, the restaurant rate dropped 1.8 percent, and in July it was even worse.
When we compare the numbers of bars and pubs that drink heavily, we find that the number of people in pubs is almost as high as the number of customers in restaurants.
Food bars have also declined, but not restaurants.
I think people just wanted to drink.
"Alcohol sales in pubs and bars increased by 6.6 percent, and food sales grew by 3 percent".
Paul Newman, a leisure and hospitality analyst at RSM, said: "These results are continuing the trend that has been going on since the end of April.
When it comes to sales in the foreign market, the weather and the main social and sporting events are the main factors.
It's not surprising that restaurant groups continue to struggle, but a 4.8 percent drop in sales could be the biggest hit in the year overall due to continued price pressure.
The long summer was a bad time for hot food operators, and the cold weather in August would bring the long-awaited break.
Pubs and restaurants, including newly opened locations, saw sales increase by 2.7 percent in July, slowing the opening of new locations.
The Coffer Peach Tracker is a popular reference in the industry for collecting and analyzing the data of 47 working groups with a total turnover of £9 billion for pubs, bars and restaurants in the UK.
One in five children has a social media account that is hidden from their parents
Surveys show that one in five children (some as young as 11 years old) have a social media account that they hide from their parents
A survey of 20,000 high school students showed a rise in fake Instagram accounts
This news threatens to be sexually explicit.
Twenty percent of the students said they had a "basic" account to show their parents.
One in five children (including 11-year-olds) have a social media account that they hide from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a rapid increase in fake Instagram accounts on the photo-sharing app Instagram.
This news has raised fears that sexual content is being published.
Twenty percent of the students have a "basic" account to show their parents, and they have a personal account to add to it.
A mother who discovered the secret account of her 13-year-old daughter saw a message from a teenager calling for "me to be raped".
Digital Awareness UK and the Independent Schools Headmasters' Conference said that 40 percent of teenagers aged 11-18 had a secret account and that their race had acknowledged it.
Mike Buchanan, director of HMC, says: "It's alarming that so many teenagers want to create online spaces that parents and teachers can't find".
Eileen Doyle is the "voice of the athlete" on the Scottish athletics board
At the annual general meeting of the governing body, Elid Doyle was elected to the Scottish Athletics Board of Directors as a non-executive director.
The chairman of the board, Jan Beatty, described the move as the biggest international opportunity for sports managers in the last decade.
"Ayled is highly respected in the Scottish, British and world athletic communities, and we believe that athletics in Scotland will be of great benefit to him", says Beatty.
Doyle said, "I'm an inspiration to athletes, and I hope to help shape the future of sport in Scotland".
The American athlete who won gold medals in the 200 and 400 meters at the 1996 Atlanta Games, and who has won four Olympic gold medals in total, and who now works as a simple scientist for the BBC, has been left unable to walk after suffering from ischemic stroke.
She tweeted: "On this day a month ago, I had a stroke.
I could not walk.
The doctors told me that only time would tell if I would recover and how much.
It was a very hard task, but I recovered completely, and I learned to walk again, and today I'm doing the walking exercises!
Thank you for your encouraging comments!"
Online views on a commercial for milkshakes that liken mothers to cows are divided
Online consumers were divided by an advertisement from the company that made the milk pump, which compared nursing mothers to dairy cows.
To celebrate the launch of the "world's first silent breast pump", Elvie, a consumer technology company, released a music-driven promotional video to showcase the freedom that the pump gives mothers.
Four mothers dancing in the yard of grass to the following: "Yes, I'm beating, but I don't have tails", and "If you didn't notice that a cow doesn't have a breast, these are my breasts".
The chorus goes on, "I'm just going to suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck, suck
However, the ad on the company's Facebook page caused controversy online.
The video has been viewed 77,000 times, garnered hundreds of comments, and received mixed reactions from viewers, many of whom have also spoken out about the "dangers" of the dairy industry.
"It's a terrible decision to use products in this ad.
Like us, they must be pregnant and give birth to produce milk, but when they do, they steal their babies".
Elvie ' s milkmaid is submerged under her milkman ' s underwear
Another commented: "It is understandable that it is traumatic for both mother and child.
But why should they be used to advertise a milk pump for mothers who leave their babies alone?"
Another added: "It's so far from reality".
Others defended the ad, and one woman wrote that the song was "funny".
"I think it's a great idea.
If I were still breast-feeding, I would buy one.
I felt like a cow while I was sucking the milk.
The ad was a little crazy, but I bought it on purpose.
It's a brilliant product". Another user wrote .
Another commented, "This is a ridiculous ad for mothers who feel 'off' at work and in the bathroom".
This is not a promotion of the dairy industry or a critique of it".
At the end of the video, all the women in the group showed unidentified plugs in their underwear.
The idea behind the campaign was that many women who breast-feed feel like cows.
But the Elvie Pump is silent, has no wires or tubes, is hidden in the breastfeeding underwear, and allows women to move around, hold their babies, and go outside during the breastfeeding.
Ana Ballarin, a partner at Mother and an expert in early childhood development, said, "Elvie Pump is such an innovative product that it deserves a decisive and provocative marketing.
When we looked for similarities between the needs of women and cows, we wanted to bring breastfeeding and its problems to the public in a fun way that would bring out the incredible freedom that it offers and that would be absorbing.
This is not the first time Elvie has been featured in a commercial.
At London Fashion Week, a designer named Martha Yakubowski, a mother of two, took the stage for a product.
Hundreds of migrant children are being gradually relocated to a Texas border barracks
While the number of people crossing the border in one month remained the same, the number of migrant children detained increased rapidly, partly due to the harsh declarations and policies introduced by the Trump administration that made it harder for people and children to cross the border.
Most of the survivors were undocumented immigrants, and they feared that they would lose their right to stay in the country if they went ahead and demanded their children.
The risk increased in June when the federal government announced that prospective policyholders and other adults in their families would be required to submit fingerprints, which would be given to immigration authorities.
Last week, Matthew Albenz, a career Immigration and Customs Enforcement official, told Congress that he had arrested dozens of people who had filed a petition to bail unaccompanied children.
Later, the agency found that 70% of those arrested had never committed a crime.
"About 80% of the people they have guaranteed or their family members are in the country illegally, and most of them are criminals.
So we kept chasing them".
To ensure that the children's cases are reviewed more frequently, officials have introduced new rules that require some children to appear in court within a month of being arrested, as opposed to 60 days earlier, officials at the shelter said.
Most of them do not appear in person to defend their case before an immigration court, but instead do so via video conference.
Those deemed ineligible for support are immediately deported.
In recent months, asylum officials have reported that the longer children are held, the more anxious and depressed they become, leading to violence and attempts to escape.
These problems are common in larger places like Tornillo, where there are so many children that their problems are ignored.
Moving children to a rooming house without emotional preparation and the opportunity to say goodbye to their friends is even more traumatic.
Syria calls for "strengthening forces" from the US, France and Turkey to withdraw immediately
In his address to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Muwalem called on refugees to return to their homes after eight years of war.
He also said that foreign forces are operating on Syrian soil under the pretext of fighting terrorism illegally and are "under investigation".
"They must be eliminated immediately and unconditionally", he told the crowd.
Muallem testified that the "war on terror" in Syria is almost over, with more than 360,000 people killed and millions displaced since 2011.
He said Damascus "will continue this holy war until the territory of Syria is completely cleansed". We must cleanse the region of terrorist groups and "all illegal aliens".
The United States has about 2,000 troops in Syria, most of them training and advising the Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are opposed to President Bashar Assad.
France has over 1,000 troops in the war-torn country.
On the issue of refugees, Moualem accused "some Western countries" of creating favorable conditions for refugees to return but of encouraging refugees to stay abroad by "spreading an unreasonable fear".
"We are calling on the international community and international humanitarian organizations to help ensure their return", he said.
"They're politicizing what would be a real humanitarian issue".
The United States and the European Union have warned that they will not help Syria rebuild until there is a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
According to UN diplomats, the agreement on the creation of a buffer zone between Russia and Turkey in the last rebel-held area of Idlib has opened the way for further political talks.
The Russian-Turkish agreement helped stop a major offensive by Russian-backed Syrian forces on a region of three million people.
Muhalem expressed his belief that the agreement was "limited in time" and that military action against al-Qaeda-linked militants in the Nusra Front, as well as jihadists, would be "completely eliminated".
UN Special Representative De Mistura hopes to hold the first meeting of a new committee of state and opposition members soon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and open the way for elections.
Mu'alem warned that the work of the panel on the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee was limited to "reviewing the articles of the current constitution" and that it was against interference.
Why Trump is winning a second term
And so, by that logic, Mr. Trump could win re-election in 2020 if he doesn't end his presidency early with impeachment and the riots that many liberals hope for.
This would definitely be "the most dramatic end to a presidency in history".
At this point, there are no signs of people getting tired.
Since 2014, his prime-time government time ratings have almost doubled to 1.05 million on CNN, and tripled to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
Fox News has grown from 1.7 million viewers four years ago to 2.4 million, according to Nielsen, and MSNBC's "Rachel Maddow Show" has topped the ratings with 3.5 million viewers on prime time.
"It's not something we understand, and these people are being set on fire", said Neil Barr, host of ABC's "Dedicated Survivors", about the Cabinet Secretary who became president after the Capitol attack.

The chaos is also fun.
Of course, unlike anything else on television, the news from Washington could determine the future of the Royd-Wade controversy, and whether immigrant families can reunite and whether the global economy can recover.
Delete  is something that is only possible for privileged viewers.
But when experts listen for six hours to Bob Woodward's use of "deep-ground" for the cover of his book "Fear", Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich-skin jacket (a "proudly flat-lined suit", according to the Washington Post), and Storm Daniels' dramatic portrayal of Trump's anatomy, the public knows that these are extremes.
For example, I'll never see Super Mario the same way I used to.
Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of "Pawn Stars", said about the frequent cast changes and daily storylines of Trump's show, "You know it's a reality show because it's trying to be different every night".
If you miss an episode, you're left behind.
When I visited Mr. Fleiss this week, it was a beautiful 80 degrees outside his house on the north shore of Kaua'i, but he was sitting inside watching MSNBC while CNN was recording.
He also couldn't get away from Brett Kavanaugh, who was meeting with the Senate Judiciary Committee, and the future of the Supreme Court was uncertain.

Foreign funds are pouring into the race for the presidential elections
Not surprisingly, after the redistricting of Congress, when two strong candidates had to fight for a seat, much money flowed into Pennsylvania's 17th District.
This is the case for the recently reorganized Pittsburgh suburban Democratic Party representative Conor Lamb, who won the seat in a special election last summer.
Lamb is voting against another Republican congressman, Keith Rothfuss, who represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania, and is on a par with the new 17th district.
The map was redrawn in January when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the old territories had been wrongfully transferred to the Republican Party in violation of the Constitution.
The race for the new 17th district has reduced the funding of the Democratic Campaign Committee and the Republican National Committee.
Lamb became a household name after winning a public vote in Pennsylvania's 18th Congressional District in March.
The seat had been held by a Republican for over a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district by more than 20 votes.
Political experts have given Democrats a slight preference.
The US reimposes sanctions on El Salvador for its support of China
Diplomats said that the Dominican Republic and Panama recognized Beijing, but Washington resisted.
Mr. Trump had a warm meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varella in June 2017, and he owned a hotel in Panama before his associates kicked out the ruling faction of the Trump Organization.
After the "nearly unrecognized decision" to recognize Taiwan, State Department officials decided to recall the heads of the U.S. diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama, Department spokesman Heather Nauert said earlier this month.
But sanctions were only imposed on El Salvador, which received $140 million in US aid in 2017 for drug control, development and economic support, among other purposes.
The proposed sanctions, which would restrict financial aid and visa, would have been very damaging to the Central American country, which has high unemployment and murder rates.
While internal meetings were going on, North and Central American officials postponed a high-level conference focusing on security and economic development because a similar meeting last year was seen as an attempt to stop immigration to the United States.
But in mid-September, a senior administration official announced that they wanted the conference to take place and that they would not impose sanctions on El Salvador.
Diplomats say Vice President Mike Pence will attend the conference in mid-October, which explains the administration's focus on the conference.
And the American ambassadors to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic have returned without any new harsh statements or sanctions from Washington.
White House spokesman Mr. Bolton declined to comment on the details of the discussions described by three American officials, two of whom were diplomats, and agreed to discuss the internal discussions anonymously.
Their reports were confirmed by an outside analyst who spoke anonymously and was close to the administration.
The history of the study
The next step could be a report by special counsel Robert Mueller on Trump's attempts to obstruct justice, which now has a lot of evidence in public.
Muller is also reportedly investigating whether Mr. Trump's campaign colluded with Russia in the Russian attacks on our elections.
If Congress changes its mind, Mr. Trump will be held accountable in that body, and he will be held accountable to his colleagues, who are preparing to run for reelection.
There are many "ifs", and I'm not saying that Mr. Trump's fall is inevitable, nor that nobody knows the fate of his European counterparts.
We're all making different choices on both sides of the Atlantic, and that will affect how long this battle will last.
If the West resisted Hitler and supported the Czechoslovak army in Munich, then in 1938 German officers would be ready to stage a coup against Hitler.
We were unable to stop the years of bloodshed that followed.
The course of history is dependent on these critical periods, and the unconquered march of democracy is either faster or slower.
Americans are living through this crucial moment right now.
What if Trump fires Rod Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general who oversaw the investigation of Mr. Mueller?
Rosenstein has been walking on fire since the newspaper reported last year that he had secretly recorded the president's speech and discussed his inability to hold office.
Mr. Rosenstein said that the Times' data was inaccurate.
"What if the FBI's investigation of Brett Kavanaugh is incomplete or unfair, and he is found guilty by the Supreme Court despite credible allegations and false evidence of sexual abuse?
And also, do we support a midterm vote in Congress that would hold Mr. Trump accountable?
If we pass these tests, democracy will remain in place for a long time.
But I'm convinced from what I learned in Prague that we're not going to lose.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew who was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazi regime, which had occupied my embassy.
He survived and moved to the United States, and 60 years later, he sent me to that same table to light a candle on Saturdays.
With my legacy, how can I be optimistic about the future?

Rangers Graham Dorrance feels optimistic ahead of Rapid Vienna
The Rangers will host Rapid Vienna this Thursday and after a draw against Villarreal in Spain earlier this month, the Australian victory will help the G-Group to secure a strong position in the Europa League.
A knee injury prevented midfielder Graham Dorrance from finishing in his first start of the 2-2 loss to Villarreal, but in his game the Rangers are confident that they can use this score as a springboard to even greater success.
"It was a good game for us because Villarreal is a great opponent", said the 31-year-old.
"We started the game with a score, hoping to get something.
Maybe we could have scored more points at the end, but it's also a good result that we're still tied.
They lost the first half, and we won the second half.
Thursday is another important European night.
Maybe we can get three points, but it's going to be a tough game because they did a great job in the last game, and yet, when we see the support of our people behind us, I believe we can move forward and do a great job.
Last year was really hard because I got injured and the club has changed a lot, but I'm still feeling really good about this game.
The setup is great, and the kids are having a lot of fun, and the training is great.
I hope we can move forward, leave behind a great time, and succeed".
Women are losing sleep over their pension savings
Although the respondents knew exactly how they wanted to be cared for, few of them talked about it with their family members.
About half of the people in the national survey said they had talked to their spouse about the cost of long-term care.
Only 10 percent of them have talked to their children about it.
"People want their families to support them, but they don't talk about it", says Holly Schneider, president of the National Life Insurance Business.
This is a good place to start.
Talk to your spouse and children: If you do not talk about your wishes, you will not be able to prepare your family for the challenge.
Talk to your health care provider and your family about where and how you can get medical care, because that's a big part of the cost.
Take your financial advisor: Your financial advisor can help you figure out how to pay for these expenses.
There are three ways to fund your long-term care: a traditional long-term care policy, a mixed policy (which helps cover a portion of the costs), or self-funding (depending on how long you have).
Prepare legal documents: Make the legal decisions first.
Give your health care provider a letter of credence, and your representative will oversee your health care and, if you can't talk, help ensure your wishes are met.
Also, consider the possibility of a trust for your assets.
If you are unable to do so, you will hire an agent to make the financial decisions and pay your bills.
Remember the surroundings: Imagine that your elderly parent is being taken to the hospital in an ambulance.
Can you answer questions about medications and allergies?

A man fired several self-inflicted gunshots at himself in the infracombe
A man was walking home at night when he was shot several times with a pneumatic pistol.
The 40-year-old victim was in Ilfracombe, Oxford Grove, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, abdomen, and arm.
The shooting, which occurred at 2:30 p.m. London time, was described by officers as "accidental".
The victim did not see his attackers.
His injuries are not life-threatening and the police are looking for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
The powerful earthquake and tsunami that struck the Indonesian city of Palo on Friday killed more than 384 people, and the death toll is rising.
Because of the loss of communications, rescuers were unable to get any information from the Donggala area, north of Palo, the closest area to the epicenter of the 7.5-magnitude quake.
After the disaster in Palau, 16,000 people were evacuated.
Here are some facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi:
It is the capital of Central Sulawesi province, located in the bay on the west coast of Sulawesi island, and has a total estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami struck.
Donggala  A regency that occupies a 180-mile (300 km) stretch of the northwest coast of Sulawesi Island.
The regency, which is the smallest administrative region of the province, has a population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the mainstays of the economy of the Central Sulawesi region and especially the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also well developed in the province, but the largest is in Morava, on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
According to the Disaster Rehabilitation Agency, Paul and Donggala have been affected by tsunamis several times in the past 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
In 1996, a tsunami struck the western part of Donggala, killing nine people.
Indonesia is located in the seismically active Pacific region and is regularly hit by earthquakes.
These are the major earthquakes and tsunamis of recent years:
2004: On December 26, a massive earthquake struck the west coast of Aceh province, Indonesia, in northern Sumatra, causing a tsunami in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the coast of the Indian Ocean, more than half of whom were Aceh residents.
2005: A series of powerful earthquakes hit the west coast of Sumatra in late March and early April.
Hundreds died off the coast of Sumatra, on the island of Nias.
2006: A 6.8 magnitude earthquake struck south of Indonesia's most populous island of Java, causing a tsunami along the southern coast, killing an estimated 700 people.
2009: A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck near Padang, the capital of West Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake on the island of Mentawai, Sumatra, causes a 10-meter-high tsunami that destroys dozens of villages and kills about 300 people.
2016: A minor earthquake devastated the Pidi-Jai Regency in Aceh, and people were shocked by the devastating earthquake and tsunami of 2004.
Although there was no tsunami, over 100 people died in the collapse of the buildings.
2018: A massive earthquake killed more than 500 people on the tourist island of Lombok, Indonesia, most of them in the northern part of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and temporarily displaced thousands of tourists.
Sarah Palin's firstborn son was arrested for domestic violence
Trey Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was charged and arrested for assault.
According to a report released Saturday by the Alaska State Police, 29-year-old Palin was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, for domestic violence and for allegedly obstructing her arrest.
According to a police report, a woman whom he knew tried to report a suspected crime to the police, but the police confiscated her cell phone.
According to KTUU, Paylin Mat-Su is being held in custody under a $500 bail.
When asked if he confessed, he stated that he was "completely innocent", according to the records.
Palin would have been convicted of a Class 3 felony, sentenced to up to a year in prison, and fined $250,000.
He was also convicted of a second-degree felony, for which he faces one day in prison and a $2,000 fine.
This was not the first time that Palin had been accused of sexual misconduct.
In December 2017, he was convicted of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, called the police to report the alleged assault.
The case is currently pending before the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, obstruction of justice, and assault with a deadly weapon while intoxicated.
His girlfriend said that he had slapped him in the face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans for associating her son's abusive behavior with post-traumatic stress disorder after serving in Iraq.
Indonesia: Earthquake hits and hundreds are killed
The earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi on Sunday killed more than 384 people.
The 7.5 magnitude earthquake caused a tsunami that destroyed thousands of homes.
The number of victims is expected to increase in the next few days, with power and communications being cut off.
The earthquake struck near the center of Sulawesi, northeast of Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia.
Videos of the earthquake were circulated on social media.
As the tsunami hit the coast, hundreds of people gathered on the beach to attend the annual festival of sand fishing in the city of Palu.
Federal prosecutors want to use a rare death penalty for a suspected terrorist in New York
The New York federal prosecutor's office wants to use a rare death sentence, not used since 1953, for a federal crime against Saifullo Saipow, suspected of carrying out the New York terror attack that killed eight people.
In October, 30-year-old Saipov rented a "depot" truck and planned to attack a bicycle path in Lower Manhattan's West Side, assaulting pedestrians and cyclists along the way.
According to the death penalty report to the Southern District of New York, to carry out the death sentence, prosecutors must prove that Saipowa "specifically" killed eight people and inflicted "specifically" bodily harm on them.
According to court documents, the death penalty should probably be imposed.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury indicted Saipov on 22 counts, including the usual federal prosecutorial charges of organized crime, assault and vehicular destruction, for the murder of eight people with terrorist intent.
The prosecutor said the attack required "careful planning and preparation", describing Saipov's actions as "disgusting, cruel and disgusting".
"Saipullo Habibullayevich Saipov caused trauma and serious injury to the family and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicolas Cleves, Anne-Laura Decatt, Darren Drake, Ariel Early, Ernan Ferrucci, Ernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement said.
Five of the dead were Argentine tourists.
It has been ten years since the last execution in the Southern District of New York.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The federal execution in New York City was in 1953, two years before the execution, of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple who had pledged to be spies during the Cold War with the Soviet Union.
Both Rosenbergs were executed in the electric chair on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, the Uzbek national Saipov did not regret his actions, even days and months after the attack.
According to the police, he said that he had no regrets.
According to the indictment, the ISIS video on Saipov's phone inspired the attack.
According to police, he also asked for permission to hang an ISIS flag in the hospital.
He denied the charges under Article 22.
David Patton, a federal social worker who defended Saipoff, said that they were "very disappointed" by the prosecutor's decision.
Patton said: "Not life imprisonment, which is impossible to escape, but the use of the death penalty only adds to the trauma of the victims of the accident".
The lawyers for Saipov had previously asked the prosecutor's office not to impose the death penalty.
Tory MP Nigel FARAJ says Brexit negotiations need to be held accountable
Today, during the protest at the Tory conference, Nigel Farage promised to "mobilize the national army".
The former leader of UKIP said politicians should "feel warm" to eurosceptics because Theresa May's MP suggested she should be responsible for negotiations with the EU.
Conservative agent Peter Bon said at a march in Birmingham that if Farage had been the Brexit secretary, Britain would have "gone out" long ago.
Mrs May, who was trying to reconcile her deeply divided tribe, was particularly troubled when the pro-Torini factions joined the city's separate anti-Brexit protest group.
The Prime Minister is doing everything in his power to preserve his chess-like plan in the face of attacks from Brexit, the Rest and the EU.
The Allies continued to try to reach an agreement with Brussels despite this backlash, forcing both Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between their plan and the "chaos".
Mr. Bonn said at the "Leaving Means Leaving" rally in Solihull that he wanted to "lose at chess".
He suggested that Mr. Farage be made their equal and that he be in line with the agreements with Brussels.
"If he was responsible, we would leave now".
The MP for Wellingborough said, "I'm for Brexit, but we have to lose at chess".
In his speech against the EU, he said: "We didn't fight in the world wars to be independent.
We want to write our own laws in our own country".
Mr. Bon dismissed the idea that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote, saying, "It's a complete lie that the British have changed their minds and want to stay".
Andrea Jenkins, a Tory Brexit supporter, was also on the march, and she told reporters: "I'm just saying this: Prime Minister, listen to the people.
"Chess is not known to the general public, the opposition does not vote for it, it is not known to our party and activists who will vote for us in the first place.
Stop playing chess and listen".
In his statement to Mrs. May, he said, "If the Prime Minister keeps his promises, he'll keep his jobs".
Mr. Faraj said that if politicians are going to buy the 2016 referendum, they should "act as if they regret it".
"Now we have a question of trust between the people and the political class", he said.
"They're trying to sell Brexit, and we're here today to say, 'We're not going to let you do that.'"
In a public statement, he added: "I want the political class that we have on the brink of selling Brexit not to be left out.
"We will mobilize the people's army of this country, which has brought us victory in Brexit, and we will never rest until we have an independent, self-governing, proud United Kingdom".
Meanwhile, the Rest marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
After the group was released this week, several activists held up posters with the words "Tories against Brexit".
At the start of the conference, Labour's Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives for having a security meeting with them through an app.
"These are people who say we can get all the IT systems and all the technology on the ground for Canada++, no-fly-barrier, free trade in Ireland", he said.
"This is a complete joke.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit".
Warren is planning a "serious" presidential campaign
U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren said that after the November election she would "prepare herself vigorously for the presidential election".
According to the Boston Globe, a Massachusetts Democrat spoke at a town hall in western Massachusetts about his future.
Warren, a longtime critic of President Donald Trump, ran for re-election in November 2016 against Republican Jeff Dill, who was Trump's top campaign chairman in Massachusetts.
He was in the middle of speculation that he might win Trump in 2020.
On Saturday afternoon, in Holyoke, Trump held his 36th rally with voters since taking office.
The participants asked if he planned to run for president.
Warren said, "To the women, including the lady above, it's time to go to Washington and fix our corrupt government".
Arrest for shooting and killing Louisiana State University student Sims
According to Baton Rouge police in Louisiana, the suspect was arrested after he shot LMU basketball player Wade Sims on Friday.
The Baton Rouge Police Department announced on an external news channel that at 11:00 a.m. they had arrested 20-year-old Deaton Simpson.
They posted a video of the shooting on Sunday, asking for help in identifying the man.
Sims, 20, was shot dead on Friday morning outside the Southern University building.
According to 247sports, Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told the press on Saturday that "Wade Sims was shot in the head and died".
Simpson shot Wade in the attempt to make him his friend.
Simpson confessed to the interrogation that he was there, that he used a weapon, and that he had ridden Wade Sims.
Simpson was arrested without resistance and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge County Police Department.
Sims, who stands 6 feet 2 inches tall and grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games with 10 starts last season, averaging 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton wins the world title after defeating Sebastian Fettel
When Walter Bottas qualified first from Lewis Hamilton on Saturday, it was clear that Mercedes was playing a big game.
On the run, Bottas was off to a good start, beating Hamilton, because he defended his position in the first two turns, then called Fettell to attack against his teammate.
Fettle said he'd go in first and get Hamilton in the tail of the ball on the way, and that would be the decisive moment.
Mercedes took the lap later, and Fettel got it, but Hamilton hit the wheel and took the lead, and he saw that Ferrari was having a hard time defending in the third corner and didn't want to let go.
Max Ferstappen started from the back of the grid, and on his 21st birthday, he was seventh at the end of the first lap.
He was quick to the finish line, trying to overtake fourth-place finisher Kimi Räikkönen, and he was ahead for most of the race.
After the 44th lap, he fell into the hole, and he was unable to accelerate for the remaining eight laps, as he finished fourth behind Raikkonen.
Walttery has done a great job all weekend, so today is a tough day for him, and I know he's a master because he let me be around him.
"The team did their best to win first and second".
Sign Language to Point Out the Wrong
President Donald Trump mocked Senator Diane Feinstein at a rally on Saturday, who said she had not told anyone about the sexual assault letter from Supreme Court nominee Christina Blasey Ford.
Speaking at a meeting with West Virginia, the president did not directly respond to Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but instead said that what was happening in the Senate was "deceitful, deceitful, and deceitful".
"You've seen what's been going on in the Senate these past few days, the deceitful, the corrupt, the lying people, the angry, the evil people, and it's amazing how this continues", he said.
"Even though you see the evidence and they're spreading, they're like, 'Oh, that's not me.
I did not do it".
Do You Recall?
Diane Feinstein, are you slow?
Remember the answer... are you slow?
Oh, no. I was just trying to be a little bit more.
I'm not lying down.
He waited.
We're not -- no, we're not", he said, to the senator's surprise.
Feinstein was sent a statement of charges, written by Ford Kavanaugh, in July and released in September, but Feinstein never admitted that his office had leaked the information.
"I didn't hide it, I didn't give away Ford's show, I didn't give away his story", Feinstein told the committee in The Hill.
"He said keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret".
But the president, apparently displeased with his refusal, said at a rally on Saturday: "His sign language is telling the truth.
Maybe he didn't, but his behavior, his sign language, is telling me otherwise".
While he was running for the Supreme Court, and he was accused of raping three women, he accused the Democrats of using the prosecution to his advantage.
"They are ready to return to power by any means.
So what you see is this disgusting thing, that they're offending whoever they're offending, and it doesn't matter who they're offending, they're just trying to take control and power", Mediaite quoted the president as saying.
Elite League: Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars won their first Premier League defeat on Friday against the Belfast Giants, which ended in a 5-3 draw at Dundee on Saturday.
The Giants took the lead with goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Boville.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cooney rose through the ranks until Dwyer restored the Giants' leadership.
Lucas Lundwald Nielsen's two goals evened the score with François Bouchard's Dundee before they won.
It was the third loss of the season for Adam Keefe's men in the elite league, who came to beat Dundee 2-1 in Belfast on Friday night.
This was the fourth meeting of the teams this season, and the Giants had won the previous three.
Dwyer's opening came in the fourth minute at 3:35 from assistant Kendall McFaul, and David Rutherford came to the rescue, as Boville doubled his lead after the fourth minute.
In the opening period, Sullivan returned the hosts to the game at 13:10, and then Matt Markward tied the score with Corny at 15:16.
Dwyer knew the Giants had taken the lead in the first outing, and he scored the second goal late in the first period.
The owners regrouped, and Boucher equalised them again in his own effort at 27:37.
Cowna and Charles Corcoran teamed up, and they gave Nielsen the lead for the first time, and Dundee took the lead at the end of the second period, and he made sure his team won in the final period.
The Giants have lost four of their last five games, and they're going to send Milton Keynes home for the next game of the week.
An air traffic controller died saving hundreds of people from the earthquake
An Indonesian air traffic controller was given the title of hero after he helped hundreds of people to fly off the ground.
The earthquake and tsunami that struck Sulawesi on Friday killed over 800 people, many of whom went missing.
Severe earthquakes still hit the area, leaving many people in the ruins of Palo.
Despite his fellow workers' fleeing for their lives, 21-year-old Anthony Gunawan refused to leave the hot air balloon at Mutiara Siss Al-Jufri Airport in Agung Palu.
He remained on the runway to ensure the safe takeoff of Batik Air Flight 6321.
Then he jumped off the ladder, thinking that he was about to collapse.
He later died in the hospital.
Johannes Sirait, a spokesman for the Indonesian Air Strike Force, said the decision saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian news agency ABC News.
We arranged for a plane from Baliqpapana to Kalimantan to take her to a hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him before the plane arrived in Palo this morning.
"We were heartbroken", she said.
Meanwhile, government officials fear the death toll could exceed 1,000, as the Disaster Rehabilitation Agency announced road closures in Donggala, Sigi and Butong.
"The death toll is rising, as many are still under the rubble and many are still stuck", said Sutopo Purvo Nugroho, spokesman for the agency.
Waves six meters high swept over the city of Palo, and mass burials were held on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft were bringing aid.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News: "Every minute, the ambulance was bringing bodies.
Fresh water is scarce.
They robbed all the shops".
Jan Gelphand, of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN: "The Indonesian Red Cross rushed to help the survivors, but we don't know what we're going to find there.
It's a tragedy, but it could be worse".
When Indonesian President Joko Widodo visited Palo, he told the country's armed forces: "I ask you to work day and night to implement the evacuation plan.
Are you ready?" CNN reported.
Earlier this year, Indonesia was hit by a devastating earthquake in Lombok, killing 550.
Air Niugini says one person is missing after plane crash in Micronesia
The airline crashed in the Pacific Ocean off Micronesia, and they had previously reported that all 47 people on board had been evacuated safely, and one person was reported missing.
According to Air Niugini, on Saturday they found a man counting passengers, but they did not find him.
The airline said it was working closely with local authorities, hospitals, and investigators to find the man.
The airline did not immediately respond to a request for detailed information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats helped rescue other passengers and crew when the plane sank while trying to land at the Chuuk Island airport.
On Friday, officials said that seven people had been taken to the hospital.
The airline said six passengers remained in hospital on Saturday and were in stable condition.
The cause of the accident and the exact circumstances of the incident remain unknown.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane had landed on a runway in the area.
Some witnesses thought that the plane had lost its runway.
American passenger Bill Jans said the plane was too low.
"That's a very good thing", said Jane.
Jains said that he and others had escaped through the emergency doors of the sinking plane, being submerged up to their waists.
The flight attendants panicked, screamed, and reported minor head injuries.
The U.S. Navy said that coastguard sailors also helped with the rescue, using the submarine to help get people to shore before the plane sank 100 pounds (30 meters).
The Air Safety Commission said that over the past two decades, 111 people have died in crashes recorded by PNG airlines, none of which were related to Air Niugini.
Analyst publishes the nightly schedule of the woman who was burned alive
On Saturday, a prosecutor charged a man in Mississippi with setting fire to a woman in 2014.
Paul Rowlett, an analyst for the U.S. Department of Justice, testified for several hours as an expert analyst of the investigative submissions.
Using cell phone recordings, the jury tried to determine the actions of the 29-year-old defendant, Quinton Tallis, and 19-year-old victim, Jessica Chambers, on the night of the murder.
According to The Clarion Ledger, Roulette obtained location information from several phones that showed Tellis and Chambers were together that night (he had previously given different instructions).
When Deane's cell phone showed up with Chambers, and he said he was with Michael Sanford, the police went to see Sanford.
Sanford confessed that he was out of town on Saturday night.
When the prosecutors asked Tallis if he was telling the truth about being in the truck with Sanford that night, Sanford said that he was "lying because my truck was in Nashville".
Another discrepancy is that Tellys told Chambers that she only knew about two weeks before she died.
Cell phone records showed that they had known each other for only a week.
Tellis said that after the death of Rowlett Chambers, she deleted Chambers' messages, calls, and contact information.
"He took her out of his life", said Hale.
The defense must make its final arguments on Sunday.
The judge said that the case would be referred to the jury that evening.
Upper generation: What is hip-hop?
Hip-hop trios need to challenge the negative perception of the genre by filling the music with a positive message.
He said that High Breed hip-hop in Bristol had drifted away from its original purpose of political thought and social issues.
They want to go back to the basics and make sensible hip-hop popular again.
Artists like The Fugees and Common have seen a resurgence in the UK thanks to artists like Akala and Lowkey.
Another black man?!
A New York nanny sued a couple for being racist
A New York nanny sued a couple for discrimination and for firing her because her employer called her "another black person".
The couple refused to admit their racism and described the accusation as "an attempt to extort money".
Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman is a new employee, Giselle Morris, a mother of two, who was shocked to find out that she was black on her first day at work in 2016.
"A BEAUTIFUL BLACK MAN" was the title of a letter written by Lindsay Plasco-Flaxman to her husband.
She sent the note twice to Mrs. Maurice, not to her husband.
The New York Post reported that Plaxson-Flaxman was "uncomfortable" with the fact that the current nanny was African-American and did a terrible job, so she was waiting for a Filipino employee.
Mrs. Morris was paid for her day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is demanding compensation for his dismissal, the same amount as his contract, $350 a day for six months, but he was hired without signing the contract.
"I want to show them that they shouldn't do that", he told the Post on Friday, and then added, "I know it's discrimination".
Instead of being insulted as a racist, Maurice felt that he was too afraid to trust the woman after she had offended him.
"My wife sent him a message that she did not want to say.
He is not a racist.
We are not a racist nation", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
"But would you give your children to someone you were cruel to, even though it was wrong?
A newborn child?
Please, take care of it".
Comparing the lawsuit to a "productive effort", Plasco said that his wife had been pregnant for two months and that she was "in a very difficult situation".
"Would you follow someone like this?
And it's not a good thing".
The trial was still ongoing, and the public prosecution had denounced the couple's behavior and logic, and the news quickly spread through social media.
Paddington publishers feared that students would not accept a talking bear , according to a recent letter
Karen Jankel, the Bond daughter born after the book was published, wrote in a letter: "It's hard to be in the shoes of someone who's reading this for the first time before it's published.
We're hearing about the great successes of Paddington now, and it's been a lot of fun".
His father was a BBC cameraman before he wrote the children's book about the little teddy bear, and sadly, he died last year on the 60th anniversary of the book's publication.
She described Paddington as "a very important member of our family", adding that her father was secretly proud of his success.
"He was a very humble man, he was not a man of boast", he said.
"But Paddington was so real to him, he was almost like a child who had accomplished something, and you're proud of what he's accomplished, even if you haven't.
And I think that's how he thought about Paddington's success.
"It was his structure and his fantasy, but he always praised Paddington for his achievements".
I had to say goodbye to my dying daughter over the phone.
After the operation, doctors rushed her to the Louis Pasteur II Hospital in Nice to save her life.
"Nad shouted that it was unexpected, that it was really bad", said Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Two minutes later, Nad, who was dying, called to say goodbye, and I had no choice but to say goodbye.
I said goodbye.
I said, 'I love you so much, my lamp.
I will be with you soon.
I will be with you.'"
The medication that the doctors gave him to work on his heart was running out of action, and his body was dying.
He died before the end of the program.
I was sitting there, waiting for something, even though I knew it was over.
I could not cry or scream or cry because I was with my family and other people.
I had to concentrate".
Finally, Ednan-Laperouse, saddened by the loss of his daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers despite the ordeal.
"No one knew", he said.
"I fell to the ground and wept unceasingly.
It's hard to explain, but during that flight, I felt so sorry for Nad.
I needed to be loving and understanding.
I could see how much he loved her".
A message predicting the suicide of a grieving woman on the Women's Bridge
Two women who have lost loved ones are working to distract people from suicide.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Douglas were leaving cards and phone numbers on the Welsh Bridge to encourage people.
Davis' son Tyler was 13 when he began to suffer from depression and committed suicide at the age of 18.
"I don't want any parent to have to go through what I feel every day", she said.
Mrs. Davis, 45, of Lydney, said that her son would be a brilliant and humorous cook.
"Everyone knew her by her smile.
"She was a great teacher, and they said her smile brightened a room".
Yet, he will be dead before he can do so, for he will feel "as though in a land of darkness".
In 2014, Tyler, then 11 years old, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs. Davis said, "I always wait for someone to knock".
Mrs. Davis began making cards "to let people know that there are people you can go and talk to, and that you can be friends with".
" You Need to Be Silent and Talk "
Mrs. Humphries Davis was a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, whose mother had died 15 years before her husband committed suicide.
"He didn't say anything about drowning or depression", she said.
"Ahead of Christmas, he noticed a change in his wife's attitude.
"He was different on Christmas day, and he didn't look at the children when they opened their presents".
His death was a great loss, but they must live with it: "It gives the family a chance to cope with a grief.
We are very sad.
But we have to fight it".

Brett Kavanaugh 's future remains uncertain since the FBI began investigating
"If we do the time-limited and limited investigation he asked for, we might be able to come to some kind of unity", Mr. Flake said Saturday, "the committee is in a state of "depression" over the ongoing partisan deadlock".
Why do Mr. Kavanaugh and his non-Republican supporters want an FBI investigation?
They were not willing to do so for a period of time.
The midterm elections are just five weeks away on November 6th. If, as expected, the Republicans lose, they may not be able to continue their efforts to elect a Supreme Court justice.
George W. Bush called the Senators and urged them to vote for Mr. Kavanaugh, who had worked for Bush at the White House and was married to Ashley, who was Bush's personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI creates its own pass?
51 Republicans and 49 Democrats are now sitting in the Senate.
If Mr. Kavanaugh gets at least 50 votes in the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence can vote for him to run for the Supreme Court, but the question is whether he gets that many votes.
North Korean defectors 'suffering' under Kim
A South Korean lawmaker says the number of North Korean refugees arriving in South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago.
Pak Byung Seog cited data from the southern ministry, saying there were 1,127 refugees last year, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that increased border controls with North Korea and China and snipers were the main reasons for the increased rates.
North Korea did not make any public appearances.
The vast majority of North Korean refugees are gradually offered South Korean citizenship.
After the Seoul war, 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the Korean War ended in 1953.
They mostly flee through China, which has a long border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily guarded zones between the two Koreas.
China treats them not as refugees but as illegal migrants, and often forcibly returns them.
Relations between North and South, still in a technical war, have improved significantly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in North Korea to discuss disarmament.
This meeting came after the historic meeting in Singapore between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, who agreed to operate on the nuclear-free Korean Peninsula.
On Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-woo accused the US of failing to respond to the sanctions.
"If there is no trust in the United States, there is no trust in our national security under these circumstances, and we will never unilaterally disarm ourselves first", Mr. Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "a burnt-out starving man" who she believes is unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Minority leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "burned out", saying he was unfit for the Supreme Court because of his temperament.
Pelosi said this in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
"If a woman did that, I think they would call her very 'irritating,'" Pelosi said Thursday, speaking before the Senate Judiciary Committee about Kavanaugh.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the accusations that he had raped Dr. Christine Blaisey Ford when she was a teenager.
Kavanaugh was very emotional and breathless as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also accused the Democratic committee of "disorderly assassination" against Hillary Clinton, organized by liberals angry at her 2016 presidential defeat.
Pelosi said that when asked about Kavanaugh, he showed that he was unbiased toward the Democrats, and that he proved that he could not be a Supreme Court justice.
"I think that's self-disqualification for that statement and for what he said against Clinton and the Democrats", he said.
Pelosi was wondering if you could hold Kavanaugh accountable if he was proven guilty and the Democrats had a majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he didn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not fit to serve not only in the Supreme Court, but in this court", Pelosi said.
Kavanaugh is currently a judge on the District Court of Columbia.
I'm really worried about Pelosi Kavanaugh's decisions on affordable health care or Roe v. Wade, because he's a conservative judge.
During his hearing, Kavanaugh did not answer questions about whether he would overturn the ruling of the famous Supreme Court.
"This is the time when we go to a court that is so hysterical, so ignorant, that we don't say, 'How wonderful.'"
Women need to be good at it.
It's honest diatribe, going crazy for months and years, and she can't stop crying.
"If we get angry, we'll cry", Mrs. Steinham said to me 45 years later.
"I think it's not uncommon, do you?"
She also said, "I was helped by a woman who worked as an actress, and when she got angry and started crying, she came up with a way to tell people, and she said, 'You might think I'm upset because I'm crying.
I'm getting really angry".
Then he just kept going.
I thought it was a great idea".
Because of the deep misunderstanding of the practice, it is often considered a good way to control anger.
One day, when I was in a job that was mostly male-dominated, I was crying and angry, and a senior employee, whom I had always been afraid of, came up behind me, grabbed me by the neck, and led me down the hallway.
"I don't want them to ever see you cry", she said.
"They don't know you're angry.
They think you're upset and are glad you're upset".
Patricia Schroeder, who was then a congresswoman for the Democratic Party in Colorado, worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, when Mr. Hart was caught with someone other than his wife on a boat called Monkey Business and then dropped out of the race, Mrs. Schroeder was so upset that she thought she should run for president herself.
"It was not a well-planned decision", he said, laughing 30 years later.
"There were seven other candidates in the race, and they didn't want anyone else to join.
Someone called them "Belshazzar and the Seven Dwarfs".
He was so late in the vote that he started fundraising and vowed not to run until he had two million dollars.
It was a race to be won.
He noticed that people who gave $1,000 to other candidates only gave $250 to the female candidate.
"They think they're going to get me a discount".
When she announced the campaign had failed, she spoke with such emotion, because she was grateful to the people who supported her, angry at the system that made fundraising so difficult, and angry at sexism.
"You thought I was too nervous", said Schroeder, recalling the press reaction of the day.
"You might think that Kleenex is my sponsor.
I wondered what they would write on my wallet.
Did he say, "She cried?"
How the US-China trade war is benefiting Beijing
Although the U.S. and China are locked in a trade war, experts say that the dispute between the two countries could be beneficial to Beijing in the long run.
Donald Trump, the first US president to issue a warning, earlier this year imposed tariffs on major Chinese exports, including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
This week, there was a significant increase: 200 billion dollars worth of goods were subject to new tariffs, and half of the goods imported into the United States from China were taxed.
Beijing has responded each time, the last time by raising tariffs on $60 million of US goods from 5 percent to 10 percent.
China said that it would now take responsibility for every move of the United States, and the world's second largest economy would no longer die.
Chinese President Xi Jinping understood that he had to comply with these requirements to push Washington back, but he was too embarrassed to bow to the United States in public.
However, experts say that if Beijing plays its cards right, the long-term U.S. trade war could be good for China by reducing the dependence of the two economies.
"If Washington or Beijing makes a quick political decision, it could have far more dire consequences for both countries than experts predict", says Abigail Grace, an Asia expert at the New American Security Center.
Syrian Foreign Minister says "ready" for Syrian refugees to return
Syria says it is ready to accept the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by seven years of war.
Iranian Foreign Minister Walid al-Mualim, speaking at the United Nations General Assembly, said that the situation in the country was improving.
"Today, the situation on the ground is stable and safe after the anti-terrorist march", he said.
The government is continuing its efforts to restore normalcy to areas devastated by terrorism.
All efforts are now focused on the voluntary return of refugees who have been forced to leave due to terrorism, and on improving their daily lives and living conditions through unilateral economic measures.
According to the United Nations, more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Mu'alim said the Syrian regime would appreciate any help in rebuilding the country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept aid from countries that had sponsored the rebellion.
Europe consolidates its victory in the Ryder Cup in Paris
The European team won the 2018 Ryder Cup at Le Golf National outside Paris, beating the USA with a final score of 16.510.5.
The U.S. has lost six straight times on European soil and hasn't won the Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained its crown when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn and his team scored the 14.5 points needed to beat the United States.
Phil Mickelson, the US star who has played most of the tournament, scored three pairings in the 16th hole to beat Francesco Molinari.
Italian athlete Molinari was the star of all matches, and is one of only four players to record a 5-0-0 record since the tournament began in 1979.
The American Jordan Spit beat the Danish Turbjörn Olesen, the lowest rated player in Europe, 5-4 in the final.
Dustin Johnson, the world's best player, beat England's Ian Poulter 2-1 and could have played in the final.
Sergio Garcia, an eight-time Ryder Cup veteran from Spain, is the European record-holder for most points scored in a single game with 25.5 points.
"I don't usually cry, but today I can't stop.
It's been a tough year.
I am grateful that Thomas chose me and trusted me.
I'm very happy, I feel very happy, that I won the trophy again.
The team is the solution, and I'm happy to be able to help", said Garcia, excited about winning the European Championship.
He gave a torch to his compatriot John Ram, who had defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 on Sunday.
"I'm so excited to beat Tiger Woods, and I'm going to grow up watching it", said Ram, 23.
Woods lost all four matches in France and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
Jack Nicklaus, who has won 14 titles, is the greatest player of all time.
The U.S. team didn't play much, and only Patrick Kamish, Justin Thomas, and Tony Finau played at the highest level throughout the tournament.
After the disappointing performance of his team, the captain of the U.S. team, Jim Furyk, said: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought.
One morning, we were going to conquer Europe.
We were wiped out.
We are following Thomas.
He is a great captain.
All 12 players played well.
We're going to rebuild the team, work with the PGA of America and our own Ryder Cup committee, and move forward.
I love these 12 boys and I'm proud to be their captain.
You must take off your headbands in front of them.
We played too much".
Red tide updates: Concentration decreases in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
A recent report by the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission indicates that red tide is decreasing in areas of Tampa Bay.
The Commission says that the Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte, and Collier areas are experiencing conditions of excessive blooming.
The red tide extends from the northern Pinellas to the southern Lee areas for approximately 130 miles (209.21 km).
You can also see these sites 10 miles (16.09 km) away in Hillsborough, but they are smaller than they were last week.
The red spotted owl has also been observed in Pasco.
Moderate concentrations were reported in the Pinellas region and its vicinity last week, with low to high concentrations in the Hillsborough region, high concentrations in the Manatee region, high concentrations in Sarasota or nearby coast, moderate concentrations in Charlotte, high concentrations in the Lee area and its coast, and low concentrations in Collier.
In Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee, and Collier, there is still a respiratory allergy.
As of last week, no respiratory allergy cases had been reported in northwest Florida.
