Peterson: Transfer to the last minute?
All is Possible
Today is the last day to jump through the transfer window and make a big transfer.
The next chance will come in the winter.
Petr Čech, currently the replacement goalkeeper of Chelsea, is now not sitting over a new professional contract in Madrid, Monaco or Paris.
He sits at the Smíchov NH Hotel, talks to Czech journalists and is preparing for a game with the Czech national team against the Americans and subsequently also for the sharp start of the Euro 2016 qualification against the Netherlands.
In Chelsea’s goal, Thibaut Courtois is preferred in the new Premier League season, Czech for the first time in ten years in the London club got into the position of a replacement.
It has been speculated that Real Madrid could be interested in the Czech.
He lost the Spanish Super Cup at the start of the season against Atlético and failed to enter the league season when he lost 2:4 in San Sebastián.
There was also speculation about the interest of Paris SG.
He scored two wins and two draws to the French league season, scoring 5-0 against St. Etienne on Sunday.
The most popular club is AS Monaco.
He has a balance of 1-1-2 in the league so far, and in the weekend he split from Lille 1:1.
On bullshit English websites today popped news that they might want the Czech in the Queens Park Rangers.
According to the bookmakers, Chelsea’s departure at the last minute is unlikely.
Skybet scored 4:1 for him.
Is it possible for you to change your clothes in the next few hours?
I don’t count it, but in football nothing is 100%.
There may be an offer that cannot be rejected.
How would such an offer look like?
“I don’t know how an offer that can’t be rejected actually looks like.
First of all, it would depend on the position of Chelsea whether or not the club would address the possible offer.
Is it technically feasible to do such a transfer when you are now in Prague?
Wouldn’t you have to sign a new contract somewhere else?
I did not think about it.
But there are a lot of players in this situation today, they are all somewhere in the national team clashes and there will be a lot of transfers closed today.
It would be somehow feasible.
How many clubs on the planet could afford you?
I really don’t know.
Are you not pushing to leave?
The situation that I didn’t catch in the first three games of the new season is new for me after fifteen years of career.
There is no need to panic, pack up and leave.
I want to continue taking part in the match for Chelsea’s goalkeeper position and it’s up to the coach who he chooses what decisions he will make in the coming weeks.
What role does the family play in your decision making?
I take all the factors into account.
For me, of course, the sporting aspect is important, but I also look at it from the personal side, which of course includes the needs of the family.
Is it possible for you to join another club in England?
This is a question that I thought would never affect me.
But in football everything is possible.
I do not want to exclude anything.
I do not know the answer.
Prime Ministers of Japan and India meet in Tokyo
New Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is in Tokyo for a meeting with his Japanese counterpart, Shinzo Abe, to discuss economic and security commitments at his first major visit since the May election victory.
Modi is on a five-day trip to Japan to strengthen economic ties with the world’s third-largest economy.
The list includes plans for broader cooperation in the field of nuclear energy.
According to reporters, India also hopes that both nations will agree on cooperation in defence matters.
Police arrest 20-year-old after motorcycle chase
The motorcycle was stopped after it ran 125 km/h in the 70 km/h zone and ran into a bush to escape police.
A blue motorcycle was stopped by traffic police in Karrata in the morning when they noticed that it was driving 125 km/h on Bathgate Road when it left the gas station.
According to police, the driver did not stop and continued on Burgess Road and then stumbled into a bush, so police lost him from sight.
The motorcycle and the person that matched the driver’s description were then spotted in a house in Walcott Way, Bulgaria.
Karrath police accused the 20-year-old of failing to obey the call to stop and careless conduct.
He will face trial in Karata on September 23.
The motorcycle was seized for three months.
George Webster accused of rape in hotels in Nairn and Pitlochry
The man will be brought to court on charges of raping women in two hotels.
George Webster, 28, was acquainted with the accusation during a hearing at the Supreme Court in Glasgow.
He allegedly raped a woman on June 7, 2013 at the Scotland's Hotel in Pitlochry, Perthshire.
According to the allegations, Webster attacked her while “she was unconscious, sleeping and unable to give her consent.”
Webster is also being prosecuted for raping another woman at the Golf View Hotel in Nairn, Scotland, on May 4, 2014.
Judge Lady Rae has set the date for the hearing at the Supreme Court in Edinburgh on November 17.
Restoring the very American ideal that labor rights are at the same time human rights
Congressmen Keith Ellison and John Lewis have proposed a law to protect trade unions as a civil right.
“According to how unions work, jobs work for the middle class,” says Ellison, a Democratic senator from Minnesota, who is a co-chair of the Congressional Committee.
That’s why I’m so proud to be able, along with John Lewis, the model of occasional rights, to introduce a law empowering employees.
This breakthrough legislation will give workers the same legal opportunities to defend themselves against discrimination in trade unions as it does in other forms of discrimination – and will stop anti-union forces.
Adjusting the Labour Relations Act to allow all employees who face discrimination if they want to join unions to sued themselves in a civil court – and to award compensation or damages – is a right and necessary initiative.
This is not a radical initiative – at least not according to American standards.
The best way to understand what Ellison, Lewis, and other proponents in the bill are putting forward is to re-establish the American ideal.
Despite the trade union struggles that have taken place in recent years – in Wisconsin, Michigan and other states – Americans have once supported countries around the world to adopt, expand and respect labor rights.
There were times, and millions of Americans still remember them, when the country in one breath promoted democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and the right to assembly.
When the United States occupied Japan after World War II, General Douglas MacArthur and his advisers supported the country to adopt a constitution designed to ensure that the military autocracy of Hideki Toja was replaced by democracy.
They were convinced that workers and their unions played a role in shaping the new Japan, included language in them and openly recognized that “the right of workers to assemble, collectively negotiate and act is guaranteed.”
When the United States occupied Germany after World War II, General Dwight David Eisenhower and his advisers urged the Germans to create a constitution that would ensure that Adolf Hitler’s fascism was replaced by a strong democracy.
The Germans realized that workers would need to organize and promote themselves in the new nation, and therefore included a clause that openly says: “The right to form associations that will ensure and improve working and economic conditions will be guaranteed to every individual and every profession or profession.
Agreements that restrict this right or seek to damage it will be cancelled.
When former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt presided over the International Commission on Human Rights, which proposed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was adopted by the United Nations in 1948 as a global treaty, the petitioners and Roosevelt included a guarantee that “everyone has the right to form trade unions and join them as part of the protection of their interests.”
For generations, Americans have accepted the basic premise that labor rights are human rights.
When the country advised other countries on how to build a civil and democratic society, Americans explained that the right to form trade unions – and their participation in collective bargaining with companies and government agencies as equal partners – must be protected.
Now that these rights are being attacked in America, it is absolutely necessary to return to the American ideal that working people must have the right to organize and promote in a free and open society.
As Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. said:
History is a great teacher.
Today everyone knows that the unions have not diminished the power of the nation, but have expanded it.
They raised the standard of living of millions of people, created a market for industry and raised production to an unprecedented level.
Those who attack trade unions forget these simple truths, but history remembers them.
History has not forgotten, and we should not.
The formal recognition of labor rights as human – and the expansion of the protection of civil rights to prevent discrimination in organizing unions – has been delayed.
Keith Ellison and John Lewis renew the ideals that have raised America and made it a real promise of democracy.
A judge temporarily blocked a law that could close all abortion clinics in Louisiana
A federal judge on Sunday temporarily blocked a law in Louisiana that, according to lawyers, would likely close all five abortion clinics in the state.
A decree signed by Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal in June, which will come into force on September 1, would require doctors performing abortions to have the right to take a patient to a hospital within 30 miles of their practice.
The judge’s ruling means that doctors can temporarily continue to perform legal abortions and must obtain this permission in the meantime.
“The proposing party will be able to conduct its activities legally and will get permission in the meantime,” federal judge John deGravelles said in a statement.
The hearing will be scheduled within one month so that the judge can issue a more permanent ruling on the law.
Abortion rights activists welcomed the resolution, which is the latest in a series of similar measures, saying it would give doctors more time to get permission.
“Today’s decision ensures women in Louisiana that they are safe from a delusional law that is meant to deprive them of their health and their rights,” said Nancy Northup, president and executive director of the Center for Reproductive Rights, who, on behalf of three of the five clinics, filed a lawsuit demanding the blockade of the law.
It was not immediately clear whether the decision also concerned doctors from two clinics who were not among the applicants and are also applying for this permit.
Louisiana is among the eleven states that have passed similar laws, with courts in Alabama and Mississippi declaring such measures unconstitutional.
Key parts of the Texas law, which would close most of the remaining clinics in the state, were blocked by a federal judge on Friday.
Fighters for women’s abortion rights, together with the Association of American Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association, argue that the need to have this permit puts on the physician requirements that are not necessary from a medical point of view.
Opponents of abortion opposed that the measures were aimed at protecting women’s health, and some also welcomed the fact that clinics would be closed because of the measures.
The Center for Reproductive Rights said that in Louisiana only one doctor has a permit to perform abortions.
If all doctors in the state were forced to stop performing abortions, this doctor would also stop performing the procedure for fear of their safety, the group said.
The Louisiana authorities said in response that they would not punish doctors who perform abortions while waiting for the application to be handled.
Due to late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment, ovarian cancer kills more often in rural areas
Angelina Jolie and her brother James posted a video to pay tribute to their late mother, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007.
Women in rural Australia are at a higher risk of dying from ovarian cancer than their city counterparts.
Researchers analyzed the medical records of more than 1,100 Australian women diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2005 and found that only 35% survived five years after the diagnosis.
Research leader Susan Jordan of the QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute said that women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Small Study: New Drugs May Slow Lung and Ovarian Cancer
The researchers followed the women for seven years of treatment.
Dr. Jordan said the chances of survival were influenced by the age of women at the time of diagnosis, the type of ovarian cancer, other existing diseases, and socio-economic status.
The lowest survival rate occurred in older women who were diagnosed with cancer at a more advanced stage.
Women in rural and remote areas of the state were about 20 percent more likely to die during the study than women in urban areas.
Although the study was not designed to determine why women living outside the city were more likely to die from ovarian cancer, Dr. Jordan says the factors could be late diagnosis and poor availability of treatment.
“The disease is best treated by gyneco-oncologists, who usually reside in larger cities,” she said.
Despite the improvement of remote medical services to overcome the barrier in the form of distance, the doctor suggested that it would help to strengthen transportation services that allow specialists to treat women closer to their homes, and programs to support people who are treated away from their family and friends.
Dr. Jordan said the study revealed that the long-term survival rate of women with ovarian cancer is low regardless of geographical location, highlighting the need for better treatment and preventive programs.
The research funded by Rio Tinto Ride to Conquer cancer will be published today in the Medical Journal of Australia.
In March 2012, at the age of 33, a young mom, Elisha Neave, from the town of Gold Coast, was diagnosed with an aggressive form of ovarian cancer.
Households regret reduced number of homeowners
According to a HTA study published by the Financial Times, the decline associated with the extraordinary decline in homeowners under the age of 35 could lead to the fact that once today’s younger generation of consumers reach the “main age group of gardeners,” garden centers will lose up to 10 million pounds a year.
According to the report, people who rent houses spend on their gardens on average 55% of the amount spent by people living in their own.
Additional threats to the industry, which earns an estimated £5 billion a year, include the rise in the number of people living in highly urbanized areas where there are no gardens, the popularity of flooring instead of front gardens used as parking spaces, and the shrinking size of gardens.
In the Greater London area, where the share of homes owned dropped from 61 percent to 43 percent over the course of six years, household spending on gardening products is the lowest in the UK.
HTA and the Royal Gardening Society said that living in a sub-loan or lack of space does not mean that people would not be able to grow plants.
Guy Barter, chief gardening advisor for RHS, said: “Renters are very fond of growing plants in pots – when they move, they can take the plants with them.”
The HTA report revealed that the “golden age” of the garden retail sector was between 1997 and 2005 and was the result of a higher share of homeowners and economic prosperity lasting from the 1980s to the mid-1990s.
He also predicted higher sales this year due to the better weather that came after adverse conditions in March and April.
The Eastern dictators speak of democracy.
After Putin, at the collapse of his youth organization, which reminds me most of all of Hitlerjugend, rescued with atomic weapons and essentially showed everyone that their opinions were stolen from him, he gave us today a lecture on democracy.
But I have the feeling that the current regime in Russia shows many features of a fascist state.
The great nations have one thing in common, and that is that they can be dominated by both the outstretched nationalism and that they can transform the complex of inferiority into imperialist lusts.
Time is different in the East than in the West.
While the Western world thought that the era of wars for domination over Europe had long passed, the East, on the contrary, thought they had long been overlooked and needed to regain their international position.
Such a mood and frustration prevailed in Germany in the 1930s, just before the Nazi seizure of power and then followed by an outbreak of nationalism unlike the current situation in Russia.
And then the very same cult of a strong leader, the slaughter of journalists, the liquidation of uncomfortable political opponents, the discrimination against minorities and homosexuals, that is, indeed, quite similar.
Vladimir Putin and a large part of the Russians are probably missing a time when Russia ruled half of the world and the other half trembled before them.
Per Western politicians blamed themselves for this, maybe little Vladimir was swept on his shoulders, maybe they didn’t invite him where he wanted and maybe they started to underestimate him and he just behaved like a typical Russian man.
He made order at home, pretending that he did not want to go anywhere, and scratched his knives at home.
Now he has decided to regain his lost position.
It starts slowly, it has time.
He is a lifetime leader, so he should be in a hurry.
He slapped the Caucasians, now he slapped the Ukrainians, then the dwarfs from the Baltics are on their turn.
The Russian bear has been in the wool for a long time.
This will be noticed by China, which is hoping to make a big leap to the Far East.
And those Germans that Vladimir is also a bit upset how well they are, and I put them in 45 so on the ass.
How about making a new Novorossiya in Karlovy Vary.
That would be the base and our there are a lot of them and as they are there pressuring and dacha already wanted to destroy any of them.
Our veterans will remember how they lived in Czechoslovakia.
Now that their prime minister, Gospodin Sobotka, is so soft, it can be looted like a onion and it will eat the whole of their EU.
This would make it possible for them to get into a big Russia.
They need to know where their place is.
And as explosives we will use our nicknames who live on their territory.
There are enough Russians everywhere, and if they say they are being oppressed there, they are simply being oppressed there, and we will not let them be, we will protect them.
And again, the Russians will rule, for what else is he born for.
Europe is good only as a substrate on which the proud Ivan can dance the Cossack.
Turkey Recalls U.S. Diplomat for Spy Report
The Turkish Foreign Minister called the top U.S. diplomat in the country to explain the report on U.S. and British espionage activities in Turkey.
Deputy Prime Minister Bulent said the U.S. Charter of Affairs and Turkish officials discussed the report on Monday.
German magazine Der Spiegel and online magazine The Intercept said that according to documents provided by a former US National Security Agency analyst, Turkey was a priority target of US and British intelligence services.
According to Turkish media, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan underestimated the importance of the report and stated that all major nations were watching each other.
An older report, according to which the German intelligence service has also targeted Ankara, has provoked a more indignant reaction in the Turkish government.
Game of Thrones Series 4 Announces New Tricks

Magaluf police chief accused of corruption
Complainants on Friday submitted to the Mallorcan State Prosecutor’s Office evidence of blackmail by police and state officials at the municipality in the municipality of Calvia.
The head of the Calvia police on the holiday island of Mallorca was arrested after charges raised by entrepreneurs and bar owners in the infamous party district of Magaluf.
Inspector-in-Chief José Antonio Navarro was placed under investigative custody after he was charged with corruption by several businessmen from Punta Ballena, the street where most of Magaluf's bars and night are located.
According to the online daily Mallorca Diario, the complainants submitted on Friday to the prosecutor of the Mallorcan Anti-Corruption Office evidence of blackmail by police and state officials in the municipality in the municipality of Calvia.
Two other local police officers have been arrested by the Spanish state police on charges of corruption and will be heard by a judge along with Navarro.
The Spanish national newspaper ABC quoted dissatisfied night business owners as saying that public favors have a serious impact on their.
“It’s not about earning money, it’s about surviving,” one of the businessmen said in court.
Do not play with our livelihoods.
We have nothing to lose.
Magaluf came to the headlines of magazines around the world after a video appeared on YouTube of an 18-year-old British tourist who provided oral sex to 24 men during a tour of bars.
The island’s authorities have since tried to oversee drunkards and whistleblowers in the ranks of holiday parties in Magafulu by reducing the number of notorious alcoholic tours around the bars.
In addition, the Playhouse club, where the incident occurred with the provision of oral sex, was forced to close for a year and together with the organizers of the tour of the bars of the company Carnage to pay a fine of 55,000 euros ($73,000).
The tourist resort Magaluf, which is popular mostly with the British, has also witnessed many accidents under the influence of alcohol, including a fashion wave known as “balconing”, in which people jump from one balcony to another or from the balcony to the hotel pool.
The first spring day marked by rains and storms that impacted the flight at Adelaide airport
Spring brought southern South Australia ice surprises, with heavy rains and heavy winds hit the airport in Adelaide.
Five millimeters of rainfall will fall in the city until nine o’clock in the evening and another 6.6 millimeters will fall during the night of Sunday.
The last rain was introduced along with several short overdoses associated with the storm and winds that began before eight o’clock in the evening and in about ten minutes brought about 4 mm of rainfall.
After several early portions of spring came after the winter last week, temperatures in the city fell again to just 15.8°C on Monday.
It is believed that the stormy weather contributed to the delayed arrival of Virgin Airlines flight from Melbourne to Adelaide.
The plane was scheduled to land a moment after 19:30, but was hit by a change in wind speed or direction and was forced to postpone the landing.
Winds at Adelaide Airport at that time reached a speed of about 50 km/h on the ground.
Flight data showed that the aircraft had to take off from the second landing and finally landed at about 20:40.
The delay caused delays on other flights, including Emirates flights from Dubai and Qantas flights from Sydney.
According to the forecast, temperatures in Adelaide will reach a maximum of 16 degrees Celsius on Tuesday, and there may be one or two storms.
Israeli children return to school after Gaza war
Thousands of Israeli children from areas near the Gaza Strip returned to school on Monday after spending the summer in anti-bombing houses, as their homes were hit by rockets and mines during the fifty-day war between Israel and Hamas.
The start of the school brought a sense of joy and excitement to the communities in southern Israel marked by attacks, but signs of fighting are still noticeable.
In Ashdod, a city in the south of the country, the staff of a schoolhouse hit by a rocket removed the remains from the wall and slowly await the return of the children.
“We’re a little scared, but we’re looking forward to it,” said Ronit Bart, a Kibucu Saad resident and English teacher at the local school.
A lot of children in this area really need to return to their daily routine.
Her 11-year-old daughter Shani Bart revealed that “it’s a bit strange” to go back to school.
“We had a few difficult moments and we didn’t leave the house at all,” she said.
Kibuc, located near the Gaza border, visited President Reuven Rivlin to offer his support to the people.
Until the ceasefire last week ended the war, thousands of residents of border settlements like Saad remained inside their homes or left their homes and headed to safer areas beyond Gaza to escape missiles and machine guns.
Many inhabitants of Nachal Oz, a village near the Gaza border where a fire from a Palestinian shell killed a four-year-old boy, hesitate to return.
The Ministry of Education said about twelve families have still not returned.
Their children were temporarily placed in replacement schools.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a school in Sderot, a city on the border with Gaza that was severely hit by Palestinian fires.
He encouraged children to study diligently, adding, “We will provide you with education and security.”
Israel and Hamas agreed on an unlimited peace treaty on Tuesday.
While the ceasefire resulted in an immediate end to the fighting, it did not solve key problems such as Hamas’ demands to end the Israeli-Egyptian blockade of Gaza and reopen Gaza’s airports and ports.
Israel demands the disarmament of Hamas and the return of the bodies of two soldiers killed in the war.
A new round of indirect negotiations is expected to begin later this month in Egypt.
According to estimates by the Palestinians and the UN, more than 2,100 Palestinians were killed in the war, three-quarters of whom were civilians and at least 494 children.
Israel disputes these figures and estimates that at least half of the killed were radicals, although there is no clear evidence for these claims.
On the Israeli side, 66 soldiers and six civilians were killed, including a Thai worker.
Hamas and other radicals from Gaza fired 4,591 rockets and missiles from the Gaza Strip during the fighting on Israeli cities, mainly in the south of the country.
The Israeli army, in turn, carried out more than 5,000 airstrikes and other attacks.
Israeli attacks have damaged or destroyed thousands of homes in Gaza, and an estimated 250,000 people have hidden in hundreds of UN schools that have become temporary shelters.
Due to tens of thousands of people still in shelters and ongoing fighting, school officials postponed the start of the school year last week.
“I hope the school will be opened soon so that we can complete education just like Jewish children and other children in the world,” said Mohammad Amara, a 13-year-old boy from a school in Gaza’s largest city.
I stand behind you, I stand behind you.
Lafatu suffers from temperature.
The Czech football team met in Prague on Wednesday before the preparatory match against the United States and the subsequent opening match of the qualification for the European Championship against the Netherlands.
From the twenty-three-member squad has trouble Spartan attacker David Lafata, who is troubled by the heat.
David is not here yet, but Sparta had some problems last week, there were more players and David still has a little bit of the problems.
But we want him here and he’s fine as soon as possible,” coach Pavel Vrba told reporters.
"Whether it's going to be two or three days, or if he's going to fit tomorrow, it's going to be determined by his health condition, which our doctor will decide," he said.
The other players are okay.
“Of course, someone has some pain, but it’s not that they can’t train or take part in a match against the United States on Wednesday,” he said.
On Sunday evening Vrba called as the last player of the Spartans defender Lukáše Váchu.
He acknowledged that it was not an easy decision, other midfielders were also taken into account.
I decided on the basis that Lukáš is a prospective player who is 25 years old.
The decision was very difficult, but I stand behind it,” Vrba said to Vách.
What about Shural?
Let’s see what happens to the latter.
It is not excluded that, in the event of health problems, the nomination could still change.
On the weekend with a great performance flashed, for example, Liberec Josef Šural, who gave a hattrick.
Of course, there are players who have shown shape lately.
We’ll see what David Lafata will do.
In the event that he will not be able to be available on Wednesday, I don’t say that I can’t dominate any of the players who took in the Czech league,” Vrba said.
This afternoon, the team will have a training session in Strahov, and on Tuesday, a classic pre-match training before a duel with the USA in the Summer, which will be open to fans and followed by an autogramiade.
The match with the Americans will be played on Wednesday from 20:15 and the national team in it will strive for the premiere victory under Vrba.
In the previous three preparatory matches he won two drawings and lost one.
The qualifying match against the Netherlands is scheduled for September 9 at 20:45.
Walking to the Netherlands in Italy
He is pleased that he has more time to train, unlike his predecessors.
It’s an advantage when you have players for eight days and you can practice certain things with them that we didn’t have so much time for before.
Now we will be able to focus only on preparing as well as possible for the Netherlands," Vrba said.
The Dutch will play in Italy on Thursday before the match in Prague and the duel will be personally watched by former temporary representative coach Josef Pešice.
He will give us information about the match.
But it’s not just about him, we’re going to have a game and we’re going to have a movie and we’re going to discuss it.
A new coach is coming to the Netherlands, we’ll see what changes there will be,” Vrba told the bronze medalists from the recent world championship.
According to high-profile statistics, the price of apartments in the winter period increased the most in the last seven years.
According to the apartment value index in the Australian capital, RP Data CoreLogic Hedonic, housing prices rose by 1.1 percent in August, the agency said on Monday.
The increase resulted in the overall increase in June, July and August to 4.2%, the highest increase in the winter months since 2007.
Annual price growth rose to 10.9%, more than doubling in one year until August 2013, but profits were not evenly distributed across the country.
RP Data Research Director Tim Lawless said Sydney and Melbourne are the market leaders.
RP Data figures show that apartment prices in Sydney last year increased by 16.1%, while prices in Melbourne by 11.7%.
Other strongest markets were Adelaide, Brisbane and Darwin, with prices rising on average between five and six percent.
On the other side of the scale was Canberra, which was damaged by the state's ordered spending cuts and where prices rose only 1.4 percent during the year.
Lawless said that as spring has now begun, the number of properties for sale will increase in the coming months, which will be a “real test” for the market.
“Given the persistently high rate of auction sales, the overall high rate of sales and the low interest rate, it is likely that the value of housing will continue to rise over the next three months,” he said.
Lenny Henry: My father never hugged me.
He never said “I love you.”
Henry was born in 1958 as one of seven children of Jamaican immigrants in Dudley, Midlands.
With their father, who died when Henry was 19, and who worked in a factory, they had a cooler relationship.
Henry tries a comedy, Rudy's Rare Records, which is partly based on an imaginary interview with his father and which is part of the Radio 4 series.
Soundtrack is a mixture of reggae and rap and the melody is optimistic.
Henry had to deal with some unpleasant childhood memories.
After his mother’s death, Henry underwent “deep” therapy and is now thinking about his relationship with his father.
He knew very little about him.
You have never seen his face, you have only heard his voice, “Stop this noise.
Leave my sister in peace.
Fuck it!
I want to watch cricket.
My older brothers Seymour and Hilton — when I was a child they were already adults — went to the bar with him and discussed things like the shape of a glass of beer or the beauty of a cricket hit.
I never spoke to him like that.
Most of my life it was a serious guy in the corner reading the newspaper.
Recently, Henry visited a casting factory in Dudley, and although the conditions were better than at his father’s time, he looked into what life had to be for him.
Today there’s a little more light there, but it’s still a dark, smoked, cloudy labyrinth where flames explode and there’s a lot of smoke and saws.
Daddy always walked into the bathroom and only lay there, then he could hear him slowly singing for himself because he was washing off the castor.
As I walked around, I realized that he had been doing this for years to feed his family, and I began to appreciate him more.
Still, Henry lived his childhood without parental love.
No one hugged me, no one said, “I love you.”
It was only when my mother was sick and dying that we started to say to ourselves, “I love you, I love you, I love you.”
His daughter Billie, whom he has with Dawn French, has allowed him to experience the love he missed as a child.
Can you stop saying “I love you”?
Do not always embrace me.
Dad, I am 22 years old!
With Dawn French.
Why not be friends?
She is a great mom
With French, with whom he has been married for 25 years, they are still good friends.
Dawn is nice.
Why shouldn’t we be friends with Dawn?
She is a great mom.
Henry’s own mother had diabetes.
It was one of the things that killed her.
So when I had a lot, a lot of overweight and symptoms of diabetes began to appear, the doctor told me, “You have to make a radical change.”
So I started going to a big fitness center and also had to stick to a drastic diet to get rid of the symptoms.
It is very difficult.
And tired.
No one wants to eat carrots.
The change in the direction of Henry’s career may be reflected in his elegant, short-cut beard.
After receiving recognition from critics for his Othello, he plunged into the theatre.
The Comedy of Mistakes and the Plots of August Wilson.
It’s a different experience than the sitcoms and comedies that filled his hectic working life.
He started when he was 16 and worked in a factory.
DJ noticed him on the stage parodying someone, and wrote about him to the talent contest New Faces.
His television career began in the mid-1970s: “For a long time I was the only black imitator/comedian on television.”
He studied on the march.
In addition to being noticed by the public, between 1975 and 1985, I also had to learn how to invent working jokes, be a star and perform on television, and that was really hard.
Lenny in New Faces, 1975
Since his manager owned the rights to the stage production of The Black and White Minstrel Show, an entertainment program in which actors dressed as blacks, Henry eventually performed in it with his comedy for five years.
My family has been upset for that.
I wish it never happened, but I do not regret it.
Although it was a strange and embarrassing position, I worked on big scenes and learned how to work with the crowd.
What was “for years and years the main product of British television”, but was also “a grotesque parody of blacks.”
In the 1980s, Henry worked in alternative comedy circles and introduced characters that both mocked and celebrated British black culture.
The first series The Lenny Henry Show began broadcasting in 1984, and in the 1990s he was known, among other things, as the chef Gareth Blacklock in the comedy series Chef!.
The next decades took him ads, documentaries, television series, and film roles, but after broadcasting his series LennyHenry.tv on the BBC in 2008, he said, “So what will you do now, Lene, it’s a bit like you’re stuck in one place, or you’re a bit off the road.”
Next up was a documentary show on Radio 4 called What's So Great About...?/What's So Great About...?
The first was Shakespeare.
I was allergic to Shakespeare.
We didn’t teach it at school and I thought it was something for the white middle class.
So I was afraid of it.
Everyone we interviewed on the show, Peter Hall, Trevor Nunn, Adrian Lester, Judi Dench, said, “You should try it.”
Don’t get involved if you don’t know what you’re talking about.
Try a few words and see why we all love Shakespeare so much.
Henry presented twenty lines of Othell’s final speech for the documentary, and he was already there.
It gave me the feeling that I could do it.
As if it gave me courage.
It’s a serious thing, take it seriously, learn the text, find out something about it.
So the test was tough, and before I read this game for months and months.
And it was a success.
They seemed to be in trouble, which did not happen.
He soon began to play in Comedy full of mistakes.
Suddenly I was at the National Theatre, I couldn’t believe it.
At one point I thought, “You’ve changed.”
There was a technical failure and Henry instinctively felt he had to take responsibility for seizing the audience.
“The sound in my head said, ‘Before the computer does it, you have to have 10 minutes of fun.’”
Instead, the theatre director announced that the show would continue as soon as the problem was resolved.
I left the stage and something inside me said, “Hm, thank God.”
It is not my responsibility.
Someone else can solve it for me.
“You play, so stay in the role.”
Henry at the Duchess Theatre
Learning the text of the Plots was a challenge.
Panic is pretty good, it adds determination.
The game was also well received, so it’s like a sign of God saying, “This is what you should do.”
He says it with a loud voice.
So I stay at that.
I really like it.
I like to test.
Henry still has a comedian’s brain – he interrupts our conversation all the time with humorous performances, when he enters and comes out of the role of an imitator.
I decided not to do stand-ups because having satisfaction from a room full of strangers is a bit dangerous, I would say.
If you are always looking for something, you may end up in a blind spot.
Sometimes, when I want to, I do Live at the Apollo, but I’m not as happy as before.
I asked if he would ever go on a stand-up tour.
The joy of sitting in the same room with the director helping to give out the contours of the beginning, middle, and end of the journey – I don’t think I’d ever want to give up on it.
Your new incarnation?
I think yes.
I enjoy acting.
It is fun.
You keep telling stories, which is great.
I love stories.
People love stories.
Kenya to Register Officials to Look At Non-Existent Employees
Kenya has begun biometric registration of all its government officials to try to remove non-existent employees from government payrolls.
According to a government statement, employees who do not register in the next two weeks will cease to receive pay.
The government believes that thousands of people get paid even after leaving the public service.
After taking office in 2013, President Uhuru Kenyatta vowed to prevent corruption in the state administration.
The audit conducted this year showed that the state is losing at least $1 million (£700,000) per month on payments for non-existent employees and further abuse of official powers.
The government suspects that salaries are still being deposited into bank accounts even after an employee dies or leaves the government, BBC reporter Wanyama Chebusiri said.
All government officials will have to arrive at the identification centers within the next two weeks, where their data will be recorded biometrically.
Anyone who does not appear without a sufficient apology will be removed from the payroll.
“By identifying actual public servants, this measure will significantly contribute to its economy and will also be used to clear the payroll at both levels of government, thus solving the problem of non-existent staff,” said Anne Waiguru, Secretary of Development and Planning.
Dozens of Turkish policemen arrested for “conspiracy” against government
Local media reports that a total of 33 police officers have been detained in Turkey on suspicion of “controversy against the government.”
Police have not yet commented on the case.
According to Hurriyet Daily News, 14 senior officials were among the detainees.
Some of them were involved in a corruption investigation in December that targeted government officials including four ministers.
In July, several Turkish police officers were arrested for allegedly organizing a criminal gang and telephone intercepting.
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan (at the time prime minister) described their actions as part of the action of Islamic cleric Fethullah Gülen against him and other people in power.
Not all children in Ukraine go back to school
Most schools in Ukraine reopened on Monday (1 September) after the summer holidays.
This day is traditionally important for families and, like thousands of other Ukrainian parents, Prime Minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk took his daughter to school.
On this occasion, he told reporters that not all schools had reopened, but that he was determined to defend the country for future generations:
There is no traditional September 1 ceremony in all schools.
There is no peace in Ukraine.
We must fight for peace.
The entire Ukraine, the united Ukrainian front, must fight for peace.
Alexan Pastukhov, a teacher at a school in Slavyansk attended by Yatsenyuk’s daughter, spoke in Russian.
We hope that peace will finally be achieved here and that children will gain knowledge that will be useful to them in the future.
The first day of school is traditionally celebrated by children wearing shirts, bringing balloons and giving flowers to teachers.
Ron Fairhead may have a BBC boss
He carries a cloud of fame from the world of banking, media management, and the Conservative Party’s internal conclave.
He has experience from the front lines.
She started her career at Bain and Co, then went through Morgan Stanley, Bombadier, ICI and into the media world of Pearsons.
She was chief executive officer of the Financial Times for seven years and resigned when her younger colleague took over the top position at Pearson's.
It is said that her withdrawal was close to a million pounds.
Its portfolio is also extensive.
She was recommended to David Cameron by Lord Browne, a former BP director, when Cameron in Whitehall needed private expertise: she became a counselor to the government office.
Her husband is a former city council member.
In May, I described the director’s work as a cup of poison.
Not only is the BBC a vast and intricate entity at the heart of public life, but there is also an internal paradox in its structure.
The corporation turns in two directions: into the top layer of the BBC’s own management hierarchy, but also out to the voice of the public in times of unrest when things don’t work.
This is an almost unsustainable monopoly that requires profound reform.
Which director would risk coming into a company as complex as the Chinese dynasty, dismantling it and thereby losing himself of his job.
It is a difficult challenge.
If it wasn’t that hard, a lot of people would love to see the BBC shrink – its power, its finances – and its status revised.
As competition expands and new technologies challenge old assurances, the immediate negotiation of concession fees carries great danger for the BBC.
For a modest amount of £145.50 a year, the British public buys a stake in something that is the largest media company in the world.
The BBC tells a good story: it claims that its production reaches 96% of households and each costs only 40 pence a day.
In addition, the popularity of the BBC is obviously rising: to 53% of supporters from 31% ten years ago.
BBC usage patterns have changed: Today, I see newspaper headlines on my mobile phone, and I can watch programs I’ve watched on iPlayer.
But the BBC remains a very beloved and amazing institution.
She needs a great director - I hope she has found one.
Texas Governor Perry Says He Has Not Approved Offensive Tweet
The tweet from Texas Governor Rick Perry’s official Twitter account, which was released on Sunday, contained an offensive picture of a Democratic attorney who initiated a criminal charge against Perry for abuse of power.
The tweet was later deleted and another tweet was posted on Perry’s account, which distanced itself from the previous one.
There was a tweet from my account that was not authorized.
“I disagree with the tweet and I have withdrawn it,” he said in another post.
Perry’s assistants did not respond to the messages with questions immediately.
Although the tweets were sent from Perry’s official account, it’s not clear who is actually responsible for his message.
The previous tweet posted an illusory, humorous picture of Travis County Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who was convicted in April 2013 for driving in drunkenness.
When she refused to resign, Perry refused to pay funds for her office, bringing Perry, a potential presidential candidate in the 2016 elections, before a large jury in Austin this month.
He tweeted, “I don’t always drive with a blood alcohol level three times higher than the permitted limit... but if I do, I regret Governor Perry calling on me to be held accountable for it.”
I am the drunkest Democrat in Texas.
The investigation against Perry was not conducted by the Lehmberg Office.
He was headed by Michael McCrum, a special prosecutor from San Antonio who was appointed by a Republican judge.
Perry was found innocent and called the charges a tactical, political manoeuvre.
His qualified legal team asked the judge overseeing the case to reject the charges because using the laws to prosecute the longest-serving governor in Texas history is unconstitutional.
Perry suspended the payment of $7.5 million from the state fund for the public interest department based in Travis County and prosecuting corruption in Texas after Lehmberg refused to resign.
The rejection sparked a formal complaint from a leftist group of civil activists.
Perry’s official account is active – and sometimes even becomes famous.
After finishing fifth in his party’s committee during his 2012 Iowa presidential campaign, Perry responded to speculations that he might already end up, tweeting with his own photo as he ran near the lake, and with the words, “Here I am, South Carolina!”
According to Berkeley, the housing market is “returning to normal”
One of London’s most prominent developers has warned that the housing market in Southeast England has “returned” to normal levels of activity.
Housing in the capital was subject to high demand and rising prices, and widespread concerns about the credit bubble prompted the Bank of England to introduce mortgage limits in June.
Tony Pidgley, founder and chairman of Berkeley’s demanding client development company, said on Monday, “Since the start of the current fiscal year, the market has returned to normal transaction levels from its peak point in 2013.”
London’s housing market went well during the decline, as foreign buyers flooded into the capital.
Last year alone, prices in the city jumped by 18.5%, far ahead of the average of 6.7% in England and Wales.
The average selling prices of private, affordable and student housing from Berkeley rose by about a fifth last year and climbed to £423,000 at the end of April.
However, due to the strengthening pound, London real estate is not so attractive to foreign buyers in recent months – some of them have also been intimidated by the introduction of new property taxes and the talk of a possible “residential tax” that politicians have come up with ahead of the next May parliamentary elections.
London real estate agency Foxtons warned last week that the April mortgage market review, which introduced stricter rules for loans, will also slow the growth rate in the real estate sales and prices during the second half of the year.
New data from the Bank of England on Monday showed a drop in the amount of mortgages approved for the month of July, suggesting that the housing market is calming down.
Hamptons International, another real estate firm, has lowered its forecast for London real estate prices growth for 2015 to 3 percent, based on the fact that home prices have already begun to fall.
According to real estate agency WA Ellis, the volume of transactions in London’s most expensive neighborhoods such as Chelsea, Mayfair and Kensington decreased by a quarter each year.
Still, the demand for housing in the capital was a blessing for Berkeley, as it increased cash for forward sales to more than £2.2 billion.
Pidgley added: “The demand for the right, well-looking home in a good location has remained the same and this has kept forward sales.”
In June, the company said it sold 3,742 properties between the beginning of the year and the end of April, almost a third more than before the peak of the crisis in 2007.
Annual pre-tax profits increased by 40% to £380 million, and revenue by 18% to £1.6 billion.
On Monday before Pidgley’s annual meeting, he said that Berkeley’s annual revenue is expected to be in line with current market expectations.
Analysts agree that the annual profit before taxes will be £450 million.
The Berkeley stock stalled at 23.96 pounds on the London Stock Exchange.
Hackers post photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence
Jennifer Lawrence arrives at the 85th Academy Awards.
Photos of Oscar winner Jennifer Lawrence have leaked to the internet because of a hacker who claimed to have a “list” of photos of hundreds of other beginner actresses.
A spokesman for the star of "Hunger Games" confirmed that Lawrence's photos are authentic and criticized the hacker for "evident breach of privacy."
Authorities have already been contacted and will prosecute anyone who publish the stolen photos of Jennifer Lawrence.
The hacker’s photos, which were originally posted on the image sharing server 4chan, were allegedly obtained thanks to a gap in Apple’s iCloud internet storage system. The alleged list of photos of victims hacked by BuzzFeed includes the names of dozens of stars including Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Mary Elizabeth Winstead and Mary-Kate Olsen.
It is unclear how many of the photos are authentic, but the star of “Scott Pilgrim against the rest of the world” Winstead also criticized the act on Twitter.
“I hope those of you who look at the photos we took years ago with my husband in private at home are happy with themselves,” Winstead wrote on Twitter.
Victoria Justice, known for Nickolodeon's cable television series "iCarly" and "Victorious", denied that the photos were authentic.
It’s better to put it down in a slide. —A deliberate speech game.
Buzzfeed on Sunday evening that a spokesman for pop star Ariana Grande denied that the alleged photos were authentic.
Howard Jackson's new novel about love and the letter "J"
They dissolved, that’s the best way to describe it, gradually breaking up like a cardboard box someone left in the rain.
Only from time to time, a woman told him that he was too serious, complicated, sharp, isolated, and a little annoying.
Then she shrugged his hand.
You barely admitted it.
He could bite like an eagle, yes.
The last sacrifice of his ability was the beginning of a love plethora, which more than usual promised to relieve him from the lonely boredom of life and provide him with some satisfaction.
Ailinn Solomons was a fragile beauty with wild hair and a flying heart from a village on the northern island that was even more remote and hostile than Port Reuben.
To the south she came with an older companion, who Kevern thought was her aunt, who inherited a possession in a moist but beautiful valley called, casually, Paradise Valley.
No one lived in the house for years.
The tubes flowed, the dead spiders were in the baths, the slugs signed onto the windows as if they thought the place belonged to them, the garden had grown, and the weeds resembled the gigantic cabbage.
The house looked like a cottage from childhood stories, frightening and at the same time charming, with a garden full of secrets.
Author profile: Howard Jacobson, whose novel “J” is on the preliminary list of nominations for the 2014 Man Booker Prize.
A closer selection will be announced next week.
Kevern and Ailinn were sitting on a folding chair in the long grass, holding hands, enjoying an unexpectedly warm spring afternoon, in the absence of a public station that supplied the countryside with comforting music and reassuring news, when the sight of her sunny crossed legs reminded him of the old song of a long-forgotten black comedian whom his father liked to listen to with his roofs.
You have too big legs.
Because of their natural aggressiveness, these songs were not played on the radio.
They were not forbidden – there was really nothing forbidden – they simply didn’t play.
They helped them get into the desuetudo, as did the word desuetudo itself.
The popular taste has done what regulations and out-of-law positions would never do, and just as people choose memoirs in which the poor man becomes a rich man, cookers and love novels, so ballads are chosen in music.
Kavern let the day go and began to play the imaginary piano and, with a rough, comic voice, sang a serenade to Aillini's big feet.
Ailinn did not understand.
“It was a favorite song from jazz pianist Fat Waller,” he said, automatically attaching two fingers to his lips.
His father always did this when he wanted to suppress the letter j before it came out of his mouth.
It started like a game when he was still a kid.
His father told him he was playing with his father.
If you didn’t put two fingers in the mouth of a word that started with j, it cost you a penny.
It wasn’t funny then, and it wasn’t funny now.
He knew he was expecting it, that was all.
He had to explain what jazz was.
Ailinn never heard of anyone.
Even jazz, though not directly built out of the law, did not play.
Improvisation is out of fashion.
There is only one “if” in life.
When she started playing the melodies, people wanted to know exactly where she would end.
Same with humor.
His unpredictability got people nervous.
And jazz was humor expressed by song.
Although he hadn’t heard of Sammy Davis Junior until he was ten, Kevern knew jazz from his father’s semi-secret collection of old CDs.
At least, Aillin did not have to say that Fats Waller was a black man.
Because of her age, she couldn’t remember a time when her favorite singers weren’t blacks.
Without laws or pressure.
A casual society is one in which every part of it agrees with gratitude – with the gratitude of those who were happy to be saved – with the principle of group gratitude.
People of African-Caribbean origin with temperament and constitution were suitable for entertainment and athletics, so they sang and ran.
People originally from the Indian subcontinent, seemingly naturally gifted with electronics, have assumed responsibility for ensuring that no family will be without a functional phone.
The Poles who remained were waterworkers, the Greeks who remained were washers of dishes.
Those from the Gulf and Levant states, whose grandparents did not quickly leave the country while they did THAT HAVE Happened If it Happened – they were afraid to be accused of putting them in the fire, in fact they were afraid that the fire would consume them the next time – they opened restaurants where the labneh was sold and smoked water smoke, did not notice themselves and inactivity slowly consumed them.
Everyone according to his talent.
As she listened only to ballads, Ailinn could hardly understand how the stupid words Kavern had just sung could have created music.
Music is an expression of love.
“They’re not stupid,” Kevern said.
For those who have too big legs.
My dad never offended anyone, but he loved this song.
He spoke too much, but the neglected garden provided the illusion of security.
A single word could not escape from the sound.
Ailinn did not understand.
Why would your father like this?
He wanted to say it was a joke, but he was reluctant to put two fingers to his mouth in her presence.
She thought he was strange.
“It seemed funny,” he said at the end.
Incredibly, she shaken her head and overshadowed Kevern's sight.
All over the world, there was nothing to see but the melting of her haunted hair.
He did not want to see anything else.
“If you think,” she said doubtingly.
It doesn’t explain why I sing it.
She looked really angry.
Do I have too big legs?
He looked again.
Not the walk at all.
Maybe a bit of ankle.
You say you hate me because I have too thick ankles?
I hate ?
It is not true.
It’s just a stupid song.
He could say, “I love you,” but it was too early.
“Your thick ankles just attract me,” he tried.
I am a bit sluggish.
It did not work.
He wanted to be funny.
When he wanted to be funny, it often put him in trouble, because, like his father, he lacked the magic necessary to curb the cruelty hidden in the jokes.
Maybe his father was cruel intentionally.
Per he was intentionally cruel.
In spite of kind eyes.
Ailinn Solomons stumbled and got up from her bed, dropped the radio and poured out the untouched wine.
It was wine, so it wasn’t drinking.
She seemed to tremble in her upset like palm leaves in a storm.
“I’m so lucky that you’re a fool,” she said.
Except that doesn’t attract me.
He felt sorry for her, both for her reluctant words and for the fear she had in her eyes when she stood against him.
Did he think he would hit her?
She didn’t talk to him about life on the cold northern peninsula where she grew up, but he didn’t doubt that it was basically the same as here.
The same wide and icy ocean shattered them.
The same confused men, after THAT HAPPENED, even more discreet and frightened than their ancestors, smugglers and casheads, wandered angrily from pub to pub, ready to stretch their hand on any woman who dared to reject them or laugh at them.
The idiot?
If she does not pay attention, they will show her their fingers!
First to anoint her - anointing became the most common expression for erotic irritation between a man and a woman: the antibody of the faint ballads of love that the radio whistled - first they anointed her, then they ate one murderer.
In Kevern’s view, too much cultivation, because kissing itself was an act of violence.
Ailinn Solomons never verbally suggested him to leave.
He stood up like an old man.
She felt upset, but the weight of her sorrow surprised her.
It was not the end of the world.
They barely knew.
She watched him leave—as if she had watched him out of the window on the ground floor—a man who was caught by what he himself had caused.
Adam, leaving the garden, thought.
Her heart was shaken because of him and because of all the men in general, regardless of the fact that a few of them beat her.
The man turned away from her, with his shoulders lifted, ashamed, defeated, all the fighting left him—why did it seem to her that she knew this look well, even though she could not afford a single moment, until today, that she had ever seen it?
Ailinn Solomons, once again alone, looked at her feet.
About twenty years after these events, Esme Nussbaum, an intelligent and enthusiastic thirty-two-year-old researcher working at Ofnow, a non-statutory Public Mood Monitoring System, prepared a short article on the persistence of mild and moderate acts of violence in areas of the country where its mitigation or direct stop was most expected if enough money and energy had been spent on its elimination.
“A lot has been done, and much has yet to be done,” she wrote, “to calm down the innate aggressiveness of people who fought in many battles and won most of them, especially in the hollow, hard-to-reach places of the country, where, despite the peaks of church towers rising above live fences, the shade of human kindness has historically rarely appeared.”
However, some things are irreplaceable.
It might seem that the higher the church tower, the lower the instincts.
The inhabitants shudder over sentimental ballads, swallow unfortunate stories, and declare that they firmly believe in the value of marriage and family life, but not only that in rural areas the old brutality is held as stubbornly as in urban agglomerations, but evidence also shows that new and offensive intolerance is emerging at home, at work, on the roads and even at the sports fields.
“Unfortunately, you tend to be too flowery,” her supervisor said.
I would suggest you read fewer novels.
Esme Nussbaum bowed her head.
I also have to ask: Are you an atheist?
“I feel like I don’t have to answer,” Esme Nussbaum said.
Are you lesbian?
Esme once again defended her right to privacy and silence.
A feminist?
Another silence.
“I’m not asking,” Rabinowitz said, “that I have anything against atheists, lesbians, or feminists.
There is no prejudice in this workplace.
We serve unprejudiced societies.
But a certain kind of hypersensitivity, which in itself is absolutely acceptable and praiseworthy, can sometimes distort judgment as you have shown it.
Obviously you yourself are prejudiced toward the Church – things that you call “cruel” and “brutal” might be interpreted by others as expressions of natural power and energy.
Still addressing WHAT HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE.
As Rabinowitz spoke, Esme Nussbaum looked around.
Behind his head on the lightboard blinked pink recommendations that Ofnow had been broadcasting to the world for the last quarter century or more.
Smile at your neighbor, take care of your partner, listen to ballads, go to musicals, use your phone, talk, explain, agree, apologize.
Speaking is better than silence, singing is better than writing, but there is nothing better than love.
"I fully understand your reservations," answered Esme Nussbaum quietly, as she was sure that her superior had quit, "and I do not say that the wound has not healed as we say it has healed.
My concern is, above all, that if we are not warned in advance, we will repeat the same mistake that led to WHAT HAVE HAVE HAVE HAVE HAPPENED.
This time, however, we will not vent your anger and distrust on others.
Luther Rabinowitz joined the fingertips.
It meant endless patience.
“You go too far,” he said, “when you describe the steps your grandparents may have taken and may not have done as mistakes.
You go too far in talking about ventilating your “fury” and “dissidence” on “other.”
I should not remind anyone in your place that in understanding the past and protecting the present we are not talking about “us” and “them.”
There was no “we” and there was no “they.”
We only know that it was a chaotic time.
“During which, if we are honest with each other,” Esme took courage, “no one is innocent.
I blame no one.
Whether it was fair or not, what happened, happened.
That was before.
There is nothing to add to this, we agree.
And just as there is no guilt that can be seduced on anyone, there are no things that should be corrected, even if the remedy is appropriate and possible.
But what else is the past to us than to learn from it.
The past exists to be forgotten.
If I can add something –
Luther Rabinowitz disconnected his fingers.
“I’ll take your message into consideration,” he said and released her.
The next day, as usual, when she went to work, she was struck by a motorcyclist who ran on the sidewalk in a way passers described as “brutal and furious.”
Coincidences happen.
Lesotho army says no coup is planned, prime minister remains in South Africa
Military officers in the Kingdom of Lesotho denied organizing a coup to overthrow the government and claimed to have acted against the police suspected of trying to arm political fanatics.
Prime Minister Thomas Thabane has fled the country and says the military has surrounded his official headquarters and occupied government buildings in the capital Maser.
After declaring that he was threatened with death, the prime minister and his family moved to neighboring South Africa.
Army spokesman Major Ntlele Ntoi said it was not actually a coup, but an army response to the threat of “political fanatics” the police were trying to arm themselves.
“Today morning, the Defence Command of the Kingdom of Lesotho acted after receiving several intelligence reports that there are several groups in the ranks of the police that are planning to arm some radical, political fanatics who are about to make a trigger in the country,” he told the Voice of America.
South African government spokesman Clayson Monyela said the military action looked like an attempt to overthrow the government.
“Al no one has claimed to have seized government power by force, the actions of Lesotho’s defence forces appear to be marked by a coup d’état,” he said.
Military officials of the Kingdom of Lesotho said the soldiers returned to their barracks on Sunday and there was peace in the capital.
During Thaban’s absence, Deputy Prime Minister Mothetjoa Metsing will be in charge of the government.
Thabane said he believed he was the target of the attack because of his efforts to fight corruption in the country.
Since June, when Thabane suspended parliamentary meetings due to internal disputes, tensions have reigned in Lesotho.
He stated that despite the opposite claims, he does not undermine his actions to the government.
Eurozone production at 13 month low
Production growth in the eurozone slowed to a thirteen-month low in August, according to a carefully monitored survey.
The final Purchase Managers Index (PMI) in the eurozone fell from 51.8 in June to 50.7 in August.
A number greater than 50 indicates expansion.
A shortage of new orders and factories damaged rising tensions between the EU and Russia over Ukraine.
The figures came from the European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on Thursday.
Markets will need a clear plan from the bank to deal with a delayed recovery in the euro area and the threat of deflation with inflation stagnating at 0.3%.
There has been speculation that ECB President Mario Draghi may have suggested this week that he is considering a quantitative easing of the eurozone, similar to what the UK and the U.S. took during the financial crisis.
“Al at least some growth is better than no growth, the braking effect that the growing economy and geopolitical uncertainty has on manufacturers is still more visible,” said Rob Dobson, chief economist at Markit.
Germany’s manufacturing PMI, Russia’s largest trading partner in the EU, fell to an eleven-month low of 51.4.
In the second largest economy of the zone, France, the PMI fell to 46.9.
There is concern about France, Italy has moved from expansion to stagnation.
The signs that the driving force of growth in the most important industrial areas in Germany, Spain and also the Netherlands has disappeared are also not very reassuring," Dobson said.
The slowdown in the industry is likely to add oil to the fires of analysts expecting the implementation of additional monetary or tax incentives.
One positive report came from the Republic of Ireland, where the PMI rose to 57.3, the highest level since the end of 1999.
Howard Archer, chief economist at IHS Global Insight, said: “The best thing to say about the August production survey of purchasing managers is that it shows that the sector is still growing.”
Producers in the eurozone are currently facing a very difficult life as rising geopolitical tensions – especially between Russia and Ukraine – add to the increasingly difficult conditions in many countries even more uncertainty.
This increasing uncertainty has proved to have hit the business – primarily consumer confidence, which is likely to cause some orders to be postponed or even cancelled, especially those expensive.
He said it seems “even more likely” that the ECB will eventually have to carry out some form of quantitative easing, “although we expect it to be limited.”
Ten years of hell survivors from Beslan: Ten years after the horrors of occupied school children still suffer
Ten years ago, a thousand people were held hostage by Chechen radicals at a school in Beslan, southern Russia.
During the three-day struggle that shocked the world, more than 330 people were killed, more than half of whom were children.
We returned to Beslan to look for some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity
Exactly ten years after the terrifying occupation of the school in Beslan, which killed 334 people, including 186 children, survivors warned last night of a new apocalypse in Ukraine.
When on September 1, 2004, at the beginning of the new school year, fanatical terrorists captured and murdered children and parents, it looked like the deepest bottom of hell.
Resistance to the tragedy united the East and the West, which in this catastrophic disaster led to action and future.
After ten years, we returned to Beslan, in southern Russia, to find some of the victims who escaped death during the school atrocity.
We found amazing young people who resisted disaster, even though the memory of the hell caused by terrorists in them will live on.
What is their greatest wish?
That the war that now destroys Ukraine – and in which children like them are dying – has ended.
A girl trying to get back into a destroyed school gym
She was captured by the leading Russian photographer Dmitry Beliakov as he tries to get back into the bombed school gym after a bomb exploded there.
Aida was desperately looking for her mother, Larissa, who is now forty.
They feared they were both dead, but they actually survived.
“A woman told me to run away and save my life, but I couldn’t,” said Aida.
My legs were of blood.
I got up and went back to find my mom.
A soldier saved her.
After several operations, she thought she had fully recovered, but yesterday she said, “Three months ago, the pain came back.
I am afraid I will have to have another operation.
I had a piece of sting in my knee.
Her goal is to become a dentist so that she can help people just as doctors helped her.
“This tragedy changed my life, but it definitely didn’t ruin it,” she said resolutely.
“It just happened to me and it cannot be changed.
I go to the gym once a year to remember those who stayed there.
I try not to talk about it with my friends.
The pain is too big.
My best friend and future classmate Jeru Gapoev were killed there.
When we were young, we played together and imagined how we would go to school together.
“I don’t want to get married until I finish school and start my career.
I’ll think about my family later.
She says she hasn’t forgotten the captivity, but her memories fade a bit each year.
I’m glad that so many people around the world still remember what happened, and we’re so grateful for the help we’ve received from Britain and other countries.
When I look at my photo on the internet as I climb the school window, I think a lot of people will see it for the first time, understand the disaster and prevent it from happening again.
The boy who escaped the bullet rain and believed his mother was dead
It was his first school day (in Russia children start school at seven) and he survived a three-day siege of the school in the embrace of his mother, Tamara.
At the time, the seven-year-old said, “Mama told me that if there was an explosion, I should lie down on the floor and hold her hand.”
After the explosion, he thought his mother was dying.
She said to him, “Flee.”
He feared she was dead, ran away and on the way saw crying babies, grabbed the child by the hand and ran away with a splash of bullets.
His father Vladimir, who caught him outside, said, “Damir told me that his mother is dead.”
He said, “I couldn’t save her.”
In fact, Tamara was on her way to freedom, lying in the hospital with her leg injured, thinking that her son had died.
After they met again, she said, “I was crying out of happiness.
I could not believe it.
He came in and embraced me.
Damir then flew to London (according to the disappeared News of the World), where he was declared the winner by then Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie Bernardo's Children.
“That horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it,” he said yesterday.
But I can say that the memories are gone.
I remember throwing out all my guns to play.
Today, I can play computer games in which they shoot, and I have no problem with it.
“I’m not afraid to go back to the gym, but I don’t think about myself.
I remember the children with whom I played in the yard and who didn’t get out.
We will never say that they were killed or that they died.
We say they stayed in the gym.
I remember the trip to London well, especially how I could choose whatever I wanted in the toy shop, and how I drove a cabriolet.
But now he’s worried about places like Ukraine, where he suffered as much because of the war as he and his friends suffered.
That horror comes back every day, but I wish I could stop thinking about it.
“I am very sorry for anyone who has to go through such horrors,” says Damir, who participated in volunteering at the monastery last week.
I want to help a lot.
One day I want to work for the police and I hope to be admitted to the academy next year.
His mother, Tamara, 48, says: “They killed 37 children from our neighborhood, can you imagine it?
I remember that silence immediately after the attack.There were no children everywhere screaming and running here, and that silence lasted for several months.
He remembers his trip to London with Damire.
When I told our story in London, people were crying.
Then I realized how people on the other side of the world can understand our feelings and how they can express their support.
She was grateful to Cherie Blair and her foundation for the award and for the opportunity to go to London in the fall of 2004.
I wish I could call Cherie and personally tell her that even though it’s been ten years, I still remember meeting her and her husband in London and how they helped me and Damir.
I remember Damir’s appetite for borsch, so they called all the Russian restaurants.
I also remember playing with the waiters in the restaurant, Damir shooting at them from a water gun and they ran away and played with him.
And it was only a month since that horror.
I was surprised how the British wanted to share our pain with us and how they supported us.
She said, “I still think the world hasn’t changed for the better in the last ten years.
Now there is war in Ukraine, people are dying every day and I think there have been and many children will be killed.
They are the same children as ours.
I think for many people, war is just something in the news they listen to when they get bored or while doing something else.
I know what these people are experiencing, what horror it is.
I still feel it.
Nothing has changed, people still want to kill each other, it’s so sad.
Damir has grown up and is a kind and quiet boy, not aggressive or angry at all.
He doesn’t want revenge, he doesn’t care about it.
I know he doesn’t like to remember it, but he’s very close to six classmates and from time to time he’s going to the gym and lighting candles.
When he was younger, he had problems with it – I remember sometimes lying on the couch with his face turned away from us and sometimes lying for hours.
He wasn’t sleeping, his eyes were open.
I also remember throwing out all his pistols or other weapons to play. Damirov is today 17, he is higher than me, nice, smart and healthy.
I can hardly believe that I was sure for hours that he was dead and that I would never see him again.
When I recovered from the explosion and got up on my feet, I looked around and saw that hell, pieces of human bodies lying everywhere.
I was absolutely sure that my son had no chance to survive this hell.
“I remember shouting ‘Damire, run, run!’ but I was convinced he didn’t hear me.
He heard it and ran away.
So our life goes on unlike others.
Grigorij Ilyin, 17
The boy whose photo after the attack became a symbol of horror in Beslan
Consolation: Survivor of Beslan Grigorij Ilyin with his mother Fatima after the 2004 attack, right Grigorij today
While he was fleeing his life after a Chechen terrorist shot his classmates, fear was wrapped in his bloody face.
His photo was one of the most shocking symbols of atrocity in Beslan.
His mother, Fatima, 54, a doctor, drove him out of school on his first day and rushed to take his eldest son, Vladimir, to university.
“I left two minutes before the terrorists broke into the courtyard, so my boy stayed there alone for three days,” she recalled.
Not completely alone, because we had relatives there, but all died there.
Only Grigorij survived.
As this date approaches, it’s increasingly difficult to think and talk about it.
There will not be a day without remembering this tragedy.
It doesn’t seem to us that it happened a long time ago, I feel like it was yesterday, some moments still come back to me.
I promise that no one will ever forget.
Still returning memories: Grigoria’s photo (left) was one of the most shocking images of the attack and was eternalized as a statue (right)
I remember that day Grigorij was looking forward to school, saying he wanted to embrace his teacher.
That he was alive, I learned when I saw him on TV.
In San Marino there is a statue of the crying Gregory.
Grigorij does not like to look at the photo and we have it hidden in the library.
I understand it, but I also think that thanks to this picture, people around the world know the pain we feel.
Today Grigorij says: “The important thing is that this doesn’t happen again.
I doubt we will ever find out the truth.
Similar tragedies are still being investigated, but the truth will never be found out.
The Boeing crash in Ukraine is being investigated.
Will we ever find out what was the cause?
The world is waiting for something very bad.
“I don’t understand why this is happening, because when you ask people, no one wants war, how is it possible?
Ten years is nothing for such pain.
To forget at least a little, it takes decades.
It has affected my health, I still feel it.
I had nightmares for three or four years because of the attack, but then it improved.
When I went back to school in 2004, I was scared every day.
I thought of my friends and classmates who were killed.
So, as September 1 approaches, I go to the gym.
I would like to pay tribute to my childhood friends.
It’s hard for me to get into the gym, but I have to.
I don’t feel like a victim, this story is the past.
I will not forget it, but I do not regret it.
My life goes on.
This year I finished school and started studying medicine at the University of Vladikavkaz.
I want to be a cardiologist.
I wanted to join the army first.
I wanted to be a soldier, but I couldn’t because of my health.
I wanted to fight for my country, but I couldn’t.
Grogorij Farniyev, 20
The boy who survived, even though he was held by the killing terrorist's legs
Miracle: Gregory Farniyev was held at the feet of the killer terrorist during the attack, but still managed to survive
When the attack was in full swing, he was caught imprisoned in a gym as he sat next to a bomb at the feet of a killing terrorist.
It was a miracle that he survived.
“It seems to us as if it was yesterday,” said Gregory, who wanted to become an agent of the Federal Security Service but could not because of the injuries he suffered during the attack.
It’s still with me, it’s not something I’ve thrown in my head.
Now I’m older and it’s said that kids can cope better with bad experiences – I have to say that’s not true.
“I went to a psychologist in 2006 and then I felt a little better, but I can’t forget.
I would like to forget.
In 2005 – a year ago – it was the first and last time I entered the gym again.
I fainted .
I’ll never go there again and don’t ask me to show you where I’m sitting on that well-known picture.
Survivor: Gregory Farniev today, on a laptop with his photo taken in the hospital after the attack
The pain is huge and I carry it with me every day.
My friends know I don’t like to think or talk about it, and they never ask me to go to school.
As for my physical health, I am fine.
I have to be careful about my knee, which I’ve hurt, but I’m already walking normally.
But still, because of my health, I could not enter and study at the FBS Academy in St. Petersburg as I wanted.
I sent them my documents, including medical reports, and they answered that this was not possible.
My hobby is animals, so I went to the veterinarian.
I worked there the second year.
They learn how to treat all animals from “cat to cow”.
He said, “I know I will never explain this to my children.
It’s not something children should know about, and not something they should experience at all.
His mother, Marina, 42, said: “The pain here will always be.
It is inside and worsening with the approaching anniversary.
I will take part in the commemorative ceremony.
I know that Grigorij will not go.
It must be even stronger for him, because he was there unlike me.
I was waiting for him at home and couldn’t help him.
I am so grateful to God that he returned it to me here in Beslan.
It remains with us.
Gregory is now an adult, but he still carries the horror.
It’s hard to accept when something so terribly unfair happens to you.
He’s a boy, he loves sports, but he can’t do it because of his knee.
He has undergone several operations, can walk, but can’t exercise.
I would say that 50% has already surpassed that horror, but it is impossible to overcome it completely and forget it.
This terrible experience will always be with us.
During the attack, many of our friends and neighbors were killed and this only makes the pain worse.
I lost a lot of people I loved and who were close to me.
My son is with me and this is the greatest gift God could give me, but it hurts me the loss of those killed.
I know families in which other children were born, but also widows who never married again.
It’s hard to accept that life goes on even if you don’t want to.
I will never forget how my heart almost jumped out of my chest when I saw him in the hospital.
Now I observe what is happening in the world – wars elsewhere.
What are these people fighting for?
Why are they killing each other?
The war is now approaching our country, which I can hardly believe.
In the past we were a friendly country, so how did we get to fight together now?
People and children are suffering, I am sure that many children in Ukraine have been and will still be killed.
If we could gather all those rebels and throw them away – as far as possible.
Alyona Tskaeva, 10
The child brought to safety by a special commando
Rescued: Alyon Tskayev is carried to the secure Russian Special Command (left).
Now she is ten (right) and she does not remember the tragedy at all.
The world was stunned in 2004 when the little Alyon was taken out of beslan captivity by a Russian police officer.
The terrorists released her, but kept her 30 year old mother, 10-year-old sister Kristina and brother Makhara captive in the school gym.
Makhar, who was three years old at the time, escaped, but Alyon's mother and sister died in the massacre.
Her brother Ruslan has married again and with their new wife Svetlana they have a girl named Kristina after their dead daughter.
Neighbors say that Alyona, who is now ten, doesn’t remember the attack at all and grew out of her a bright and happy girl.
A close friend stated that “it’s a big happy family and Alyona and Makhar are great kids.”
Ruslan is an excellent father and wants to keep the kids away from the memories he reminds of his 10th anniversary.
You can understand why.
Man accused of killing a girl on the transition to the sign in Fife village
A seventy-eight-year-old man faces trial for beating a three-year-old girl on a sign in the village of Fife.
Gordon Stewart allegedly struck the girl on a crossing in Pittenween, East Neuk.
The plaintiffs claim that Stewart did not drive his Audi Q3 with sufficient care and attention and injured the girl.
Stewart (78) of Anstruther denied the charges at the Dundee court.
Judge Charles Macnair set a deadline for the trial.
4 Tips to Make Better Photos and Videos Underwater
If you are interested in photographing or shooting underwater, you have a large selection of equipment at your disposal.
The cheapest option is a compact camera such as the Nikon Coolpix AW120 or a GoPro Hero3+ Silver Edition outdoor camera, which costs around $300.
I took these photos at a family party with several cameras, all of which cost less than $350.
It doesn’t matter what equipment you use, but there are a few rules that apply to the best results.
Check the equipment.
Even if you have a waterproof camera, make sure the batteries and other parts are tightly sealed.
Additionally, adjust the camera according to the type of photos or videos you are taking.
Some cameras and video cameras have a scenic or shooting mode that optimizes exposure for dark underwater environments.
And before you get into it, find out how deep you can dive with your equipment.
Some cameras are designed to be up to 5 feet, others up to 50 to 60.
Read our guide to buying and evaluating digital cameras in both conventional and waterproof designs.
Always take a few pictures – a lot of them don’t work out.
Compact cameras have LCDs to help you compose photos, but outdoor cameras don’t.
Even if you have an LCD, underwater will be poorly seen and the composition of the shot will be unpredictable.
Always take more pictures.
If the camera has a bracketing mode that makes a series of shots with slightly different exposure diffusion, take advantage of that.
Stay close to the level.
With deeper sinking the light decreases significantly.
If possible, stay in the pool, lake or sea close to the level.
This also allows you to capture more light on photos – the deeper you sink, the fewer colors you see.
Get close to the photographed object.
This is a great advice if you are photographing on land, but underwater is even more important because of the dimmer light.
This is especially important if you are shooting with an outdoor camera: Such devices usually have a fixed and wide lens angle, which means that if you want to fill the photo frame, you need to get closer to the objects.
Andrew Lawson was a man whose power of personality was able to change things even in such a huge organization as the NHS.
As an anesthesiologist, he dedicated his career to relieving the sick from the pain caused by illness and treatment.
His wife recalls that one of the people who sought his help was an MI6 officer who had to live with the consequences of the torture that crushed him.
Lawson understood that while doctors focus on diagnosis and disease, the overwhelming majority of treated patients are interested in something completely different: pain.
But one day in 2007, it was he who began to suffer.
“I don’t feel in my own skin,” he wrote in May of that year.
I felt without energy.
He struggled with the symptoms of the flu and found him impatient and his wife Juliet included with regrets.
He said, “I want everything to happen sooner than later.”
When Juliet went on a business trip for a week, Lawson was unusually and unexplainably upset.
Something was wrong.
He took a X-ray of his chest.
Two weeks ago, he was skiing in the French Alps.
X-ray results have arrived.
He had a mesothelioma, an incurable tumor that affects the pleura or lungs.
For most cancers, it is difficult to determine what caused them.
Although some smokers get lung cancer, not all patients with lung cancer smoked.
Mesothelioma is different.
Almost in all cases, the cause is exposure to asbestos – a building fiber material that was previously referred to as “miracle”, but today it is known to be deadly.
For most of us, it was not difficult to ignore mesothelioma.
Asbestos belongs to the past.
The most dangerous type of asbestos has not been used in Britain since the 1960s, when the ban on the use of asbestos in industry came into effect.
Even when asbestos was used, only certain groups of people came into close contact with it, such as insulators, builders, carpenters and shipyards.
The toxin used in the industry in a different era is hardly a cause for concern today.
Such selfishness is not in place.
As it turns out, a mesothelioma epidemic is culminating in Britain today.
Mesothelioma deaths are higher here than in any other country in the world.
2,500 deaths per year from this disease are twice as many as the number of deaths in car accidents.
Deaths from mesothelioma annually since 1980 and estimated future deaths in the UK
The reason why we are only feeling its effects now, although the use of asbestos has been illegal for years (all types of asbestos were eventually banned by law in 1999), is that it usually takes several decades before mesothelioma develops.
The poem in the form of mesothelioma does not only affect veterans of the construction industry.
Asbestos has been, and in many cases still is, present in the homes where we live, in the offices where we work, in the schools where we study, and in the shops where we shop.
Therefore, mesothelioma does not respect social class, wealth, profession or age.
Privileged bastions from London business houses to public schools are not shelters.
The house is full of asbestos.
Even the hospitals where we should be treated are warehouses of this deadly carcinogen.
Andrew Lawson was not old.
He did not insulate.
He tried to find out where he could have come into contact with asbestos.
Then he came to it.
"It's possible that a lot of asbestos was in the basement hallways of Guy's Hospital, where I spent six years in practice," he wrote.
Everyone—students, nurses, doctors and doorkeepers—used the hallways.
The question is, how many of my contemporaries will get the same disease?
Unfortunately, this was a question that he was able to answer in part.
“Of the four doctors who have been in practice at Guy’s Hospital and who have since developed mesothelioma over the past five years,” he noted in a letter in 2010, “I am the only one still alive.”
How many of us get sick?
Andrew Lawson was diagnosed with mesothelioma when he was 48.
When he died on February 17, he was 55.
Surviving with this diagnosis for so long is not usual.
55 percent of people diagnosed with mesothelioma die within eight months of being diagnosed.
Disease is always fatal.
So now we can only repeat Lawson’s question: “How many of us will have the same disease?”
According to the leading British mesothelioma expert Professor Julian Pete, the best estimate is that between 1970 and 2050, when the asbestos epidemic in Britain takes place, about 90,000 people will die.
Most of them currently have no idea that they will die in this way.
Asbestos Mine in Quebec, Canada
A concise look at the archives of the courts, to which disabled people often turn and demand compensation, shows how much the mesothelioma disaster has spread.
In June, Marks & Spencer admitted that it exposed Janice Allen to asbestos due to negligence.
She worked for the chain for nine years, from 1978 to 1987, when she oversaw the clothing section in two stores - one of the places was the company's flagship, a store on Oxford Street.
Allen was only 18, when she started working for M&S.
He now has two children who are over 20 years old.
“Before it happened,” he says, “I’ve never heard of mesothelioma before, I barely knew anything about asbestos.
I never thought in my dreams that it could have anything to do with me.
There are not many people who know anything about asbestos.
In fact, asbestos is not one substance, but a group of six minerals.
The name was given due to its fibrous structure, which gives it strength and flexibility.
Of the six minerals, three were used in construction.
Most often today in buildings it is possible to find chrysotile, commonly known as white asbestos.
It has been used in roof panels, floor tiles, boiler seals and even in brake coating.
It is not as deadly as other forms of asbestos, but the EU and WHO still regard it as a “great health risk” that can cause death.
Most dangerous are brown asbestos (amosite) and blue asbestos (crocydolite).
Britain was once the world’s largest importer of brown asbestos, and experts say that “there is convincing but indirect evidence that it was the main cause of the unusually high incidence of mesothelioma [in the UK].”
An employee of Marsk & Spencer was exposed to asbestos at a flagship store in Oxford Street, London
Janice Allen may not consider herself a typical victim of mesothelioma, but Julian Pete’s work points out that her story is not unusual at all.
His study of patients states that “a substantial proportion of mesothelioma cases without known exposure to asbestos at work or at home were likely caused by exposure to asbestos in the environment.”
A significant part of this exposure is due to the “ordinary use and ventilation” of buildings.
No one seems to be sure that he is safe.
The Goddard Consulting report, which examined the Westminster Palace, shows that even people in the middle of the government may not know that they may be exposed to asbestos.
In 2009, Goddard published a report stating that the office elevators and pipelines behind parliamentary committee rooms were contaminated with asbestos, whose deadly fibers could be broken by something so harmless as a “strong flow of air.”
Ministers are often accused of only caring for their own interests, but in this case the opposite may be true.
Although Parliament's Directorate of Services has insisted that the Westminster Palace be given a "good medical certificate", it is now expected that it will take £1 million and several years of work to thoroughly inspect the Parliament, modernize electricity and remove asbestos, and that after the 2015 elections, MEPs will sit in the premises of Queen Elizabeth II's Conference Center rather than on the green benches in Westminster.
The Goddard report states that “the presence of asbestos is not in compliance with several regulations.”
It is impossible to say whether this disagreement will cost lives.
Now everyone can only wait.
One person who has never been able to determine when they have been exposed to asbestos is Graham Abbott, a doctor.
Like Andrew Lawson, Abbott (50) is suspected of being exposed to asbestos while working in hospitals.
“I worked in a hospital where the presence of asbestos was proven,” he says, “but in my case I can’t prove it.
It is difficult to remember all the places where he worked and when he worked there.
He remembers the day in early December 2009 when something like a cold hit him.
He was 45 years old, he was in the evening and was just in the middle of the operation.
Suddenly I trembled.
It came at once.
It was terrible to me.
I thought I’t get home by car.
Because he was a doctor, he knew that the pain came from the pleura, the lining around the lungs.
But like Janice Allen, she had no reason to believe it was a mesothelioma.
He spent a month at home.
The confused doctors took a chest x-ray and introduced a chest catheter to remove fluid from his lungs, which they sent for analysis.
However, they did not make a diagnosis.
His condition slowly improved and he returned to work.
From time to time, however, his symptoms returned, often after exercising and breathing.
In 2011, one of Abbott’s patients came to the operating room with similar symptoms and was subsequently diagnosed with mesothelioma.
Even then, Abbott had nothing to do with his own case.
After all, his patient was several decades older and in the work he got into direct contact with asbestos.
In this case, the link was clear.
In September 2011, Abbott’s condition deteriorated again, and his doctor consulted his CT and X-rays with a panel of experts.
In December 2011, exactly two years after Abbott started feeling ill, a camera-equipped probe was introduced into the space between his chest and his lungs.
I am optimist.
I tend to take nothing too much,” he says.
To be honest, I didn’t worry much about it.
But Rachel, my wife, was worried.
The results of the biopsy arrived between Christmas and New Year: “They told me it was a mesothelioma.”
Graham Abbott: Diagnosed with Mesothelioma
Abbott began meeting with the sisters from the Macmillan charity, and one of them advised him to contact a lawyer.
At that moment, he realized the extent of the epidemic.
“It turned out that asbestos has been widely used, especially in large public buildings, which often have asbestos thermal insulation in pipes,” he says.
In people who were exposed to asbestos in these buildings, the disease is now beginning to manifest.
Thus, mesothelioma is now beginning to affect younger people who do not have risky occupations.
The most dangerous tubes isolated by asbestos were located in the basement of hospitals, so it was unlikely that they would endanger patients.
However, staff members who walked through the basement hallways between buildings (such as Andrew Lawson) or ate in the basement dining rooms (such as Graham Abbott) came into contact with the toxic substance.
As it now turns out, several decades after the war, hospitals were a place where they could save patients’ lives, but also a place that could endanger the lives of the doctors who treated them.
Asbestos is still being removed.
Students built Bunsen's cage on asbestos pads
It’s not just about hospitals.
Asbestos was often used in offices, shops, libraries and town halls because of its excellent insulation and non-inflammatory properties.
In schools too.
In fact, many people have been exposed to asbestos already in school.
Somewhere, in countless chemistry hours, students built Bunsen's cahan on an asbestos pad.
A website on asbestos in schools has been created.
Harmless things like floor tiles or roofs of tool shelters in our homes commonly contained asbestos.
“It’s an industrial poison built into a large number of homes,” notes Andrew Morgan, a lawyer who represented Andrew Lawson in his lawsuit against Guy’s Hospital.
In one case, there was the only contact with asbestos a woman with mesothelioma could recall in the 1970s when they burst into a garden house.
Be careful when you build a garden house.
Knowing that the disease is incurable, the impact of diagnosis is enormous.
“It takes a while for you to do it,” says Graham Abbott.
I went back to work and tried to keep going, but I found I couldn’t concentrate on what I was doing.
I was in the operating room for two weeks.
Then I realized that I would have to leave and deal with myself.
I won’t live another Christmas.
One of the most difficult things was the transition from the position of the doctor to the position of the patient.
Like countless patients before him, he remembers how confused he felt about the amount of information he had to deal with.
“It was hard to understand it all,” he said.
I asked my doctor, “How much time do I have?”
I was told that twelve months.
I remember saying to myself, “Well, I won’t live another Christmas.
So is it.”
Mesothelioma is destructive because the very mechanism of what keeps us alive – the breathing itself – is what causes cancer to kill.
Most cases of mesothelioma are caused by exposure to asbestos.
Asbestos is made up of small fibers.
When asbestos is broken and the fibers are inhaled, they can settle in the pleura, the outer lungs.
Asbestos fibers irritate the pleura and can cause cell mutations.
“The problem is inhaled needle-shaped asbestos fibers,” explains Professor Tom Treasure, a heart surgeon who joined Guy’s Hospital in 2001.
To the same hospital where Andrew Lawson was apparently exposed to asbestos and which is paradoxically the leading center in the treatment of mesothelioma.
Treasure Lawson knows and treated other patients who were exposed to asbestos probably during their practice in the hospital.
Asbestos needles get into the tissue of the lungs, Treasure says, and “the breathing itself pushes them to the edge where the lining is located.
It is invasive from the very beginning.
For mesothelioma, the common treatment options used for other types of cancer do not take up so much.
There is much discussion about the effectiveness of the operation.
Some say it would be worth a try.
Treasure disagreed.
“You can’t remove the pleura,” he says.
You won’t get a scalpel around it.
Cancer “does not respond too much to chemotherapy,” which “has some effect,” but does not cure.
“Sometimes there’s someone who survives lung cancer,” Treasure says.
In the end, everyone will die.
Fortunately, some patients live longer than expected.
Stephen Jay Gould died 20 years after his diagnosis.
Two and a half years after his own diagnosis, Graham Abbott is still struggling.
After discovering mesothelioma, Abbott contacted Andrew Lawson who, four years after his diagnosis, became an individual support and counselor for equally affected people.
When they called, he joyfully presented himself, “Good morning, you appealed to the cancer center.”
“It was very positive,” says Abbott.
He was diagnosed with the disease four years ago and was still very active.
At the beginning, Abbott was offered six cycles of chemotherapy that would last four months, and probably only extend his life by a month.
“I was desperate,” he says.
I wanted to give up.
But Lawson was able to “show things in a more optimistic light.”
After visiting several doctors, Abbott decided to continue treatment with Professor Loic Lang-Lazduskim of the Department of Chest Surgery at Guy's Hospital.
“I had the advantage that I didn’t have to wait until I was sent to him, but I just called there and they checked me,” Graham admits.
A normal patient would have to receive a request and would have to be approved for payment.
In order to get the best treatment available, the question of money is key for patients with mesothelioma.
But when different treatments inevitably end up failing, many patients face another financial concern - about the future of the family they leave here.
They go to court and demand compensation.
Andrew Lawson contacted Andrew Morgan of Field Fisher Waterhouse LLP.
“Since 1898, it has been known that asbestos is harmful to health,” says Morgan.
In the 1960s, however, it was discovered that even very small amounts of it could pose a health risk.
This is the negligence of companies.
Andrew Lawson and Guy’s Hospital eventually settled, but according to Morgan, it wasn’t a “full-fledged settlement” because Lawson couldn’t definitely prove that mesothelioma was a result of asbestos exposure at Guy’s Hospital.
However, after investigating the case, a spokesman for Guy's Hospital confirmed that "asbestos in the incriminated basement section was removed in the 1990s."
It was too late for Andrew Lawson.
How to Remove Asbestos
Seducing exposure to deadly asbestos to a single business or workplace – usually decades after it happened – has proven to be a huge problem for mesothelioma patients seeking compensation.
Many former jobs have changed owners or went bankrupt.
The insurance record is lost.
And those who now defend themselves by the charges have time on their side, which their prosecutors do not.
In response to this fact, an important new legislation was passed this year, which makes it easier for patients with mesothelioma to seek compensation, even if their former employer cannot be searched.
The law has created a 350-million-dollar financial reserve paid by insurance companies for people diagnosed after July 2012, who can prove that they have been exposed to asbestos but have no one to sue.
In this case, the disabled will receive 80% of the amount that the court would normally assign them as compensation – approximately £120,000.
Each year 300 applications are expected to be successfully handled.
Andrew Morgan, like patients with mesothelioma, thinks that £350 million is a “good job.”
“It’s an agreement signed by insurance companies for insurance companies,” he says, pointing out that the sum is a quarter of what insurance companies would have to pay if time didn’t hit and people with mesothelioma would be able to catch up with former employers and normally sued them.
Even Mike Penning, the former minister of labor and social affairs, admitted that the law “had gaps.”
But both Penning and Morgan admit that, given seven deaths each year, it was necessary to act quickly.
“People are suffering too much and need help right away,” Penning said in December last year during the second reading of the law on mesothelioma.
Graham Abbott was in the care of Professor Loic Lang-Lazdunski for 19 months.
After initial consultations, Lang-Lazdunski recommended surgery, which, unlike Tom Treasur, he thought had a positive effect.
The surgery was followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy – a triple treatment for which Lang-Lazdunski boasts a five-year survival rate of up to 40% of patients.
Abbott has strengthened it.
“Of course, that’s not the most important thing,” says Abbott.
This is always seen in patients.
There is something that drives you.
If you give up, your condition can get worse very quickly.
Graham Abbott underwent an operation in March 2012.
At the end of August, he completed the last of six cycles of chemotherapy.
Examinations showed no symptoms of the disease.
I went to another check in March [2014].
I had several cancers in my chest.
My 50th birthday was approaching.
It does not endanger life.
Takes him it.
Abbott again underwent six cycles of chemotherapy.
At present, there are no traces of tumors in his body.
It is a physically and emotionally exhausting process.
You have to think about practical things - about financial security when I die, or about showing a woman how a boiler alarm works.
When you hear bad news, you start to be negative.
You have to look forward.
As for Father Ellie (16) and Tamsin (14) it’s not always easy.
“It’s hard for parents,” he says.
It’s hard to decide what to say and how much to say.
After the diagnosis, I told the girls that my condition means I’ll never be old.
Their reaction was different.
Tamsin is very social and wild.
She said it to her friends and suddenly a lot of people started calling.
Ellie was more restrained.
She did not say much.
Such conversations must be faced by all cancer patients.
In patients with mesothelioma, such conversations are not relieved by hope or just a hint of a chance of survival.
The disease brings with it (and eventually brought Stephen Jay Gould) an unpleasant certainty.
As Andrew Morgan says, “Mezotelioma is not life-threatening.”

Prohibition on imports of blue asbestos
The Court of Appeal confirms the first successful lawsuit for damage to health as a result of asbestos exposure in the UK.
World asbestos production is increasing to more than 4,213,000 tonnes per year.
The United Kingdom imports 139,000 tons.
The British Institute for Health and Safety requires that all asbestos suppliers have a license.
The import and use of blue and brown asbestos is prohibited by law in the UK.
All types of asbestos are prohibited in the UK.
In the United Kingdom, a law on mesothelioma has entered into force.
A $350 million compensation plan has been launched.
Asbestos is banned in more than 50 countries, but white asbestos is still used as a cheap building material in many parts of the world.
The world production stands at 2 million tons per year.
China refuses to give Hong Kong power to elect leadership - protesters promise revenge
The Chinese parliament on Sunday decided not to allow Hong Kong voters to nominate candidates for the 2017 elections.
It is likely that the move will trigger the long-promised protests in Hong Kong’s business district, as activists began to organize and prepare just hours after the announcement.
The Chinese People's Congress essentially allows Communist leaders to remove any candidate who is not loyal to Beijing.
“It didn’t surprise us, but it made us angry,” said Democratic Party Chairwoman Emily Lau.
This is not what Beijing has promised.
They lied to Hong Kong.
And it is clear that we are dealing with an authoritarian regime.
In defense of the Chinese decision, Li Fei, deputy secretary general of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, said that allowing public nominations in Hong Kong's leadership elections would cause "chaos."
Since Britain returned Hong Kong to China in 1997, Beijing has pledged that its citizens will be able to elect the executive power from 2017.
Chinese leaders presented Sunday's decision as a democratic breakthrough as it allows Hong Kong to vote directly, but the decision also clearly shows that Chinese leaders are firmly in the hands of the committee's nomination process, which is strictly controlled by Beijing.
And under the new clause, only candidates who “love the country and Hong Kong” will be admitted.
The decision came after the summer months, which saw some of the biggest and most watched protests in Hong Kong in several years.
Behind most of the pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong stands the Occupy Central with Love and Peace movement, whose organizers have threatened to close the financial district unless Beijing grants them universal voting rights.
On Sunday evening, just hours after the announcement, hundreds of supporters of the Occupy in the Rain movement gathered in front of the Hong Kong government headquarters.
At the demonstration, the organizers announced that their movement was entering a new phase of civil disobedience and that waves of protests would begin in the coming weeks.
However, they did not provide any further details, apparently trying to avoid problems with the authorities.
In their online statement, the organizers said that the movement “considered the occupation of the Central only as a last step in case all possibilities of dialogue were exhausted and there was no other choice.
We regret to announce that today all possibilities for dialogue have been exhausted and the occupation of the Central is inevitable.
Hong Kong authorities had been preparing for Beijing's announcement for days and on Sunday strengthened the protection of the government headquarters and deployed police and barricades.
The incitement to unrest is, according to many Hong Kong residents, a sign that it is slowly losing control over the city.
The influx of people from the mainland increases competition in the field of products and services.
There are also growing concerns that values such as democracy and freedom of speech are being bended by increasing pressure from Beijing.
Some people criticize the Occupation Movement of the Central and say that their demonstrations threaten Hong Kong’s trade – rescue boat.
“The protest they are talking about could cause far greater economic damage depending on how many people participate and for how long,” said Regina Ip, a longtime critic of the movement.
We do not want to spread fears that Hong Kong is getting out of control.
Such perceptions could damage the investment.
Chinese state media have also come up with reports in recent days depicting Democratic activists in Hong Kong as subversive agents controlled by the West.
In the summer, activists organized an unofficial referendum on voting rights, attended by 780,000 people – more than a fifth of the voters in Hong Kong.
And in July, tens of thousands of people took part in one of the largest pro-democracy demonstrations in the region’s history.
A pre-election campaign?
The League in Jihlava is named after the political movement
There are approximately 1,600 amateur athletes in the city of Vysočina.
And their highest competition is called Together for Jihlavu League.
It was named after a movement that will go to local elections in October.
The tenth on his candidate is also the head of a small squad in Jihlava Jan Mráka.
“There was a large crowd where there was no problem,” said Mráka.
The situation around the first league of the small kopane has already been dealt with by lawyers of the jihlav city council and recommended to change the system of distribution of subsidies.
Last year, the company earned around 1 million crowns, according to the city’s website.
This year, there are hundreds of thousands.
According to the legal opinion, the procedure is not in violation of the law or the directives of the magistrate.
But the situation is an incentive for the Office to adjust the rules for granting and subsidies," said Radek Tulis, a spokesman for the Magistrate.
Putting out subsidies from the city and at the same time expressing as a small puddle support in the elections to one political party, it probably won’t be possible.
There has not yet been a similar demand from politicians for high-level “big” football.
That it would be possible to create the ČSSD Krajský přebor, ODS Division or KDU-ČSL 1.
Classes and similar competitions.
I would not be for.
On the contrary, I would be happy if sponsors from the ranks of companies would turn to us,” said the chairman of the regional football union Miroslav Vrzáček.
The head of the small football of another party and movement in the name of the league will not allow
According to the players of the small squad, this sport in Jihlava would deserve its own campus with six playgrounds, dressing rooms and social facilities.
"For example, the Na Stoupách playground is not ours, we are rented there," said Ondřej Lapeš of the club Starlet Jihlava.
The best location is the Czech Mill.
There, however, will be built, for example, in my opinion, a senseless area for skates, which is about fifty in Jihlava," Mráka said.
The mayor of Jihlavy Jaroslav Vymazal (ODS) responded that the small squat uses a playground with artificial grass in the streets of Rošického and Na Stoupách, which are in the property of the city.
We want to build games that make the most of it.
We are planning to modernize or build sports venues at schools that will be open in the afternoon hours.
I think that in the last few years there has been a huge progress for the small pipe," he added.
Other political parties in the names of the leagues will not appear, according to Jan Mráka.
We have restrictions.
If someone from one industry enters our partnership, we don’t give the other one there,” he explained.
"A political movement in the name of the league, I consider this to be at least an unfortunate move," said Karel Voldán, a member of the city committee for sport.
"Let the voters evaluate whether Mr Mráka uses the association Malá kopaná Jihlava and the city's subsidies for political purposes or not," he added.
American tradition penetrates into university life – beginners can fly a jet jet
We are pleased to be able to respond to the demand by launching the first luxury travel service for students in the UK.
In order to leave the best impression when arriving at the university, the company also offers transport options including a private jet or Rolls-Royce Phantom, Aston Martin or McLaren P1 cars.
Stewart also stated that the service also has its own security side.
The service is the ideal option for students who would otherwise have to drag their things across the state in a dangerously loaded car.
We look forward to making sure that with our VIF (very important fresher) variants this year, students arrive at the university with a minimum of nervousness and a maximum of luxury.
A spokesman for the company said that since the services have just started, they have no reservations yet, but added: “Students will start making reservations within the next few weeks.”
The company also said that although students pay £9,000 in annual tuition, it expects the service to find its place on the market.
Compared to students ten, twenty, thirty or forty years ago, today’s students are different in terms of expectations and wishes – it’s more important than ever to make the right first impression and the VIF program is exactly the right way to that.
But the National Student Union criticized the service as unattainable.
Megan Dunn, Vice-President of the Union for Higher Education, said: “For most students, such a project is unattainable.
Many students who enter university this month have to cope with a financial crisis before throwing out thousands of pounds for something as simple as getting to college, because the available financial support in the form of loans and grants can’t keep up with the rising cost of basic needs.
Feminist women oppose racism and police behavior after Ferguson events
Earlier this month, a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, killed an unarmed young man.
The people waiting for the funeral with their hands up shouting, “Hands up, don’t shoot!”
After two weeks of protests in Ferguson, Missouri over the shooting of unarmed young man Michael Brown, blogger Miriam Zoila Perez has seen a shift in online discussions of white feminists.
She found that when it comes to promoting reproductive rights and income equality, white feminists prefer gender over race.
With the growing tensions in the Middle West attracting the attention of the national press, Perez noticed that the reaction of whites was 100% focused on race.
Compared to the reactions of black women shortly after the August 9 shooting, personal articles with headlines such as “white woman’s thinking about Ferguson” or “Feminism is not just about oppressing women” appeared relatively late.
According to Perez, this is an important change.
“I think there are not many people in the feminist movement who talk about race and privileges at that level,” she said.
People felt that they had to comment on what had happened.
This is characteristic of the crisis we are facing because [the situation in Ferguson] is so racist that they had to be alerted to it.
According to Korith Mitchell, a professor of English at Ohio State University, Ferguson has highlighted problems that African-American women face every day and are not perceived as “women’s issues” in the cultural sphere.
“I can post funny stories from my life with my partner on Facebook and it gets 150 likes from people around the world,” Mitchell said.
When I write something about the fact that the colored are trapped in their own country, it is silence shameful.
“How is it possible that a woman can talk about relationships in public, but not about safety in public?” she asked.
For blacks like Mitchell, who have dealt with the question of race, gender and sexuality in American history, there is no dichotomy between race and gender questions.
Black women could not afford the luxury of sharing these problems clearly: they live in this mixed reality every day.
Though white women today combine the question of race and gender in mainstream feminist circles, Angela Hattery, a professor of women’s issues and gender studies at George Mason University, says their predecessors did the opposite.
Between 1865 and 1890, at least 10,000 blacks were lynched and the reason was almost in all cases of rape of a white woman," Hattery said.
To justify lynching, you needed the collaboration of whites.
According to Hattery, the split between whites and blacks came when voting rights fighters such as Susan B. Anthony explored the terrain at the end of the 19th century and realized that only one group of people - women or blacks - could have voting rights.
“They decided to bet on women’s voting rights and on the rights of blacks to focus later,” Hattery explained.
When we realize this, we get an important insight into why colored women don’t believe white women.
We did not do a good job.
We never helped black women protect their husbands and children.
Even after women gained the right to vote in 1920, it took ten years for them to start organizing against lynching in the Southern Women’s Association for the Prevention of Lynching.
The group was formed 40 years after black women first asked for help.
According to Mitchell, the upsurge of white feminists’ reactions to the questions that the events in Ferguson brought about – the question of police behavior, racial discrimination – reflects a time when white feminists had to “hunt” the issues that black women faced generations.
“Wouldn’t it be great if activists in these areas of [traditional feminism] took the right to raise a child as seriously as they took the right to contraception?” asked Mitchell.
The second wave of feminists who have made a career fighting for reproductive rights and access to contraception are now finding out what this means.
Prominent feminist activists such as Gloria Steinem took a Facebook attack two weeks after the shooting of Michael Brown, where they posted a column of Rebecca Carroll of the Guardian demanding that white Americans protest more vigorously against racism.
“I hope that women who have different but similar reasons for understanding the dangers in society – and racial opinions that differ significantly in polls – will strive for change,” she wrote.
Although Steinem advocates intersectional feminism, which includes questions of race and gender, her comments on the question of race in America confuse some people.
Christina Sommers, an expert at the American Enterprise Institute, author of “Who Stole Feminism?”, told She The People that young men in the United States, especially young colored men, are “much more vulnerable than their sisters,” but Steinem’s comments on Ferguson’s side are facing criticism it has already provoked.
We now have hundreds of special programs for girls and young women, but almost none for boys.
But when the White House launched a small program called My Brother’s Keeper to help vulnerable young blacks and Hispanics, it sparked a furious reaction among many feminists, including Gloria Steinem.
The police’s relationship to the black community is not the only issue that comes to the forefront of mainstream feminism.
After the U.S. border police detained 63,000 unaccompanied minors in the country’s southwest this year, the issue of reforming immigration laws has risen again – this time as a women’s issue.
Andrea Mercad, co-chair of We Belong Together, an organization that mobilizes women for immigration laws reform, said that in order to present the issue as necessary for women, all she had to do was share the stories of immigrant women.
“They speak for themselves,” says Mercadova.
Since most work permits are issued to men, women who come with them find themselves in a position where they are vulnerable to domestic violence and abuse.
“These stories have a reputation in women’s organizations,” she said.
A pig home in Ipswich for sale
The real estate agency removed a picture of a house for sale in Suffolk - when it was published, a pig rested on it in the living room.
A single-room single-room house for sale for £120,000 stands on a private trip in Ipswich.
Information photographs included a picture of the living room in which he rests with his head on the couch of a pig.
Real estate agency Connells said the pig in the photo is the owner’s pet.
“The photo was found there by mistake, so it was already removed,” a spokesman for the office said.
In information about the property, real estate agency Connells described the former prayer hall as “a single, separate one-room house.”
Although the photo has already been removed from its website, it still appears in promotional materials.
The sale of the house sparked interest on social networks, where some asked if the pig was included in the price.
After winning the lottery, the city of Harvey in the southwest has a fresh millionaire
A lottery player at Harvey wins a million.
A new millionaire is being sought in southeastern Perth, where one lucky man takes home $1.1 million from a Saturday lottery draw.
It was the second time in five years that Harvey’s traffic had a chance in sharing, the last time it was a $1 million win in November 2009.
The lucky winner has to sign up.
Store owner Steve Forward said the whole city in southwestern Perth is speaking about the win.
This is the main topic and everyone is upset.
We thought that such a win was a touch.
Eight winners shared one win in Western Australia last month, ending a few happy weeks.
Last weekend, the Canning Vale player became one of the five August millionaires and just weeks earlier, the Belmont couple won an incredible $7.5 million.
The winning couple wagered for 20 years and said the win would allow them to travel the world and buy a new house.
The millionaire from Harvey is the 59th only winner of the lottery in Western Australia for this year, winning a total of $85 million.
Deutsche Bahn trains do not run tonight.
Engineers want higher wages
In a press release, GDL described the protest as a warning strike, for which it deliberately chose the time outside of the traffic peak.
With the selected time of the strike, GDL takes into account many people who return from the weekend by rail only during the first working day.
At the same time, we also think of people coming to work during the day," the trade union said in a press release on Monday morning to announce a strike.
“Our first strike should primarily affect freight transport, less passengers,” added GDL.
The DB has not yet announced an official response to the strike.
It is unclear how the protest will affect international rail connections, including with the Czech Republic.
The unions are demanding a 5% increase in engineer salaries and a two-hour reduction in working hours per week.
Currently, the average salary of engineers varies between 36 thousand and 46 thousand euros (998 thousand and 1,27 million crowns) per year, depending on the years they have worked.
Drivers at DB work 39 hours a week.
DB refuses to increase wages while reducing working hours.
They emphasize that the remuneration of engineers must develop in the same way as the rest of the railway staff, for which DB does not count with the reduction of the working week.
There was a danger that Krest’s car would burn.
The Barum rally ended.
What exactly happened?
It was a matter of material.
The car was completely new, so I didn’t even think something like this could happen.
Couldn't the exhaust be provisionally repaired and continued at a slower pace to the service, where the mechanics would replace it?
If we were to go straight, yes.
But there were two more runs ahead and it didn’t happen.
There is a high temperature in it and the risk of the car burning is high.
I cannot afford it.
You have completed five speed tests.
What impression did you have of them?
very good .
I felt like a youth.
We were quick, but I didn’t get over the wind.
Everything was due to the fact that the car we pipled for more than half a year to be at some level.
The race proved we were able to do it.
You made it so that you could really think about winning.
I prepared myself and the car so that we really had to win.
The work did not come in vain.
The outcome we could have expected did not come.
This is Barumka.
Unfortunately, technology said no.
He wasn’t the only player to retire prematurely from the race.
Foreign favourites Breen, Abbring and Lappi also fell out.
Are you surprised that so many fans have resigned?
Yes is.
It was a pity for the spectators because the race ended early.
At the top of the long move also Jaromír Tarabus, to whom you are preparing a car.
But he paid off for leaving the track and took a two-minute short.
How satisfied were you with his performance?
It’s a shame, because he could have repeated the levels of winners.
It was the first second time.
He also confirmed that the car was well prepared.
It went very fast.
Exactly a year ago you announced the end of your career, yet you appeared at the start of the Barum rally.
Can a good feeling of driving make you a regular participant in rally races?
Certainly not at the moment.
Last year I said Barumka was my last race and I didn’t keep it.
I decided to take her again.
It was my nineteenth start here, and if there is a chance in a year, I will probably go there again.
But I am not thinking about anything else.
A lot of people came to the road just because of you.
Have you been pleased?
To a certain extent, it was because of them.
A lot of people, known or unknown, always asked me if I would go.
I wanted to make them happy.
What awaits you after the bar?
This continues on.
Next week we will go to Vyškov, where Robert Adolf will race.
I hope the car didn’t hurt much.
In addition, he wants to borrow Fabia Honza Sýkora from us for this race.
The European two-race will take place in Switzerland and Corsica.
We will have to prepare things for next year.
Can you suggest something?
Nothing is decided.
When the Corsica Rally belonged to the World Championship, the fifth place was your highest in the series.
Do you want to try the tracks again?
It does not.
An agreement with an employer can be a problem.
Unfortunately, you have not been issued a certificate of disability from a doctor, which serves as proof to the organization that you cannot perform your work duties for health reasons.
You did not immediately notify the employer of your absence.
Subsequently, it was agreed that the days would be recorded as holidays, but the agreement was only verbal.
Although the Labour Code does not impose an obligation to confirm the consent of the employer to take leave in writing, in practice this procedure has proven good.
If there is only an oral agreement, you do not have a confirmation of the agreement.
Later, the alleged consent to taking leave, as in your case, may be denied and absence from work may be considered as a long-term unjustified absence, therefore the reason for immediate cancellation of the employment relationship according to § 53 of the Labour Code.
In case of a legal dispute with the employer, there is a lack of proof.
The employment relationship with you has not been cancelled according to § 53, only you have given days listed in the accounting sheet as an unjustified absence.
An unjustified absence in the record does not have the same consequences as § 53 (e.g. inability to receive material security in unemployment), but it makes it difficult to find a new job.
We recommend that you visit the doctor again and confirm in writing that there has actually been an injury, as a result of which you were incapable of work (this is not a so-called "incapacity", it is only a doctor's certificate).
When looking for a new job, you can present the document and explain the situation.
In practice, it is advisable not to underestimate the issuance of a written medical certificate of disability, as well as early notification to the employer or requesting written consent to take leave.
This will avoid possible complications.
Tony Stewart crashes on track
The return to the track ended for Tony Stewart just halfway behind the Atlanta Motor Speedway.
Stewart fell into the grip for the second time after his right front tire broke in the 172nd round, and the race ended for him.
Stewart brought the damaged car into the garage, did not comment to reporters and left.
Team boss Chad Johnston said the 14th car team is disappointed, but will now focus on the race in Richmond, Virginia, which will take place next weekend.
“I would like to have a better performance and a better conclusion,” Johnston said.
We’ll go to Richmond and hope we’ll get better there.
Stewart stumbled into the load for the first time in the Sunday evening race after a collision with Kylie Bush, which required the right side of his car to be repaired.
“We were hoping for a good finish in today’s race,” Johnston said, adding, “It just didn’t work out.”
Shortly after the second crash, Stewart’s car was loaded and the team packed and ready to leave.
After his car hit and killed another driver at a New York race, Stewart missed three NASCAR Sprint Cup races.
He decided to return this weekend and needed to win either the race in Atlanta or the next race in Richmond to catch a place in the table.
He returned to the race during the investigation of a tragic accident in which twenty-year-old Kevin Ward Jr. died, who came into Stewart’s way during the race.
Authorities said it would take at least two weeks to investigate the cause of the accident.
It has not yet been decided whether Stewart will face any charges.
The three-time champion received a warm encouragement before the race.
Stewart started in 12th place, at the start of the race he worked to 10th and then even 4th.
Then, at the beginning of the 122nd round, Busch's car No.
18 got out of control, came out of the second curve and struck Stewart, thus sending both cars into the load.
Stewart continued, but withdrew to 21st place.
Prague has chosen a new taxi station manager, earns 12.3 million
Prague has completed the selection process for the new taxi station manager.
For 103 parking spaces, it will earn approximately SEK 12.3 million annually.
Until recently, taxis collected 150,000 crowns per year for the same seats for drivers.
This was by the city council Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
Previously, the city used the draw for the selection of administrators.
The winner then received a rent for a flat amount of 1000 crowns per year.
But the rules have changed.
The amount of the offer is currently determined.
"A year since the termination of the original rental contracts and the opening of the tender proceedings, it has proven that the new rental system is far more advantageous and generally fair for Prague," he said.
The most expensive is in Perugia.
The highest price was offered by those interested in a place in the street of Perštyně.
It costs 2.1 million crowns a year.
Approximately 1.5 million crowns new administrators paid for places in front of the Municipal House or on Václavský náměstí.
The new rental rules were adopted in the autumn of 2012 and the original rental contracts were terminated in the summer of last year.
The selection process was conducted in four waves and 29 offices were found for the new manager.
This is the second time this year that we have to clean the water.
We dropped it all the time, creating practically a second pond around the cottage.
Then we put our own.
An incredible puff!
Our well in the basement always provided plenty of beautiful scented water.
And it was not expertly done, the grandfather was able to do it with his help.
for a long time.
It was just so on three screws and generally self-reliant, like everything else in the cottage, but as I say.
The water was great.
Until this year.
When we started the season, we had the water exhausted.
Having been there for months, she deserved it.
Even then, it seemed that the water did not smell.
I wondered if there was something going on there.
In the place where the pump was passing, it was possible with a little misfortune, there the plate was not very close, so the opening was sealed with a piece of brick.
Our inspection confirmed that the brick was moving.
Otherwise, there was nothing to see in the water, and we lighted it up to the bottom.
So we put it out and cleaned it up again.
Of course, we improved the improvised seal around the pump pipe.
We saw strange things in the basement.
There was a package on the ground with some pieces.
At least so it looked.
And a piece further.
It looked like a blinking mouse.
At the ceiling, in the places where there are bronches, the grandfather's invention, there were remains of fish!
It is heavy!
Our shop is also very spacious.
Someone would say that my grandfather had just groomed the chalet.
It’t be so far from the truth.
The walls and the floor are just sinking sand, only the ceiling is crushed.
Mostly boats are there.
and car.
Sitting on the beach.
The door with wide gaps was mostly open, as someone walked in one moment.
Some of the above mentioned roofs.
There are no nets, so birds usually fly there and build their nests on the trams.
There is no need to mention mice.
My grandfather wanted me to fight, and that’s it.
Even the air did not help.
The whole shop smelled.
We cleaned the whole shop.
Especially the fish in the tree was nutritious!
We threw out the things that were around: boards, heraclite boards, and so on.
Our cottage in the distance welcomed passers with a disinfectant odor.
We wondered, who could have put those disgusting remnants there?
The nearest cat lives two kilometers away in the village.
It would be hard for her to come to us.
My grandfather was attacked by a neighbor who is not well.
Didn’t the French get us out of the hustle?
He’s been there almost all year, stupid ideas, that’s he has.
We decided to guard the well and the well and check it regularly.
After a few days everything was fine.
We started using the water again, for now only for washing and washing before the tests were finished, but it was good.
Putting water out of a well is not something I would like to do for a while.
Once we heard a terrible anxious whisper of our fancy.
Mom looked from the balcony and saw a long, thick black hose in the grass next to the veranda.
Reese jumped over her and whistled like a crazy man.
Mother gave it out because she thought Réza had pulled out the garbage hose from the dishwasher.
Suddenly, the hose partially smelt into the club and partially sprang up.
The balcony was shaken.
Reese had a hysterical attack.
We ran down.
The dwarf, much over a meter long and thick as a bull, was about to swallow a huge dwarf, and Réza prevented her from doing so.
It was not clear whether she wanted to save the frog or if she wanted to eat it herself, but that was irrelevant.
When she saw the presel in the form of our whole family, she probably said, let us eat it when we are so hungry, and elegantly stretched through the bronchus into the basement.
We flew after her.
He jumped like lightning out of a well.
By the way, we noticed another stinking package on her record.
It smells like a fish.
She was not there yesterday!
Our new security around the pump was a bit shady.
We closed the store over the day.
That would...
We went out and each of us lay down to one side.
We did not wait long.
The well was shaken.
First appeared a flat head with yellow moons on the neck.
Then the whole well went out.
She wrapped herself around the pump and began to get inside.
A dismissed employee took revenge, bought a notebook and sold it to the company
A worker bought computers from the company and sold them.
The money was spent before the police arrested him.
In a short period of time, the man bought in twelve cases a total of sixteen computers for more than two hundred thousand crowns.
“The notebooks were taken to Olomouc, where they were sold at the markets,” said Rostislav Brückner, chief commissioner of the Schumpers police.
The motive for the fraud was revenge by the employer for dismissal and also profit money.
“During the interrogation, he claimed that he used the money to repay loans,” Brückner said.
The police also found that the fraudster was a pathological player who had repeatedly been treated in a psychiatric clinic.
The money could also end up in the winning devices or in the video lottery terminals.
“The fact is that we didn’t find any money at him,” the commissioner said.
A fraudster who has already been convicted of theft is now facing a prison sentence of one to five years.
Police have not yet revealed whether they also threaten to punish the basars who bought and sold laptops below the price.
"It is true that they were taking over entirely new goods, which is at least suspicious," the commissioner said.
However, none of the owners have yet been charged.
Come, still a little, you can do it or as I We Run Prague
This year, the organizers have made a few changes.
The biggest was the change of route, which brought the destination to the swimming pool instead of leading back to the Yellow Baths.
I was looking forward to the race together with the rest of the Rungo.cz team, but I was going to experience it from the other side.
With the whole team, we decided to personally greet our readers at the stand, where we took photos and filmed the videos together.
To perfect my view from the other side, I assumed the role of a personal driver.
Together with a friend Kátia, we went to the end of the corridor for 60 to 70 minutes just before the start.
We greeted our friends who walked around us in the sector for faster runners.
No longer much time.
A few jumps on the heating, turn on the sports testers, count off and start!
Cries of cheerfulness, but instead of a quick start followed a cupitation to the starting line.
After five minutes, we arrive at the gate, turn on the measurement and move up at 10 a.m.
We are interwoven with the yellow snake of runners who, like Kátia, are running their first race.
For now, they all look fresh, the slowly falling sun in the sky gives the views of Vyšehrad almost a whirlwind.
The pulsing mass stretching along the coastline looks like the whole of Prague is running here.
On the shore between Vyšehrad and the National Theatre, it is traditionally beginning to show who has how many powers.
A light hill on Palackého náměstí forces many runners to slow down or move on to walking.
Just before heading to the Theatre, I see a police escort and immediately behind him, Vítek Pavlišta flies at an incredible pace to the target.
I can hear the admired breathing of the other riders.
I move to the edge of the track, I encourage him, he’s about to crack with me, but just before that my foot crumbles and our hands tighten.
Walking through the Theatre Street gives a chance for a short rest and breathe.
There are places in front of us that take my breath.
The turn on the Manes Bridge shows the Threshold in all the beauty of the sunset.
I can’t breathe and my legs can carry me alone.
The first moment of truth comes.
During the course of the road, Káťa scattered on the edge and performed the jump float.
I look if she doesn’t need help, and I run a series of encouraging words so that she doesn’t have time to think of the pain.
It rises and we continue the Kozí uličkou, it is one of the narrowest places on the track, in this stage of the race there is no such a rush, but it is necessary to follow the surroundings well.
I still don’t know that the term narrower place will gain its true meaning later.
Behind the Dust Gate we are frenetically encouraged by tourists and friends of other runners.
I try to applaud anyone who offers a hand, and I also advise Kate, because ten applause with the fans is like half an energy bar.
It really works, we are speeding up again and although we have been down quite significantly, now the pursuit has begun.
We run past dozens of runners, when I pass by someone especially tired, I try to encourage him with a few words: “Come, a little more, you can do it!”
No one is running ahead of us, we are speeding up.
So far we’ve been running for an hour and a quarter, adding, there’s nothing to wait for.
Three kilometers to the goal will hurt, but it really needs to be mocked.
The sun has slowly gone down and the end of the day symbolically slowly ends the race.
The last step to the bridge, the turn and just a row to the goal.
The speed we run is surprising, where does this girl get in?
“Come, we’re down at three o’clock, we’re going!”
We try it, sprint and there’s the goal.
Thirteen hours and six seconds.
What can be done.
The coach set an hour limit of twenty.
Seven minutes under schedule.
which is a superb result.
Close to the goal, Katie's legs are slapped, I help her to the fence, where she rests for a while.
You can see exhaustion, but also happiness from a well performed performance.
After a while, I slowly pull her out of the space of the goal.
The euphoria doesn’t make us think of the press in the passages to the dressing rooms.
You can see that the street was not the closest place.
This is only here behind the goal of the boat, which is under the pressure of almost ten thousand runners crashed.
If someone doesn’t like crowds, this is not a place for them.
I also lose my head after a while and wonder if those wonderful views and a more interesting route compared to previous years were worth what is happening in the destination.
I know from my own experience that running is not fun.
If we add ten thousand people, a rich accompanying program and the closure of the entire Prague centre for all transportation, this is a huge challenge.
This year's change of route showed the runners many interesting places, but also brought a few really unpleasant surprises.
The excellent atmosphere pumped up in the Yellow Baths was transmitted between the runners and in the race itself.
Organizers around the track and random spectators scaled it on every meter of the track.
At the city run through the historic center, unfortunately, obstacles must be counted that cannot be removed, but the goal of a mass race in a place that is bordered by a wall on the one hand and a river on the other, I do not consider the best solution.
If I say that the race ended with a goal, I evaluate it as very successful.
I was a little worried about the health of the participants, but in the end everything went well.
Tell us if you liked the route and what you think about the situation at the destination.
Bulgarian prison guards protest
Hundreds of prison service employees across Bulgaria took part in a national protest gathering in front of the Ministry of Justice in the capital Sofia.
At a peaceful demonstration, they reiterated their demand for the restoration of the original working conditions that have recently changed.
There are also higher salaries on the list of demands to be discussed with the interim Minister of Justice Hristo Ivanov.
The supervisors protested symbolically against the new working hours and demanded a return to the original twenty-four-hour shifts.
Although the prison guards’ unions and representatives of the Ministry of Justice met, they did not reach an agreement, Bulgarian State Radio (BNR).
“Negotiations are still ongoing,” said Rosen Zhelyazkov, head of the General Directorate of Prison Service at BNR.
Members of the Federation of Trade Unions of Employees at the Ministry of Internal Affairs are also expected to join the protests of prison service employees.
Why the universe can have multiple dimensions and we can’t see them
Physicists usually don’t write bestsellers, but Brian Green of Columbia University hit black in 1999.
His book The Elegance of the Universe has become the most accessible way for laypeople to penetrate the cluster of problems that a number of theoretical physicists are dealing with today – the attempt to unite two well-functioning but mutually incompatible discoveries of the 20th century: quantum theory and general theory of relativity.
One of the reasons for the success of the Elegant Universe is undoubtedly that the search for a unified physical theory is not a boring story.
Physicists have solved the basic problem between two key theories (because at this moment our universe is de facto divided into two worlds with different laws) so imaginatively that it is worth telling the laity too.
Moreover, Greene consulted the complex material so fresh and engagingly that he could not be blamed for not having included a lot of interesting things in his book.
In addition, he has largely corrected his "errors" in two other books: The Structure of the Universe and Hidden Reality.
Apparently even the author would not object to the fact that his book would become obsolete faster, but the fact is that even after 15 years the Elegant Universe still provides almost everything that an informed layman with an ambition to understand the world should know about this important part of theoretical physics.
It is quite likely that in the coming years it will be a little more lively in this area (for example, because the LHC accelerator will finally go on "full gas"), and so it is a good time to enter Green's nonviolently open doors of the world of modern physics.
How many dimensions can our universe have?
The idea that our universe may have more than three spatial dimensions may sound silly, fantastic, strange, or mystical.
It is concrete and completely acceptable.
To understand this, let’s turn our eyes away from the universe as a whole for a moment toward something more grounded, namely, a long and thin watering garden hose.
Imagine stretching the stometro garden hose from one side of the canyon to the other and watching the whole landscape from a half-kilometer distance (as in the picture and on the next page).
From such a distance, you can easily notice a long, horizontally stretched hose, but if you are not suffering from blindness, you will hardly recognize the thickness of the hose.
Given its large distance from the hose, you would think that a ants forced to live on a hose has only one dimension in which it can walk: the left-right dimension along the hose.
When someone asks you where the ants were at a given moment, you only answer with one information: the distance of the ants from the left (or right) end of the hose.
All that we want to say is that from a half-kilometer distance, a long piece of hose looks like a one-dimensional object.
In the real world, the hose has thickness.
If we enlarge everything, we suddenly see a second dimension - in the shape of a circle wrapping the hose.
In this enlarged view, it is obvious that the ants can actually move in two independent dimensions: in the already well-known left-right dimension along the length of the hose, but also in the “dimension in/against the direction of the clock indicator”, i.e. around the circle range of the hose.
You begin to understand that to determine the location of a small ants you need to enter two numbers: how far it is from the end of the hose and where the wrapping hose is on the circle.
This reflects the fact that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional (Experts will notice that this chapter focuses purely on the theory of strings failures.
These are discussed in chapters 12 and 13.
The surface of the hose is two-dimensional: one long long longitudinal dimension is represented by a straight arrow, the dimension in the direction of the perimeter, marked by a circular arrow, is short and curved.
However, there is a clear difference between these two dimensions.
The size along the hose is long and easily visible.
The size that wraps the circumference of the hose is short, "curved" and worse noticeable.
In order to realize the existence of a circular dimension, we had to examine the hose with a much better resolution.
This example illustrates an important feature of spatial dimensions.
They are divided into two groups.
They can be either large, vast, and therefore directly noticeable, or, on the contrary, small, curved and much worse observable.
Of course, in this case, we just didn’t get overwhelmed to reveal the “swinged” dimension that wraps the thickness of the hose.
You just need a telescope to help.
But if the hose were thinner, like the hair or capillary, the curved dimension would only be revealed with great effort.
Kaluza sent Einstein his article in 1919, in which he pointed out the astonishing idea that the spatial geometry of the universe could have more than three dimensions we all know.
Kaluza justified his radical claim by the fact that the additional dimension provides an elegant and compelling framework in which Einstein’s general relativity and Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory can be drawn into a single, unified conceptual structure.
Immediately the question arises, how does this observation of Kaluz go together with the obvious fact that we see precisely three dimensions of space.
The answer, which Kaluza quietly assumed between the lines and which was clearly pronounced and clarified by Swedish mathematician Oskar Klein in 1926, stands and falls with the assertion that the spatial geometry of our universe can have both large and curved dimensions.
This means that just like the dimensions in the direction of the length of the hose, our universe also has large, vast and easily visible three dimensions, the existence of which we are aware at every moment.
But analogously to the circular circuit of the garden hose, the universe may have additional dimensions, firmly curled into a space so tiny that they have so far remained hidden even from our most perfect experimental apparatus.
To get a clearer idea of the essence of Kaluz’s remarkable design, let’s stay with the hose for a moment.
Imagine drawing a fairly dense series of circles in black on the perimeter of the hose.
From the distance, the hose still looks like a thin one-dimensional line.
With the telescope now thanks to the drawing we will reveal the curved dimension even easier, we will see the motive from Figure 2.
We can see clearly that the surface of the hose is two-dimensional, with one dimension large and almost unlimited, and with the other short and circular.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that our universe has a similar structure, but in addition to one small circular dimension it has three large spatial dimensions, together therefore four-spatial dimensions.
It is difficult to draw an object with too many dimensions.
To help our imagination a little, let’s note the illustration in Figure 3; it shows two large dimensions and one small circular dimension.
In the picture, we enlarge the view of the geometry of the space similarly to how we enlarged the surface of the hose.
Each next level represents a huge increase in space geometry from the previous level.
Our universe may have additional dimensions (we see them at the fourth level of enlargement) if they are bended into a sufficiently small space; this explains that we have not directly observed them so far.
The square grid represents the commonly known “large” dimensions, while the circle represents a new, small and curved dimension.
Just like the loop of the thread in a thickly woven carpet, these circles exist in every place of the usual dimensions - only we have scattered them only into the intersection of the square grid for the sake of view.
The background of Figure 4 depicts the commonly known structure of space - the ordinary world around us - in such common scales as meters, represented by the side of a small square in a square grid.
In each subsequent image, we focus on a small area of the previous image; we enlarge it to make it visible.
At first, nothing special happens, as we can see on the first few levels of enlargement.
But as we move on our path for the microscopic properties of space geometry further—to the fourth level of magnification in Figure 3—we suddenly see a new, circularly curved dimension, similar to the looping of the thread in a thickly woven piece of carpet.
Kaluza and Klein came up with the idea that an additional circular dimension exists at every point in the direction of large dimensions, similarly to the way a hose has a circular circuit at every point of its length.
For the sake of viewability, we have scaled the circular dimension only in some, regularly spread points.
Figure 4 summarizes Kaluz and Klein's idea of the microscopic structure of space geometry.
The similarity with the hose is obvious, although we also note important differences.
First, the universe has three large, far-reaching spatial dimensions (of which we have drawn only two), whereas the hose has only one big dimension.
An even more important difference is that we are now talking about the spatial geometry of the universe itself, not just about some object inside the universe, such as our hose.
But the basic idea is the same.
If the additional circularly curved dimension is extremely miniature, it is much harder to recognize it – like the circular circuit of the hose – than to observe the apparent, large and vast dimensions.
If the size of the additional dimension is small enough, it will actually be revealed beyond the power of our state-of-the-art enlargement tools.
The most important thing, however, is that the additional dimension is not merely a fuzzy bump within the usual dimensions, as the two-dimensional illustration mistakenly suggests.
A circular dimension is a new dimension that exists in each point of three common vast dimensions.
It is a dimension on the remaining three dimensions as independent as are the dimensions up-down, left-right, and forward-back independent (and third) of each other.
A sufficiently small ant could move in all four dimensions and we would need four data to determine its position, in addition to the usual three still a position in the circular dimension; if we count the time, then data five, in any case one more than we would normally expect.

The price of the e-book is €149.
To our surprise, therefore, we find that although we are aware of the existence of only three dimensions of space, Kaluz and Klein's reasoning shows that this does not rule out the existence of additional curved dimensions, if they are small enough.
The universe has more dimensions than we can see with the naked eye.
How small should they be?
The most advanced technical equipment can recognize structures of a billionth of a billionth of a meter.
Small dimensions can hardly be seen.
In 1926, Klein combined Kaluz's original idea with several ideas from the newly born quantum mechanics.
His calculations suggested that the additional circular dimension could be approximately one Planck length, a size far beyond the resolution of today’s instruments.
Since then, physicists have called the possibility of additional small spatial dimensions the Kaluz-Klein theory.
Wohnout Honza Homola advises how to exercise on an electric guitar: Part 5
The whole essence of the "twelfth" consists in a twelve-tact harmonic form, which you can repeat at will.
Anyone interested in music theory will find its principle explained in detail here.
Jan Homola or Honza Homolka Tobolka (1976)
The educational puppet and puppet driver, whose Facebook profile can be followed here, has been working as a graphic designer since graduation twenty years ago.
He is a guitarist of the band Wohnout, from which he is unfortunately unable to leave.
He is a guitarist after his father, as is his brother Matěj, the leader of the Wohnout.
Start your training with one string.
"The rhythmic model is up to you, you can think of anything, you just need to apply it to the harmonic model of the twelve," Honza advises.
When you add another string, you can change the figure again.
Just listen and watch Honza, what can be invented with twelfth harmony on two strands and how nice it is already beginning to sound.
If you take the third string, you can already cocket with the melody of some song.
When you finally add the fourth, beware of changing the adjustment, Honza points out in the video.
Next time Honza returns to the pentatonics and you try to put it together with the twelfth.
Practice it honestly.
As best, you can read this in an interview with Jan Homola at the first lesson of his school playing electric guitar here.
Another goal without waiting.
It’s not a big celebration, he admits.
We take a point and we love it.
In the first half we had more chances we, the second home," said the attacker, who this time scored from a penalty kick.
Were you not nervous when he played it, but was he accompanied by a tremendous singing?
Somehow I didn’t notice it in particular, although for the second goal, where there are domestic fans, it would probably be worse.
You got the penalty after half an hour, but you also got the goal from the penalty after less than four minutes.
What happened?
We slept the beginning, we were passive, a corner emerged from it and then a penalta.
After that, you got up and in the first half you were a better team, having more chances.
Why did this change after the break?
Hard to say.
I think we played well until the end of the break.
In the cabin, we said we wanted to keep the pace of the game, but we couldn’t.
To be honest, I can’t even explain why.
But it is also true that the hosts said something about their game about the break, they were probably not very satisfied with it.
You have only scored for the first time on the opponent’s field, while at home you may not have scored a goal yet.
Why is this such a difference?
I’t say it’s so different, it’s up to us how we deal with it.
In Brna we started well, but then it was bad from us, Plzeň, that’s another category.
Have you been waiting for a goal for four games, did you not fear that it could be the same after the last game?
Maybe not, but of course we are happy that we don’t have to listen to the talk of waiting for a goal from the last game.
Now we have added another without waiting, but there are still only three in six matches, which is not yet a big celebration.
Iceland - lava flows from a kilometre-distance crater.
The lava fleeing to the surface in the Holuhraun area near the Vatnajökull glacier flows through a underground tunnel from a crater kilometers away.
It is located under the iceberg, as well as part of the underground lava tunnel.
This is what worries scientists most.
The situation remains unchanged for now.
Last week (31.8 hours ago)
2014) continues to fly out of the crack about the same amount of lava.
Compared to the original estimates, however, its quantity is lower, not 1000 m3, but "only" 300-400 m3.
Compared to the previous eruption of 29.8.
In 2014, it was 50x larger.
However, scientists fear that the lava tunnel could open up even where it is under the ice.
If this happened, moreover, with the same intensity as the current eruption, it would mean huge floods, both on the Jökulsá á Fjöllum river and on other rivers.
A strong smell of sulfur is felt around the eruption, clouds of steam and gas rise from the cracks.
It is not an eruption suitable for tourism, as was the case with the eruption at Fimmvörðuháls in 2010.
This is much larger and there are much more gases,” says volcanologist Ármann Höskuldsson.
However, the weather has improved significantly since yesterday, in the early hours it was almost windless in the area.
Traces of the sandstorm were wiped away by rain.
Scientists can continue their work.
For air traffic, the orange grade (the second highest) applies to Bárðarbungu and the yellow (the third) to Askju.
Heaven over Cheb belonged to the brave Lady Peggy.
She walked through the wings.
Day in Cheb.
On the Boeing Stearman PT-17 aircraft acrobat Peggy Walentin, who during the flight climbed out of the cockpit to the fence on the upper wing of the double plane and also between the wings.
It depends on the strength of the muscles.
The air day in Cheb was held this year for the fifth time and the organizers again managed to prepare several interesting air pieces.
The premiere took place at the oldest Czech airport not only "walking the wings" in the presentation of the German acrobat Peggy Valentine, but also the legendary fighter P-51 D Mustang or Beechcraft 18.
He attracted attention with his brightness.
Wingwalking originated in the United States.
After the First World War, many former war pilots tried to promote it.
Due to the number of fatalities, it was banned.
Today, however, it is slowly returning to the program.
Peggy climbs from the cockpit to the upper wing.
He performs various exercises.
At the end of the show, she will move to the space between the wings of the aircraft, where her show continues,” said Luděk Matějíček from Cheb’s Ultralight Club and the organizer of the air day.
The pilot of the Boeing Stearman 75 E is her husband Friedrich.
If Peggy’s performance was the main key of the show, then the next Mustang performance was the notorious cherry on the cake.
The legendary fighter came to the ground with the Grippens of the Czech Republic Army in the curtain (so-called on the numbers).
This is the first time that fans in the Czech Republic have seen it.
Pilot Miroslav Sázavský then showed everyone a breathtaking acrobatic action with an aircraft from 1945.
It was built during the war, but probably never participated in it.
He was placed in the military reserves.
Since 1963 he has worked in the civil sphere.
Like a racing aircraft.
Today it has its home hangar at the airport in Munich Hradišti.
In the same place is also another pearl of Cheb air day, the two-engine Beechcraft C45H Expeditor.
At the airport, a massive machine could not be ignored.
His polished aluminum coating shone in the distance.
The Max Holste MH 1521M Broussard is a French aircraft.
A small transport aircraft crashed behind the abandoned Turbolet and brought part of the German delegation from Hof to the air day.
German neighbors showed up in Cheb with reconstructed Jak 18T aircraft or a three-member formation of Bücker Jungmann.
Lucie Borhyová: A dramatic return to the camera!
Lucy Borhy has exchanged her parental worries for work tonight.
Stress or nervousness – the blonde moderator obviously doesn’t know anything about it.
The moderation of television news went well, as if she hadn’t stopped with him for two months at all!
It’s only two weeks since the blonde’s sixth week ended, when women experience the greatest stress after giving birth.
However, Lucie will not appear regularly on the main news channel TV Nova.
A regular return is expected, according to Blesk.cz, only in a month.
But now she needs her daughter Linda more than television viewers.
Lucie Borhy returned to the TV screen and it was a hit in black.
Exhibition in Prague.
The house would be sold out, plans to say goodbye to Jagger
It would be worthwhile if something like this were done during the world championship.
But it depends on how the union will stand up to it," he said in Jihlava after the exhibition titled Golden Match, in which the stunning Daman team met again.
The players who played in the gold hattrick.
The players would like it, right?
Certainly .
It would be good to say goodbye to the gold generation during the championship.
I think they can find one or two days during the tournament when there is a complete vacation and where such a match could be mixed.
We will tell Gum (Jiří Šlégro) or Béď Ščerban (the organizer of the jihlav match), who would take care of it...
The arena is sold out.
What if you play the New Jersey play-off?
When I arrive...
You don’t want to play in the team.
Did the Jihlav meeting change your decision?
Representation and exhibition matches are two different things, and in representation performance is decisive.
One thing is that people would love to see me there, but the performance is crucial, especially at the World Cup.
There should be players who have it, and not because they have a good name.
My decision has not changed.
How did you really enjoy the Danish event?
Meeting with the players was great.
A man resurrected stories and experienced a lot of fun.
It was a great experience not only for the fans, but also for us hockeys.
But the most important thing was the tribute to Ivan Hlink.
And it’s good to recall the history of our hockey and the fact that one generation is leaving, which is really worth it.
Slavomír Lener, Vladimír Růžička and Petr Čechmánek on the switch.
Are you preparing for your first match?
Such things are not forgotten.
It was against the Calgary Flames and three young people: me, Robert Holík and Robert Reichel, we were in one three.
For all of us, this was the first start.
But that we would dominate in some way, it cannot be said.
After a long time, Dominik Hasek was caught in Jihlava.
What did you say about his performance?
I will never be surprised by the ice.
I wanted to return it to him with that criticism, but I can’t (Hašek criticized Jágra for the reasons why he decided to end up in the national team).
He also demonstrated great.
He was there with me one night, and he was there.
He is now famous.
First the United States and then the Netherlands, footballers start qualifying
There were prominent guests at the hotel on Monday morning.
People could see, for example, the goalkeeper Peter Czech from Chelsea, the representative coach Pavel Vrba...
And here, the character in the black sheet, that’s Tomáš Rosický!
Arsenal and the captain of the national team arrived at the match around half twelve between the last.
We have a great match against the Netherlands.
Who would not be delighted?” he said when he appeared before the journalists in the representative set.
Czech Representation Program
Monday, September 1: Start of training
Tuesday 2 September: Training open for fans (18:30, Summer) Autogramiada (20:00)
Wednesday 3 September Czech Republic - USA (20:15, Summer)
Tuesday 9 September Czech Republic - Netherlands (20:45, Summer) end of match
Rosicki and his supporters can support him before Wednesday’s match against the United States (20:15).
The team opened Tuesday’s training, which begins at 18:30.
And then there will be autographs, which Rosický and Czechs will not miss.
Otherwise, the team will be quieter.
That’s what the coach Vrba praised, who just complained about the number of social events in the spring.
Finally, we will focus on what we want to do.
Now we will focus on the Netherlands.
It is an advantage to have players together for eight days.
We will have time to practice things that we haven’t had so much time for so far,” Vrba praised, who has officially led the national team since January.
The Czech national football team will be accompanied by a musketeering image when entering the new qualifying cycle.
The team has played three matches, all of which are preparatory.
Finland and Norway were defeated by 2-2 and Austria lost by 1:2.
However, these results were not important yet.
Only now.
The match with the Netherlands will start the qualification for the 2016 European Championship.
Of course, it would help the Czech team if it managed a general against the United States.
The first half of the year we met.
Now there are important results.
We have to think about it to be successful,” Vrba agreed.
The only player with health problems is David Lafata.
He is worried about temperature.
If he failed to recover to Wednesday's match against the United States, Vrba's coach would call another attacker.
Genetic disorders are often misdiagnosed
A woman from Britain describes how after a wrong diagnosis for many years she thought she would die.
After being diagnosed with another disease, Karin Rodgers spent most of her adolescence thinking that she had only a few years to live.
In fact, it was Charcot-Marie-Tooth syndrome (CMT) – a group of inherited disorders that damage nerves outside the brain and spine.
The charity CMT UK said that misdiagnosis is a common problem among people with CMT because very little is known about the disease.
It is estimated that approximately 23,000 people in the UK suffer from CMT, which can be manifested by motor skills symptoms such as muscle weakness, stiff walking and twisted toes on the legs.
The affected may also experience numbness or pain, this condition is incurable and progressive, meaning that with time the symptoms get worse.
When Rodgers was thirteen, she thought she was suffering from Freidreich ataxia (FA), a disease that has a very poor prognosis.
She believed that before her eighteenth birthday she would be stuck in a wheelchair and dead before she was thirty.
The mother of two children, who is now 51, says: “As a child, I knew I couldn’t do the same things as everyone else.
I fell down every day and it took me longer.
I was never able to ride a rollercoaster or skateboard with other children, and I was harassed at school because of how I walked and ran.”
When Rodgers was thirteen and was after several operations to loosen her Achilles tendons and straighten her feet, she took advantage of the fact that her doctor left the room and looked into her documentation, where she learned she was suffering from FA.
“I felt guilty because I was tracking, so I didn’t tell anyone, but when I got home, I searched for information about the disease in the library and wrote to the FA Association,” he says.
When they answered, I was in shock, completely panicked.
I thought that before I was eighteen, I would end up in a wheelchair, and before I was twenty-five, I would be dead, and in the meantime I would gradually lose all my abilities.
I was alone and planned my funeral.”
When she was seventeen, she realized that her ability to walk did not deteriorate as much as she expected, and asked her surgeon about it.
He just stood up, hugged her, and said, “Daddy, I don’t think you have this illness, otherwise you’d already be in a wheelchair.
I think it’ll be something much less life-threatening.”
After passing several genetic tests, it was found that he had CMT.
“When he explained to me what CMT was, I thought I was a lucky child,” she said.

Businesses in the Washington area: with the turnover of the economy, taxes rise
A growing economy means more customers, higher sales and new jobs.
Also higher taxes.
According to a new survey released last week, state and local corporate taxation in the country with the accelerating recovery of the economy increased slightly last year, and firms in Washington were no exception.
Entrepreneurs in Maryland and Virginia put together $27.6 billion into state and local treasures for the fiscal year 2013, which is 3.8% more than $26.6 billion raised in 2012.
The tax burden – state and local – increased by 4.3% last year to $671 billion compared to 3.9% last year and was the third consecutive year of growth after 2009 and 2010, when taxes were reduced.
According to a study conducted by the professional firm Ernst & Young and the political group Center on State Taxation, state taxes increased faster, by 4.3 percent, than local taxes, by 3.9 percent.
More than half of the district’s tax revenue, 56 percent, comes from business taxes, and 36 percent of Maryland’s revenue comes from companies.
Virginia, with 28%, shows proportionally the lowest business tax revenue.
The researchers say that the majority of the growth in tax revenues comes from the increase in the value of real estate belonging to companies, which real estate taxes this year after three consecutive years with -1% growth increased by 3.7%.
Although most of the profits come from major states such as California, New York and Texas, the same situation seems to be in Washington.
Companies in D.C., Maryland and Virginia paid over $10 billion in state and local property taxes last year, an annual increase of 4.2% compared to 9.6 billion in 2012.
However, the apparent increase in property value doesn’t drive up state and local tax revenues in Maryland, where property tax accounts for less than a fifth of corporate taxation.
For companies in Virginia and D.C., property tax represents almost half of state and local taxation.
“Many real estate in Maryland is owned by corporations, the tax base around D.C., the government or non-profit organizations that don’t pay taxes,” said Douglas Lindholm, executive director of the Center on State Taxation.
So Maryland is forced to rely much more on, for example, income taxes to pay for the same services that are in other states.
The recent increase in business tax revenue cannot only be attributed to the recovering real estate market.
According to the data, business revenues also appear to increase.
Companies in the region $2.3 billion in corporate income tax, up from $2.1 billion in 2012.
Maryland has raised $1 billion in corporate income taxes, the highest in the region.
Although they are moving in the same direction, the local tax burden on entrepreneurs does not grow in these three locations as quickly.
The growth rate in D.C. was at the national average of 4.3%, while Maryland’s growth rate was significantly higher, 4.9%.
In Virginia alone, tax increases were below average, to 4.1 percent.
Virginia has the lowest corporate income tax rate of all three districts (all of which have the same taxation), 6%.
The corporate tax rate in Maryland is 8.25%, while the D.C. average remains relatively high, at 9.975%.
A similar study conducted this year by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce showed that Virginia has lower state and local taxation and a generally more favorable tax climate than Maryland.
D.C. has not evaluated the study.
Despite this advantage, Virginia faces the pressure of competition from the south.
North Carolina recently signed a law reducing corporate tax from 6.9% to 6%, just like Virginia, and next year the tax will be reduced to 5%.
If the state continues to meet its income targets in the coming year, the statutory income tax rate could be reduced to up to 3% in 2017.
According to a recent study, small in Washington do better, and therefore pay higher state and local taxes.
The business tax paid by small as a personal income tax – the structure of compensation for rising costs by raising prices that organizes most – in D.C., Maryland, and Virginia increased by 20% last year to $2.4 billion, much faster than other taxes.
The researchers say that the trend and nationwide increase in business tax is likely to continue next year, with total sales tax revenues for state and local governments rising to 6.2% over the first three quarters of 2014 compared to the same period last year.
Washington, however, may be lagging behind others, as cutting government spending collects its tax on the labor market.
What you missed: the head of Europe will be Tusk, Putin's Novorussia and Lafat's scissors
Will a new state be established in Ukraine?
Putin calls for negotiations on Novorossiysk
Russian President Vladimir Putin has mentioned the possibility of creating a new state in the southeast of Ukraine, where government troops have clashed with pro-Russian rebels since April.
He also warned European companies that after the current regime of anti-Russian sanctions they will have difficulty returning to the Russian market.
The support that the West receives from the fighting of the Ukrainian army in eastern Ukraine, he said, is contrary to democratic values.
The end of the conflict depends on Kiev, so he cannot say when the Ukrainian crisis will end.
New sanctions against Russia?
The Czech Republic has the right to disagree.
The European Commission and its diplomats are expected to propose the form of further reinforcement of anti-Russian sanctions within a week, the EU summit decided on Friday.
This was stated by Herman Van Rompuy, the permanent chairman of the European Parliament.
According to Czech Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka, concrete proposals for a shift in the form of sanctions should be prepared as early as Monday.
Tusk will be the new EU president.
Van Rompuy replaces in December
Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk has been elected at the European Union summit to head the European Council, the so-called EU president, who heads the summits of member countries.
He will replace Herman Van Rompuy for two and a half years.
Catherine Ashton is replaced by Italian Foreign Minister Federica Mogherini.

On August 30, 1944, the Czechoslovak Independent Brigade moved to France.
Its commander Alois Liška constantly asked for the supplementation of technical equipment and the dispatch to the front.
The British side eventually accepted and ranked this ground unit as one of its forces in the siege of the port city of Dunkerque, which remained in the hands of German troops.
Plzeň leads the league before Prague's "S", Liberec declassed Baník
Viktoria Plzeň is the new leader of the football league, which leads by a point ahead of both Prague "S".
The change in the lead was caused by the defeat of Slavia 1:2 in Mladá Boleslav.
After two defeats in the home league Sparta recovered, thanks to two Lafat's interventions defeated Jablonec.
The record victory in the year was attributed to Liberec, who shot Baník Ostrava 6:0.

Joan Rivers family: “We hold our fingers”
Joan Rivers has been unconscious for three days since being taken to a New York City hospital, but her daughter said today she is not losing hope that the 81 year old comedian will recover.
“Thank you for your greetings and support,” Melissa Rivers said in a statement.
We hold her fingers.
Her mother was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital on Thursday after a call to the emergency service said she had a heart attack at the Yorkville endoscopy in Upper East Side, a source said.
Doctors deliberately keep her under the influence of sedatives and under strict supervision until they are sure of her condition, which remains “serious.”
Reactions did not wait long, including incredible online support from personalities such as Donald Trump, Montel Williams and Kelly Ripa.
Reality is rubricated.
The fact that media outlets are distorting reality is (unfortunately) nothing new.
I know the headlines "sell" the newspapers, but unfortunately I also know that there are many so-called "readers" who don't read anything else.
This is a fact that has bothered me very much lately, more appropriate is the word stitch.
This is true of the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip.
It is very common to say that “Israel has attacked Gaza.”
Only in the text can you read that the Israeli "attack" was a response to rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, often during the declared ceasefire.
It will then appear under the title "Both sides violated the ceasefire."
Does the journalistic community realize that their actions are directly involved in the anti-Semitic attitudes that are growing throughout Europe (and not only there)?
60 years have passed since the end of World War II.
There are still people who survived Shao.
When I saw videos from the Federal Republic of Germany, where the crowd shouted the slogans of “Jewish pigs” and similar conspiracy, I stunned.
Does the world want to do what Hitler did not do?
Are our journalists aware of the fact that the Slavs were destined to be exterminated after the Jews?
Ladies and gentlemen, please pay a little more attention to your work.
You are often referred to as the “guard dogs of democracy.”
Defend her then.

And defend the right of the only truly democratic country in the Middle East to protect its people.
How would you like our government to be preserved if one of our neighbors decided to destroy the Czech nation and erase the Czech Republic from the map of the world?
You should also be aware of another fact.
Nearly 20% of Arabs with Israeli citizenship live in Israel.
They are well there.
When you ask them why they don’t go to Gaza, for example, they’ll answer, why would they do it?
In Israel, they have jobs, social security and top-notch health care (I have seen myself visiting the top-notch private hospital Hadassa, which is funded by sponsorship donations from Jews from all over the world, and Arabs, of course, are treated there).
Hamas is also targeting its Arab brothers.
The only real aid to Gaza, and thus to this troubled region, is to remove it from Hamas and disarm it.
And not to condemn Israel, though indirectly in the headlines.
Report the practices of Hamas, its abuse of people as human shields.
Hamas aims to destroy the state of Israel at any cost.
Even at the cost of the death of innocent Arab children.
Hamas is on the list of terrorist organizations.
In the nine years of self-government in Gaza, this region could have been flourishing thanks to humanitarian aid from all over the world.
Even from Israel, which supplies water and electricity there, but the Gazan administrators do not pay for it and are even upset that at this time the supply of electricity is sometimes interrupted.
If Hamas had not invested money in building underground tunnels to allow suicide bombers to penetrate Israel, but in building houses, hospitals and schools, its Arab brothers in Gaza would have lived much better.
Amazon to buy Twitch for $1.4 billion
Amazon just confirmed Monday morning’s Information claim: An internet retailer – a video producer and hundreds of other things – is buying the video streaming service Twitch for $1.4 billion ($970 million).
The announcement caused a surprise, not because nobody expected Twitch to be bought, but because it was expected that YouTube would be the buyer.
Three months ago, a billion-dollar sale of Twitch to Google seemed certain, and this connection seemed natural.
Twitch, which just three years ago was founded by Justin.tv, had stumbled to become a widely used video streaming service – a live version of YouTube.
Instead, it quickly became a platform for gamers to broadcast online games to it – in the words of Business Insider “YouTube for Live Playing”.
Interact with Twitch.
On YouTube, there are already popular “Let’s play” videos, a genre where mudrlants (mostly older) give games the processing of Mystery Science Theater.
The fact is that YouTube comes to shake a lot when describing Twitch, so the news that YouTube is buying Twitch didn’t upset anyone much, it was a textbook example of how an established company will pay off potential competition.
The mystery is why the deal with YouTube failed, despite the company being willing to pay the same amount as Amazon.
Emmet Shear, CEO of Twitch, said: “We chose Amazon because they believe in our company, have the same values and a long-term vision and want to help us it faster.”
Another mystery is – frankly – the incredible success of Twitch.
For snobs like me who say they’d rather do sports than watch, it’s hard to understand what’s so amazing about playing games instead of just watching.
One thing is to watch a friend over the shoulder at three in the morning as he plays Resident Evil, and another thing is to watch a stranger get twenty hits in the head in Call of Duty.
All the games you can watch.
Another problem is that many of today’s most popular games are from a player’s perspective, so looking at their record without being able to check the perspective yourself is quite a good recipe for getting a bolehlav.
I admit that speed run games, in which the Rogers Bannisters of our electronic age finish the game in record time, are fun.
But if someone is not a master of gaming or humor, his channel on Twitch probably won’t be very interesting.
But what do skeptics know about this?
Twitch has 55 million monthly visits and is fourth in the top of internet traffic.
How does Amazon use it?
It’s hard to imagine Twitch mixing up with Amazon Instant Video as elegantly as it could have been swallowed by YouTube.
Twitch, however, has something every company would like to attract: the hordes of young men advertisers want.
As CEO Twitche Shear said, both Amazon and Twitch “believe in the future of games” and the media don’t seem to be reluctant, even as – swallowing – viewers.
The second basic lie of creationism.
Another English translation by American atheist vlogger Arona Ra.
This time on the subject “The Holy Scriptures are the Word of God.”
Original video attached.
The second basic lie of creationism is the belief that sacred texts were written by God and not by real human authors.
When believers debate one of the many things that are in conflict with their religion, they often put us before the question: Who will you trust?
The word of God or the word of man?
As if human investigation were entirely futile compared to the authority they imagine their doctrine has.
But when they say “man,” they talk about science.
And when they refer to “the word of God,” they refer to the myths about God written by men.
If there really exists an intelligent creator with a purpose, then it is he who created the fossil record that reveals the evolutionary history, and it must be he who invented the genetic patterns that correspond to it, and it must be he who delivered the next series of evidence that points exclusively to the evolutionary conclusion to the last detail.
Why would otherwise all these things exist?
It looks like he’s trying to tell us something.
People could not create any of those things.
But people can tell stories, fabulate.
And they were the people who wrote all those texts that pretended to be the Word of God.
Every supposedly holy doctrine of any religion in the world describes itself as written by people, not gods.
People who were "moved" or "inspired" by their favourite gods, or listened to the dictates of angels, but those texts were written by no one but mere mortals with a certain degree of imagination, not angels and no gods at all.
If there really were one real God, he would be an integral part of all the gods of all religions, an over-galactic supergeny, the ultimate entity of the entire cosmos.
If a being of this size ever wrote a book, there would only be one such book, one sacred Scripture.
It would be known everywhere in the world, without predecessors, parallels or alternatives in any language, because only human authors would not be able to measure themselves with such a work.
And people’t have to blindly believe it, because it would be consistent, backed up by verifiable and true evidence, and revealed a profound morality and wisdom far beyond all human limits.
It would perpetually inspire every reader to the unity of a common faith.
If God had written it, we would not have expected anything less.
But what we see instead is the exact opposite.
Instead of a single religion leading to the ultimate truth, we have many different religions without a common origin, and all of them are continually breaking up into increasingly separate denominations, seeking controversial truths, and each claiming in some way the guidance of God, regardless of the continuing divergence and separation in every direction.
The Jewish Torah, the Christian Gospels, the Islamic Qur’an, Bahá’u’lláh’s Kitáb-i-Akdas, Zarathustra’s Avesta, the Sikh Adí-Granth, the Mahabharata Bhagavad-Gita, the Book of Mormon, or the Book of Urantia are all considered to be “absolute truth” and “the revealed word of the one true God” and the respective believers of each say that the others are in error.
Probably the only logical explanation is that everyone is at fault to some extent.
None of these books have any advantages over the others.
None of them have evidence and none can be historically confirmed.
My name is Dr. Paul Maier, and I am a professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University.
I am not saying that I have proven that the Bible is reliable and historically accurate.
Of course it is not.
You must always have faith.
All of them require faith and also apology (defense), because they contain irregularities, absurdities and primitive ideas once considered true, which have already been overcome.
Therefore, it cannot be claimed that they are proof of divine wisdom.
Many of them advocate abominable atrocities instead of morality, and many of them are claimed to have been confirmed by the fulfillment of prophecies – with each also containing prophecies that have not been fulfilled.
The leading theologians admit that all sacred texts of any religion have been written by human hands and are therefore subject to the interpretations, impressions and views of their primitive and often prejudiced politically motivated authors, thus explaining many of the contradictions and irregularities in these books, especially those in the Bible.
I would not call it contradictions, but rather contradictions.
We must again point out that here we have two different authors whose work was somehow mixed together during some editorial review.
He’s right that Genesis has more than one author and it’s definitely not an eyewitness story!
Some experts now distinguish four different sources only for the Pentateuch, i.e. five Books of "Moses," and do not attribute authority to Moses, because it almost did not exist as described in the Bible.
Experts agree that Genesis was composed (probably by Ezra) from several unrelated oral traditions less than 2,500 years ago.
Other documents have been filtered at the same time and are all attributed to human authors.
The Bible is not as old as its believers think.
The Dead Sea Scrolls are the oldest archaeological finds of texts known for their unfinished foundation of all Western monotheistic beliefs, and yet they are many centuries younger than the roots of Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Hellenism, Druid cults, Chinese or Egyptian religion.
Christianity began as a gnostic faith, followed by docetes and ebionites and their entirely different views of Jesus, which eventually combined into a kind of compromise called orthodoxy.
Other Christian groups such as the Luciferians were scattered and discredited by other revisions of the Bible.
One of these modifications relates to the king of Ugarit, who ruled 3,500 years ago.
Because his followers posed a fundamental threat to the young Moses religion, the New Testament authors decided to ridicule and changed Ba’al Zebul, “the Lord on the mountain,” to Belzebub, “the Lord of the flies.”
So the Bible was deliberately and fraudulently modified for both religious and political reasons.
The rest of what happened to the New Testament was canonized in the 4th century AD in a series of committee decisions at the Council of Nicaea.
Four gospels were accepted and sixteen others were rejected by simply raising the hand, as if the fact of something could be accepted or rejected by voting.
The way in which the canon evolved depended on what was read on Sundays in the Christian centers at the time.
What was read on the second Sunday after Easter in the Church of Jerusalem?
And what about the Roman Church at the same time?
And gradually they found that they were approaching the same gospel stories.
And thus the core of the canon thus evolved from the snare of the early Church.
So the Council simply accepted as a gospel any relevant stories that circulated among the uneducated masses at the time.
But they also deliberately removed more than ten books from the Bible, even though they referred to them books that were approved.
Among the rejected items we find writings of both apostles and prophets.
Why should the Word of God refer to books that are only the words of some people and/or are no longer available?
Who was the real editor?
The Bible often mentions human authors.
But how could it be so approved if God was the real author of this random blend of rumors, parables, and psalm lyrics?
The Bible was definitely written by people and not too enlightened, quite the opposite!
That is why so much of its content is historically and scientifically completely misleading, regardless of almost anything from the beginning to the end.
We are talking about people who believed that snakes and donkeys could talk, believed in spells, bloody sacrifices, ritual spells, enchanted objects, flames, astrology, and the five elements of magic.
They thought that if they used a magic rod with which they sprinkled someone with blood, it would cure him from leprosy.
We are talking about people who thought rabbits were cheeks and frogs were birds and whales were fish and pi was the whole number.
These people believed that when they showed pregnant cows striped patterns, they would give birth to striped calves.
How could anyone know anything about genetics?
The authors of this book did not know.
If the Bible were written by a higher being, it would not contain the mistakes it contains.
If it came from the pen of a truly superior being and was intended as a literal history, then it would contain nothing at all of what it contains.
As a moral guide, it completely fails because, most of the original Hebrew writings were written by ignorant and bigot wild men who ignored or promoted animal cruelty, incest, slavery, slave abuse, family abuse, child abuse, child violence, abortion, looting, murder, cannibalism, genocide and prejudice to race, nation, religion, gender and sexual orientation.
To defend their inhumanity by claiming that they are doing the will of God.
But the creationists still ignore all this.
Some of their websites admit that if any fact is contrary to the Bible, then the fact must be ignored!
And why ?
Because if creationists had no beloved books, they would have no God.
In their world, both are the same.
It is ironic that they reject God’s “work” as “inciting creation instead of the Creator.”
But they themselves regard the word of man as the word of God and of God himself, and even insist that the rejection of their supposedly "holy" books somehow rejects God as such.
Not their version of God, but all versions of God.
Creationist Christians think that if the Bible is wrong, then God is lying.
They cannot accept that God may exist and that the Bible may be mistaken at the same time, because they cannot separate the doctrine from the deity.
So it is a kind of idolatry where believers worship man-made compilations as if these books were God Himself, because they think they are His word.
But God never wrote or dictated any of the writings of any religion.
Everything that people have approved or rejected in their supposedly “immutable word” of any god has been invented, assembled, grouped, translated, interpreted, modified, and often also deliberately altered and distorted by mere erroneous people.

Attacker kills nine people in Chinese school, three killed
A man named Chen, according to the New China news agency, violently broke into the building of the primary school in the morning and attacked around half eleven local time.
Three of the nine people he beat later died in the hospital.

New art director of Novy News is David Fiala
David Fiala has been the new art director of news and publicity for Nova TV since September 1.
He will be replaced by Alana Zárubu, who has led the creative department of the entire Nova Group since June 1.
David Fiala previously worked in the graphics department of news television Z1.
Over the last two years, under the leadership of Alan Záruby, he participated in the implementation of the complete visual transformation of the news programmes Televizní noviny, Střepiny, Prásk! and other publicist programs of TV Nova.
David Fiala controls very well the synergy of communication between the editorial, studio management and graphic department, which is the essence of the work of the art director of news.
It has a sense of typography and a pure elegant design, which is the path that we want to go further in Novy’s visual news,” says Alan Záruba, Novy’s creative director.
Apple's iCloud allegedly surrendered to hackers, nude photos of celebrity appeared in the public
Screenshot of missing files
In the meantime, an anonymous user posted nude and pornographic images of American celebrities on 4chan, the US server Mashable.com.
They are allegedly obtained by unauthorized access to user accounts on Apple’s servers, where affected users uploaded them through automatic backup of images from iPhones and iPads.
Apple has not yet commented on the issue.
Some celebrities reject the images as fake, but several have already admitted the authenticity of the images.
Among them are actress Jennifer Lawrence, known for her title role as Katniss in the Hunger Games series, and Mary Elizabeth Winstead, who starred in Deadly Traps 4.0, for example.
The goal of the hacker is to use the images and videos obtained to enrich.
U.S. magazines arely interested in the footage, according to reports on the server 4chan but the hacker wants money from the community.
According to the server The Next Web, it is very likely really a weakness in iCloud security.
Two days ago, a tool appeared on GitHub that allowed you to obtain passwords to user accounts through brute force, i.e. automatically repeating attempts to log in with different passwords.
This tool proved to work, but Apple closed the security hole after two days.
The certainty, however, is that potential attackers had a lot of time to gain access to different accounts before releasing this tool.
iCloud users should change their password associated with their Apple ID for preventive reasons.
The length of the password is important, not its complexity.
The length is at least 12 characters.
The leakage of nude pictures of celebrities is considered a reminder of the safe use of online services.
Although servers of companies such as Apple, Google or Microsoft are secure many times better than computers in households or smaller, uploading sensitive photos in unprotected form is an unnecessary risk.
If you want to back up explicit photos or any other sensitive content online, first encrypt the files before uploading.
It is also reasonable to set the automatic backup of photos from the phone so that it only takes place on wi-fi and after connecting to the charger.
In this way, you will be able to move sensitive images "safe" in time, and most importantly, you will have space to delete unsuccessful images, so they will not unnecessarily occupy space in online storage.
Instructions on how to encrypt files and communications on the Internet, we offer readers HN and IHNED.cz in the form of an electronic book by Michal Altair Valáška in PDF format.
A smart way to save for college scripts
Since the cost of college scripts for many students exceeds $1,000 a year, an upcoming second-year student came up with a smart way to cut costs.
He invented a system of borrowing books from high school classmates with a nominal compensation offer to delay their sale back.
“The calculation book, which normally costs $180 for a semester, I got for ten and for chicken nugets,” says Schroeder, 19, who studies at Covenant College in Georgia.
Books required in his last semester would cost $430, he says.
He spent 120.
According to the university council, an average student spends more than $1,200 a year on textbooks and utilities, but students have different options to handle these expenses.
The preferred choice of students becomes online and creative solutions such as Schroeder’s.
Lending of textbooks is on the rise, allowing students to use a semester book often with a significant discount than if they bought it.
Neebo Inc, which runs more than 250 bookstores on campuses, says book borrowing has doubled since 2011.
The industry survey shows that around a quarter of the books in university bookstores were borrowed in the last spring semester, says Neebo Vice President Trevor Meyer.
Less than half of the textbooks are purchased in university bookstores, according to the National Association of University Shops.
Here are the 101 best ways to succeed.
Shopping Online
Prices for some new books can be up to a third lower on the Internet than in university bookstores.
The recommended price for the ninth edition of “Calculus” by Ron Larson, Bruce Edwards and Robert Hostetler is almost $290, but on the Internet it can be purchased for $239.99 on Chegg.com, a textbook retail store.

If you don’t care about other people’s notes or wear and tear, a suitable option are the used textbooks.
On Chegg.com, “Calculus” is sold for $93.49.
Matt Casaday, 25, a senior student at Brigham Young University, says he paid 42 cents on Amazon.com for the used copy of “Strategic Media Decisions: Understanding the Business End of the Advertising Business.”
It was sold for $48.
University teacher Ingrid Bracey, head of the University of Massachusetts Amherst's College Without Walls, suggests that students check with their teachers whether older editions are acceptable.
Sometimes changes are not essential for workshops.
If so, older editions may be sold for a fraction of the price of the latest version.
In addition to Chegg and Amazon, eBay Inc’s Half.com is also a popular alternative to buying used books.
borrowing
It is also worth considering to borrow textbooks, if you treat them well, do not forget to return them and do not need to have them even after the seminar.
You can save up to 80% on a new book.
For example, a student could borrow “Calculus” for about $20 for a full semester.
Get acquainted with the terms and conditions of the store where you borrow the book, including penalties for notes, highlighting or wear and damage.
Keep in mind: If you do not return the book on time, the fine may be higher than the price of the new book.
E-Books
Another option is to buy an e-book instead of a regular e-book.
Sometimes these books are essentially borrowed in the form of an electronic license valid for a certain period of time from distributors such as Amazon.com, Chegg and Barnes & Noble Inc.
Chegg borrows “Calculus” for six months for approximately $61.
According to Bracey, literary students can find the best offers because many classics are now available for free download, while science and technical texts can be very expensive.
In any case, go to shops.
Joe Gault, 29, who soon enters Pepperdine Law School, recommends following ISBN as this guarantees you’re buying the right book.
Before you order a book over the internet, make sure it’s really in stock, advises Gault.
He proved it on his own skin.
The book he bought was sold out for four weeks, and he had to pay the full price for the book from the university bookstore.
Same mud, same mud.
And then found in the well torzo rifles from the end of the war
The well is located just a bit from St. George's Church.
We uncovered the porosity around and began to pull out the old-fashioned nános – about a meter and a half of mud and rotten leaves.
When we approached the clay bottom, we stumbled upon the head,” Radomil Novák described.
We pulled it out, cleaned it and found it to be the torso of the German assault rifle used by the SS.
The discovery is allegedly unusual.
According to my information, such guns were produced until the end of the war.
And there were about three hundred thousand,” Novak added.
All the wooden structural things have disintegrated over time, so it is useless.
Her body is preserved – it keeps its shape.
How was it in the well?
There is one explanation.
Per it was thrown there by people who needed to get rid of the weapons used by the SS troops, probably out of fear of being pushed away.
The fascists would not have done so.
“They were throwing guns in the woods,” he said.
The rifle was the only thing the enthusiasts of the Spirit Movement of the Autumn found in the well.
"There could also be hand grenades, those here once were everywhere around a lot, so we slowed the excavation work, we carefully spotted the mud, so that there was no disaster, but nothing else was there," Novák said.
The find will end in the museum depository at the castle in the nearby Silesian Rudoltsia.
Ukrainian General: I have not released the captured Czech
Exclusive interview with Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban, who liberates Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists.
Kiev/Prague - "Sorry, I have to take it ... they call me from Donetsk," apologized eight times during an exclusive interview with Aktuálně.cz Ukrainian General Colonel Volodymyr Ruban, otherwise also the director of the Centre for the Liberation of Prisoners of War.
Colonel General Volodymyr Ruban in a television debate.
With each such interruption, it was impossible not to hear the names of people, their numbers or the places where they are – or should be – which Ruban specifies with his counterpart on the other end of the phone.
“It will be that – go there,” he ended one of the flash discussions with Donetsk and again devoted to our one.
Volodymyr Ruban is a backup general, a former fighter pilot and an active participant in anti-government protests on the Maidan.
Yesterday, when we had an interview, he was in Donetsk.
The liberation of Ukrainian soldiers from the captivity of pro-Russian separatists is devoted to twenty-four hours a day.
You may know that on the side of the pro-Russian separatists are also fighting the Czechs.
Our counterintelligence estimates their number to thirty.
Of course, there can be a lot more.
Have you met any Czech prisoners during your negotiations?
Volodymyr Ruban: I have liberated the captured Serbs, Dagestans, Chechens, a Swedish, a Georgian... but a Czech yet not.
But I know who to turn to in Prague if we encounter your captive compatriot and can rescue him.
Ukrainian soldier captured by separatists
A.cz: What do you advise the Czechs, who are joining the pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian soldiers are taking them?
They should understand that if, like the Czechs, they fight in Ukrainian battalions of volunteers and separatists capture them, they will be shot without mercy after interrogation, just like any other foreigner.
Separatists consider these men to be mercenaries, and they say they deserve nothing but death.
But if, for example, Ukrainian soldiers capture a group of Donetsk separatists – and among them a Czech – they put him in prison and treat him as a prisoner of war.
That guy will survive.
The Ukrainian side also acts as a state in the war.
Q: And how many Ukrainian prisoners have you managed to save?
If I understand it correctly, in exchange.
Some sources report that it has long since exceeded a hundred men.
We’ve stopped counting how many people we’ve helped.
But we only liberated them... they didn’t save them from the war if they decided to continue fighting.
The survivors are doctors, surgeons, but we aren’t.
So is it.
Every day there are more and more.
Every day we save someone.
Sometimes one, sometimes four or five.
It is not always an exchange.
Sometimes a simple human request is enough to release prisoners.
A.cz: It is rumored that in a few months you have gained great authority and even trust from the pro-Russian separatists... just like in Ukrainian society.
How have you managed to build respect on both sides?
A difficult question.
One of the officers in Kiev gave me the nickname "the mad general with the steel balls".
It does not offend me.
Per that is the essence of our work.
As the head of the Ukrainian Corps of Officers, I have gained some authority before.
I never cheat, I never cheat and I always keep my word.
Whatever happens, I act honestly and tell the truth.
Even when it is very unpleasant for the Ukrainian government, or that of Donetsk or Luhansk.
They torture and kill people.
They say they are being tortured and killed.
That they are crimes.
Often I risk my life, even I was captured in the exchange of prisoners... this work for me can end at any time... I don’t have to go back.
Q: How many executions and torture prisoners do you know?
Ukrainians and separatists are resorting to torture prisoners during interrogations.
Unfortunately .
And the execution?
It is only on the Donetsk side.
I have no information that the Ukrainian army is also executing prisoners.
There is no indication that the Ukrainian army is doing something similar.
We have an idea of the number of executions, but I cannot and do not want to give numbers.
A.cz: Describe the characters and motives of the pro-Russian separatists.
Among them are soldiers and veterans from Afghanistan.
They are striving for independence and democracy in Donetsk or Luhansk – at least so they say.
They no longer want to play games with Ukrainian oligarchs.
Separatists already have their teeth full of oligarchs and are their irreconcilable opponents – to life and to death.
As we say, they ate them up to the throat.
The same dreams and desires were expressed by people on Majdan, by the way.
And now I speculate a bit: Russia supports the separatists and the West, on the contrary, supports the Ukrainian state.
One speculation is big and the other is small.
But this phrase hides an irreconcilable contradiction.
A.cz: For example, what do you think of Igor Bezler, one of the hardest leaders of the pro-Russian separatists?
Whenever I cross the line of the war front, I am without weapons and show the soldiers or the militants their bare hands.
And I always have both sides of those two hundred or three hundred meters on the musk or in the optical focuser.
The faces of the people who are aiming at me, I see well every time... and they can press the trigger of their weapons at any time.
Lander, experienced colonel with German and Ukrainian ancestors.
He considers himself to be a Russian officer, but his family – his mother – lives in Ukraine.
They believe that Ukraine should not exist.
And if so, then just like a small governorate in a large Russian empire.
In any case, he constantly talks about it and considers Ukraine a kind of misunderstanding.
Such a country should not even exist.
He is the enemy of all Ukrainian oligarchs.
A.cz: When we’re talking about characters, in the Ukrainian TV talk show you called your Prime Minister Arseni Yatsenyuk a weak, helpless and tired “leader” who would do the best if he left quickly.
In those three hundred meters walk, I always get at least five times scared.
So why should I be hiding with the view that Yatsenyuk is a very weak prime minister and that he is harming our country?
Q: Do you think it has a role in the war in Ukraine?
You may know that the Ukrainians refer to Jaceňuk as “the rabbit.”
And the rabbit is not in the eyes of Ukrainians an animal to be feared or to have respect and authority in others.
His behavior directly copies the rabbit’s behavior.
Per he is a good economist, but as a prime minister he has no right in war to weep in parliament, to plead with him, to play his intrigues, to threaten to lay down his position... he must rule the country, manage it, and protect it in time of war.
When the country is threatened, the prime minister has no right to family, friends, rest on weeping emotions.
He is the first Minister of Ukraine.
And Jace?
She is a puberty girl.
Yes, he’s tired, but he’s also weak because he’s never been strong... he’s not fighting for Ukraine, he’s just constantly complaining about everything.
He should therefore leave.
The sooner, the better for Ukraine.
Why Guardians of the Galaxy failed to save sales
The missing 3 of Sylvester Stallone returned less than $30 million from a $90 million U.S. budget, and Sin City: Woman I Would Kill for only $12 million from a $70 million budget.
Cameron Diaz’s Sex Tape made just $14.6 million over the first weekend, and children’s movies like How to Train a Dragon 2 were a disappointment for theaters.
According to the article by film critic Robbie Collin in the Telegraph, when it comes to children’s films, their quality itself is to blame.
Collin called 2014 the “worst” year for children’s films, and How to Train a Dragon 2 called it a mere “functional” sequel.
When it comes to movies deployed to a slightly older target audience, it seems that the problem may not necessarily be in the quality of the films themselves.
In July, Entertainment Weekly compared the CinemaScore and Metacritic servers and their average ratings of summer film premieres broadcast in at least 2,000 cinemas between War Victims’ Day and July 20, 2013 and this year.
The results, which take into account the opinion of viewers and film critics, suggest that this year’s film harvest is similar in quality to last year’s hits.
According to some commentators, the change in viewing approach and the higher popularity of internet servers such as Netflix may be to blame.
Director Jon Favreau, who is currently working on Disney’s “Book of the Jungle,” told the Hollywood Reporter website: “I think times are changing.”
We must accept it and not strive to chase what has already been.
In contrast to the current crisis of Hollywood cash markets, Netflix's profits from internet services reached $1.2 billion, almost twice as much as last year's $837 million.
Last summer, director Steven Spielberg criticized the studios for relying too much on rights to comics, and predicted a “crash” of Hollywood.
In the light of the current decline, some commentators say that there may be something on its catastrophic spell.
With the listing of possible big cash tricks in the summer of 2015, including Avengers: Age of Ultron, The Outsiders, and the Jurassic World, other figures in the film industry are more optimistic.
X-Men producer Simon Kinberg recently described the drop in sales as simply “cyclical.” For the Hollywood Reporter, he said: “Next summer will be the summer of the biggest cash tricks in history and no one will worry about selling.”
North Korea threatens Seoul with another short-range missile
North Korea has fired another short-range missile into the sea, Soul said.
The alleged missile test took place shortly after the end of the joint military exercises of the United States and South Korea, which Pyongyang sees as preparations for the invasion.
Chagang province lies in the northwest of the DPRK on the border with China.
A spokesman for the South Korean Defense Ministry said the missiles were fired from a location in North Korea’s northwest and reached a distance of about 200 kilometers.
North Korea apparently fired a missile from the province of Chagang for the first time, South Korean media, citing military circles.
There is an underground launch ramp for Scud missiles in the province.
This is another of a series of similar tests carried out by the isolated North Korean regime in recent weeks.
North Korea has conducted an unusually large number of missile and artillery tests this year.
NATO Summit: Protests in Newport and Cardiff
This weekend, protests took place in Newport.
On Saturday, hundreds of people gathered in the center of Newport to take part in a march against NATO.
And on Sunday, about 150 people came to the town hall in Cardiff for a meeting that was described as a counter-summit.
Stephen Fairclough watched the situation over the weekend and spoke to protesters who arrived from Bridgend to Belgium.
Teenagers had to be transported by air from the Blue Mountains
Two teenage tourists were picked up by plane and taken to safety after spending the night in the Blue Mountains in New South Wales.
A 16-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man went on a tour to Govetts Leap in Blackheath after Sunday noon.
When they did not return home, concerned relatives called the police around 8 p.m.
A search team, including local police and a rescue team, was dispatched and the couple was found near Bridal Veil Falls around eleven o’clock in the evening.
The girl injured her knee and the man fell and struck himself in the head.
The police stayed with them overnight and were picked up on Monday morning.
They were taken by ambulance to the Blue Mountains Hospital.
The winner had only a point on his feet, but the winner was on his feet.
The 23-year-old could have decided, but failed in the two biggest chances.
After the goal called mainly a shot close three minutes before the end, but instead in the net ended on the goalkeeper of Opava Josefu Květoňovi.
I was on my feet and I had to give it a chance.
“I’m angry with myself,” she poured ashes on her head.
“I should have put it higher under the lid, I felt a little like it,” he reminded.
The defense of Sigma did not allow Opava much, with the exception being Mikulov's attack from the 11th minute, which, however, covered goalkeeper Reichl.
Then the Hanats began to push, but the chances in the block defending the domestic did not let go and the missiles from a distance captured Květoň.
We played for 15 minutes and then we took the initiative.
In the second half we were better, we had more of the game and Opava threatened us only from standard situations.
But Vašíček did not change the chance, and so it ended 0:0," regretted Hanákov coach Leoš Kalvod.
Opava took a point also because of absences in the composition, where in addition to two injured missed Petr Vavřík with three-goal shooter Peter Ševčík, who in Silesia host from Sigma.
Unlike his previous policy, he did not participate.
Deputies deserve discharge.
Sigma was more footballistic, but until one standard we didn’t let it go for nothing,” said coach of Slezanov Petr Baránek.
There was a lot of emphasis, aggression and fighting.
The finish is well-deserved, and the point is a decent gain for us,” he added.
Sigma got four points, which means thirteenth place.
Nothing that could satisfy the boss of the club, Jose Lebr, who after defeat with Znojem conditioned his million-dollar deposit in the box by diametrically different performances in further matches.
"We were aware of Mr. Lebra's warning, so there can be no talk about the fact that the boys would not want to fight," Kalvoda noticed and added to the address of the sleeping shooter Vašíčka: "I believe that it will come and when he gives a goal, it will start to fall there.
But after the first hit, I will replace him immediately to save his goals for the next match," Kalvoda laughed.
Al Pacino has struck Venice twice.
The film festival is in crisis.
After the enormous enthusiasm over the opening film Birdman, whose director Alejandro González Iňárritu once ranked among the serious candidates for the Golden Lion, the next few days gave the impression that interest in the 71st Venice festival fell somewhat.
Whether because the number of seats in the largest hall increased to fourteen hundred, or because Birdman was followed by critics recognized but less appealing to viewers, such as a documentary about the Indonesian genocide of the 1960s The Look of Silence and other social-themed films from American 99 homes to Iranian Stories, the cinemas simply left empty seats.
Heroes of Comics
Even the red carpet in front of the festival palace did not have such crowds as in the past andly ceased to be a problem to find a place in the hotel at the last moment.
The crisis is talked about more than anywhere else in Italy, and it is no surprise that it has affected even such respected institutions as the Biennale and the oldest film festival in the world.
Fortunately, the crisis is not manifested by a lack of personalities, but present only in the context of films.
While younger fans longed for autographs of comic superhero representatives Michael Shannon and Andrew Garfield, who successfully played dramatic roles in 99 homes, for all generations without distinction, the main event became the visit of the legendary actor Al Pacino.
He appeared here in two films.
In the Oscar-winning film Barry Levison’s Out of Competition, based on the novel by Philip Roth, the seventy-four-year-old Pacino has a role that is close to him: an actor at the height of fame who suffers from depression from the end of his career and his personal life.
But seeing him the next day as a strange iron shop owner from a rural town in the film Manglehorn, directed by David Gordon Green, was a truly unforgettable experience.
Volpi's cup for best acting performance shouldn't miss him - but does the artist of Pacin's format still need prizes?
Per the greatest satisfaction for him is the love of the audience, and the Italian in particular, because although he was born in New York, Al Pacino is proud of the country from which his grandparents came.
Points for Italy
This year’s film is doing very well in Venice.
Black Souls, directed by Francesco Munzi, became the first film after Birdman to be rewarded with long applause of standing up.
The Calabria mafia is inspired by a look at family relationships between clans fighting for power and money, and the director has been able to reconcile all the prerequisites for a good film: a quality script, camera, music and actors.
He was also interested in the chamber psychothriller Hungry Heart, which was shot by Saverio Costanzo with Alba Rohrwacher in the role of a woman who almost kills her own child with her scary anxiety.
On the contrary, the French competitive films did not receive a warm welcome, neither the Redemption for Fame nor the Three Hearts, both of which stick to the traditional model of consumer films, which are based on the popularity of acting representatives.
But after all, the two really excellent films, Birdman and Black Souls, are not so few for the first half of the festival.
And although the festival films have some depressive features, Peter Bogdanovich’s new film, She’s Funny That Way, a funny comedy released in Venice outside of competition and shot in the style of American games of the 40s, has been able to raise the mood for more than a day.
Police arrest four pervitin manufacturers in Prague, drugs were carried from Poland
"The detectives have detained three men aged 42, 42 and 37 and a 25-year-old woman who, from last November until this August, manufactured and sold the drug pervitin in Prague 9," police spokeswoman Jana Rössler said.
First on Tuesday, August 12, an intervention unit in Tihlarska Street caught a forty-two-year-old organizer and dealer in one person and a young woman, who in the group figurated as a drug buyer in Poland and a drug dealer.
The following day, the detectives detained, on the basis of the prior consent of the prosecutor, another member of the group, namely a 37-year-old man.
The last of the four police officers were caught in the morning of Wednesday, August 20, in the area of the Malachic combustion plant," the spokeswoman said.
A third of the drug was taken from Poland.
The leader had a wide field of action.
In the workshop of the airfield, in the garden house in Horoměřice, in the apartment in Konevova street and in other places in Prague 9 he produced pervitin, supplied various devices and chemicals necessary for its production, and provided the transport of drugs with pseudoefedrine from the Republic of Poland.
He also weighed the drug, divided it into plastic bags and sold the pervitin.
He was assisted by a twenty-five-year-old woman who had not yet been punished for selling drugs from Poland to drug addicts.
For this, she received a reward from the organizer in the form of a third of the drug produced," Rössler added.
On the basis of the judge's order, the criminals also conducted several home inspections, where they seized the drug, industrial chemicals, digital weights, salary bags, syringes, tubes and other devices and items that, according to experts, can be considered complete equipment for the manufacture of methamphetamine.
The dealer has been punished seven times since 1995.
"From the available records, the police found that the main organizer had been convicted for property crime seven times since 1995, the woman was not convicted," the police spokesman added.
The last detainee was convicted in 2006 for a crime of sexual abuse and the 37-year-old car mechanic, who is being prosecuted on liberty, has been convicted nine times since 2009.
It was mainly a property crime.
The investigator accused three men and a woman of committing a crime of illicit production and other handling of narcotic and psychotropic substances and poisons, for which they risk up to ten years in prison.
In the case of three people, the investigator eventually submitted an incentive to the public prosecutor for the proposal to impose detention, where they were eventually placed by the judge," the spokeswoman said.
The fourth accused, a 37-year-old recidivist, was released.
His position and role in this case was not as fundamental as that of the other accused.
Police are still working with the man.
Ferrari offers chess from wood and carbon.
Ferrari offers in its other products very interesting things at a lot of "interesting" prices.
A good example is hand-made chess with a playboard size of 42 x 42 cm.
If you like it, get more than 40,000.
The exact price is 43 405 CZK.
The customer receives a set of wooden black and red-painted figures stored in a wooden box coated with carbon fibers.
No one will be surprised that instead of a classic rider, players have a figurine of a racing horse.
If chess doesn’t seem like a valuable gift, there’s also a Ferrari 500 F2 made (of course by hand) on a scale of 1:1.8.
The price of this toy is 318 305 CZK.
The dismantling of high schools and high schools makes no sense.
The Czech Republic has few generally educated people and statistics also show that high school students have a good application.
The start of the school year is here.
There has been a lot of preparation in the schools over the last 14 days.
This is usually routine, such as bringing the flower pots from the summer storage back to the classroom and tapping the crisps.
The high school will have a little bit of freckles.
A few days before the start of the season, they collect furniture, computers and other technical equipment and literature to the library.
There was no robbery or bribery, the four-year gymnasium in Hořice after three years opens and reopens its activity.
Not in the public, but in the private.
The lack of material equipment is not due to the fact that the founders were so incompetent.
They had to wait for the existence of the school to be confirmed by entering the school register managed by the MŠMT.
“The French Socialists should break down and put France in order,” says key ally Francois Hollande.
Valls called on the highly fragmented left to “show its support” for the militant socialist president, whose new division of functions has not met with the approval of the majority of the French.
The President deserves universal respect, deserves loyalty, deserves our support.
“Our duty is to stay by his side,” he said and applauded.
As a conciliatory gesture, the prime minister insisted that his government would not challenge the controversial French 35-hour working week despite the passionate arguments from Emmanuel Macron, the new finance minister who earlier this week proposed to relax the rules.
On Saturday, Hollande called on the Socialists to remain “coherent” with the government.
But Justice Minister Christiane Taubir made a line over the budget when she appeared at a meeting of rebellious Socialist MPs, where she criticized the Socialist Party for causing it to “defeat the French’ faith in the future.”
Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right conservative party, laughed at the ongoing internal disputes among the Socialists when she said she did not expect the new government of Valls to last longer than a few months.
Emperor Francois Hollande is naked and Prince Manuel Valls too.They were forced to form a new government when the previous one did not last until the end of the summer.
“And the new one will not last until the end of autumn or winter,” Le Pen told her supporters.
She reiterated her party’s call for the dissolution of Parliament, saying that she believes it could win early elections and that she is ready to rule the country.
The French ruling party suffered a defeat in the municipal elections in March and in May, the far-right wins the European Parliament elections.
According to a survey by the Journal du Dimanche, 76 percent of French think the Socialist Party is at risk of splitting into several rival factions before the end of Holland’s term in 2017.
Pascal Perrineau, a political scientist at Sciences Po University, warned that the French would soon lose their patience if the new socialist government failed to improve the economy and reduce record unemployment.
“This is a limited space for opportunity, but public opinion must think that there is a change in the situation,” he warned.
Otherwise, the situation could get worse.
Gambling and street art will no longer limit Prague to elections
The amendments should be prepared and approved by the new management.
No more playgrounds will disappear from the streets of Prague before the municipal elections and the city will not restrict street art.
There will be no restrictions on dogs.
Prague will not be able to prepare and approve amendments to the relevant decrees in the parliamentary assembly before the October elections.
"The decision on the changes should not be made by the current management of the city, which ends the mandate in a few weeks," said the council's Lukáš Manhart (TOP 09).
In the past few weeks, several town halls, such as Prague 5 and 7, have decided to abolish platform gambling on their territory.
But the game will not disappear, the gambling regulations will not change yet.
This is the role of the city after the elections.
Now we’t technically do that, given the time limits for comments and so on,” Manhart explained.
He added that the last meeting of the current parliament, which must approve the amendment to the decree, will take place on September 11.
A referendum on the ban on gambling is scheduled on the day of municipal elections in Prague 1 and Prague 8.
Currently, gambling is prohibited in Prague 2 or Prague 12.
For the same reasons, the decree will not change in the case of street art, the so-called busking.
Prague 1, in particular, has already sent to the magistrate a proposal for places to expand the current list of forbidden places.
The musicians do not want Prague 5 in the vicinity of Angel.
A decree regulating the marriage of dogs is being prepared by the city for several months, yet not completed.
The location of the playgrounds and the problem of busking are resolved by city regulations.
It can only be issued or modified by the City Council.
The councils have an advisory voice, they are not allowed to issue orders.
Last week, he placed the victory of Scottish independence advocates at hand
The Scottish independence campaign was in danger of making this mistake for the third time when it placed on billboards across Scotland the question of whether the Scots wanted to be rich.
But you won’t reach the hearts of Scottish voters by appealing to their wallet, or getting their respect by threatening them.
The morality of the New Testament is still alive in Scotland, although few Scots still attend church today.
Scots have a much greater tendency to drive exchangers out of the temple than to let them dictate how to vote.
The head of Scottish nationalists, Alex Salmond, knows this well, so in a television debate he repeatedly asked his rival, Unionist Darling, if he was willing to respect the "sovereign will of the Scottish people" if Scottish voters voted for independence, and to start supporting a single currency for Scotland and for England.
That forced Darling to vote between Scottish civil society and London financiers, and fell into this trap with grimas.
Of course, Darling will not support the Scottish voter’s mandate.
However, the discussion about how Scotland will have a currency has been more or less neutralized.
What really motivates Scottish voters is fairness, job opportunities and the defense of public health care that citizens have for free.
Darling supported the London bankers on the issue of currency and also gave the impression that he would not protest against the privatization of healthcare.
As Salmond said, “He went to bed with the Conservatives.”
This is a very dangerous position for every Scottish politician.
Every Scottish voter knows that Scottish businessmen are in bed with conservatives.
This was confirmed by David Cameron, who in Scotland spoke not to the voters, but to the association of "bosses", to the Confederation of British Industry.
It is becoming clear that Cameron’s refusal to debate independence with Scottish Prime Minister Salmond was a serious mistake for the unionist campaign.
Cameron looks like a cowardly absent housewife.
The Scots would respect him if he came to a debate with the Scottish prime minister.
Cameron has at least been able to say that Scotland can be a “successful independent country.”
Alistair Darling can’t say anything like that, it almost causes him physical pain.
What it communicates is clear: Scots should not jump out and must accept what is.
The longest year is 10 months.

Milos Urban Longest Year
The end was the best of the holidays at all, the last week that has gone nowhere and we just walked and walked with baby summer, silence before the storm, calm before stress.
New clothes, when you could get from Tuzex, shoes from East Germany.
Reading the Fast Arrows, for the fifty-fifth time, cycling the mountain around the Imperial to the back of Vary, somewhere to the tennis courts, there was no more heat, the sun smoothed the back and shoulders, the rays knocked on to say goodbye.
In the evening, mild nervousness, still a holiday mode, sleep until half eleven, in a week it will be worse, the moments before going to bed will stretch from a few minutes to two hours, in the morning then get up at half seven.
Will come Monday.
It usually doesn’t rain, on the contrary, the summer is rough in front of the school.
To climb in the ghostly light on a slope and feel like a plastic figure in a glass gravel, there is the school, ZŠ A.
With a monstrously pink patch, and in front of her old known faces and a couple of new, boys more distant, girls more busty.
There they are frightening, those to avoid, it’s just as interesting how unmistakably they hold together and how soon they are here.
And these adult-looking girls, who came screaming, are now laughing hysterically at something, maybe something has changed in their lives over the holidays, while everything is the same with me.
And the new ones, some nervous and others delighted, why do they go here at all?
Because it must, educational warfare obligation.
So inside, the cold moisture of the floor and the light smell of disinfection, the poisoned schoolman with a mop, unfortunately still the same one, which is said to lend the pupil a key from the drawer, where you can leave textbooks and there are still so few.
for a bottle.
The smell of clothes remains in memory, now it doesn’t happen, it’s pretty ventilated, but in a week it will be worse.
It is only from this idea that the stomach swells and the head starts to hurt.
A head that understands the lessons of mathematics even worse, that evil game for the chosen, among whom I am not and will never be.
Again, those three and four, no god five, to hide from the trial, to fit into the bench and best to sublimate, to be there and not to be, to exist only as a name in the triangle and to dream for the time being stories of more lovely girls and more beautiful buildings, about antennas to the universe, where no one competes with anyone, nobody humiliates and nobody's foot.
The longest year has 10 months.
Today is the first day, just like years ago.
Her born daughter died.
He is in danger of a special punishment. - News.cz
The first birth occurred in March 2012 in the public toilet cabin at the bus station in Jihlava.
Without any help, a little girl was born to her, which she wrapped in a ready-made blanket after cutting her umbilical cord, hid under her jacket, and took to the roadside, where she placed her in the bushes several tens of meters from the road.
Born on the way to school
It came to me a little earlier.
I was on the way to school.
I had to go to the bathroom in the bus, where I gave birth.
She was born alive and looked at me.
I cut off the cord with the scissors I wore for school," the accused said, saying she was ashamed of being pregnant.
“The next day she returned to the place, put the baby’s body in the backpack and took it away, took it out of the backpack, wrapped it in a black igelit bag and hid it and left it under the stairs in her grandmother’s house in Havlíčkově Brodě,” the lawsuit says.
It could be tens of minutes, but also several hours after birth, suffocation when covered with a blanket or placed under a jacket, hypothermia or bleeding from an unconnected umbilical cord.
The same scenario repeated in the spring of next year.
The woman in the nearest unknown time from February to April 12, when the body of the child was found by random witnesses under a crawl near the pond in Havlíčkobrodsk, she secretly gave birth.
This time in the bathroom of a mansion apartment in a family house.
Without checking if she was born alive, without cutting and banding the umbilical cord that was wrapped around her neck, she put the baby in several plastic packages including an igelit bag and left it in the bathroom.
Then, in the afternoon, he and his then partner were taken to the pond.
Finally a friend took her.
The father of the two children was a friend of the accused, who allegedly did not know about the partner's pregnancies.
He has not been convicted, but has been sentenced for a crime against the law.
He was the one who later turned to the police.
I don’t like that he’s not punished as a complicit.
He manipulated the child against my wishes.
I know that my solution was not correct, but it came to me at that moment as human," the accused, who allegedly in the relationship to the man submitted and feared him, did not hide the indignation.
During his speech, the young woman spoke fairly equally.
The tears in her eyes came to her at the moment when she spoke about the relationship with her parents, from whom she left after reaching adulthood.
She did not want to kill
“They come to visit me every 14 days, they do everything for me, even though I know I don’t deserve it,” she said.
I didn’t make up my clothes because I didn’t want children, I felt young.
I wanted to put it in the baby box, but I don’t know what happened that I didn’t do it.
I can’t explain it to you,” the judge replied.
However, she refused to act with deliberation and intention to kill the newborn.
The second child is said to have been born dead.
She did not stop drinking alcohol during pregnancy.
But I limited it.
He did not drink hard.
“I have stopped smoking,” she said.
Although her pregnancy was seen in both cases, she claimed to all, even to repeated questions, that she had health problems, that she was injured.
And a friend too.
The hearing will continue on Tuesday with the testimony of the judges.
A verdict could be issued on Wednesday.
The woman is threatened with a penalty of up to 18 years in prison, or even an exceptional sentence.

According to sources familiar with the matter, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings s.r.o. (NCHL.O.), the world’s third-largest cruise operator, has advanced in negotiations on the acquisition of Prestige Cruises International Inc. for approximately $3 billion.

The deal could be announced this week, a source said on Sunday, but warned that the negotiations still may not end successfully.
The owner of Prestige Cruises, the private investment company Apollo Global Management LLC (APO.N), also owns a 20% stake in Norwegian Cruise.
The sources did not want to be named because the talks were not public.
Representatives of Norwegian Cruises and Prestige Cruises did not respond to requests for comment, a spokesman for Apollo declined to comment on the situation.

According to the registration documents, Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises and Norwegian Cruises together cover 82% of the passenger volume in North America.
Pro-Democratic activists in Hong Kong provoke Chinese authorities a day after the vote decision
Nearby there was a group of people loyal to Beijing who waved the Chinese flag.
The Permanent Commission of the National People's Congress on Sunday approved that only two out of three candidates should participate in the 2017 Hong Kong elections.
All candidates must first gain the support of the Nomination Commission, which will likely consist of members loyal to Beijing.
Because of this decision, it is almost impossible for opposition Democrats to get to the ballot and to force pro-democracy activists to renew their promises and paralyze Hong Kong’s financial center by the protests of the Occupy Central movement.
In Hong Kong, political reforms are the main cause of tensions, with Chinese leaders worried that demands for democratization will spread to other cities.
After Beijing released a detailed report outlining China’s official authority in Hong Kong in June, Democratic activists held an unofficial referendum on elections in a special official district and hundreds of thousands of people marched into and occupied the city’s business district.
The press conference, which will be attended by Prime Minister Li, will be organised by the government in Hong Kong and the Chinese Liaison Office in Hong Kong.
During the day, Zhang Ronghsun, deputy chairman of the Standing Committee of the Legislative Commission, and Feng Wei, deputy director of the State Council of the Office for Hong Kong and Macau Affairs, also spoke at several press conferences.
Student activists said they would gather in front of the Hong Kong government office in the afternoon.
Until the last days of colonial rule 150 years ago, Britain had never mentioned democracy in Hong Kong.
Putin urges Kiev to start talks on "state sovereignty" with eastern Ukraine
On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin asked the Ukrainian government to stop fighting separatists in the eastern part of the country and immediately start negotiations on “state sovereignty” of the separatist regions.
His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, later explained that Putin did not intend to indicate that separatist-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine would become part of Russia, but that their status within Ukraine should be re-evaluated so that the Russian-speaking region would be empowered to protect their rights and interests.
Putin’s call to the Kiev government to treat the pro-Russian rebels as equals corresponds to the obvious strategy he has followed since the outbreak of the riots five months ago: Help the separatists seize territory and force the Ukrainian government to grant the newly declared Novorussia factual independence so that instead of the West it can unite with Russia.
In an interview with the first state television channel, Putin condemned Ukrainian military actions to regain the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, which were dominated by separatists in March and April after Moscow annexed the Ukrainian Crimean peninsula on March 18.
The Kremlin and separatists have referred to the recently occupied territory as “Novorossiya” or “New Russia”, a term referring to the famous pre-revolutionary days of the Russian Empire.
Russian news agency Itar-Tass released Putin’s words that “a prisoner of illusion” is anyone who believes that peace talks are on the horizon, because Ukrainian politicians have launched campaigns ahead of the October 26 parliamentary elections, while government troops are attacking civilians in areas controlled by separatists.
“In the interests of the people living in these areas, we must immediately start meaningful negotiations, not only on legal matters, but also on the political organization of society and the status of state sovereignty in the southeast of Ukraine,” he said.
Peskov said Putin’s allusion to state sovereignty was meant in the context of a broader autonomy that has been negotiated with the leadership of Kiev for months to alleviate the concerns of Russian-speaking regions about threatening cultural and linguistic rights.
Peskov said that only the Ukrainian government can grant the necessary autonomy to the eastern regions.
This is not a matter to be discussed between Ukraine and Russia, Peskov said, “because it is not a conflict between Russia and Ukraine, but an internal Ukrainian conflict.”
The intervention by a Kremlin spokesman to correct the “misinterpretation” of Putin’s remarks highlighted the Russian leadership’s approach to solving the separatist uprising in the east, which is different from the open occupation of Crimea, where most of the two-million population originally belongs to ethnic Russians.
Moscow would have much more trouble annexing Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine, as the majority of the 6.5 million inhabitants are not Russians, and polls conducted before the conflict have shown widespread support for staying in Ukraine.
The autonomy that Russian diplomats discussed in international forums would give regional governments in Ukraine the power to determine their own trade agreements and international relations, and essentially give the Kremlin actual control over the territory that would connect the Russian mainland with Crimea.
The Black Sea peninsula, which was annexed five months ago, is home to the main Russian naval fleet, naval trade and historic coastal resorts.
The areas between Russian Rostov and Crimea are also a center of mines, factories and castings that produce important components for the Russian army.
Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, during his inauguration speech on June 7, suggested that Ukrainian lawmakers - after the new elections - consider constitutional changes that would give diverse regions more control over their finances and language status.
But this vision of autonomy differs greatly from that of the Kremlin and the separatists.Moscow is accused of arming and inciting violence.
Putin’s latest call for Kiev to deal with the separatists as equals followed further insurgency last week after Russian troops and tanks from the previously peaceful region along the Azov Sea penetrated eastern Ukraine.
Separatists reinforced by the Russians have taken control of Novoazovsk with such force that Ukrainian security authorities fear it is a quest to occupy strategic coastal territories up to Crimea.
This accelerated the enormous civil and military effort to fortify Mariupol, a 500,000-populated port of metallurgical combinations between Novoazovsk and the narrow entrance gate to the Crimean peninsula.
Poroshenko spoke at a meeting of EU leaders in Brussels on Saturday, urging action to prevent further Russian aggression against Ukraine, a former Soviet republic that has been independent for 23 years.
“We are approaching a point from which there is no return,” Poroshenko said.
Thousands of foreign troops and hundreds of foreign tanks are now stationed in Ukraine.
The EU summit did not take any definitive steps - the leaders are calling for further sanctions against Russia in the event of an escalation of the Ukrainian crisis.
Colonel Andrij Lysenko, a spokesman for the Ukrainian National Security and Defense Council, told reporters in Kiev on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had to withdraw from their positions in Ilovaisk after two columns of Russian armored vehicles and 1,000 military units penetrated into the Donetsk region last week to support the besieged separatists.
The first of 63 Ukrainian soldiers captured in Ilovaisk during the Russian invasion were exchanged on Sunday for 10 Russian landers captured a week ago in the interior of Ukraine, Lysenko said on Sunday.
Australian celebrities and Gabi Grecko are also involved in the photo scandal.
Geoffrey Edelsten has expressed his disgust over hackers who allegedly stole intimate photos of his fiancée Gabi Grecko and other influential Hollywood stars.
Tinseltown is in shock after a series of explicit photos of naked Jennifer Lawrence came to the internet in the biggest scandal with hacked photos of celebrities.
The hacker claims to have seventy photos of the naked star of the Hunger Games Lawrence and other stars including Kate Upton and Cary Delevingne, singers Rihanna, Ariana Grande and Ley Michell, and actress Kirsten Dunst.
As a result of the leak from iCloud, personal photos of Australian actresses Theresa Palmer, Emily Browning, Yvonne Strahovski and Melbourne actress Grecko also appeared.
There are 101 celebrities on the list.
Edelsten, who asked Greece for a hand last month, told Confidential magazine: “It’s disgusting.”
All private correspondence and all private images should remain private.
It is a shame that personal information can be stolen and spread to the public.
Greece, which is now in New York, has told online newspapers that the hacking is “not shameful” and those who have become its target “feel humiliated.”
The hacker is believed to have obtained thirty photos of Palmer's ex-boyfriend Scott Speedman, including two pictures of her upstairs unwrapped at the pool.
She starred in the movie Love and Honour, with her partner Liam Hemsworth.
TV star Chuck Strahovski and actress Sucker Punch Browning did not comment on the stolen footage.
Lawrence’s spokesman told TMZ: “This is a clear breach of privacy.”
Actor Seth Rogen tweeted: “Publishing photos of hacked phones is like selling stolen goods.”
From a legal point of view, the publication of stolen images should not be tolerated.
The footballers of Sigma have gained Lebra, even without winning
The thunderstorms and flashes, which the co-owner of Olomouc Sigma Josef Lébr sent to his subordinates last week, seem to be the past.
At the end of the game, they only got a point for a pointless draw.
The club’s commitment and commitment has been a bit improved.
The money could soon come to the club.
“I’ll keep one more game, as I said last week, but I’m far more optimistic,” Lebr said, adding that despite the fact that Sigma didn’t win, the players convinced him with improved performance.
The fighting and dedication we played with mainly in the second half was exactly what I wanted to see from the players.
In this case, I can forgive him for not winning.
If we played like this from the beginning of the season, I’m sure we haven’t lost yet,” Lebr said.
Sigma in Opava stopped the initial pressure of the home, then the game was balanced and in the second half it was already better.
After the victory, Kalvod's confidants reached, but they did not reach their chances for a goal, so they could not win.
The outcome is not as expected.
To complete satisfaction, we lacked only one changed chance," Lebr said, but he does not think that the change in the attitude of the footballers was caused only by his threat.
There must have been more aspects.
Whether it’s from my side, from the coach, or from the fans,” Lebr said.
Sigma is under pressure.
The players did not want to comment on the events of last week.
I try to get rid of these things entirely.
I tried not to admit it," young goalkeeper Michal Reichl nodded his head.
Completely uncommented then left a question on Lébrov's statement from last week attacker Václav Vašíček, who did not change Sigma's biggest opportunity in the Saturday match.
Then he talked a little about pressure.
We will always be under pressure.
Everybody wants to pull us out.
Today we showed that if we fight and ride all the fucking, it will go,” he said.
They took warnings to the heart.
Even coach Leoš Kalvoda did not disguise that the preparation for the match was not the easiest given the atmosphere that ruled in Olomouc last week.
It was hard enough.
But I think the boys realized it, and today it was seen that they took the warning of Mr. LeBra to their hearts.
Even if before it was not about not wanting to fight and floppy it," said the coach.
It was the same as the first 15 minutes.
It took us to compare to the hardship and realize what the second league is about.
That it’s not just about football, but mainly about that fighting,” Kalvoda said.
It remains to be hoped that in the next games, Sigma will work from the beginning.
“I would love to believe it,” he added.
