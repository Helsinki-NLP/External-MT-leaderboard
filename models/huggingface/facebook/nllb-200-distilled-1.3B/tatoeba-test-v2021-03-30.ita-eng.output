I don't drink alcohol, you know.
There seems to be no way out.
We fell asleep.
I was very annoyed with him.
Why should we help you?
I've put the plan into action.
He made a list.
I was really addicted to Coke for a while, and I drank it every day.

I am totally satisfied with my new home.
Why do you study English every day?
I'd like to drive across the United States of America in a convertible.

I just need to find him.
Can I see this?
He can speak Japanese.
I could be wrong.
You're afraid to sleep, aren't you?

Correct the underlined words.
Did you tell him you were kidding?
Keep looking.
When the results are out, I'll let you know.
I wanted to go back to his village.
Tom is satisfied with his success.
You are reliable.
I didn't even consider it.

I agree with you 100%.
These flowers are not only beautiful but also have a good smell.
He's at college now, isn't he?
We should call him.
It's interesting how it happened.
You should remember that.
Tom said he likes teaching French.
He took out a coin from his pocket.
Are you related to her?
Who broke this window?
I'll go and tell them.
If you heard him speak French, you'd mistake him for a Frenchman.
He came ten minutes later.
We were expecting him yesterday.
Tom said that Mary was short.
Where's the exit?
If I remember correctly, Tom sold his car to Mary for just $500.
I'll call you after lunch.
We didn't agree on anything!
It's highly unlikely.
No doctor can explain it.
I have to try it.
She's depressed.
You're wasting my time.
Aren't you Mary's husband?

What's the difference between real diamonds and imitation ones?
Can you call me back?
I'd like two copies of each of these documents.
I expect I'll have to do that for Tom.
What do you think of the new teacher?
If actions are stronger than words, why is the pen stronger than the sword?
She bought a tea service.
We're all going to die.
Tom kept crying.
I can't do that yet.
George was out of his mind with rage!
You misled me.
Are you willing to learn?
Poor people are people with feelings, too.

You smell so good.
I forgot all about them.
He doesn't use it.
I'm a mess.

He was often up late.
I don't often eat bananas.
Get them out of here.

I'm not busy at all right now.
Tom doesn't think he's going to win.
Maybe you should listen.
He is a brilliant artist.
Hurry up, boys.
I like your painting.
I waited for an hour and a half.
I'm not good at math.
Tom refused to say what he did.
I don't like your hat.
I can't be happy when Tom is so sad.
I want to share this with you.
I'm a student at the University of Hyogo.
We're going to run the marathon.
Maybe you should tell her.
I know what to study.
His life went smoothly.
No one wants to help us.
They speak very fast.
Tom was lucky at first.
I need to go to the bathroom.
Mary really does look like her mother.
He didn't have money to buy the farm.
How often do you go to the movies?
Are you religious?
Did he talk to you?
Are there a lot of sharks around here?
Tomorrow, God willing, we'll be with your parents.
It's from Sweden.
He didn't have the money to buy the farm.
Did you really believe that?
Tom decided to sell his car.
I don't like fish with fins.
I feel safe.
You're the tallest.
Isn't this funny, Tom?
Tom was born on October 20th.
It's a good picture.
I'll leave you alone.
Tom won't even look at me.
We humiliated them.
He's already here.
I know who my enemy is.
Tom has to sleep now.
Tom is not honest.
Tom's father is a policeman.
Does Tom work here?
That's what Tom was looking for.
What did you do to her?
Tom wanted to send a message.
I wasn't happy to see them.
Don't break my heart.
I don't have any plans for tonight.
Stop being so sarcastic!
She was crying.
I wish I could be as rich as you.
We had fun.
She's not honest.
I often read books.
Tom and I want to talk to you about something.
I can meet you at 2:30.
Tom got irritated.
I'm old already.
I have a dirty record.
Good night, my friends.
He bought an English book in a bookstore.
I'm going to the bookstore tomorrow to buy some books.
What would the world be without women?
They tell us funny stories.
Can you hear what Tom is saying?
What's your favorite historical film?
We can't see her.
Tom and I still love each other.
Tom needs to eat.
Everybody out of here.
Giant pandas live only in China.
I'm being followed.
Don't say such things.
It's getting worse.
Jim is Canadian.
You did the right thing here.
Where did all the others go?
I'm relaxed now.
The cattle were grazing in the field.
He's been intruding on your private life.
Can I borrow your knife?
I'm late for a date.
Tom is still away.
I ate the whole apple.
Roast the bhakri while the pot is heated.
Is the park open today?
We only prepare Uyghur food.
We leave Boston tomorrow morning.
We can't just leave you there.
Tom was playing football.
Stop your stuttering.
I know her.
We are the real heroes.
We are waiting for Tom.
Unfortunately, my birthday only comes once a year.
Put your bike away.
I took that as a compliment.
They called President Roosevelt a pirate.
I could go to the movies.
It's not a date.
It makes me nervous.
Who do you think told them?
Why did Tom give it to Mary?
Listen to her!
You're good at this game, aren't you?
Take care of them.
I live in the Fiji Islands.
You want to eat with us?
You don't seem too surprised.
I don't go to school on Saturdays.
It's my job to protect you.
Tom is unfaithful, isn't he?
Is this cage designed to protect against sharks?
Tom wants to get to know Mary better.
I'm very disappointed.
Tom wants more coffee.
Who do you think is the author of this novel?
I wish you'd called me.
Don't you want a job?
I used to play the trombone when I was younger.
I am faithful.
Can you write in braille?
I don't know what happened to him.
I'm free today.
Why do you want to kill us?
He ate an apple.
I got him.
He adopted the orphan.
I guess they speak French.
Step forward, please.
You need to get more active.
Are Tom and Mary joking?
She's out of smoke.
I have no choice.
I think Tom knows who lives in that house.
He's smarter than he is.
What are you doing this summer?
He became irritated.
Do you speak Shanghaiese?
It's shrunk because I washed it.
Tom was wearing an old pair of shoes.
Tom wondered what happened to Mary.
Something bad happened to them.
How much was he paid?
They didn't touch anything.
Do you like horror movies?
I know a lot about animals.
Don't hold your breath.
I'm in London, are you?
He's still there with her, isn't he?
This is going to make a big difference.
Tom didn't have much money with him.
Tom doesn't have a great appetite.
Were you with them that night?
I was running.
The village was dead after sunset.
Who's your favorite female rapper?
Say hello to Tom for me.
It's nice to see her so happy.
I usually swim in the summer.
Why are you leaving so early?
I'm pretty proud of that.
I smell gas.
I'll tell them that's not true.
Here's a picture of him.
I can depend on my friends.
The experiment confirmed his theory.
Tom is lucky.
Pass me the ketchup, please.
I happened to sit next to her at a conference.
There's no furniture left in the room.
Tom showed up early for class.
He's a little overweight, isn't he?
Who is the man who is playing the piano?
I decided not to do it again.
No, I haven't written it yet.
You have to listen to Tom.
He slept in the car.
Tom and I are going to Boston with Mary.
He spent all his income on drinking.
Google it more thoroughly!
That's not the only problem with your idea.
You talk like you're the boss.
You want me to go with you?
I came to see you.
Does that look familiar?
I'll check on your game tomorrow.
So, what am I supposed to tell him?
It's starting to rain.
Do you play any instruments?
Are they going to die?
I really like it.
Are you guys coming in?
Tom stabbed her.
I have no feelings.
She's incredibly stupid.
We landed on a desert island.
It takes patience.
He convinced the teacher.
When's your new novel coming out?
I would never betray her.
Are you aware of any problems?
The mystery remains unsolved.
I will never forget Germany.
Why didn't you call a doctor?
You're good.
How would you like to change it?
It's snowing today.
He promised to write to me every week.
I wasn't born deaf.
We should leave you alone.
I can't raise our child alone.
Go get some milk.
Tom seemed surprised.
I like being right.
Tom married a rich girl from Boston.
I forgot if he drinks wine or not.
Who warned them?
Have faith in God.
I'll give you 50,000 for this statue.
Why would anyone want to kiss her?
He should have bought a used car.
I'm going to stay in a hotel.
I didn't grow up like that.
You can park here.
Please tell him to hurry.
Tom hated them.
I shave almost every day.
I'm not going to apologize.
We really like picnics.
I haven't spoken to him yet.
It was a hot summer evening.
I always walk.
It's the key.
You're not much fun at parties, are you?
He searched his bag for the car keys.
I really don't feel like talking.
So he must be Argentine.
I really like my job.
I'd suggest you be more careful.
She's shaken up.
He was supposed to do it yesterday.
I'm a big fan of the American cuisine.
Tom is dancing with Mary.
Your fate is in my hands.
No, you don't have to go now.
No one wants to help you.
It'll clear up this afternoon.
He went blind.
We subscribe to a newspaper.
I thought it was a combination.
What do you imagine when you look at that painting?
How many continents are there in the world?
He's good at singing, isn't he?
Tom is angry with Mary, isn't he?
His idea is superior to his.
Tom never forgave me.
I'm the expert.
Tom has a secret.
We are losing blood.
Chaucer and Boccaccio are two writers. The first is English, the second Italian.
Tom is getting emotional.
I was just scared.
Tomorrow is a holiday.
I drank too much beer yesterday.
I would like to teach you Chinese in exchange for another language.
I'm still busy with work.
I appreciate your insights.
I went to the park this morning.
Tom likes fly fishing.
We have no choice but to risk it.
I don't want to play chess.
Mary is jealous.
I should have changed the oil.
Do you have a calculator?
I asked him to stay.
If you really want to know, all you have to do is ask.
We have to inform Tom.
Tom is still sleeping.
Tom is a little impulsive, isn't he?
You agree with Tom, right?
Tom didn't take much money.
Tom calculated his expenses.
It's not my idea of fun, but whatever.
Could you ask Tom to stop by after work?
He plays the drums.
It must be hot.
Which online dictionary do you use most?
You lighted the candles.
We lived in Osaka for ten years before coming to Tokyo.
No one can solve this problem.
German cars are among the best.
Call them .
That's cool.
Tom doesn't respect Mary's opinions.
She plowed the field.
He came to listen to jazz.
Do you really think Tom is handsome?
I can't give Mary everything she wants.
When does school end?
Tom and I are pretty busy.
He hired me.
I said I'd take it.
I knew they were watching me.
I have plans with them tonight.
I might know someone who can help you.
Can you ride a bike?
These shoes are too small for me to wear.
I see a pattern.
She brought me a cup of tea without sugar.
It was published in 1969.
We just need to relax.
He speaks Chinese.
Tom told me he wants to go to Boston.
London is smaller than Tokyo.
I'm three years older than you.
Look, I'll show you.
I said he was innocent.
Fear of failure is one of the most common fears in the world.
Why are you so jealous?
Do you think Tom killed Mary?
Why don't you have anything to say?
That's outrageous!
Come on, Tom, aren't you curious?
Watch your mouth.
I drank the wine.
He's more popular than me.
When can I get out of here?
You're early again.
We left this.
All I want to do is go fishing.
You want to take this?
Tom didn't want to go back to the orphanage.
Gold is heavier than iron.
I'll find one later.
At least I'm older than you.
Tom didn't want to spend any more time with Mary.
Tom says he kissed Mary.
You can pick whatever you want.
I'm in the hospital. I was struck by lightning.
Did you call them?
He turned off the radio.
Why did you decide to become a professor?
It was a really scary story.
It's in the van.
I'm not introducing them.
Do you like golf?
I'm sorry to interrupt the other day.
Can you believe this?
I waited for a bus to arrive.
He found the bug.
You'll never guess where I am.
I wasn't well.
You students are expected to be diligent.
I won't be able to help you.
That is a scandalous idea!
The sun disappeared behind a cloud.
You're interested in politics.
Many people go to church on Christmas Eve.
Thank you, my child.
I can't drive very well.
I heard that Tom is learning to drive.
She knows I love her deeply.
He's trying to kill himself.
I don't need your help anymore.
The problem is that we don't know where Tom is.
It's under the bed, isn't it?
I cut the branch down with an axe.
Miniskirts are back in style.
There are some books on the table.
Come at least at six.
I have a lot of work to finish by the weekend.
He forgot his name.
Are you Mary?
After dinner, I'll walk on the beach.
Why didn't you go with him?
She's two years older than him.
French is difficult.
I'm sure she's very busy.
My name is Ahmad.
You've got the wrong number.

I've known him for over ten years.
We are grateful for the music he left us.
It's not like I'm really into the idea of putting an ammonia appliance in my house.
Judy is a very smart student.
We knew the dog would run after the cat.
I'm a cop. I'm not a cop.
You kissed her, didn't you?
Why don't I just buy her a hat?
I thought Tom was going to show up.
She's pale at the bad news.
This car doesn't belong to me.
Are you listening to me, Tom?
He often shows his anger.
Tom is my dad.
We don't have to leave yet.
Do you like the mountains?
My daughter likes to play with dolls.
Come on board.
She is charming.

I don't want to waste any more time.
We lost sight of him.
The hostages will be released before Christmas.
Go wake them up.
Which tooth hurts?

I'm here to help him.
It's not easy to speak English well.
I don't believe a word you say.
Get off of me!
Naoko is the only one who drinks coffee.
Sami needed to use the bathroom.
He changed his name.
You are vulgar.
Tom is improving.
We can help you.
They called us.
I think Tom must be hungry.
The country is rich in natural resources.
It was a difficult start for Mary.
Tom won't be back today.
It's you again!
Why does this always happen to me?
The birds are taking over the ground.
The park is closed on Monday.
Didn't you even update the firmware?
I have a job for you.
This is just a game.
Can we do this now?
All my friends like them.
I like my tongue.
Why won't you answer me?
We are Tom's classmates.
There's nothing better to do.
Tom started writing.
That's what I'm looking for.
He's practicing his hand.
Are you coming in?
Which way should I start?
Have you studied Darwin's theory of evolution?
His horse had a heart attack.
The ruins are worth a visit.
You should be prepared for the worst.
Tom took the suitcases out of the trunk.
This reminds me of someone.
I'm so hungry, you know?
Tom lost his new watch.
Tom sang with Mary.
Is that what you told Tom?
Do you remember his license plate number?
He lied to us.
She has seven children.
Let's hear some music.
I think it's dangerous for children to play in the pond.
She bought me a nice coat.
The bell rang.
Take him to the men in room 318.
I'm falling in love with her.
We have to postpone our departure.
Tom doesn't even care.
We were separated.
It's really early.
You saved Tom's life twice.
I don't like big cities.
This happened to me.
He has many friends in America.
I didn't live in Boston last year.
Are you reading this book tonight?
Does Tom have a car?
I'll be all right, don't worry about it.
Tom rarely laughs.
I can't get her smile out of my head.
I disobeyed him.
Do you know any Canadians who live in Australia?
Tom is cheeky, isn't he?
I'm perfectly happy here.
Do you like it?
What exactly do you want Tom to do?
Listen, we need to talk.
Tom didn't like it very much.
Would you wash the dishes, please?
Lunch was great.
She turned off the computer.
Torture is against the law.
I remembered.
It's not impossible.
What do you want me to do?
She was supposed to share a bedroom with her sister.
I heard the door close.
She got him drunk.
How are you feeling today?
Would you be interested in working for me?
It reminds me of my childhood.
Mary and Alice were like sisters.
Tom arrived in Boston last night.
You are stubborn.
I'm not feeling nervous.
You have a nice dog.
What do you really want to do?
Tom didn't even read Mary's letter.
They were perfect.
What are you planning to do this summer?
You're going to my house.
But the fox jumped up to the quiet Fido.
Tom is engaged to my older sister.
My father is always meddling in my private life.
Everybody wants something different.
Tom refused to carry out the order.
I know you don't like them.
I didn't know about his plan.
Why don't you go back to Boston?
I don't want to be away from home.
How about we go for a walk after dinner?
Fight like a man!
Do Tom and Mary sing?
Are Tom and Mary okay?
Trading is common in markets.
They shot him.
We're sorry for the inconvenience.

Money saved is money earned.
We're not cold.
We need to talk to him.
I know his name.
She ran a red light.
Don't bother them.
We were good.
She started acting weird.
You should ask Tom to help.
Who sent the flowers?
Do I owe you money?
Would you like me to go?
You left this, didn't you?
Tell us something.
You are random.
Please turn down the music.
I trained Tom for the job.
She watched him swim.
Who broke the vase?
You'd better go with him.
The Queen visited the museum.
Tom didn't go, and neither did I.
Would you like to leave a message?
The children played together.
Say that again, please.
You're upsetting her.
Sami isn't here to ruin your day.
I took off my shoes.
I'm learning Esperanto now.
He hired mercenaries to kill Sami.
Are those yours?
The woman is drinking water now.
Tom was a lawyer.
People here are picky about what they eat, so even if a restaurant is cheap, it will soon close if the food does not taste good.
The man Tom and Mary are talking to is a lawyer.
He changed his diet.
He's a man of his word.
I'm free tonight.
Do you think I'm too tall?
What should we do now?
Tom tried a new technique.
Were you blindfolded?
Are you interested?
Tom cut his wrists.
You seem relieved.
You should have kissed Tom.
I know I'm wrong.
I'm looking for my keys.
Will you join our club?
Don't fire Tom.
He won't listen.
I bought it at a thrift store.
Why don't you do it yourself?
It's finally here!
Tom thinks they'll all be here by noon.
Why don't you work with me anymore?
It doesn't mean anything.
You're lying to me.
She helped him.
Everybody was talking about it.
Are you telling me you're not busy?
He hates clubs.
Go on home.
Tom told me that Mary was busy.
Where's my money?
No one saw her do it.
Tom hasn't read any of these books.
You're still inexperienced.
I have to go to work now.
You're too early.
He is able to speak ten languages.
Come home before it gets dark.
I got off the train at the wrong station.
I hated French in high school.
Shouldn't you be home with your mom?
She has blue eyes and blond hair.
I can't understand that.
Tell him who you are.
My name sounds weird.
I will never forget that night.
Be cheerful! Add an exclamation point to all your sentences!
Can you see anything in there?
You are ready.
Why would I talk to them?
I won't forget.
I don't want to forget her.
I can't open it!
Tell Tom that I'm innocent.
I bought a pair of shoes.
I started working here in 2013.
They are traitors.
I'm going to stay.
I'm not always busy.
I'll assist you.
I got up before dawn.
I'll be right behind you.
How long did you live in Kobe?
We're getting close.
Tom always says the same thing.
Did you talk to Tom?
Try to get some rest.
Do you have a Facebook account?
He asked how to cook the fish.
No one will believe his story.
Tom is a golden boy.
You seem to be prejudiced against ideas coming from foreign countries.
I bought that book for him.
I didn't mean to hit Tom so hard.
She makes me throw up.
I want a doctor.
What does the cat want?
You'll meet her tomorrow.
You're three years younger than Tom.
Finish the sentence.
The watch broke.
I'm not going to wait forever.
Just give the order.
Do you know any Canadians who live in Australia?
This book is much more interesting than that.
We were obliged to obey the rule.
I hope Tom isn't angry.
The rock was moved with dynamite.
Mary made breakfast.
Where did you meet my father?
Who was Mona Lisa?
He said he had to go.
You can keep them.
This smell is unbearable.
She became famous.
What are you pointing at?
I became friends with him while I was in Taiwan.
He was intimidated by her intelligence.
She hit the balloon.
We have to go.
Staying home is not fun.
I'm sure Tom will be awake.
She can't find her hat.
Mr. Young would like his son to study more.
I opened an account in a bank near here.
I didn't like that one.
Can you be sure?
It was nice to see you.
You don't have to worry.
We'll be close.
I'm really worried about them.
He clearly wants to go.
I knew Tom would do something romantic.
How much paper do you need?
Can you confirm that?
It was a waste of money.
Tom is talking to Mary on the phone.
Bring some wine.
I was very proud.
You're very fast.
How about a beer?
I had no idea you were so stupid.
They're not alive.
I'm hiding in Japan.
You are a brave man.
You're not surprised?
It only costs a dime.
I hope Tom and Mary are wrong.
My spoon is too big!
Give them a minute.
We're having dinner together tonight.
I don't expect you to remember.
Put the picture up.
You're my three best friends.
Have you tried talking to him?
Where did you have lunch?
He's the last person who can tell a lie.
June's not that far away.
Why do you hate Tom so much?
You know who said that?
I'm going to bed early tonight.
He kicked me out of the house.
My shoes got wet.
The key was left in the room.
Are you leaving me?
Tom always liked you.
Why do you care?
Give him a hand, okay?
You wanted to ask me something?
Don't make fun of Tom.
You'll land on your feet.
I took risks.
Two people were killed in a car accident.
You know Tom, don't you?
It wasn't my idea to hire them.
Last night my grandmother passed away without pain.
I know why you're mad at them.
You know Tom likes cars.

Don't fall out of your chair.
Tom sent us Christmas presents.
Can't Tom swim?
Children usually get up early at Christmas.

Why does he seem so grumpy?
There's nothing I can do for her.
The father is good.
I think they're ready.
Tom will try again.
What a wonderful woman!
They played a board game.
They all believed him.
It means a huge increase in the use of air conditioning, which uses energy, costs money and creates pollution.

Those are crocodile tears.
He could have said something before.
The work leaves traces on Tatoeba...
Do you like carrots?
I have pains every half an hour.
Tom is much older now.
Tom is better.
I think Tom is pessimistic.
You have to help them.
I write to my mother sometimes.
Don't trust anyone. I know.
I regret that I was never nice to him.
Have Tom call me.
It hasn't changed a thing.
She's not wearing her hat.
Tom actually apologized to Mary.
Why doesn't he sit with me anymore?
I want you to find them.
I left the party too soon.
I should have eaten more.
Of 20 female students, only one read the book.
To love someone means to see them as God intended them to be.
Don't lie to them.
Do they live with you?
I don't know how he did it.
I'm not sure George's gonna like this idea.
They're afraid to say it in public.
Please identify yourself.
You're leaving us.
It would be nice to spend the summer in the mountains.
I lost him.
I almost dropped the dishes.
There's a phone in my room.
Is it serious?
Tom called 911.
We're brother and sister.
Are you interested in Buddhism?
This week's been good.
You want a tray with that?
You don't know me.
Nobody wants to work.
Please drive slower.
How do we fix it?
This is last month's magazine.
They haven't come back yet.
He's about your age, isn't he?
It's backed up.
We can't let them die.
It's a bundle of nerves.
Tom arrived late.
Tom stayed behind.
This point will be discussed tomorrow.
How did you spend your vacation?
When he left the Army, Roger Miller moved into the country music house in Nashville, Tennessee.
Mary corrected it.
Have you ever spoken to him?
I don't think Tom will be able to do that.
When did you get back from London?
Tom is always in a good mood.
Can I get you some coffee?
He left the village to study.
I've never seen you dance.
Tom bent down to take a closer look.
Can you save them?
So you and Hanna are thinking about getting married?
You can drive, can't you?
They need us to finish the job.
I've been here twice now.
It looks so fake.
They're all dead.
I don't want you in my car.

I'm not interested in her.
Don't say anything!

Do you like golf?
What's your favorite kind of pizza?
He's not very good at his job.
Bob has a lot of books in his room.
They followed Tom.
The ship disappeared over the horizon.
You obviously told a lie.
Something was going on.
Send it by mail.
It's interesting, is it?
Mary accidentally bumped into Tom.
I'm not anyone's enemy.
I forgot your number.
The two teams fought very hard.
I think there's a mistake in my account.
Tom didn't convince me.
Sami had some painful secrets.
You want me to come clean?
What are you gonna do?
Tom seems tired. Please take him home.
May all your wishes come true!
He already did.
He's experienced with a word processor.
He was at the gate of death.
You're hurt, aren't you?
Your table is ready.
Will it be hot again tomorrow?
Tom and Mary have a car, don't they?
Let's talk about it.
I can't solve this problem.
He hit him in the head.
It's gonna be a lot of fun.
Tom told Mary what not to do.
Mind your own business!
She was extremely scary.
I'm telling you a story.
You're homesick, aren't you?
What will you eat tomorrow?
I've seen the movie before.
Sophie, who was hungry, ate everything she could get.
Are those Tom and Mary?
There's no future in his employment.
Tom and I often study together.
Tom and Mary are very happy here.
Do you like to travel?
I want to go back to Tom's house.
He has strong principles.
He was buried in this cemetery.

It's a disease to be obsessed with winning, it's a disease to be obsessed with using martial arts, and it's a disease to be obsessed with presenting everything you've learned. It's a disease to be obsessed with attacking, and it's also a disease to be obsessed with defending. It's also a disease to be obsessed with getting rid of the disease. Fixing your mind obsessively on anything is considered a disease.
