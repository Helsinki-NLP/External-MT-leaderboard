The prosecution insisted on three years of forced labor.
I was given a restraining order, which is that I cannot attend public events and cannot communicate with the organizers of the April 7 protest.
"I've been wearing an electronic bracelet and a wallet all this time.
It was used to track my location.
I should note that I was not limited in my movements.
I recently flew in from Moscow, where I was studying", - said Andrey Borovikov.
After the verdict, the regional headquarters coordinator of Navalny said he would serve his sentence in Arkhangelsk.
On September 26, a deputy from the KPRF faction, Sergey Shargunov, introduced a bill to the State Duma that would soften Article 212.1 of the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.

So each of us needs to think about the reasons for these bad matches.
There's a meeting ahead, and we need to prepare for it and fix it.
How did you do that?
If we knew, we'd probably fix it by now.
But first of all, I think we need to add a component like martial arts.
I think we have a problem with that.

China strongly opposes the US adoption of the Taipei Bill
China strongly opposes the US adoption of the so-called "Taipei Bill", which seriously violates the one-China principle and the principles of the three Sino-American joint communiqués.
This was announced on Friday by the official representative of the State Council Office for Taiwan Affairs Ma Xiaoguan.
The approval of the bill by the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee is also a serious violation of international law and the basic principles of international relations, and a gross interference in China's internal affairs, Ma said.
He said Taiwan is part of China and that issues related to it are China's internal affairs.
"We urge the US side to clarify the situation, immediately stop promoting the relevant negative bills, and immediately stop interfering in the Taiwan issue to avoid further damage to China-US relations, as well as peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait", he noted.
China must be and will be reunited.
This historical trend cannot be stopped by anyone or any force, Ma said.
TikTok is hiding unwanted videos from users
TikTok has over 500 million users worldwide, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
This is a picture of China .
Chinese social network TikTok censors videos that mention Tiananmen Square, Tibet independence or the banned religious group Falun Gong, The Guardian reports.
The documents obtained by the publication say that the owner of TikTok (ByteDance) uses the app to promote China's foreign policy goals abroad.
Most of the violations related to China's policies fall under the "incitement to hatred" category.
In each case, TikTok places objectionable posts in a context that is appropriate to the general rules so that the social network's actions do not look like censorship.
For example, the ban on criticism of China's socialist system falls under the general ban on "criticism or attack on the politics and social rules of any country, such as constitutional monarchy, parliamentary system, etc".
The ban on mentioning Tiananmen Square incidents or the Cambodian genocide is "distorting the history of China or other countries".
The document also lists 20 "foreign leaders or statesmen" as banned names, including North Korean leaders Kim Jong-il, Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-un, Indian politician Mahatma Gandhi, US presidents Donald Trump and Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, South Korean President Park Geun-hye, Indonesian President Joko Widodo and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the document said.
Prohibited material is divided into two categories, the document says.
The first category of posts are deleted by the social network administrators and can lead to blocking.
Less severe violations fall into the second category: such posts remain on the site, but their distribution is limited by TikTok's algorithms.
ByteDance told The Guardian that the rules are outdated and no longer applicable: "We now use a localized approach to moderation, and also involve independent local professionals".
Russian TikTok users have no specific restrictions on posting, says Rustem Bogdanov, co-founder of the Producer Center.
Producers Center is one of the Russian media companies that officially cooperates with TikTok.
All the bloggers' advertising materials are coordinated with the social network's representatives, but user materials can be posted without approval, Bogdanov reports.
Asked if it is allowed to comment on politics or Putin on TikTok, Bogdanov said yes and said he had seen similar posts.
Roman Zaripov, founder of Our Didgital, agrees with Bogdanov: "TikTok's basic rules for users are listed in the user agreement: no shocking content, discriminatory statements, etc".
But any content that moderators don't like can be brought under the rules, Zaripov says.
Zaripov Agency is another Russian partner of TikTok.
TikTok has more than 500 million users worldwide, 40% of whom are under the age of 18.
According to the terms of the agreement, TikTok is only available to people over the age of 13.
The social network administrators use artificial intelligence to check their age: a neural network that analyzes faces and determines how old a person looks, Bogdanov says.
If the neural network decides that the user is younger, the account can be deleted, he adds.
According to RBC, in September 2019, ByteDance opened an office in Moscow on the territory of the WeWork coworking site.

Russians warned about fake calls from banks
In Russia, the number of calls from fraudsters who substitute a bank phone number has increased.
This is reported by "Kommersant" with reference to the data of the Central Bank.
In the summer of 2019, the regulator provided telecom operators with information on more than 2,500 numbers from which customers of various financial institutions were called.
In 189 cases, the operators found a number switched.
Another 218 numbers were blocked, and in 59 cases, financial services were restricted.
Deputy head of the Central Bank's information security department Artem Sychev said that a wide range of Russian banks faced a number change.
He explained that operators do not always respond to Central Bank warnings about fraudulent calls, citing the lack of such a duty in the law "On communication".
The Bank of Russia, Rosbank and Alfa-Bank confirmed the increase in the number of fraudulent calls with a changed number.
According to the press service of "Beeline", some of the information about fraudulent calls that the Central Bank transmitted was incorrect: the lists included numbers that are actually used by banks to communicate with customers.
Blocking them would cause disruption to the organization.
Artem Sychev said that the Central Bank plans to create a database of fraudsters' numbers, which the operator will contact every time a call is made to verify the number.
He explained that to create such a base, it would require amendments to the legislation.

Stoltenberg discussed with Zelensky the accession of Ukraine to NATO
NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky discussed Ukraine's membership in the alliance on the sidelines of the 74th session of the UN General Assembly.
The secretary-general spoke at Columbia University in New York.
Asked if the meeting raised the issue, Stoltenberg said they had indeed discussed the issue, and also stressed that he did not mention the date of Ukraine's NATO membership in his answer.
He said any country that wants to join the North Atlantic Alliance must meet certain conditions to meet specific standards.
In Crimea , Zelensky was offered an alternative to NATO
Ukraine's President Vladimir Zelensky should instead of pursuing NATO membership focus on building good neighborly relations with Russia.
This was reported on Friday, September 27, by the co-chairman of the Assembly of Slavic Peoples of the Republic of Crimea Roman Čegrinyts.
"The president of Ukraine should not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, but listen to the advice of Donald Trump, whom he listened to with a sour face, and establish relations with the president of Russia", said Chekhrinets to RIA Novosti.
Chegrinets noted that Zelensky is a good actor for him, but a bad politician.
According to him, the Ukrainian president will only be able to stay in power if he establishes relations with Russia.
Earlier, on September 27, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he had a conversation with Zelensky on the issue of the country's accession to the alliance.
According to him, Ukraine is obliged to fulfill certain conditions.
On June 5, parliamentarian Evgeny Balickiy said that Ukraine's possible accession to the alliance does not guarantee improvement in the country's life.
Money is more important than football.
Barcelona is blackmailing Neymar.
Barcelona and former Brazilian player Neymar are trying to settle a financial dispute that arose after the striker moved to Paris Saint-Germain.
The case almost went to trial, but the Catalans offered the player to settle the dispute without Themis's intervention.
Otherwise, they refuse to let him come back.
Neymar and his cunning father, who is also the Brazilian's agent, have devised an interesting trick: according to the agreement with Barca, which the player signed in 2016, he was to receive 40 million euros.
However, just a year later, the forward was signed by PSG for a record 222 million euros.
However, he got 22 million from the Catalans and now he wants to take the other 18.
Not only that, but the Brazilian's lawyers insist that the club owes him interest for late payment.
When Neymar's claims became known in the Catalan capital, Barcelona filed a counterclaim.
The Blue and Browns insist that the bonus was for the entire contract, from 2016 to 2022.
Accordingly, the club believes that the player was owed only a quarter of the 40 million euros and demands the return of a proportionate part of the first payment.
But the most interesting thing is that in the summer Neymar and Barca almost agreed to return the "errant" player to the bosom of Catalonia.
The deal fell through, but the forward's chances of a comeback are still there.
According to Sports.Ru, citing insiders, the club's lawyers told the player's representatives that if the financial claims are not settled in a pre-trial manner, the Brazilian will not be allowed to return.
Neymar himself is so eager to return that he has asked for guarantees that the Catalans will buy him back.
Mart Laar: EKRE members will not be part of the Board of the Bank of Estonia
EKRE members have not been and will not be invited to the board.
The composition of the Board of the Bank of Estonia is used to assess the trustworthiness of the Estonian state.
As long as EKRE members continue to behave like this, they start talking and then they think, none of them will be invited to the bank board.
"The chairman of the board of the Bank of Estonia cannot apologize for the statements of the board members", Laar said in an interview with Delfi, according to ERR broadcasting.
Laar noted that EKRE is represented at the board meetings of Eesti Pank.
The current seventh board of the Bank of Estonia includes, in addition to Laar, Liina Tynyssson, Kaije Kerem, Urmas Varblane, Kalev Kallö, Yaanus Tamkivi (Reform Party), Ann Listra and Reine Minka.
Laar's proposal was to replace two council members - Kalló and Tynisson, with Laar proposing Anna Eesmaa (Center Party) and Ivari Padara (Social Democratic Party) instead.
At the same time, the Reform Party wanted Andres Sutty to join the council instead of Janus Tamkivi.
But Laar replied that the Reform Party's goal was to get two seats on the board of the Bank of Estonia - so that in addition to Ya'anus Tamkivi, Andres Sutty would be on the board.
On Tuesday, September 24, the Riigikogu rejected Laar's proposal to appoint new members to the Bank of Estonia's board.

Rooms in the center of Moscow are being rented at the price of apartments in the suburbs
Despite the decrease in the number of communal houses in Moscow, the demand for them is not falling.
The supply is driven by demand, and the rent is driven by the number of rooms.
In the center of Moscow, rental prices are higher than in the suburbs - mainly because of high demand.
The rooms in the centre are rented at the same price as apartments in the outskirts.
So, in Hamovniks, the average price of a room is 28 thousand rubles, according to a study by the portal "The world of apartments".
That's enough to rent a place near the MCA.
Rooms on Arbat are rented for an average of 27,3 thousand rubles, although some offers can compete with the rates not only on one-room apartments, but also on two-room apartments in sleeping areas.
The cheapest rooms in Moscow are rented in Kapotny - the average price in the area was 13,6 thousand rubles.
The second place is taken by the West Birule district (13,8 thousand).
For 14,1 thousand, rooms are rented in Biryulov Výchny and Veshnyak.
The most expensive area after the MKAD was Solncevo, where rooms are rented for almost 16 thousand rubles a month.
The rooms in North and South Booth and New Pederelkin are a little cheaper.
How to increase your future pension without overworking
Not only the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation, but also non-state pension funds are able to pay pensions.
The NPF is a private company, reports Volgogradskaya pravda.ru.
They work like a deposit: you make contributions, the fund invests them and eventually pays you back the money with interest.
If you are interested in this method, you can first read the information on the website of the Bank of Russia.
All funds operate under the same rules, which are set by federal laws.
Pension points can be bought by law.
The number of missing points depends on how many years of experience you do not have enough to qualify for pension.
This is a good way to work for people who have worked informally.
You can also contribute for a relative, for example a housewife.
Recommendation for those who are thinking about retirement at the beginning of their working life.
The higher pension is paid to civil servants, doctors, teachers, agricultural workers and people who have worked for a certain number of years in the Far North.
To ensure that you are not deprived of anything when you reach retirement age, make sure that you do so in advance.
Buy real estate, currency, securities, put your money away on deposits.
The most important thing is to keep improving your financial literacy.

The footballer Pavel Mamaev, released last week from the UDO colony, will not return to the Krasnodar football club.
The former midfielder of this club may soon sign a contract with the Rostov FC, - reports the portal "Championnat".
According to the publication, negotiations between representatives of "Rostov" and Mamaev are now in the final stages.
The 31-year-old is expected to sign a two-year contract with the option of a further season.
"Sport-Express" writes that a day earlier Pavel Mamaev was supposed to undergo a medical examination in Moscow's "Dynamo", but the examination did not take place due to "an uncertain situation in the club".
Krasnodar terminated the contract with Mamayev last week by mutual agreement.
The midfielder played for the Krasnodar club since 2014.
With the team, he won the bronze medal of the Russian championship twice.
Previously, Mamaev played for the Moscow "Torpedo" and CSKA.

A man with a samurai sword tried to defend a trolley found in a garbage dump
A man from Oakland Park, Florida, has been arrested on charges of attempted murder after he brandished a samurai sword at his opponent in a dispute over a trolley found in a trash can.
54-year-old Curtis Miller was digging through a pile of trash near an empty house.
This was noticed by Todd Beavers, who was out for an evening walk.
The last one decided to join the search and found a black cart in the trash.
Miller saw Beavers' find and was upset.
He thought he could get the cart because he was the first one to dig through the trash.
The men started arguing.
Suddenly, Beavers grabbed the cart and ran toward his house.
Miller then took the samurai sword he found in the same pile and began to pursue his opponent.
He caught up with Beavers outside his house.
Miller took the sword out of his shears and began to swing it in the direction of the cart- snatcher.
Beavers told Miller that the whole thing was on video.
Miller saw the video camera and fled, but threatened to return.
Beavers left the cart in the yard and went inside.
Shortly thereafter, he saw a strange woman enter his yard and take the cart away, shouting insults.
The police were already looking for Miller for driving without a license.
A man has been arrested and charged with attempted murder.
In September, it was reported that a hedge fund manager attacked a stranger and stabbed her in Hardeston, New Jersey.
He did so when guests at a wedding in the same hotel where he was staying refused to let him smoke.
Mass riots on three .
The "Moscow case" against the participants of the summer protest actions is becoming more visible as it breaks up into separate fragments and loses its political content.
The evidence of the "mass riots" itself is not subject to scrutiny, but in the absence of a political solution to put the case on hold, a weak evidence base would not necessarily lead to the charges being dropped.
The case should be a source of inspiration to the public, but it will certainly leave the police in a state of extreme irritation, whose efforts to fill the case with defendants and evidence have been in vain.
On Thursday, September 26, one of the three remaining defendants under Article 212 of the Criminal Code (mass riots) - Alexey Minayilo was suddenly released from custody without any obligations, and after a few hours he was fully rehabilitated: the SC removed the charges against him.
Minaylo was imprisoned for almost two months, and several professional associations, including historians, priests, and writers, joined in.
After that, only two accused in the case remained in the mass riots (initially there were 13 accused): Sergey Fomin, who was transferred to house arrest on September 3, and Samarriddin Rajabov, whose arrest was extended until the end of December (he is also accused of using violence against a government representative, article 318 of the Criminal Code).
Court rules on a mock petition to join the U.S.
The court of the Videme district of Riga has sentenced Denis Bartetsky, the author of a humorous petition to join the United States of America.
The man was sentenced to 80 hours of community service and one year of probation.
"Common sense is not the strongest part of our system", Bartetski commented on the court's decision.
He also added that the punishment is usually less than requested.
The collection of signatures on Latvia's accession to the United States was organized in 2016.
Meanwhile, simultaneously with this petition, the website collected signatures on Latvia's accession to the "Galactic Empire" and on the country's exit from the Solar System and the Milky Way.
It is noted that a criminal case was opened against Bartetski under the first paragraph of Article 82 of the Criminal Law of the country - "Public call to undermine the territorial integrity of the Republic of Latvia".
Before that, in 2016, the author of an internet petition to join Russia was sentenced to six months in prison.
Japanese airliner makes emergency landing in Khabarovsk
A Boeing flying from Austria to Japan made an emergency landing at Khabarovsk airport, TASS reports.
The aircraft, owned by the Japanese company ANA, was carrying 206 people, including 12 crew members.
There are no reported injuries.
Another plane has come for the people from Tokyo.
According to a spokesman for the Khabarovsk airport, the cause of the accident was a drop in oil pressure in one of the aircraft's engines.
Earlier it was reported that the plane, flying from Moscow's Zhukovsky airport to Kyrgyzstan, made an emergency landing at Samara airport because of a sick child on board.
Russia 's Interior Ministry proposes to punish for insulting police officers on the Internet
The Russian Interior Ministry has prepared amendments to the law "On the police" to protect law enforcement officers from spreading defamatory and defamatory information on the Internet.
On Friday, the federal portal of regulatory legal acts published an application for public discussion of the bill, but the draft document has not yet been published.
The explanatory note to the document notes that it is being developed in connection with the need to protect the honor and dignity of a police officer from "dissemination in information and communication networks, including the Internet, of information of a defamatory nature, including discrediting nature".
It is unclear how exactly the police are supposed to protect themselves from online defamation.
The document's explanation notes that the amendments will be applied "by individualizing the mechanism" already provided for in the law on blocking posts that insult government officials and the law on fines for such posts.
Both laws went into effect in March of this year.
The final text of the bill will be published after public discussion and independent anti-corruption review.
According to the explanatory note, the amendments to the law "On Police" should come into force in January 2020.
On March 18, President Vladimir Putin signed a law punishing "open disrespect for the state" on the Internet.
According to this document, Roskomnadzor warns the resource about the violation and gives it 24 hours to eliminate it.
For the first violation of the prohibitions, a fine of 30 to 300 thousand rubles is provided, and for repeated violation - administrative arrest for a period of up to 15 days.
On April 12, Roskomnadzor first applied this rule to the media, blocking the Yaroslavl publication 76.ru.
Shortly after, the Chudovsky district court of the Novgorod region fined a local resident 30 thousand rubles for posting "two records with information in an indecent form that insults human dignity and public morality and expresses a clear disrespect for society, the state, the bodies exercising state power in the Russian Federation".

The rates on housing loans in Russia will decrease until the end of 2019.
This was stated by the general director of the credit organization "Dom.rf" Alexander Pluтник, reports "Interfax".

The program provides "for affordable housing for families with medium incomes, including the creation of opportunities for acquisition (building housing using a mortgage loan, the rate of which should be less than 8 percent)".
Earlier in September, it became known that one of the largest players in the Russian mortgage market - Sberbank - plans to reduce rates on housing loans again before the end of 2019.
Can phytoestrogens and phytoandrogens help you stay young?
The topic of phytoandrogens is poorly understood.
The most famous is pine pollen.
But phytoestrogens are well-researched and have positive effects on the body.
They reduce the risk of certain diseases associated with age, including cardiovascular disease and some cancers.
The best known sources of phytoestrogens are all legumes (the most popular being soybeans), hops, and flaxseeds.
However, many experts feel that such supplements are not a complete replacement for natural hormones.
The potential harm of such additives cannot be ruled out.
For example, taking them may reduce the production of your own hormones because of the excessive intake of hormones from outside the body.
He called on the Vrenetsnikovs to revive the Kazakh "Genis".
Former Russian national team and Russian clubs' striker Oleg Veretennikov has joined the campaign to revive the Kazakh "Zenis".
The Astana club, which in different years was called "Dynamo", "Celinnik", "Astana" and "Zenis", was disbanded in 2014.
Verenikov defended his colors in 2004 and 2008.
"I heard about the revival of the football club "Genis" organized by its fans.
I couldn't stay away!
I spent a season and a half at this club.
It wasn't the best of times in terms of results and funding, but I will never forget this club and its loyal fans who have always been with the team!
I will always remember the Munaytspayev Stadium, where I scored my 200th goal in my career!
The genis must be reborn!
He's got a great history and a great fan base.
I wish them all the best and I believe that the city authorities will return their club!" - wrote Veretennikov on Instagram.

Hydrometeorological Center named true folk signs
In Russia, there are many folk signs that people use to try to predict the weather.
Unfortunately, not all of them work.
The weather station checked all the signs that seem to work.
Meteorologists have concluded that only two of them can be really trusted, though, in the short term.
According to Roman Vilfand, scientific director of the Russian Hydrometeorological Center, if the sun is red at sunset, the next day will indeed be clear, as our ancestors noted.
And if the sky is white, it's going to rain the next day.
The second working sign is based on bird watching.
They're more often referred to as swallows, if they fly low, it's usually in the rain.
The reason is simple - when the humidity is high, the mosquitoes get wet wings and the birds have to lower themselves to hunt insects, reports TASS.
There are folk symbols on different continents.
Moose Day is a traditional public holiday in the United States and Canada, celebrated annually on February 2.
It is believed that on this day, the mole is watched emerge from its burrow to determine when spring will come.
Unidentified oil spots found on beaches in northeastern Brazil
Oil spots of unknown origin have been found on 99 beaches in northeastern Brazil.
The contamination was found to be spread over 2,000 kilometers of coastline.
Reports of the first oil spills began arriving on September 2.
However, each day until Thursday, their numbers continued to grow, as did their territory.
The Brazilian Environment Institute conducted a chemical analysis of the samples.
It turns out they're all identical, and it's crude oil.
The state oil company Petrobras, which handed over the samples, said they did not match the oil produced in Brazil.
"It's thick oil.
It could be dropped from one of the ships after the tanks are cleaned.
Many people continue to do so.
And it probably went into the ocean", Rosario Almeida, the union coordinator for the oil workers of Pernambuco and Paraíba states, told G1 news.
He also added that despite the ban on this practice, many ships continue to dump waste on the high seas.
On the beaches of four of the eight affected northeastern states, conservationists found nine sea turtles completely covered in oil.
And only two of them were saved.
In the coming days, the Brazilian Environment Institute will work with Petrobras to clean up the polluted beaches.
In the meantime, the institute advises tourists and locals to avoid oil spills and report any contamination.

Russians have nothing to save for retirement - V. Matvienko
Federation Council Speaker Valentina Matviyenko believes that Russians do not have enough savings to fully implement the guaranteed pension product bill.
The practice of increasing pensions by personal savings is quite common in the world.
It's another matter of how timely we are in introducing it.
"In my opinion, now a significant part of the population has incomes from which they simply have nothing to allocate to increase pension provision in the future", - said V. Matviyenko.
Russians, according to the speaker, cannot understand the mechanisms of forming and calculating pensions, because "the constant changes in this sphere have finally confused them".
This does not mean that I am against improving the pension system, which regulates its legislation.
"Russia is a social state, and we must do everything to improve pensions and social security.
But steps in this direction should be thoughtful, responsible, taking into account domestic realities", - said V. Matviyenko "RIA Novosti".
The head of the FS stressed that if this initiative (the bill on a guaranteed pension product) is to be developed, several basic principles must be provided for, including voluntariness, tax preferences for citizens and employers and strict guarantees and state responsibility for ensuring the safety of pension savings.
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation announced on September 6 the sending for approval of the law on the guaranteed pension product (GPP).
Among its main elements are the voluntary procedure for citizens to join the savings system, the guarantee of the preservation of long-term pension savings by the state, the registration of savings accounts by the central administrator, tax benefits for businesses and tax deductions for citizens.
Spider-Man is staying in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Sony and Disney have a deal.
Image caption The news of the departure of the Marvel superhero has angered many fans
One of the most famous comic book characters, Spider-Man, will remain in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
Disney and Sony Pictures managed to agree on the rights to use it in the franchise's films.
This was revealed in a Sony press release, which said that the third part of "Spider-Man" with Tom Holland will be released on July 16, 2021.
Earlier it was reported that Disney and Sony Pictures could not agree on a revenue split, which is why Spider-Man will be leaving the Marvel Cinematic Universe.
The movie rights are owned by Sony.
She rented them out to Marvel movies, which is owned by Disney.
As a result, Sony was earning revenue from movie sales, while Disney was earning revenue from souvenirs and toys.
It was reported that at some point, Disney was no longer comfortable with the situation, and the company wanted to reconsider the agreement.
Marvel Studios president Kevin Feige said he was thrilled.
It's amazing that Spidey's journey in the Marvel Cinematic Universe is continuing.
"We're all excited at Marvel Studios to continue working on it.
Spider-Man is a figurehead.
He is a hero whose story touches all generations and audiences around the world", the statement said.
Feygi also reminded that Sony is creating its own movie universe built around Spider-Man.
"He happens to be the only superhero to appear in multiple movies.
So as Sony continues to develop its own Spidey universe, the future may hold surprises".
Tom Holland, who has played Spider-Man in five films, apparently posted a clip from the movie "The Wolf of Wall Street" on his Instagram account, in which Leonardo DiCaprio's character shouts "I'm not leaving!"
The information about the discrepancies between the companies came out in August.
According to media reports, Disney wanted to get half of the box office from Spider-Man movies on the condition that both companies would pay half of the cost of producing the pictures.
But Sony didn't like that.
The news of the possible departure of the beloved superhero from the Marvel Cinematic Universe has angered many loyal fans.
Details of the new terms are still being worked out.
Sony declined to comment on the deal, but said: "We have worked together beautifully for the past four years, and our shared desire to continue working together has been commensurate with the wishes of many fans.
We are happy to move forward together".
The film "Avengers: The Final", which brought together Spider-Man, Thor, Hulk and other Marvel superheroes, became the highest grossing film in the history of world cinema, taking "Avatar" from the top spot.

The expert told me why I should give up tea bags
A team of scientists from McGill University in Canada found that over ten billion microplastic particles are added to a cup in five minutes when a tea bag is brewed.
The packaged drink may also contain sawdust particles, said Nation News food safety expert Elizabeth Tikhonova.
According to the agronomist, the consumer cannot get reliable information about the composition of the packaged tea - the manufacturer may add ingredients that are not listed on the packaging.
The sawdust is not thrown away at the end of the season, so it can end up in the tea.
"Moreover, the tea plants are not always included in the packets", Tikhonova said.
She says it is better to give up such a drink in favor of tea on a stick, which is sold in specialty stores.
She also said that the danger of packaged tea is not only in the ingredients but also in the way it is made - the micro-particles are heated to high temperatures, which can cause them to release harmful substances.
"It is best to buy pure green or black tea - it has the least amount of additives", she said.

Regions invited to share business support secrets
As the Parliamentary newspaper learned, on September 27, the Chairman of the Committee of the Federation Council on Economic Policy Andrey Kutypov sent a letter to the Minister of Economic Development Maxim Oreshkin and the Minister of Finance Anton Siluanov with the proposal to express his position regarding the initiatives of the subjects of the Federation to improve the legislation in the field of supporting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
It 's time to establish interregional ties
The Federation Council Committee on Economic Policy summarized the information received from the regions on the programs for business development and self-employed legalisation, as well as on the results of such programs.
In their letters, the regions told the senators about the problems of SME development and sent proposals to improve the existing legislation.
"Today, communication between regions is not sufficiently established, as a result of which the business community in all regions visited by senators was indicated the lack of information about regional programs of entrepreneurship development in the country as a whole", - said Andrey Kutypov.
In the annex to the letter, which was sent to the Government, he presented a summary of the positive developments of the regions on the legalization of self-employment and summary data from the regions with proposals and problems (available at the disposal of the editorial office).
In addition to the relevant ministries, the aggregate data from the regions are also sent to the heads of regional executive authorities.
The exchange of information on the positive developments in the regions could give impetus to the development of entrepreneurship as a whole.
The first step towards such an exchange will be to send information to the Economic Policy Committee", the senator told the Parliamentary Gazette.
Useful experience
Today, many regions of the country have adopted and successfully operate programs to support small and medium-sized businesses.
For example, the Vologda Region has an Entrepreneurship Support Center, which, in addition to financial support, assists businessmen in certifying finished products.
In the Ivanovo region, a business support system has been developed, which provides for the implementation of the one-window principle through multifunctional centers.
In the Krasnodar region, start-up agricultural consumer cooperatives are granted grants from the regional budget.
In the Oryol region, the center of cluster development operates.
Amur region within the framework of the federal project "Acceleration of small and medium-sized enterprises" provides the possibility of subsidizing business incubators created on the basis of existing non-state coworking centers, at the expense of the federal budget.
In some other regions, special support measures are being taken for youth entrepreneurship.
Self-employed continue to be pushed out of the shadows
The regional authorities believe that a number of changes should be made to the existing legislation to support small and medium-sized businesses more effectively.
For example, the Arkhangelsk region proposed to replace the term "self-employment" with "entrepreneurial activity", as this "best corresponds to the content of the state service on promoting self-employment of unemployed citizens".
In the Ivanovo region, amendments are considered necessary to expand the list of activities provided by self-employed citizens, including activities for decorating and repairing residential premises, cottage buildings, conducting physical training classes.
The Brno region considers it important to strengthen control over unscrupulous dairy producers with the help of the veterinary system "Mercury".
And in the Kostroma and Magadan regions advocate for the consolidation of the concept of "social entrepreneurship" and the directions of supporting social entrepreneurship in the normative field.
All proposals from the regions will be taken into account when preparing state programmes to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of specific draft laws.
"All the proposals from the regions will be taken into account when preparing state programs to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and the most important will be developed in the form of concrete law projects", - assured Andrei Kutypov.
Airline helps passengers avoid neighbors with crying children

Now you can avoid being in the neighborhood if you want.
Passengers on Japan Airlines (JAL) have been given the opportunity to take advantage of a new option and avoid unwanted neighbourhood with small children.

Thus, those who do not want to fly near babies because of the possible inconvenience of their crying can stay as far away from them as possible.
Internet users who use the airline's services were delighted with the innovation.
Some of them thanked the carrier, saying that other airlines should do the same.
One user complained that a few weeks ago he was flying from New York to Doha and had three crying children sitting next to him.
Another commentator suggested introducing "adult-only flights", saying he was willing to pay extra for such flights.

She prepared bags of candy for each of the 200 passengers, each with a note of apology.

Pavel Ustinov joined the picket lines in support of the Moscow case
Actor Pavel Ustinov joined a series of one-man protests "Freedom to all", which are taking place on Friday at the Russian President's office on Moscow's Old Square, the Interfax news agency reports.
The series of picketing began on September 18 in support of Ustinov himself and has continued every day since.
Currently, the participants of the action, alternating with each other, are holding a poster with the inscription "Freedom to all" and the names of the convicts and arrested after the uncoordinated rallies in Moscow in the summer of 2019.

Supplies of "sanctioned" drugs to Russia have fallen 100 times
The Russian government estimates that the supply of agricultural products and foodstuffs to Russia from countries subject to the Russian food embargo has decreased by more than 100 times since 2013.
According to the report sent to Russian President Vladimir Putin, 31 thousand tons of products were imported from sanctioned countries in the first half of 2019 compared to 3 million 442.2 thousand tons in the same period of 2013, "Interfax" reports.
The value of imported goods decreased to $226.5 million from $4 billion to $975.5 million.
It's about the supply of goods that are not under embargo.
The report indicates that the decrease in the volume of prohibited products was compensated by increased imports from the CIS, Africa, South-East Asia, Serbia.
Recall that at the end of August, the government extended until December 31, 2020 the expiry of the rules for destroying agricultural products, raw materials and food, which are prohibited from being imported into Russia as part of counter-sanctions.
The document posted on the official legal information portal noted that the rules were extended for another year - from December 31, 2019 to December 31, 2020.
Initially, the ban applied to products from the US, EU, Australia, Norway and Canada.
Later, on August 13, 2015, Albania, Montenegro, Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Ukraine joined the list.
Putin's decree to destroy the illegal imported "sanctioned" (food products that fell under the food embargo imposed by Moscow in response to anti-Russian sanctions by the West) entered into force in 2015.
In turn, the government allowed the destruction of "sanctioned" food by any legal means.
As Western sanctions persisted, Russia also extended its response measures.
This measure does not apply to products that citizens import for personal use.
The ban does not apply to the import of goods for personal consumption weighing less than 5 kilograms.
However, the head of the Council for the Development of Civil Society and Human Rights under the President of the Russian Federation, Mikhail Fedotov, earlier called the destruction of food "simply immoral", and this, according to him, negatively affects people's upbringing.
Moreover, the initiative to ban the destruction of food products suitable for consumption was taken by Rospotrebnadzor in early June.
After that, the Council for Human Rights under the President of the Russian Federation gave a similar recommendation to the government.
And Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexey Gordeev said that destroying food is wrong, and we need to think about how we can use it for its intended purpose, evaluating its quality.

This is reported by the press service of the Investigative Directorate of the Central Criminal Police in Chuvashia.
From January 2008 to December 2009, Vyacheslav Morozov entered information about incomplete transactions in the tax accounting documents of the LLC.

This is reported by TASS with reference to the press service of the European Southern Observatory (ESO).
ESO has announced that the construction of the dome of the building that will house the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), the most expensive and ambitious ground-based astronomy project yet, has officially begun this week.
The total cost of the project is estimated by ESO to be over a billion euros.
Most of this money will be spent on the manufacture of equipment and the construction of the observatory building.
The most expensive and complex component of the telescope is its record-breaking mirror, which will be about 120 feet [39 m] in diameter.
It will be assembled from 798 hexagonal segments measuring 1.4 meters.
This huge mirror, along with two auxiliary reflecting surfaces 4.2 and 3.75 meters in diameter, will help the E-ELT take the first detailed photographs of planets outside the solar system, stars in other galaxies, and look for Earth-like twins.
In addition, scientists will try to use this observatory to observe the vicinity of Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way.
Although the dome is just beginning to be built, the mirrors, scientific instruments, and other components of the observatory have been in the works for three years - since the first plans for the E-ELT were announced.
The contract for the production of the main mirror, whose total cost was about 400 million euros, was awarded to the German company SCHOTT and the French company Safran Reosc.
