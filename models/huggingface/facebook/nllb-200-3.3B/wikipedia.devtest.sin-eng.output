Even in the art of immortality, kings are depicted as bisexual.
In the name changes of the Amarna era, the people added the word "Atan" to their name, and the word "Amun" was quickly removed.

Her successive kings used similar nicknames, and she was not given a royal burial.
Her plan succeeds, and the Hittite prince Sansa arrives in Egypt to marry her and claim the throne.
Her memorial temple was located in Thebes, the religious capital of the Ammonites, and the Ammonite priests would have served in it.
It is disputed whether she was co-regent or sole ruler during her reign.
If a new crown was on her neck, it would be strong evidence that Nefertiti had acquired a new name and title.
Her age does not seem to be a barrier to her position, as Tutankhamun was also on the throne at the same age.
Some say that she took the name Smenkhkare and ruled the kingdom like a man.
Perhaps the power of the land was not in Akhenaten's hands, but in the hands of his mysteries and the ruler.
Perhaps this is a temple complex of shrines.
Some have suggested that she is the Queen of Meritaton.
She succeeded him as an anarchist princess with the title Ankhkeperure.
She came to this conclusion in view of the fact that she had to marry a "servant" named Ai.
She seems to have a rather mild policy on "priests of the poor".
She died in childbirth, as depicted in the royal tombs.
It is believed that she later reigned as a king.
After marrying her and ascending the throne, Smenkhkare used the masculine form of her first name as his own.
The tomb that was supposedly designed for her appears to be unused.
She used the royal title Ankhkhapere after ascending the throne after her husband's death.
Whether she reigned before or after Smekhraj depends on her identity.
According to Allen, King Neferneferuaten is the only one to be called by all three titles, regardless of gender.
Allan suggests that sometimes she may have been three years old when she first performed in Meketa.
Rarely, these names are followed by the feminine qualifier 'powerful.'
The fourth stanza is a reference to both kings, since she was later elevated to the position of co-ruler.
Egyptians have tried to hide the evidence of immortal kings from the future.
Among the Egyptians, the leading scholars are divided on this point.
James Allen offers a spiritual interpretation of the existence of two successive kings on the same throne.
The name "numerical" is given because the contents are specified as a number.
While some scholars have suggested different names for this, the debate has not yet reached a satisfactory conclusion.
She will thereby announce herself as Akhenaten's chosen successor/regent.
This suggests that she died at a time near that of Hatshepsut.
The same epitaph mentions an Ammonian temple in Thebes.
If so, the scene may have been that of another member of the royal family, Merrittatton.
This is because her heroes associate her with Akhenaten ('Va-n-Rey's lover / Neferkh-kheper-re').
When it is associated with Neferneferuaton, its prefix is an acronym for "the beloved of Va En Ray".
It must be a few years after the work on the tomb stopped.
He also claims that she was the queen of Dahmunsu, who had relations with the Hittites.
Neither the name Neferneferuaten nor the short personal names are mentioned.
And then the entire Age of Immortality under King Horemheb was abolished.
Nor did she need to take on the pharaohly titles of a double quarter when dealing with her husband.
Nor can the date of the tomb's owner's death be confirmed, nor whether he served the new king.
It shows him and Merritt, the Great Royal Wife, presenting a gift to the owner of the tomb.
So there is no evidence of King Tutankhamun in Amarna.
So he took over the reins of government and changed his name to Ankh-perun-nai-far-ne-far-utan.
Neferneferuaten would then have succeeded him.
By this time, Akhenaten had tried to make his daughters and grandchildren his father.
Aidan Dodson's Immortal Sunset is considered the most modern work of fiction in chronology and sequence of events.
They are often seen as "... beloved", but sometimes "active toward her husband".
Next to them are four empty cartridges, enough to name two kings.
His predictions were later confirmed by James Allen.
After his death, she assumes full pharaonic authority and rules the kingdom as King of Ankhkherperure Neferneferuaten.
He says that although Akhenaten, Neferneferuaten, and Smenkhkare were kings of Amarna, only a few rings are evidence of Tutankhamun.
He said that the name "Ankh-Peru" has different meanings depending on how it is associated with the Smenkhkare or Nephernephruarthon.
He suggests that political impropriety was the reason for Merrittans removal from office.
In his History of Egypt, he divided the kings into dynastic groups.
He will take her throne name with the name of Smurf.
The cut marks show how work began on the final location chosen for her miniature coffin.
However, the tomb of Merer, in the vision of Merer, is not dated, and there is no mention of Akhenaten.
Gobaldi says that the Smenkhkare wine list indicates that Smenkhkare was the successor to Akhenaten.
The name of Meryton as chief queen, along with Akhenaten, on Tutankhamun's tomb, indicates that she succeeded Nefertiti in the position.
An inscription on the tomb of Tutankhamun, found by the priests:
Even though Tutankhamun was still alive and in the royal line, Queen Meritaton would have prevented his succession.
Dodson concludes that Nefertiti is the mother of the Tutankhattan.
Dodson writes: "... the next debate is clearly about her origins.
Dodson suspects she has usurped seniority and nominally used the Tutankhamun years of rule.
Others still believe that Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten are the same person.
The apostle Paul was a member of the first-century Christian congregation.
The information about the Damounouz/Sananza relationship comes almost exclusively from Hittite sources written years after the event.
But she was sometimes relegated from the position of king to that of queen.
But Alan believes that these titles and their appearance are simply the 'fake' names that these children have been given to fill the void.
But the rings and scarab ruins found in his name indicate that the city was inhabited during his reign.
But it could have belonged to one of these two people.
But since the images do not resemble Tutankhamun and his wife, it has often been suggested that they are those of Smekkhkare and Meritaton.
But there are also the ideas that are attributed to Akhenaten and Nefertiti.
But it has recently been suggested that his vineyard may produce wine in the first year of his successor.
But since there is no definitive evidence of the dates of the kings or contemporaries, this argument remains speculative.
However, his work is now lost, and only fragments of his work have been cited by later writers.
The date of Smenkhkare's reign is still disputed.
Mernean also proposed that there was a common rule in the new kingdom and no double date.
Or Tutankhamun would have her buried with a set of other kings' funeral objects when his officers took the throne after her.
Reeves sees this as a key element in solving the Nefertiti problem.
Much of her history was erased by Neferneferuaten's successor.
Neferneferuaten's successor seems to have refused to grant her a royal burial.
Allan later showed that the heroes of Neferneferuaten can be divided into three types.
The evidence that Neferneferaton was a virgin, her gender and identity, is this:
The idea that nepherneferutane is meritatane seems to be the most uncertain.
Perhaps the most convinced of all that King Neferneferuaten is Meritaten is Marc Gabledi.
Nefertiti is an early name for King Neferuaton.
Later records mention only one queen.
Later, French Egyptologist Marc Gaboldi noted that some of the elements found in Tutankhamun's tomb were originally made for Neferneferuaten.
Since the Pairi inscription is written in her reign years, it is believed that she probably ruled alone.
Surprisingly, it started in this very temple of the visionary and the ruler's memorial.
Since there is no male heir, Akhenaten will be next to take Ankhesenpaaten as his wife.
Although the pot may have suggested a shared government, it may also have been an attempt by a king to link his name to that of his predecessor.
Most Egyptians accepted that she was a woman, and that she was a king other than Smenkhkare.
In several of her papers and at least one book (in French), Marc Gabledi mentions that she was a meritaton.
Mark Gabald claims that Tutankhamun ruled Amarna for no more than a few months.
It seems that in the last years of her reign, the ban on pilgrimages was lifted and traditional religion was restored.
According to Miller, they "were written with a full understanding of the tragic inadequacy of this strategy.
Miller says that the word "servant" is often used in a derogatory sense, not in its proper sense.
Previously, records of a stone block containing the names of almost the entire Smenkhkare king and his royal wife Meritaton were found.
After the recent violence, it has officially started to function again.
A similar case can be seen in the passage concerning Hatshepsut in the tomb of Panteleimon.
Without grandchildren, there is no evidence to support the argument about her age.
One could say that Morsi was attempting to reform history, placing the entire blame on the Egyptians for the flood.
The name 'Smenkhkare' is not found in any of these places with a 'long' prefix.
Although some aspects of this hypothesis are accepted as true, the argument that Nefertiti was the mother of Tutankhamun has been shown to be false.
This proves that his reign was short.
This information suggests that Neferneferuaton was deposed in a power struggle.
The letters "Djesser" and "Kherparu" and a portion of the "Ka" symbol are clearly identified.
These objects are now the subject of numerous speculations.
The key points in the debate hinged on her name: it is highly improbable that someone would change her name to become Neferneferu'tan.
She was queen at the time of the start of the construction of these statues, so she is depicted with a flat-topped head.
The shabbat is in two pieces, and there is a piece that is said to fit between the two.
This is explained by Reeves' claim that Nefertiti did not disappear, but rather appeared in numerous inscriptions from Akhenaten's last period.
This also laid the foundation for the modern practice of dating in ancient Egypt.
This is a reference to the portrayal of Kaolin and her daughter.
This is a simple logic used to explain the nature of the heroes.
If this is true, then the Smendkaras have never had an independent kingdom.
When Meritathon gave birth to a daughter, Athena would sometimes take the daughter of Meketaton as her wife.
Merritt-Aaton had no need for such a change of name.
Thus, the argument between Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten was suppressed, leading to new interpretations of the evidence.
If her image had been here, it would have been possible to understand how Nefertiti's image had been altered to fit the new inscription.
If her image had been replaced in its entirety, Neferti would have been replaced by Neferneferuthun, a king named Neferti.
Here, James Allen describes most of his works as being about Neferneferrathan, a woman, and not about Smenkhkare.
Nepherneferuthun is used here in place of Nephertiti.
Although the names of the babies are not given, the baby is definitely identified as a girl.
The contradiction here indicates that there was opposition to Neferneferuaten's appointment, or that such opposition was expected.
Among them are the heroes "The Beloved of Artan" and "The Ruler".
In this sequence, the Acherneries are the factors of the numerator.
Thus, there were two treasurers.
So this mask was originally created for Queen Nefertiti, Akhenaten's great-grandmother.
These male pharaohs have never encountered heroes or cartoons.
Because of these differences, Smenkhkare was placed after Neferneferuatan.
Many experts on this period believe that the archival evidence suggests that she shared a reign during Akhenaten's reign.

After Akhenaten's death, she was made co-regent/regent for Tutankhamun.
Since the names of the immortal kings have been erased from history, the only ancient record of this is the Manetho account.
Her successive kings used similar nicknames, and she was not given a royal burial.
Her scheme succeeds, and the Hittite prince Sananza arrives in Egypt to marry her and claim the throne.
Since her memorial temple was located in Thebes, the religious capital of the Amun priests, the Amun priests would serve in it.
Whether she was a regent or a monarch during her reign is debatable.
If her statue was crowned with a new one, it would be a strong indication that Nefertiti had acquired a new name and title.
Her age does not seem to be a barrier to that position, as Tutankhamun was crowned at the same age.
Perhaps the power of the land was not in Akhenaten's hands at the time, but in the hands of his mysterious and ruling master.
Perhaps this is a complex of mortuary temples.
She succeeded him as an archaic princess, named Ankhkhapperure.
She seems to have a rather mild policy on the priesthood.
The royal tombs depict her as having died in childbirth.
She used the royal title of Ankhkh-e-Perur after ascending the throne after her husband's death.
Whether she reigned before or after Smenkhkare depends on her identity.
According to Allen, all three of these titles, regardless of gender, are attributed to King Neferneferuaten.
Alan suggests that she was probably three years old when Mekete was first depicted.
Rarely, these names are followed by the feminine adjective 'justified.'
The Egyptians have tried to hide the evidence of the immortal kings from the future.
Among the Egyptians, the leading scholars have a different view.
The name "Ankhkhkhare" was given to the contents of the scroll.
One scholar suggests different names for the subject, and the debate has not yet reached a satisfactory conclusion.
This suggests that she died at a time near that of Hatshepsut.
If so, the scene may be that of another member of the royal family, such as Merritt.
It must have been a few years after the tomb was abandoned.
The short personal names Neferneferuaten are also not common.
And the whole of the time of the reign of Horemheb was also abomination.
Nor did she need to assume the titles of a double Pharaoh in the service of her husband.
He and his wife, the Great Royal Wife, are shown by Meritaton, who presents a gift to the owner of the tomb.
According to this, there is no evidence of King Tutankhamun in Amarna.
He has thus taken over the reins and changed his name to Ankh-per-nai-farne-fur-a-tan.
Aidan Dodson's The Colorless Sunset is considered the most modern of the fantasies of chronology and sequence of events.
Behind them are four empty cartouches, enough to name two kings.
His discoveries were later confirmed by James Allen.
After his death, she assumes full pharaonic authority and rules the kingdom as King Nephernephoratan of Ankhkherper.
He said that the name "Ankhkhkheruh" would have different meanings depending on how it was related to the name "Smenkhkare" or "Nefernferuharatan".
In his History of Egypt, he listed the kings according to their dynasties.
He will join her to the throne as Smenkhkare.
However, the tomb of Meryre, in the tomb of Meryre, is not dated, and there is no mention of Akhenaten.
Gabaldi says that the Smenkhkare wine list indicates that Smenkhkare was crowned after Akhenaten.
The name of Meritaton, along with Akhenaten, as the chief queen, is found on Tutankhamun's tomb, suggesting that she was the successor of Nefertiti.
An inscription on the tomb of Tutankhamun, which is dedicated to the priests:
Since Tutankhamun was still alive and was of royal blood, Queen Merritt would have prevented his succession.
Dodson concludes that Nefertiti is the mother of Tutankhamen.
Dodson writes: "... the next debate is obviously about her origins.
Dodson suspects that she has used seniority to take advantage of Tutankhamun's royal patronage.
But perhaps her failure to rule the kingdom has seen her demoted from queen to queen.
But the object could belong to one of these two people.
But since they do not look like Tutankhamun and his wife, it has often been suggested that they are those of Smenkhkare and Meritaton.
However, his work is not found today, and only the quotations from his work by later writers survive.
But Smekara's reign is still disputed.
The idea of a new kingdom with a shared government and no dual monarchy was also proposed by Maren.
Or Tutankhamun, who succeeded her on the throne, and his officers buried her with the remains of another king.
This is seen as a key element in the solution to the Nefertiti problem.
Neferneferuaten's successor erased much of her from history.
It seems that the successor king of Neferneferuthan has refused to give her a royal burial.
Alan later showed that the heroes of Neferneferuaten could be divided into three classes.
The evidence that Nephrenferuaten was a virgin, and her gender and identity, is as follows:
Mark Gabaldi is the one who most believes that Neferneferuaton is Meritaton.
An early name suggested for the Nephrenferraton king, Nefertiti.
Later, French Egyptologist Marc Gaboldi noted that some of the elements found in Tutankhamun's tomb were originally built for Neferneferuaten.
Since the Pairi inscription describes her reign, it is believed that she ruled most of the time alone.
Most Egyptians accept that she was a woman, and that she was a different king than Smenkhkare.
Marc Gabaldi has stated in several of his papers and at least one book (in French) that she is a Meritaton.
Marc Gabald claims that the kingdom of Tutankhamun ruled Amarn for no more than a few months.
According to Miller, they were "written with a deep understanding of the tragic failure of this strategy.
Miller says that "the word 'servant' is often used in a derogatory way, not in its true sense.
A similar passage is found in the text of the tomb of Hatshepsut in the Penati.
Without grandchildren, there is no evidence to support her age.
One might say that Mursul is attempting to shift the blame for this delusion entirely onto the Egyptians, somewhat revising history.
Although some aspects of this hypothesis are accepted as true, the claim that Nefertiti was Tutankhamun's mother has been proven false.
This is evidence of his short reign.
The key points in this debate depend on her name: it is highly unlikely that someone would change his name to become Neferneferuaton.
The shroud is in two pieces, with one piece said to fit in between.
Ancient Egypt was also the basis for the modern system of chronology.
This is a portrait of the princess and her daughter.
This is a simple logical theory used to explain the nature of heroes.
As the debate between Smenkhkare and Neferneferuaten continued, new interpretations of the evidence were made.
If her entire image had been restored here, it would mean that Nefertiti had been replaced by Nefertiti-Nefertit.
Here Nephertiti is replaced by Nepherneferuaton.
Although the baby is not named, it is definitely identified as a girl.
The distortion of this statement reveals that there may have been, or was expected to be, opposition to Neferneferuaten's appointment.
Among them are the heroes "The Beloved of Artan" and "The Ruler".
So, it's clear that there were two sets of officers.
So this mask was originally created for Akhenaten's queen Nefertiti.
These men have never met the Pharaoh's heroes or carthusians.
Because of this, Smenkhkare was placed after Neferneferuaton.
There are many interesting speculations among Egyptians about the chronology of this era.
Like many facts of this age, this fact is a suggestion, not a conclusion.
The main focus is to reveal the identity of Neferneferuthan.
A small statue of Tutankhamun, found in his tomb, is also depicted.
So this simple relationship may not always represent shared control.
For this reason, when one scholar has one opinion about the period and title of his reign, the Sessons may have completely different opinions.
This would make it impossible to find any definitive information about the events.
This is a step forward in the argument for a reigning queen.
Reese believes that Nefertiti ruled the kingdom independently for a short time before Tutankhamun ascended the throne.
Although intimate scenes on a number of stele sites suggest a homosexual connection, later evidence and revelations have largely ignored it.
If the evidence shows that he lived for a very short time, it would be difficult to reveal the clarity of this.
If a man disappears from the inscriptions and carvings, the simplest explanation is that he is dead.
After Smenkhkare, Nefertiti will rule for a time as queen Nefertiti, under the name Neferteniferuaten.
The Szekker/Sansa hypothesis has received little support from the Egyptians.
Scholars are not in agreement about the line of succession of Smenkhkare and Nefertiti.
The extremely vague nature of the evidence has made it difficult to substantiate various theories.
For the Hittite, Suppiluma was well aware of the risks of revealing the plan, but he also considered the benefits.

In addition, some dives can start from a flying position.
Higher altitude gives longer flight time, so it takes longer to perform maneuvers.
All of these dives come with a DD (degree of difficulty) which is a measure of how difficult/complex the dive is.
At the national level, diving is almost entirely without alternative, along with other water sports, owned by a governing body.

The limit is four years, but under certain circumstances it may be less.
The NCAA limits the number of years a student can represent any school.
The swimming and diving competitions are held after the completion of the swimming event.
The body that is open to penetration does not stop rotating, but simply slows it down.
The difficulty factor is multiplied by the number of moves attempted and the number of points scored.
Diving classes are divided into six groups: forward, backward, inward, backward, ambling and Armstrong.
Attempts to isolate the governing body as a way to resolve this disintegration are rarely successful.
There's a common misconception about scoring and judging
