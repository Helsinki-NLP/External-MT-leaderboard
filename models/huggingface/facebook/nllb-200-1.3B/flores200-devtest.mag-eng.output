This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had wings, a theory already abundant, but provides details that fossils cannot typically take on color and three-dimensional arrangements.
Scientists say that the wings of these animals were brownish-brown above and pear or carotenoid below.
This finding gives information about the development of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaurs did not have a well-developed wing shaft, called a ratchis, but had other features of the wing - barbs and barbels - researchers speculated that ratchis were likely a later evolutionary evolution of these other features.
The structure of the wings suggests that they were used for temperature regulation or display, rather than in flight.The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen would show adult wings and not below a snout.
The researchers suggested that, even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult wings and not under a paw.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made from the Rainbow Galaxy.
The teams that were looking for the impact would have been due to tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the Moon creates a pull on Earth, creating tides, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as regular matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a type of bulge around a galaxy, and is made up of very small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth, putting a pre-printed sheet of paper that reflects the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the identity of the voter is verified by the officials, the voter leaves the envelope in the ballot box and signs the voting list.
French electoral law strictly codifies the procedure.
Since 1988, ballots have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that no envelopes are present at the beginning of voting and no envelopes have been added except for duly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives to oversee every part of the process.In the evening, following specific procedures, votes are counted by volunteers under heavy surveillance.

Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, noted that "journalists are walking a dangerous line when publishing pictures of suspects, etc".
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of the prosecution, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made until at least the prosecution is found.
The document, according to the leak, will mention the border dispute, which Palestine wants to build on the borders it had before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other topics reportedly covered include the future status of Jerusalem which is sacred to both countries and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed Israel demands an ongoing military presence in the valley for ten years while the PA agrees to abandon such a presence for only five years.
In the supplemental pest control test, shooters were monitored by rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of parks conservation and heritage with the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation received extensive protection and training.
Martelli was sworn in yesterday to a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelli's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month a presidential commission had recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to lead the country to new elections.
The commission was Martelli's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by failure to hold elections, some since 2011.
There have been about 60 cases of iPod breakdowns, with a total of six fires and four people being lightly burned.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had information on 27 accidents related to equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported to it 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company called "non-serious".
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake in Mariana occurred at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT on Friday).
The Northern Marianas Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported in the country.
Also the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
In the Philippine capital of Manila, a retired Filipino policeman hijacks a tourist bus from Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six more people are confirmed dead so far.
A total of 6 people, including children and the elderly, were soon released, including photographers.
Later, photographers took the place of an elderly woman who went to the toilet, and in doing so killed Mendoza.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps by making his career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm labor in her spare time.
Her research showed that if a hormone is administered it accelerates the maturation of the lungs of the baby's fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two 'black boxes' flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Acostreme. I was the first manager. Luna died on a fortnight. Just like her, very unique. Strong woman".
Dustin "Goldst" Runnels commented that "Luna was as strange as I am...maybe even more...loving and missing her...hopefully in a better place".
Of the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election who oppose Australia becoming a republic, this is an increase of 8 per cent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those surveyed share the view, who wanted Queen Elizabeth II to be Australia's last monarch.
At the peak of the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believed that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist swam in the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but her fitness is in doubt due to complaints.
He has been unable to take the medications needed to relieve his pain since he has been banned from sports.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number ever on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software by early February and another was announced on Tuesday.
Comets would have been the source of organic matter as well as water distribution on Earth that could make proteins and support life.
Scientists have come to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth is formed, since comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his reign earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He referred to the rumors as "political nonsense and stupidity".
There is speculation that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and cut carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-radar-based technology to allow air traffic controllers to point aircraft with greater accuracy and give pilots more accurate information.
No additional transport is being put in place and no overground trains stop at Wembley, and car parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of a lack of transport increased the possibility that the team would be forced to play behind closed doors without supporters winning the game.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new bird species on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that new species have evolved in only two generations, although this process takes longer due to breeding among a local Darwin finch, Geospyza forts, and the nomadic cactus Finch, Geospyza conyrostris.
Gold can be worked into all kinds of shapes.Agora can be modeled into smaller sizes.
An agora can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be twisted and plated. An agora can be engraved or twisted into a sheet.
The agora can be made very thin, and glued to other metals. The agora can be made so thin that the agora was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books called "enlightened manuscripts".
Agoras call the pH of a chemical. They can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or alkaline (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H in pH) ions in the chemical being tested.
The hydrogen ion is the proton that the electron took from it (since hydrogen atoms have a proton and an electron).
Twist two dry prunes together and then, with clean wet hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture from the open hand will react with the outer layers, which look strange and form a kind of shell.
Almost every home in the towns of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women lived together in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, they are using satellites.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects back to Agora almost immediately.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket.Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and sights we see.
A giant rocket more than 100 feet high is required to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The wheel is the biggest thing to us, providing us with much easier and faster transportation.
It has brought me trains, cars, and many other transportation devices.
Below them are more moderate-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to deer and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including loose domestic cats) that eat many small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special job that each cat holds that prevents one from competing with the other.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called pride.
The pride is composed of three related adult males, as well as thirty females and cubs.
Women are usually closely related to each other because they have a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion Pride acts much like a pack of wolves or dogs, the animals behave surprisingly like lions (but not other big cats), and are also very lethal to their prey.
A well-rounded athlete, tiger can climb (though not well), swim, leap long distances and pull five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four cats can bark.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but rather like the sentence of harsh, shouted words.
Oscelets prefer to eat smaller animals; if they can they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all animals that prey on oscelets are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that oselots are eaten by tracking and finding animals (prey) by smell, where they live on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and can also walk very stealthily. Osseolate prey on their prey by blending with their surroundings.
When a small group of living things (a small population) diverges from the main population from which they came (such as if they moved over a mountain range or river, or if they moved to a new island so that they could not easily retreat) they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
These new environments have different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than the previous one.
The original populations have not changed at all, they still need adaptation as much as before.
Over time, as new populations begin to adapt to their new environments, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or millions of years, the two populations would appear so different that they could not be called the same species.
This process we call speciation, which means the creation of new species. Specificity is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take in the carbon-dioxide that humans exhale (i.e. exhale).
Plants make their food from the sun by photosynthesis; they also provide shade.
We make our homes out of plants and make clothes out of plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
Moussaures were the top hunters of their time so were afraid of nothing but other moussaures.
Its long jaws were lined with over 70 sharp teeth, with an extra set above its mouth meaning nothing could pass through it.
We cannot say for sure but the egrets may be quite strange. The egrets may have feasted on turtles, large fish and other shrimp, and may have been carnivorous.
It is also thought that if anything came underwater it would attack, to the point that even a giant dinosaur would not survive much longer.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a share of strange or unusual feasting objects, including wild pigs, peacocks, snails, and a type of rat called a dormouse.
Another difference was that where poor men and women would sit on chairs and eat their meals, the wealthy men preferred to dine together, where they would stay on their side, while they would stay together.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not include foods that were imported to Europe from the Americas or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Romans had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods that was considered to be the house of the gods.
People sacrificed to the gods and priests tried to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that could only be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped minarets, called ziggurats, were built to form part of the temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family's life was spent in the open air.
The stores served food in the courtyards; the stores were open counters that faced the street. Stones were used to build houses.
The land of Canaan was not heavily forested, so timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely settled; in Norse sagas he says that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for his murder, and while travelling further west, Greenland was pioneered and later renamed Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribe was already living in Ozza at the time.
Although each country was 'Scandinavian', Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland had many differences between the people, kings, customs and history.
If you have seen the National Treasure film, you might think that a treasure map was written behind the Declaration of Independence.
This is not true, however. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The words "Original Declaration of Independence of 4 July 1776" were written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote the Agora, it is known that early in its life, large parchment documents (Agor measuring 293⁄4 inches x 241⁄2 inches) were folded up for storage.
Thus, it is likely that the notation was merely added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the following battles had liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
These "Viches" were ruled by the French; it was the French who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with them rather than fight the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning towards Germany.
A civilization is a distinct culture that is shared by a significantly larger group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, related to the Latin civilis, meaning citizen, and civilis, meaning city or city-state, and also defines the shape of an S in some ways.
City-states are the precursors to nations.A civilizational culture means the transfer of knowledge across generations, a sluggish cultural footprint and a fair spread.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the Thirteen States first formed a weak central government - with Congress as the sole constituent - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to tax, and, since there was no national executive or judiciary, it depended on state officials, who were often uncooperative, to enforce its good acts.
It had no authority to override tax laws and fees between states.
The amendment of the Articles required the consensus of all the states and the states so undermined the central government that their representatives were often absent.
Italy's national football, along with the German national football team, is the world's second most successful team and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water-polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the Northern Territory, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world.
Japan is often referred to, for geographical purposes, as an archipelago, due to the cluster/island in Japan.
The introduction of Taiwan began in the 15th century where European sailors crossed the island bearing the name Elah Formosa or Beautiful Island.
In 1624 the Dutch East India Company established its base in southwest Taiwan, and initiated a change in the ancient methods of grain production and employed Chinese workers in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) captured the western and northern coastal regions of Taiwan and proclaimed Taiwan a kingdom of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894 - 1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which Taiwan was ceded to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Ma Pichu consists of three main structures, such as the Intuatna, the Sun Temple, and the Room with Three Windows.
To give the tourist a better understanding of what they initially looked like, most of the buildings at the end of the complex were rebuilt.
By 1976, thirty percent of the Machu Picchu had been restored and restoration is still ongoing.
For example, the most prevalent still image photography in the world is 35mm which was the most effective film size at the time of the end of the analog film era.
They are still manufactured today, but their length-to-height ratio is derived from the digital camera image sensor format.
The 35mm format is, in fact, somewhat confusing, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The width-height ratio of this format (dividing by 12 to get the normal integer ratio) is therefore called 3:2.
The very common format (e.g. the format of the APS family) is very close to or equal to this aspect ratio.
The much-praised and often-mocked rule of thirds is a guideline for maintaining order in photos with a passion.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is the cut-off point of the line dividing the photo into horizontal and vertical thirds (see examples).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, rose to prominence.
Despite differences in language and customs, Christianity held the kingdoms of Europe together for over a thousand years.
Its all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
A core Christian doctrine is that money should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's monetary fund is specifically for that.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this doctrine was being fulfilled.
Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The tactic proved effective, cutting off significant troops and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international rules, which have been codified under various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain built tunnels in the international waterway to prevent any ships from entering the entire area of the sea, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the response to this strategy was limited, Germany expected a response similar to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries were pacifism and isolationism.
In view of the horrors and atrocities of World War I, countries wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to take a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
With 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at the former job) he arrived at Thomas Edison in the US.
Ancient China had unique ways of showing different time periods; each stage of China or each family that had ever been in power had a specific dynasty.
There was a temporary era of kingdoms divided between each dynasty.The most famous of the time between the Han and Jin dynasties were the three dynasties that ruled for 60 years.
The period saw fierce wars for the throne between several kings.
The Three Dynasties period was the bloodiest era in the history of ancient China, with thousands of people killed in the war that took place over the largest throne of the magnificent palace at Xi'an.
There are many other notable social and political influences such as the use of the metric system, the shift from dictatorship to republicanism, nationalism and the idea that states belong to the people rather than to a king.
Even after the Revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants with the most ambitious and fortunate succeeding.
The same system became applicable in the military as ranks in the army based on class became based on merit.
The French Revolution prompted many other oppressed working class people in the Second World War to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave known as "Diamond" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) for meditation.
The cave itself, which has long since built its existence, is a very vivid depiction of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
The cave, located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it is not easy to find an agora even if one knows it exists. Once inside the cave, it is complete seclusion.
Nothing could be seen except the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains. Very little of this world could be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of several large pyramid structures built in honor of the dead pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis", located in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (of which The Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous smaller tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of the Pharaoh Khufu and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built for Khufu's wife and family members.
The upper arch looks like the sign V and the sign of the "downward arch" looks like a staple or square with the lower part missing.
Up means you should push the bow starting from the tip, and down means you should pull the bow starting from the frog (where your hand holds the bow).
The upward arcs usually produce a softer sound, while the downward arcs are stronger and more pronounced.
Feel free to mark in your own digits, but remember that printed bowings are for musical reasons, so they should usually be given due respect.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, her two young children (11 year old Marie-Thérèse and four year old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on 6 October 1789.
Riding a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a mob shouting and threatening against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep their car windows open.
At one point a member of the crowd waved the head of a royal guard killed at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay a large portion of the expenses of the American colonial regime and interest on bonds issued through the Wall Street banking houses in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits derived from the long exploitation of Filipinos were the core benefits of American imperialism.
To understand Templar one must understand the context that led to the creation of the system.
The period that occurred in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (A.D. 1000-1300) is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages.
The High Middle Ages were after the Early Middle Ages and before the Late Middle Ages, which traditionally ends in about 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in itself encompasses a very large range of ideas.Technology-push or technological imperative literally means that we are driven by a logic associated with the expression of human destiny in scientific laws and technology.
Most interpretations, when used in technical parlance, revolve around two general ideas: that the development of technology follows a path other than cultural or political influence itself, and that technology in turn "affects" society from within rather than being socially conditioned.
For example one might say that the development of roads is due to motor cars.
Although a sprawling road network in the country is not for cars, work is underway on ways to make new ways of producing cars work.
Having more cars also increases the risk of accidents which requires finding new technologies in health care to heal the damaged body.
A large component of Curatism was cultural determinism, derived from authors such as Goethe, Fitch, and Schlegel.
In terms of sanctity, geography shaped people, and over time those customs and cultures emerged that were geographically relevant, and that, by being tailored to the place of society, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris has come to be known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD, and lasted until around 1100 AD.
The situation deteriorated during the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style peaked in the period between the 10th - 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially the dress was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture of the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, the style in the West was left 25 to 30 years behind.
In the late Middle Ages Western Europe began to develop its own style.One of the biggest events of the time was that people began to use buttons to tie clothes as a result of the Crusades.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is done solely to produce enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their families.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple, often organic system, that uses seeds saved in an ecological field in combination with crop cycles or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were engaged in subsistence agriculture and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subculture brings together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be specific because of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The attributes that make a subculture distinctive may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of all elements.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through distinctive and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and dialect.
One of the most common methods used to explain the importance of socialization is to note some unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults through neglect, misfortune, or deliberate abuse when they were growing up.
Such children are called "savage" or feral. Some feral children have been imprisoned by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases such abandonment of the child by the parents was due to the rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
Others are said to have kept all their animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by non-human animals, feral children exhibit almost entirely caring animal-like behaviors (within physical limits), such as fear of humans or indifference.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a tool that assists people who are gaining experience learning something new such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffold can be both virtual and real, in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffold, but so is the small paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are embedded in the software and are used to question, indicate, and explain processes that may be challenging for students to handle themselves.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse and even forced recovery.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, but it is.
We see the foster care system as a safety zone for all these children.
Our foster care system is considered to provide safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable health care.
Foster care is expected to meet all the needs that were lacking in the home from which it was first taken.
The Internet serves as a link between both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The Internet is taking on additional dimensions in terms of specific properties, usage, and satisfaction.
For example, "education" and "socialization" have been shown to be important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Individual participation and continuous interaction were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eghami and McCord (1998) when they examined audience responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial activity, that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting subtle expressions one can determine whether a person is lying or not.
Oliver Sacks indicated in his paper The Presidential Speech that people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are still able to accurately assess honesty.
He also said that such abilities to explain human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twentieth-century research has shown that there are two forms of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
Mutations add new genetic variations, and selection removes one manifested variation from the group.
Isolation and recombination alter the variation between the two groups in each generation.
In savannahs, primates with digestive systems like humans have difficulty meeting their amino-acid requirements from available plant resources.
And moreover, failure to do so has serious consequences: developmental depression, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins available in leaves and fruits, but primates like us have a hard time digesting them unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (ants, ducks, eggs) are not only easily digested, but also provide high amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we should not be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in much the same way that chimpanzees do on the savannah today.
Sleep disturbance is the tendency to wake up well within the normal sleep period and fall asleep after that time (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a quiet alarm clock to bring oneself to consciousness without waking oneself completely.
If you can reset the clock in your sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, which you can comfortably get out of bed to quietly close.
All other biorhythm-based options involve drinking a lot of fluid (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, which forces the man to urinate.
The amount of peace a person has inside is inversely related to the amount of stress in his body and soul.
The less stress, the more positive the vitality. All men have the ability to find complete peace and contentment.
Only one thing stands in the way of this goal, and that is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been extended by the Mahavanas of Love and the many techniques of Indian Yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle; it includes the Agora Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of omnipresent love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (knowledge energy) is awakened through yoga mudras, breathing exercises, mantras, and visuals.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Diati yoga. Energy nerves are cleansed, chakras are activated and wisdom consciousness is constructed through visions of various deities.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, with the USSR and the USA cooperating.The country was excluded due to conflicts of order, procedures, and culture with the end of the war.
Two years after the end of the war, the Eastern Allies were now enemies and the Cold War began.
It will last for the next 40 years and will be fought, in reality, by pseudo-armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many more.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already broken, and the Romanians withdrew with Bridgehead as the only hope of reorganization.
These plans were rendered obsolete almost overnight, however, when more than 800,000 troops of the Soviet Union's Red Army penetrated and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for cargo transportation to carry large numbers of people and goods across the oceans is by far the most efficient method.
The role of navies has traditionally been to ensure that their countries maintain the ability to move their people and goods, while, at the same time, interfering with their enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
The most notable recent example was WW II's North Atlantic Expedition.The Americans were trying to transport men and similar across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
The German Navy was also attempting to intercept this traffic, primarily using U-boats.
If the Allies failed, Germany would probably be able to win over Britain because they had the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Older cultures and tribes began keeping them for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skins.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that roamed the mountains or other grazed areas, similar in appearance to the more widely known shepherds, which were cubs or teenagers. This method of animal husbandry is still used today.
Wagonways were built in England in the 16th century.
But the wagonway had parallel planks of bare wood, helping the horse to run faster and pull more weight than the more bumpy roads of the day.
Crosses were introduced much earlier to place tracks. Gradually, however, it was realized that tracks would be more efficient if they had a piece of iron on top of them.
This has become common, but more so on the wooden wheels of iron wagons.
Later, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron railway was introduced.
The first known transport was walking, with humans beginning to walk directly two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning straight man).
Before that, astralepaths did not walk as straight as they usually did.
Bipedal speciation is found in the fossil Australopithecus 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelatropus could walk on two legs seven million years ago.
We can all start to be more environmentally friendly, we can get involved in environmental movements, and we can even be caregivers to reduce future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to pathological treatment in many respects. However, we do not want just a temporary solution, we must find the root of the problem, and eliminate it.
It is clear that the world is changing a lot due to the scientific and technological advances of mankind, and the greater population and the different ways in which mankind lives have led to a lot of problems.
After the adoption of the Agora by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlop's printing shop a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made at night, now known as "Dunlop Broadside".
The first public reading of the document was given by John Nixon on July 8 in the yard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
25 Dunlop broadsides still exist which are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs lived and are still alive today; we call them birds.
Many people do not think of them as dinosaurs because they have wings and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs today.
Their feet are with scales and claws, they can lay eggs, and they walk like T-Rexes on their two hind legs.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information that is coded as binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary digits - or bits - to use computer jargon.
Internal toxicity may not be immediately apparent.Symptoms such as vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best sign of internal toxicity may be the presence of open containers of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first-aid instructions for that specific poison.
The word bug is used by entomologists in the language of insect collocation.
The term is a metonym for any species that can survive on humans.
Both blood-sucking insects and mites are parasites, living in houses built by others.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), leaving it as the dominant neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to have MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest to raise children or in the best interest of their children.
This couple may choose to plan for adoption for their child.
In an adoption, the giving parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can raise the children.
The main goal of science is to discover the way the world works through the scientific method.This method actually guides most scientific research.
Although this is not alone, experiment, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and observing also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and especially on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's ideas were accepted on all matters of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greeks diminished, the West found itself cut off from Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many observations in physiology and behavior often rely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just responses to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-perpetuating pendulums that will continue periods of free-running cycling even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the major suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
He performed two experiments to either mark the phase of DNA with radioactive phosphorus in the phase or the phase of the protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the fragment of the affected genetic material and whether or not the affected cells are germ-line cells.
Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell-death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife of plants and animals.
Examples of activities on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is to know, photograph, and learn about the orgatungas in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small town by car to go to their workplace and are passed by other people, whose work destination is the place from which they just left.
Everyone in these dynamic transport shuttles is connected in some way, and supports transport systems based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this vast carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.
In developed countries you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or falling bridges.
Transport systems generate complaints that they fail on a daily basis; that transport engineers are just incompetent; or that something more fundamental is going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of different drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flows are difficult to study because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers behave within reasonably consistent limits; thus, traffic flows have some reasonable stability and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flows, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
This relationship helps in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to be carried in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back with their bodies.
This gives them a wide range of small spaces to hide from hunters.
Today, only the dragonfly and the mayfly are insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right but many believed otherwise; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That makes sense, because the earth doesn't seem to be spinning, does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes being six miles wide.
The full 20 percent of the water flowing into the oceans from the planet's rivers comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although pyramid-building in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The New Kingdom Ancient Egyptians were amazed at the monuments of their predecessors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
The population of Vatican City is about 800; it is the smallest independent country and the least populous country in the world.
Vatican City uses Italian in its laws and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those working in the state while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People knew about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper from ancient times, as they could be found in nature in their original form and were much easier to find with ancient machines.
Aristotle, a philosopher, ruled that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements; they were earth, water, air, and fire.
This was like the four states of matter (in the same line): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also gave the rule that they change into the new thing that we are.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals such as silver and gold.
You may also have alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that tens of billions of them could fit into periods at the end of sentences.
Thus, pencils were a good friend to many people when they came out.
Unfortunately, as new ways of writing have emerged, pencils have been taken into disrepair and use.
People now type messages on computer screens, never getting close to the sharpener.
One can only imagine what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
Fusion bombs work on the principle that energy is required to hold a nucleus with many protons and neutrons together.
As if rolling a heavy wagon over a hill. Re-splitting the nucleus then releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei which means they split with little or no elbow.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick for nearby and 100 km thick for distant.
It thins below the Maria and thickens below the Highlands.
There may be more lava on the near side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on finding out what attracts or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people all have certain needs and/or desires that are given intrinsic form as they mature for adulthood.
This theory sees what it is about certain people that makes them want what they do and what things in their environment motivate them to do or not do something.
Two popular material theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
In general, two behaviors can emerge as managers begin to lead their former peers - one end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, performing performance evaluations, delegating responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, a stranger transforms into a person who feels that they should change everything the team is doing and make them their own.
Yet the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior is often the result of a rift between leaders and other members of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same standard of excellence as traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as the contact points for their immediate physical group.
Vocara often have greater autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet according to different time zones that may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
An invisible team is a management team to which each member reports.
What an organization wants to go through is the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization. One goal of bringing organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and simplicity can be communicated when all available resources are used effectively across the functional departments of an organization.
As a result, an organization's processes are working together to overcome a barrier, which can lead to a new innovative process to meet customer needs.
Now before an organization can be innovative, leadership must build a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006), defines the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to investigating perception.It therefore narrows the research field and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior assists scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, wounds and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and examine brain structures and processes never seen before.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although there is a strong sense of science fiction in AI, AI is a very important branch of computer science, which deals with behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation in machines.
Research in AI involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose and answer customer questions, as well as handwritten recognition, voice and face.
Such things have become distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
AI systems are now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as have many home computer and video game software applications.
Field trips are a large part of any classroom. Often a teacher prefers to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology provides solutions with virtual field trips. Students can sit with their classrooms to see museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire fine art.
Virtually sharing a field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital, the website is redesigned each year, but older versions are kept online to serve as scrapbooks.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing. While students often start their blog experience with messy grammar and spelling, audience presence generally changes the agora.
Because students are often the most demanding audience, bloggers begin to try to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
At the same time blogging "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them". The need to feed the audience's interest motivates students to be clever and interesting (Totto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration, and encourages students to learn beyond traditional school days.
Proper use of blogs "empowers students to be more analytical and critical; through actively responding to Internet content, students can define their position in terms of others' writing as well as outline their own viewpoints on particular issues (Orevake, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's fascinating, bilingual capital and now houses a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Far to the south are Niagara Falls and to the north are Muscoca and beyond, home to an untouched natural beauty.
All of these things and Ontario are best highlighted by outsiders as Canadian.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited forests.
To a population comparison that surprises many: more African Americans live in the U.S. than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and a continent in its own right when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also landed Islam, and it took large-scale possession in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco de Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north the region is bounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any female passenger say she is married, regardless of actual marital status.
Wearing a ring is also helpful (not just the ones that seem too expensive.
Women should realize that cultural differences may result in them believing that harassment and following, holding hands, etc. are not uncommon.
Be persistent in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, that's not OK!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and Agora was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed Agora and rebuilt Agora as Casa Branca, only to abandon Agora after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Darou el-Badiya and Agora was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders, who established the commercial base of Ouza.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old medina it is easy to find places selling the full spectrum of traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagins, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and gigos, but they are all for tourists.
Goma is a walled city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the east of Passe, Rwanda.
Lava from the 2002 Nyaragongo volcano destroyed Goma, closing most of the city's streets and alleys, especially the inner city.
While Goma is well-secure, anyone traveling outside Goma should still be well-informed to understand the situation of the fighting that is going on in North Kivu province.
The city is also the base for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking in Africa as well as climbing the Nyaragongo volcano.
To get around Goma, one can take a Bodo-Bodo (motorcycle taxi). The usual fare for a small car is 500 Congolese francs.
Along with its relative impenetrability, "Timbuktu" has come to be used as a metaphor for foreign, distant lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, although its reputation makes Agora a tourist attraction, and Agora has an airport.
In 1990, Agora was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the major stops during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special Wonders of the African World.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as Agora has a more Arab nature than an African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border of Mozambique to the east, the border of Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern boundary is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 distinct ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the Agora South African National Park (SanParks).
All South African national parks have a daily conservation and entrance fee for the park, Nane.
Buying a wild card can also be beneficial for anyone, providing access to South Africa or a selection of any one of the South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a spectacular bar chart illustrated by the presence of Victoria Harbor's waters.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to the opposite Kowloon waterfront.
Much of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is where the British colonists settled and so if you are looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundaras are the world's largest coastal mangrove belt, extending 80 km (50 mi) from the coast into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterlands.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not merely mangrove swamp though - the Agora contains some of the last remaining stands of the mighty forest that once covered the Gangetic plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one-third is contained in water/marshland areas.
Sundaran has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal Tigers and about 30,000 cheetah deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and those heading to Jakarta/Boomthang depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable means of traveling to nearby places such as Parro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and the Agora has two lanes 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres.Construction was completed in August 2011, it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when Brazil's customs checkpoint is expected to be finished.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group living in what is now eastern Paraguay, remaining as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycur and the Payagua, who escaped from hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "Great Province of the Indies", was born as a result of the encounter of Spanish conquerors with native indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of the Assunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Polo Field in Las Canitas.
At other times of the year, smaller tournaments and matches can also be seen here.
For news of the tournament and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see Associados Argentinos de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland is the Falkland pound (FKP) with a value set equal to one British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands that is located at FIC West Store in Stanley.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere in the islands and within Stanley credit cards and the United States dollar is also often accepted.
Credit cards may not be accepted on outlying islands, although British and United States currency may be taken; check with the owner beforehand to determine what is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it has summer there when it has winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely go below freezing, but air and humidity add to the feeling of cold compared to an aurora thermometer.
There are no particular "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rainfall remains almost the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wildlife is wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park officials, be at least 100 yards/m from bears and wolves and 25 yards/m from all other wild animals!
No matter how tame they look, bison, elk, moose, bears and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they do not keep proper distances. These animals are large, wild and potentially dangerous, so give them their place.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep a clean camp.
Apia is the capital of Samoa.The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser sank; about 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the freedom struggle organized by the Mou Movement, a peaceful rally in the city resulted in the assassination of the supreme leader Tupou Tamasie Leilofi III.
Auckland has many beaches due to the expansion of its two ports, and three beaches are the best in the era.
The North Shore stretches across the Pacific Ocean from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
All of these sandy beaches are safe for swimming, and most have sheltered trees.
Tamaki Drive is on the beach at Wetematta Harbour, in the upmarket suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with many shops on the shore and swimming is essential for safety.
The main local beer is 'Number One', not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing.
There are many French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines can travel better.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but bottled water is easier to find if you are afraid.
The idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign to Australians. A small black 'espresso', high in cappuccino with cream (not jam), and tea without milk is served.
Hot chocolate conforms to the Belgian standard.The fruit juices are expensive but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries to any of the agoras on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, take advice from the authorities, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near the beach and river mouths north of 1770, from October to April. They can sometimes be found outside of this time.
Sharks exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the sea, their primary habitat being at the mouth of the North River from Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that once they reach their destination they will have nowhere else to sleep.
Travel agents often have deals with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other types of accommodation such as camping grounds through your travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transport arrangements to/from the airport or even combined flights and hotel packages.
They may also reserve for you if you need time to think about your offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) for your destination.
However no modifications or requests should be made first through the travel agent rather than directly with the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of concert attendees decide to camp on site, and most attendants consider Agora an important part of the experience.
If you want to get close to that action, you'll have to hurry to get a camping site close to the music.
Remember that even if the music has ended at the main stage, there may be parts of the celebration that continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If crossing the North Baltic in winter, check the cabin location, as passing through the snow makes quite a terrible noise for those most affected.
A cruise to St. Petersburg includes time in the city.Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually make numerous efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests.Winds and clocks are usually absent, and getting out can be difficult.
They usually have special food, drink, and entertainment offerings to keep guests in a good mood and keep them on the premises.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages at home.However, alcohol interferes with decision making, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying calm.
Anyone who is driving at high latitudes or mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice or cold temperatures.
There is less friction on icy and icy roads and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get you stuck.
Visibility may also be restricted by snow falling or blowing or condensation or snow on the vehicle's window.
On the other hand, snowy and snowy conditions are common in many countries, and traffic runs mostly uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and is an attraction for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to underground trips to see the amazing African wildlife, especially the Savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, get close to cars and standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with a telescope.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk", "hiking safari", or "footing") consists of a long walk, either lasting a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will take place from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo hosting the Games in 1964 would be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most coronavirus-based cancellation policies as of the end of March do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000, with typical tickets costing around 7,000.
Ironing wet cloth can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loans, even if none are present in the room.
If iron is not available, or if one does not like to wear iron socks, one may try using a hair dryer when available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burning).
There are various methods of purifying water, some more effective against specific threats.
Boiling water for one minute is sufficient in some areas, requiring several minutes in others.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are not familiar with in their home region.
Insects can spoil food, cause burns, or worse than agora can cause allergies, spread poisons, or spread infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can forcibly injure or kill people, usually do not qualify as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to do some shopping at certain locations and buy goods exempt from excise duty.
Travellers bound for heavily taxed countries can sometimes save considerable amounts of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently passes through distinct backwoods.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your wits about you: steep grades, narrow alleys and sharp turns prevail.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than the previous and subsequent sections - typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) - and their strict compliance is even more important than otherwise.
Funnily enough, however, Izza's mobile phone service is much stronger than many other parts of the route, e.g. the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and in Bavaria, like its southern neighbor, Austria, is quite rich and varied.
Fruit pastries are common, apples are cooked in pastries year-round, and cherries and plums make their appearance during the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other tree nuts.The popular cake is often paired particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
So if you want something smaller but rich pastry, try what is called a berliner, puffancuchen or craffen, depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a huge variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without further qualifier, the term basically means food from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine has a range of typically seasoned dishes, the predominant flavours being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The rack is the support for the rider's legs that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider but they may have safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck.
If a rider is thrown from a horse, but his or her legs become trapped in the rope, the horse may be dragged if it runs away. To reduce this risk, several safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a chicken, fairly narrow, sole.
Later, some cages, especially English cages, have safety bars that allow a rider to fall off the cage when pulled backwards by a falling leather rider.
Cochamo Valley - Chile's premier climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its large granite walls and crags of various types.
The summit includes enticing views from the summit.Mountaineers from all parts of the world are constantly establishing new routes among the endless potential of the Agora Wall.
Downhill snowports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving skis or snowboards connected to the feet of the whales, sliding across snow-covered terrain.
Skiing is a major travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes referred to as "ski bumms", planning a whole holiday around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians in 1861.
Backpacking by ski: This activity is called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
These are related but usually do not involve alpine style ski touring or mountaineering, the latter being done in standing terrain and requiring very stiff skis and shoes.
Think of a skiing trail as an equally long hiking trail.
Under good conditions the AHA will be able to cover a little more distance than walking - but very rarely will the AHA-ready track get the speed of cross country skiing without heavy backpacks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but with many independent countries.In normal circumstances, travelling through several countries means having to go through visa application and passport control many times.
However, the Schengen Zone acts somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you live in these areas, you can generally cross the border without passing through a passport control post.
Likewise, by having a Schengen visa, there is no need to apply for a visa separately for each of the Schengen member countries, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for what constitutes an antique.Some tax agencies define items older than 100 years as antiques.
There are geographical variations in the definition, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicraft products can be defined as antiques, although they are smaller than similarly large-scale produced objects.
