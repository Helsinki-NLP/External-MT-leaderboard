This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, an already widespread theory, but provides details that fossils cannot usually provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were brownish brown on the top and pale or carotenoid on the bottom.
This discovery also provides a better understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a fully developed stem, called the spine, but do show other features of feathers  beards and barbels , researchers have concluded that the spine was probably a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used for flight but rather for temperature regulation or display. e researchers suggested that even though this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult plumage and not the down of a chick.
Scientists say that while it is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the specimen reveals a feather that belongs to an adult, not a juvenile.

The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter in the galaxy and the dark matter in the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts a pull on the earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around a galaxy is in a kind of halo, and is made up of a large number of small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experiment: voters isolate themselves in a booth, put a pre-printed sheet of paper in an envelope indicating the candidate of their choice.
After the officers have verified his identity, the voter throws the envelope into the ballot box and signs his voter card.

Candidates can send representatives to assist with each step of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under close supervision, according to specific procedures.

The road where the accident occurred was temporarily blocked to allow emergency services to extract the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since been charged with her son's murder by the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in custody awaiting trial, but eyewitness accounts could be compromised because her portrait has been widely circulated.
This is a common practice elsewhere in the UK, but Scottish justice works differently and courts have found that posting photos is potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson, of the University of Dundee, notes that  journalists seem to be following a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc., of suspects.
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is in charge of the entire prosecution, has told reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the indictment.
According to the leak, the document will deal with the border dispute that Palestine claims on the basis of the existing borders before the 1967 Middle East war.
Other matters discussed included the future State of Jerusalem, which was holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years from the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority only agrees for five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control test had to be closely monitored by rangers, as the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Through a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting head of park and heritage conservation at NPWS, the four shooters assigned to the first slaughter campaign were properly trained and instructed in safety.
Martelly inaugurated a new provisional electoral council (CEP) consisting of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth ERP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to put the country on the path to new elections.
This commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
These sometimes violent protests were triggered by the absence of elections, some of which were due to take place in 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating of faulty iPods were reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents involving these aircraft.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling it  really regrettable  that Apple postponed the report.
The earthquake struck the Marianas at 7:19 a.m. local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said no damage had been reported in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no sign of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six of them have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly lady who needed to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career as a doctor.
He trained as an obstetrician, and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began investigating preterm births in his spare time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was given, it would speed up the baby's lung maturation.
Xinhua news agency reported that government investigators recovered two flight recorders (or  black boxes ) on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said:  Luna was the first queen of extreme.  My first manager.  Luna died on the night of the second moon.  A unique moment, just like her.  A strong woman. 
Dustin  Goldust  Runnels commented that  Luna was as weird as I was... if not even more... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she rests in a better place. 
A survey of 1,400 people before the 2010 federal election found that the number of people opposed to Australia becoming a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those polled share this view, and want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch to rule Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was questioned.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain, as these were banned in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the earth, as well as organic matter that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, and especially how the Earth formed, since comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors  gossip and political nonsense .
He is believed to be running for president in 2016.
According to the FAA, NextGen is a system that would allow aircraft to fly shorter distances and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, limiting carbon emissions.
It is based on satellite technology, not on the ground-based radar systems used previously, which allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more detailed information.
Additional transport is non-existent and surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and relay parks are not available on the ground.
The fear of lack of transportation has led to the possibility that the match could be played behind closed doors, without the supporters of the teams.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the genesis of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, although this process was estimated to be much longer, following the breeding between the endemic Darwin finch, Geospiza fortis, and the migratory conical-billed finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped in many ways.
It can be pulled into a fine thread, which can be twisted and braided, hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin, and glued onto another metal. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images in books called  illuminated manuscripts .
You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The colour of the cabbage juice changes according to the acidity or basicity (alkalinity) of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H in pH) present in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of their electron (since hydrogen atoms are made up of a proton and an electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then, with clean, wet hands, press them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will induce a strange sensation and produce a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with a water main in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, too, there were toilets, and in Roman civilization, the bathroom was sometimes part of the public baths where men and women could gather.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite receives the call in space and sends it back to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in many ways, but the biggest benefit it has brought us is that it has made transportation much simpler and faster.
This brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below are more medium-sized felines that eat similarly medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and other deer.
In addition, many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) eat much larger prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of niche, a special task assigned to each cat, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable of cats, living in large groups called packs.
The herds consist of one to three adult male lions, as well as about 30 females and cubs.
Women are usually very close to each other, with a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion troops act like pack wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not to other big cats) in their behavior, and also very lethal to their prey.
A balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (but sometimes with difficulty), swim, jump great distances, and trail with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is part of the same family (genus Panthera) as the lions, leopards and jaguars.
The roar of the tiger is not like the loud roar of the lion, but rather a phrase that would be a scream and a roar.
The ocelots are fond of small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if they can. Almost any animal the ocelot hunts is much smaller than it.
Scientists say that ocelots hunt and find prey by sniffing, or sniffing, their way across the ground.
They have excellent night vision and are also very stealthy, tracking prey by merging into their environment before jumping on it.
When a small group of living things (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (for example, if it moves over a mountain range or a river, or if it moves to a new island so that it cannot easily return), it often finds itself in a different environment than it was before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need new characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor to what it needed before.
The original population has not changed at all, it still needs the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, it begins to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be considered to be of the same species.
We call this process  speciation , which simply means the formation of new species.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhale).
Plants produce their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We make our homes and our clothes from plants, and most of the food we eat is from plants.
The mosasaur was the super predator of the time, he feared nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had over 70 sharp razor blades, plus a series of additional teeth in the palate, so that nothing in its path could escape.
We can't be sure, but he may have had a forked tongue, his diet included turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, and he may even have been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex was no match for it.
Although the Romans ate the food we know today, they ate some strange or unusual feast foods, including wild boars, peacocks, snails, and the loach, a type of rodent.
Another difference was that while the poor and the woman ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have banquets together where they would rest on their side while they ate their meals.
Ancient Roman meals could not include the foods of American or Asian origin that were introduced to Europe centuries later.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the god's dwelling place.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivities.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Some pyramidal towers, ziggurats, were sometimes built as elements of a temple.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the hot climate of the Middle East, the home was not so important.
Most of the Hebrew family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard; stores were just open counters facing the street.
Since there were few large forests in the land of Canaan, the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and in Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, that he found Greenland and named it after it, while travelling further west.
But regardless of who discovered it, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although each country is  Scandinavian , there are many differences between the people, kings, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie Benjamin Gates and the Templar Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is an inscription on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
The back of the Declaration of Independence read  Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776 . The text is at the bottom of the document, backwards.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its early stages, the large parchment (about 29 inches by 24 inches) was stored rolled up.
So it is likely that the notation was added simply as a label.
The D-Day landings and the ensuing battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
It was ruled by the Vichy French, Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupier instead of confronting him.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies landed in southern France, an invasion called Operation  Dragoon.
Within two weeks, the Americans and the Free French Forces had liberated southern France and were moving toward Germany.
A civilization is a singular culture shared by a large group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The term  civilization  is derived from the Latin word  civilis , meaning civil and which is related to the Latin words  civis , meaning citizen, and  civitas , meaning large city or city-state and which also indicates, in a way, the size of the society to which it refers.
A civilized culture involves the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a lasting cultural footprint and equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government  with Congress being its sole component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and as there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on the often uncooperative state authorities to enforce all its acts.
Nor did it have the power to derogate from the laws on taxes or customs duties between States.
The Articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italy national football team is, along with the German national team, the second most successful team in the world and it won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians taking part in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Because of the group of islands that make up Japan, it is often referred to geographically as an  archipelago.
The first information about Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European navigators passing through it referred to it as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, introducing a transformation of indigenous grain production practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared it a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is made up of three main structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Hall of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings bordering the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better view of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and this restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of photography in the world is 35 mm; it was the most common film format at the end of the analogue film era.
It's still made today, but what's important is that its image format is inherited from the format of the digital camera's photo sensor.
The 35 mm format is actually, and this is quite disconcerting, 36 mm wide by 24 mm high.
Thus, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest of the whole-number ratios) is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family) are equal to or close to this aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is often abused and ridiculed, is a simple directive that gives life to the people and protects their image.
It states that the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was challenged.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has united European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power touched everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's monetary funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over 1,000 years and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether this doctrine was being respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy has proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although the blockade has violated generally accepted international law and has been codified in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from venturing into entire sea areas, thus posing a threat even to neutral ships.
This tactic was met with a timid reaction, and Germany expected a similar reaction to its unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, most citizens and nations showed a tendency toward pacifism and isolation.
After seeing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations desired to prevent such a situation from occurring again.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four hundred in his name, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of showing the different eras; each stage of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
The most well-known of these periods is the Three Kingdoms period which ran for 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During these periods, fierce struggles took place between many members of the nobility who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in battle to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political repercussions such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
So after the Revolution, the jobs were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and talented to succeed.
The same is true of the army, for the ranking of armies is no longer based on class, but on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working classes in other countries to start their own revolution.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that went beyond the scope of this worldly life. He used to frequent a cave that became famous as  Hira' on the mountain of  Noor (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which survived the time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists.
From the top, you can only see the clear, beautiful sky and the many mountains around it.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians during the third millennium B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many giant structures erected in honor of deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or  necropolis of Giza, in the Valley of the Dead in Egypt, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the most imposing), several smaller tombs, many temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor his wives and family members.
The symbol  push  looks like a V and the symbol  pull  looks like a staple or a square with the bottom side missing.
The top means you have to start at the tip and push the arrow, and the bottom means you have to start at the top (which is where your hand holds the arrow) and shoot the arrow.
A bow upward usually produces a softer sound, while a bow downward is louder and more assertive.
Feel free to write your own marks on the pencil, but remember that the printed marks are for a musical motif and should therefore generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4) and the king's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were all terrified and forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of saleswomen.
They rode back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people screaming and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The king and queen were forced to open the windows of their carriages because of the crowd.
At one point, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover much of the expenses and interest on bonds issued on behalf of the Philippine government by Wall Street banking institutions.
Naturally, the super profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people could be the fundamental advantages of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
These events took place in the period generally considered to be the High Middle Ages  period of European history running from the 11th to the 13th century (1000-1300).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the High Middle Ages and followed by the Lower Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, ranging from the technological push or technological imperative to a strict sense that the fate of humanity is dictated by an underlying logic related to scientific laws and their manifestation in technologies.
Most interpretations of technological determinism agree on two general ideas: technological development itself takes place in a process far beyond cultural and political influences, and technology affects societies that are intrinsically rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it could be said that the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for a handful of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The mass ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the healthcare field to treat personal injuries.
Romanticism featured an important element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Romanticism theorized that geography shaped individuals and that, in time, customs and culture linked to geography would emerge, which, in harmony with the places occupied by society, would be preferable to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD, and lasted until about 1100.
Its status declined during the 12th century, mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, with which the Byzantine markets could hardly compete.
It was at this time that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its zenith between the 11th and 14th centuries.
At first, the dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow pace of communication, Western fashions could be 25 to 30 years behind.
During the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest advances of the time, following the Crusades, was the use of buttons for closing clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is agriculture that is practiced to produce enough food to meet only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic, system using preserved seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal norms and who share the same ideas, which allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The criteria that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging by a distinctive and symbolic use of style, which encompasses fashions, mannerisms, and slang.
One of the most common ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to draw on the few unfortunate cases of children who, through neglect, misfortune or willful abuse, were not socialized by adults during their childhood.
Some wild children were locked up by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child was due to the parents' rejection of a severe intellectual or physical disability the child suffered from.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or fled.
Some would have been raised by animals; some would have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman species, wild children display behaviors (within the limits of their physical dispositions) almost identical to those of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
While project pedagogy should make learning easier and more interesting, support goes further.
Support is not a method of learning but rather a means of helping learners who are discovering a new teaching such as using a new curriculum or starting a new project.
The support can be both virtual and real, so a teacher is a form of support, but the little trombone man in Microsoft Office is one too.
The virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended to question, guide and explain procedures that might have been too difficult for the learner to handle alone.
Children are placed in foster homes for a wide variety of reasons, from neglect to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring and educational, but it is.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system is supposed to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education and reliable health care.
The placement in foster care is intended to provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which they were previously taken.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to use and gratification.
For example,  learning  and  socialization  are considered to be major factors in Internet use (James et al., 1995).
 Personal involvement  and  ongoing relationships  were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to major discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, that is, facial expressions in milliseconds.
One claim is that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to assess sincerity accurately.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behaviour may be found in animals such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two reservoirs of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the reservoir of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination cause variations between the two basins to alternate with each generation.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure to respond to such a response can have serious consequences - growth disorders, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The most readily available plant resources are protein in leaves and legumes, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods - ants, termites, eggs - are easy to digest and provide a large amount of protein, containing all the vital amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their  protein problem  in a way that is a bit like what chimpanzees in the savannah do today.
Interrupted sleep is the process of intentionally waking during your sleep period and falling asleep shortly afterwards (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock, to bring you back to consciousness without you being completely awake.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be placed across the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based possibilities include drinking plenty of fluids before sleeping (including water or tea, which are reputed to be diuretics), which forces you to wake up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace of a person is in contrast to the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the stress, the more positive the life force present, and the more opportunity there is for everyone to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing standing in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but has been enriched by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, and it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the way of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the deity, and it is through the visualization of different deities that the energy channels are cleared, the chakras activated, and the consciousness of awakening is created.
Germany was a common enemy during World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. By the end of the war, deep conflicts between their different systems, methods and cultures had ended the understanding between the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and see real fighting, through surrogate armies, on battlefields as far away as Africa and Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defenses were already broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
But these plans became obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army arrived and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, as well as other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way of moving large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the Marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country retains the ability to move your people and your property, while interfering with your enemy's ability to move their people and their property.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II, when the Americans tried to get troops and equipment across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany probably could have conquered Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping them close to them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skins.
Domestic goats were usually kept in flocks that roamed the hills or other pastures, often cared for by goatherds who were mostly children or teenagers, similar to the more common term for shepherds.
 wagonways  were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriageways were simply made of parallel planks of wood, they allowed the horses pulling them to reach higher speeds and pull larger loads than on the slightly more bumpy roads of the day.
The crossbars were introduced early enough to keep the runways in place, but it was gradually realized that the runways would be more effective if fitted with a strip of iron on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the first iron rails appeared.
The very first means of locomotion was walking: humans began walking standing up two million years ago with the arrival of Homo erectus ( straight man).
Their predecessors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright as they used to.
Bipedal specialisations are found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus could walk on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start by living in better harmony with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even campaign to alleviate the suffering that is coming.
In many cases, it is symptomatic treatment, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problem and deactivate it.
Clearly, the world has changed a lot because of the scientific and technological advances made by human beings, and the problems have become more serious because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of mankind.
After it was passed by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent a few blocks away to John Dunlap's printing house.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as  Dunlap Broadsides.
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on 6 July, who had it read to his troops in New York on 9 July.
The 25 Dunlap sheets that are known to still exist are the oldest copies of the document.
Many paleontologists now believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive.
Few people consider them dinosaurs, given that they have wings and can fly.
But there are still many things about birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have legs covered in scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on their two hind legs like T-Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits to use computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent, and symptoms, such as vomiting, are sufficiently general that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of internal poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic medicines or household chemicals.
See the label for first aid instructions specific to this poison.
The term  insect  is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
The term is derived from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, which are highly adapted insects to parasitize humans.
Like bed bugs, bed bugs are nest-forming, that is, they are adapted to live in their host's nest or habitat.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may feel that it is not in their best interests or the child's best interests to take on the responsibility of raising a baby.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, which guides most scientific research.
However, it is not the only one, experimentation, and an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, ask questions and make observations, but also guides scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on ancient texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were widely accepted.
With the decline of Greek knowledge, the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many of the rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue a cycle of operation for a certain period of time, even in the absence of external stimulation.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main indications that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They ran two experiments to either tag the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation, the size of the part of the genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while other mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism is of interest to people who wish to visit natural areas in order to enjoy the landscape, especially the fauna and flora.
Hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks and learning about the ecosystem are examples of on-site activities.
For example, you can go and see, photograph and learn about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small towns to work and meet other people who are going to work in the countryside they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this massive carbon-based economy has displaced the biosphere from its stable state that has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why do transport systems generate such complaints, why do they break down every day? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movements of drivers and individual vehicles between two points, and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behaviour of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to operate within a reasonably consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent and can be represented mathematically in an approximate manner.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to escape from their enemies and to find food and companions more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them more small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings are dragonflies and the short-eared bat.
A few thousand years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed otherwise - that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolved around the earth.
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth, carrying more than eight times the volume of water of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes reaching 10 kilometers wide.
As much as 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main branch of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, the Giza pyramids were never surpassed in size and technical excellence in their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which were well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has about 800 inhabitants, making it the smallest independent country in the world, and the least populated.
Vatican City writes its legislation and official communications in Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
The citizens of Vatican City are all Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have been familiar with basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper because they occur in nature in raw form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements - earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, he was concerned with the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also proposed that these latter transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Alloys also exist that contain a small amount of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it first came out.
Unfortunately, the emergence of new writing styles has relegated the pen to a more confidential status and to less common uses.
People now type messages on computer screens, without ever having to go near a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what the keyboard will become when the next innovation comes along.
The fission bomb works on the following principle: it converts energy by assembling a nucleus of myriads of protons and neutrons.
It's like moving a heavy cart up a hill, splitting the core again, then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, so they tend to break up with little or no pressure.
The surface of the moon is made of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km on the hidden side.
It is thinner at sea level and thicker below the continents.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories are centered around finding out what makes people feel good or attracted to something.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature into adulthood.
These theories look at what makes some people want the things they do and what in their environment makes them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when a manager becomes the leader of former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain  the good friend  (or the good girlfriend).
This type of manager has a hard time making unpopular decisions, conducting disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, delegating responsibilities, and holding others accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that he/she must change everything the group has created up to now and do things his/her way.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the team's success and failure.
This often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often function as the point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members because their teams can meet based on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a real  invisible team  (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of a virtual team.
The  invisible team  is the management team to which each member is accountable.
Why would an organisation want to impose the tedious process of creating a learning structure?One of the objectives of implementing organisational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in the functional departments of an organisation, creativity and ingenuity can be fully expressed.
Therefore, the process of an organisation working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to meet the customer's need.
Before an organisation can be innovative, its management must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge and its own culture of learning.
Angel (2006) presents the Continuum approach as a method used to help organisations achieve better results.
Neurobiological data provide material evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and therefore allow the research field to be narrowed down and made much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, injury, tumours and trauma affect behaviour and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI is often strongly associated with science fiction, it represents a very important part of computer science that studies machine behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation.
Artificial intelligence research aims at automating tasks by machines that require an intelligent approach.
Examples include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnostics and customer questions, and handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These practices have led to distinct disciplines, focused on providing solutions to problems of daily life.
The AI system is now often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering and the military, as it has been implemented in several home computer and video game software.
Excursions are an integral part of any school classroom.Many times a teacher would like to take his pupils to places where a bus trip is not possible.
The solution is technology in the form of virtual educational outings, where students can look at ancient artifacts in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire a beautiful work of art while sitting with their class.
Practically taking part in a field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share your experiences with future generations.
For example, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their visit to the state capital, which is updated annually, but the old versions are kept online as an album.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills. Although students often try blogging with a neglected grammar and spelling, having an audience usually makes a difference.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog writer starts working on improving his writing to avoid criticism.
In addition, blogging  forces students to become more aware of the world around them . The need to arouse public interest motivates students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that stimulates collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning well beyond the traditional school day.
"When used properly, blogs 'can help students to develop their analytical and critical thinking skills: by actively responding to online content, they can compare their opinions with those of others and express their own views on specific topics' (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital and has a wealth of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls and to the north, the area of pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and its surroundings.
All these and many other measures make Ontario what foreigners consider the quintessence of Canada.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited in the wild.
For a comparison of the population that may surprise many: There are more African Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the coast of East Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest country, and even a continent in its own right, in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known for being luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought the practice of Islam to the land and this religion was widely spread in Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route, which connected Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should say she is married, regardless of her marital status.
It is also advisable to wear a ring (not too expensive).
Women need to realize that certain cultural differences can lead to behaviours they consider harassment, such as being followed, being held, etc.
Be firm in rejecting male advances, and don't be afraid to hold on (cultural differences or not, doesn't mean it's acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the tenth century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese, who had destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, finally abandoned it in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and it was renamed Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in all of Morocco to shop.
Around the old medina, you can easily find places to buy traditional Moroccan products, such as tajines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs and trinkets of all kinds, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town located in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano that buried most of the city streets, especially the city center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside Goma should be researched to understand the state of ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province.
The city is also the starting point for the ascent of Nyiragongo Volcano as well as for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla tracking treks in Africa.
You can use boda-boda (motor taxi) to get around Goma.The normal (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for faraway and exotic countries.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990 it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites in Danger, due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stages of Henry Louis Gates'  Wonders of the African World  show on PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it has an Arab rather than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
The total area of the park is 19 500 km2, and it is divided into 14 ecozones, each with a specific fauna.
It is one of the most popular amusement parks in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily entrance and conservation fees for the park.
It can be beneficial to obtain a Wild Card which gives access to some parks in South Africa, as well as all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the main attraction for many tourists.
The row of buildings that line the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to a glittering bar chart, reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, leave the island and head for the Kowloon waterfront opposite.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on the flatlands of the north shore.
This is the place where the British settlers invested, so it seems to me a good place to start if you're looking for evidence of the colonial past of this area.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest belt of coastal mangroves, stretching for 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not just mangrove swamps. They also contain some of the last remnants of the majestic jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3 850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water/marshland areas.
Sundarbans has been a nature reserve since 1966, and you can find about 400 royal Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses leave from the Inter-District Bus Station (located on the other bank) throughout the day, but most, especially those serving the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6.30 and 7.30 am.
Buses between districts are often full, so it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, comfortable and robust Japanese ferries.
Public taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cantilever bridge that spans the Oyapock River connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 meters high, 378 meters long, and have two lanes of 3.5 meters wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres. The structure was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the largest indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters and also practicing subsistence agriculture.
Other indigenous tribes in the Chaco, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, relied primarily on fishing, hunting, and gathering.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once called  the giant province of the Indies , was born from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous people.
The Spanish began the colonial period, which lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best teams and among the best polo players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo grounds of Las Cañitas.
In addition, smaller tournaments and matches are sometimes held here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, see the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Islands pound (FKP) which is equivalent in value to one pound sterling (GBP).
Cash can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley, across the street from the FIC West store.
The pound sterling is a currency commonly accepted throughout the islands, while in Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
Credit cards are not likely to be accepted on the nearby islands, although British and US currencies may be.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falklands money outside the islands, so change it before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, winter in the northern hemisphere corresponds to summer there and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical zone and summer temperatures of over 30 °C are common.
Winter can be deceptively cold - temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it seem colder than the thermometer says.
There are no real rainy and dry seasons: rainfall is almost constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild; please do not feed or disturb them.
According to park officials, you must stay at least 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
As docile as they may seem, bison, moose, moose, bear and almost any large animal can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they didn't keep enough distance.
Also, be aware that odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food that smells and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on Upolu Island and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Britain refused to leave the port.
All but one British cruiser was sunk, and nearly 200 American and German sailors lost their lives.
Tupua's supreme leader Tamasese Lealofi III was assassinated during a peaceful rally in the town during the Mau movement's independence struggle.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is within walking distance of two ports, the most popular of which are in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and extend from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most are shaded by pohutukawa.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located on the Waitemata Harbour in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These beaches, which are often popular with families, have many shops along the coast, and swimming is safe.
The main local beer is  Number One , a rather ordinary but tasty and refreshing beer.
There are many French wines to taste, but New Zealand and Australian wines may travel better.
You can drink the local tap water safely, but you can easily find bottled water if you are worried about it.
For Australians, the idea of a  cream coffee  is foreign. A short black is an  espresso , the cappuccino is filled with cream (no foam), and the tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is Belgian, fruit juices are expensive but delicious.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, obey all the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
From October to April, in the north of 1770, box jellyfish arrive near beaches and river estuaries, and they can also sometimes be spotted outside this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most of them are afraid of humans and would avoid them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their main habitat being in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation, such as camping areas, through travel agencies.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport or even packages that combine flight and accommodation.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other necessary documents for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any changes or requests must be made to the travel agent first and not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, the vast majority of participants decide to camp on site, and most consider this to be an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be a part of the musical event up close, you're going to have to get there early to find a good campground.
Please note that even if the music performances are over on the main stages, other musical performances may continue until late at night at other festival venues.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, be sure to check the location of the hut, as crossing the ice can cause unbearable noise in the most exposed huts.
Cruise ships to St. Petersburg include time spent in the city.
Casinos generally make a lot of efforts to maximize time and money spent by customers.They rarely have windows and clocks, and exits can be difficult to spot.
They usually offer special food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests happy and stay in their seats.
In some places, the locals offer free alcoholic beverages, but drunkenness can affect judgment, and all good gamblers know that it is vital to stay sober.
Anyone who travels by car to high latitudes or over mountain passes must be aware of the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snow-covered roads, there is little friction and you cannot drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During blizzards, there can be enough snow to block you in a very short time.
Visibility may also be limited by snowfall or dust or by condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal in many countries, and traffic is virtually uninterrupted all year round.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most memorable time for many visitors.
In common parlance, the term  safari  refers to a trip to the African land, and especially to the savannah, to witness the spectacular spectacle of wild animals in their environment.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars and standard equipment makes it possible to observe them well.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a bushwalk, hiking safari, or footing) is a hike, either for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, after hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation in 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may be facing a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March, most coronavirus-based cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have ironing irons and ironing boards that can be borrowed, even if they are not available in the rooms.
If you don't have an iron or don't feel like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hair dryer, if you can find one.
Avoid allowing the fabric to overheat (which can cause it to shrink or in extreme cases, burn).
There are various methods of water purification, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some places, boiling water is sufficient for one minute; in others, it takes several minutes.
The efficiency of filters varies, and if you have a concern, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests unknown to them in their home region.
Parasites can contaminate food, cause irritation, or in the most severe cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are not generally considered parasites.
In some places, duty-free shops offer the opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travellers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcohol or tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Freeway, frequently passing through isolated backcountry terrain.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep an open mind. Steep slopes, narrow lanes, and tight curves are common.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and subsequent sections  generally 35 to 40 mph (56-64 km/h)  and their strict adherence is even more important than before.
But, oddly enough, mobile service is much stronger here than on many other parts of the road, for example the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those in their southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common: apples are baked and baked in the pastry all year round, while cherries and plums are the highlight of summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts.Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of tight coffee.
If you want small but hearty pastries, try Berliner Bälle, also called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
A curry dish can be either  solid  or  liquid , depending on how much sauce it contains.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
Indonesia has 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without any other qualifier, the term tends to refer to foods from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a range of simply seasoned dishes, with the predominant flavors that Javanese prefer being peanuts, peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The straps are the legs of the rider, hanging on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the user, but they can pose a safety problem: the user's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged if the horse runs away.
First, most riders wear riding boots with a smooth heel and a fairly narrow sole.
Second, some saddles, such as the British, have safety bars that allow a strap to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley  The premier climbing destination in Chile, known as South America's Yosemite, with many large walls and different granite cliffs.
From the top of the mountains, the view is breathtaking, and climbers around the world are constantly discovering new and accessible paths on the slopes, where the possibilities are endless.
Winter downhill sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve skating down a snow-covered track with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity that has many aficionados, sometimes called  ski bums , who organize their entire holidays based on skiing in specific locations.
The idea of skiing is very old: cave paintings showing skiers date back to some 5,000 years B.C.
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century; the first recreational ski club was founded in 1861 in Australia by Norwegians.
Skiing: This activity is also called Nordic skiing, cross-country skiing or skiing.
This is similar to alpine skiing and mountaineering, but does not generally include these activities, which are performed on rough terrain and require the use of much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions you can cover slightly longer distances than on foot  but you will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on paved slopes.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has many independent countries, so under normal circumstances travelling through several countries means having to apply for several visas and undergo several passport checks.
The Schengen area, however, functions somewhat like a single country in this respect.
As long as you are in this area, you can usually cross the borders without going through passport control points.
Similarly, by having a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa separately for each of the Schengen countries, which saves time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of whether an artifact is an antique, and some tax authorities define antiques as items that are more than 100 years old.
The criteria vary from place to place; in some parts of the world, such as North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Handmade products can be considered antiques, even if they are younger than similar industrial products.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood for the Sami and the culture surrounding this trade is of great importance for many other professions.
Although traditionally not all Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, they lived off fishing, hunting and other similar activities, while using reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Today, many Sami people are practicing modern trades, and tourism is a major source of income in Lapland, the Sami region.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the term  Gypsy  is often considered pejorative due to its association with negative stereotypes and a distorted image of the Roma people.
If the country you are going to is subject to a travel warning issued by your government, your health insurance abroad or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also get advice from other governments than your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The opinions are only a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general and oversimplified in comparison to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is the generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, serious social upheaval or loss of human life.
Very adverse weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and they can be of many kinds, depending on geographical, topographical and atmospheric characteristics.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and fires are forms and effects of violent weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, tidal waves, and cyclones.
Extreme weather events, regional and seasonal, include cold storms, snowstorms with strong winds, and sand or dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to inquire about the potential for bad weather in the area of destination, as this may affect the routes they are considering.
Anyone who is planning to go to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive vocational training.
A search on the Internet for  Hostile Environment Courses  will probably provide the address of a local business.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
Training normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, lots of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but few publications on war zones.
Travellers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad should ensure that they have valid documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with no gender (X) or documents updated to match the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honour these documents is equally variable.
The search of security checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the post-September 11, 2001 period.
Preoperative transsexuals should not expect to pass the scans while maintaining their privacy and dignity.
Rip currents are currents that return from waves that break on the beach, often on a reef or similar.
Due to the underwater topology, the return flow is concentrated over a few deeper sections, and a rapid current to the deep water can form there.
In most cases, deaths are caused by exhaustion resulting from attempting to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you're out of the stream, getting back in the water isn't any harder than it used to be.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be caught again, and depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted or not, you may want to wait for help.
Reintegration shock occurs earlier than culture shock (the honeymoon phase is shorter), lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have had difficulty adjusting to a new culture may find it even harder to adjust to their own culture.
When you return home from a foreign country, you have already adapted to the new culture and lost some of your native customs.
When you first visited a foreign land, people were probably patient and understanding, knowing that travelers to a new country have to adapt.
People may not anticipate that patience and understanding are needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is one of the most interesting attractions in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and you can see them in silence before the show starts.
The history of sound and light is like a history book.
The Sphinx is placed as the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and have the largest number of research stations and sixteen of them are active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island, with the village of Villa Las Estrellas, is the largest.
Other examples include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The peninsula mountains merge into the plateau and then reappear to form the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountain Range, crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, contains the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which rises to 1,482 feet.
In remote areas where there is no cell phone network, you may have no choice but to use satellite phones.
A satellite phone is not usually a replacement for a mobile phone, since you need to be outside and have a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
It is a service often used by shipping, including pleasure boats, as well as shipping that have remote data and telephony transmission needs.
Your local telephone operator should be able to tell you more about how to connect to this service.
Those who plan a sabbatical year have the opportunity to learn by traveling, and more and more are choosing this opportunity.
This is particularly popular with school leavers, as it allows them to take a year off before university without compromising their studies.
Often, taking a gap year abroad can actually give you better chances of pursuing higher education in your home country.
In general, there is a registration fee for these educational programmes.
Finland is a popular destination for pleasure boating.  The  Land of a Thousand Lakes  also has thousands of islands in the lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht on the islands and lakes.
Although coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed large enough for a yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat capacity of seven or eight people.
Norway, Sweden and New Zealand are in the same situation, but apart from that it is a unique case (in the Netherlands, for example, the figure is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises are characterized by an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means that you can visit the historic city for a few whole days while coming back to sleep on the boat at night.
If you only go ashore on cruise trips, you will not need a separate visa (from 2009).
The city of Berlin, Germany, is mentioned in some brochures for cruises. As you can see by looking at the map above, Berlin is not at all near the sea and no visit to this city is included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a scary experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
There is no shame in it - it is no different from the fears and personal fears that many people experience about other things.
For some, understanding something about how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown or the feeling of not being in control.
Transport companies are well paid for quick deliveries, and often, in the context of urgent repairs, the issue of time is crucial for the documents, goods or spare parts involved.
On some routes, big companies have their own planes, but on other routes and for small companies, there was a problem.
If they had sent goods by air freight, some routes would have taken days to unload and clear customs.
The only way to get it to us faster was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to travel first or business class is to pay a large sum of money for the privilege (or, better yet, to have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as a rule, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
In general, it is useless to seek discounts for business or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know full well that they can count on a certain type of traveler who is willing to pay dearly for the privileges of speed and comfort, and they set their fares knowingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chişinău, the local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Transnistrian Republic in eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
With a population of 3.7 million, Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna is now a thriving, modern commercial center, surrounded by a vast bay and mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass-clad buildings and modern shopping centres are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although the city has an atmosphere more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Eysturoy and houses an unusual octagonal church.
In the cemetery are interesting marble carvings of doves on some tombs.
It is worth a half-hour walk in this fascinating village.
The romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, located in the north, is easily accessible and has become famous among foreigners because of Lord Byron's vivid account of its splendor.
Bus 403 from Scotturb runs regularly to Sintra, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
As you head north, be sure to visit the magnificent Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, a world-famous site for Mary's apparitions.
Remember, you are essentially visiting a mass grave, as well as a site that has almost incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many women and men alive who survived their stay here, and many more who saw their loved ones murdered or killed by forced labor, Jews or non-Jews alike.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves.
Do not deface the site by marking or scratching graffiti on structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half of the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone is able to speak Spanish.
However, most of the signs are in Catalan only, as the law states that it is the first official language.
Yet, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements in the metro are made only in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are announced by an automated system in many languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-centered, rude and arrogant.
Although this stereotype is often incorrect, the best way to get along in Paris is to behave yourself, to act like a good person.
The rough exterior of Parisians evaporates quickly if you show a minimum of courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely forested, mainly with beech, spruce and fir trees, and has a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The country has a wide variety of plant communities due to the diversity of its microclimates, soils and altitude levels.
The area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and great tetras can be seen there, along with many other common species.
When visiting a monastery, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and have their shoulders covered equally.
Most monasteries provide a stella for women who arrive empty-handed, but if you bring your own, and it's brightly colored, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
So should men wear pants that cover their knees.
You can also borrow this garment from the store at the entrance, but since it is not washed after each use, you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and all available condiments, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All names, followed by the word Sie, which means you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is a great way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It can also be said that it makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to know whether a verb or adjective is used in a substantivized form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are the c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the next vowel.
Please also make sure you pronounce  r  and  rr  in a distinct way:  caro  means  expensive , while  carro  means  cart .
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introduction to grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand sentences.
Of course, if you know a Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, those who speak a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough to them that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are generally obsolete today, and remain in place as museums or educational sites.
Because light pollution was not as a concern in their day as it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campus, which are easier to access than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in remote areas where the atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China where plum blossoms were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were organized by the emperor exclusively for himself and other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants look their best when they're in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even one.
If you visit a strictly landscaped garden, sampling  specimens  will also get you kicked out without discussion.
Singapore is generally considered to be an extremely safe place, where it is very easy to get around, and where you can buy almost everything you need once you arrive.
But in the  high tropics  just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to adapt to the heat (always) and strong sunlight (when the sky is clear, which is rarer).
There are also buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Bible patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you are considering is going to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kyriat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a great theme for a holiday.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley or taking a cruise to interesting sites on the Danube or taking a boat along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christendom, celebrating the birth of Jesus.
Many of the customs associated with these holidays have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian lands and by non-Christians worldwide.
It is customary to stay awake at night in an open area to watch the sunrise.
There are of course Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may well be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during Easter weekend, with congregations often bursting into the celebration at midnight to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that have come to these islands have originally done so by water, by swimming or on board floating objects, or by air.
Because of the great distance between them and the mainland, the mammals were unable to complete the journey, making the giant tortoise the main grazing animal of the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you may experience the polar night, when the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good time to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for most of the day.
Since the regions are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be used to.
The costumes are traditional work clothes, and the employees are called by their surnames or by their function.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial because it emphasises collective effort rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often have to get their superiors' agreement for any decision they make and are expected to obey their superiors' instructions without question.
