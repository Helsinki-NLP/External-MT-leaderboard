You don't need to demonize the people of Khabarovsk.
There are hardworking and wonderful people here, - said Mikhail Degtyaryev.

Two Mexican states have declared a state of emergency over Hurricane Hanna.
The Mexican National Civil Defense Administration has declared "orange" (high) levels of alarm in the two eastern states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon over the approaching Hurricane Hanna, TASS reports.

The authorities have prepared about 800 shelters for the population.
There will be 10,000 people helping people, including rescuers, National Guard and military.

Semilyarski against the prosecutor 's office: the cassaction of former vice mayor of Tartu will be considered on August 4
That means the decision on it will likely be made in early September.
The courts of the first two instances refused to hear Semilyarski's claim, but in April his appeal was accepted into proceedings by the State Court.
The Tartu administrative court on 12 December 2019 returned the complaint to the applicant, as its resolution does not fall within the jurisdiction of the administrative court.
The court's order stated that the complaint contained a claim for damages caused during the criminal proceedings.
"These issues should be regulated by the prosecutor's office and the county court", Anette Kreitsmann, spokeswoman for the Tartu courts, told ERR.
According to her, Valvo Semilyarski appealed the ruling to the district court, which on February 5 did not change the decision of the court of first instance.
Now the State Court must say its word.
According to Semilyarski's lawyer, Oliver Niece, his client has been under suspicion of bribery for about two years.
Now he demands that the prosecutor's office disprove the false claims against him and pay him back the moral damage.
The prosecutor's special cases of the Lyuana District Prosecutor's Office, Margus Gross, filed a complaint in October 2017 when Semilyarski was arrested along with then-vice-mayor Tart Artem Suvorov on suspicion of committing several crimes.
"Remember that when I was arrested, the Security Police and the Prosecutor's Office immediately organized a press conference and informed the entire Republic of Estonia that the leaders of the Tartus - one of the most influential bodies of local self-government - were corrupt.
These public suspicions have been with me for about two years.
And now that these allegations and suspicions have turned out to be false, the prosecutor's office doesn't want to say anything about it", Semilyarski commented in early August 2019.
According to Oliver Nieces, at the press conference, the prosecutor went beyond the legal framework that the prosecutor's office should operate in.
"The allegations of bribery and sale were false, but that's not the only problem here.
The European Court of Human Rights, for example, has repeatedly stressed in its rulings on Russia and on Lithuania that at the time of the investigation, state officials should be careful about their choice of words so that suspects are not represented as criminals before sentencing.
The prosecutor's office also has the presumption of innocence, which unfortunately was not respected in this case against Valvo Semilyarski", said Nayez.
"The public presentation of Semilyarski as a serious offender and a briber in circumstances where the facts underlying the suspicion of bribery are still being uncovered is unacceptable, contrary to the presumption of innocence and unfair to the applicant", the lawyer added.
According to rus.err.ee, former vice mayor Tartu Valvo Semilyarski will not be prosecuted for bribery - the criminal case against him was partially closed in July.
At the same time, the former official is being tried for deliberately violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions in particularly large sizes.
According to the indictment, between 2015 and 2017, the former deputy mayor of Tartu participated more than thirty times in the city council meetings when making decisions related to the companies operating in Tartu, with whose owners or managers Semilarski actively communicated on a personal level in extra-work hours.
According to Gross, in all of these cases, Semilyarski had personal interests, and therefore he had to withdraw from participation in decision-making.
Earlier, according to rus.err.ee, the prosecutor's office had raised suspicions of receiving bribes and violating anti-corruption legislation when conducting transactions in particularly large quantities.
This happened in October 2016, when he was arrested along with another deputy mayor Artem Suvorov (Centralist Party).
The prosecutor's office and the security police said they had strong evidence against both vice mayors.
After that, both officials resigned.
The Suvorov case later went to court, which fully vindicated the politician.
The court investigation into the Valvo Semilarski case is still ongoing.

US calls on Qatar and its neighbors to end the dispute
It is necessary to restore trust and unity between Qatar and other countries, says US Special Representative for Iran Brian Hook.
He said the conflict between the emirate and other countries in the region had been going on for too long and was damaging regional interests in stability, prosperity and security.
So far, the United States has tried unsuccessfully to mediate a dispute that Washington views as "a threat to efforts to contain Iran".
Diplomatic relations with Qatar were severed three years ago by the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Bahrain.
They have imposed a transport blockade, accusing Qatar of supporting terrorism.
In response, Doha said the neighbors were simply jealous of Qatar's economic success - according to the IMF, Qatar has been leading the world in per capita GDP for several years.
The emirate is the third largest exporter of natural gas, the sixth largest exporter of natural gas and the largest exporter of oil and petroleum products.

How the decision of the Central Bank to reduce the key rate will affect the economy
The Bank of Russia is expected to lower the key rate again.
It's down another 0.25 percentage points, to 4.25% a year, formally another historic low.
Judging by the return of a short step in the rate cut, as well as the tone of the central bank's statements and updated forecasts on the Russian economy, the regulator looks at the economic outlook more optimistic than before.
This means that the current monetary policy easing cycle may soon be halted.
"We continued to ease monetary policy, primarily taking into account that there are still risks of inflation deviation below 4% in 2021", said Elvira Nabiullina, head of the Bank of Russia.
They are linked to a significant decline in economic activity, a decline in domestic and external demand.
The recovery of the economy, Nabuulina said, will take more than a year and a half.
At the same time, she noted that after the removal of restrictions due to the pandemic, economic processes have been revived: energy consumption, consumer and investment demand have been restored, construction and production of consumer goods have been expanded, the annual rate of decline in transportation and industrial production has slowed.
According to the Central Bank's clarified forecast, in 2020, the economy will shrink by 4,5-5,5% (previously expected 4-6%), while the recovery growth of the economy in 2021 will be 3,5-4,5%, in 2022 - 2,5-3,5%.
In addition, the Bank of Russia revised its forecast for oil prices to $38 and $40 per barrel of Urals in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
The Central Bank had previously expected $27 and $35 a barrel.
Finally, the Bank of Russia's forecast for 2020 inflation was 3.7-4.2% compared to the previously expected 3.8-4.8%.
The Bank of Russia's view of the economic situation is becoming more optimistic, which brings us closer to the end of the mitigation cycle, according to Russian and CIS economists "Renaissance Capital" Sofia Donetsk and Andrei Melachenko.
The Bank of Russia has been steadily lowering the key rate for more than a year, since the beginning of last summer it has dropped by 3.5 percentage points.
And at its last meeting in June, the Central Bank lowered it by one percentage point because of the low inflation rate due to suppressed demand and the need to stimulate the economy that was held back by the pandemic and its related restrictions.
Chances of a monetary policy adjustment remain (at the next meeting on September 18 and until the end of the year), but the limit is already close, according to Rosbank's chief analyst Eugene Koshelev.
The combination of pro-inflation risks also points to the proximity of a pause in the easing of interest rates - disrupted supply chains, potential cost increases due to prevention measures, and a faster (than expected) recovery in demand, he says.
The Bank of Russia's subsequent actions will require more attention to inflationary processes during the harvest season, as well as external volatility, which has increased amid geopolitical conflicts, Kochelev points out.
Either way, the lowering of the key rate will lead to further lower rates for the most reliable borrowers, and possibly also for mortgages, says Maxim Petronevich, senior economist at the analytical management of the Open Bank.
The correction of the rates will be less pronounced than the reduction of the key rate, he says.
The rate of consumer loans could fall by another 0.3-0.6 percentage points during the second half of the year, the rate of mortgages could end the year in the range of 6.2-7%, says Anton Pokotovich, economist at BKS Premier.
He believes that the average interest rate on deposits will also fall - in the coming months it could drop to 4,2-4,5% (now barely above 4,5%).
They could go down to 4 percent if the central bank cuts the key rate in the fall, Pokotovich says.
The centrist party promises to pay off all its debts by the end of the year

"According to today's financial forecasts, the Centre Party is settling its current debts and commitments by the end of this year", said Korb.

Poll: Lithuania's ruling Union of Peasants and "greens" again topped the party rankings
The Lithuanian Union of Peasants and "greens", which heads the ruling coalition of the Seimas, led the party rankings.
This was revealed in a survey conducted by Vilmorus sociological research company after ordering the newspaper Lietuvos rytas.

However, recently Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda, assessing the electoral possibilities of the parties, stated that the Union of Peasants and "greens" after the parliamentary elections this year would probably be able to form a coalition again.
This statement has caused outrage among conservatives.
The last poll showed that if parliamentary elections were held today, 17.6 percent of voters would vote for peasants, and 17.2 percent for conservatives.
According to Vilmorus director Vladas Heydis, the gap is within the margin of error, and yet the ruling party has stopped falling behind the conservatives.
According to Gaidis, the news that their electoral list would be headed by Prime Minister Saul Skvernalis contributed to the "peasants'" social success.
This politician was first on the list of "peasants" and in the 2016 elections.
The Social Democratic Party is in third place, with 7.1 percent of respondents now willing to vote for it.
In a month, she lost 2 percent.
The fourth is the Labour Party, led by Russian businessman Victor Uspassky (6.2 percent).

In the autumn session, the State Duma is scheduled to consider in second reading a draft law setting requirements for the content and composition of the procurement application, which can only be attended by small and medium-sized businesses.
The amendments are being made by the government to the law "On the procurement of goods, works, services by certain types of legal entities".
The bill is designed to implement the roadmap for the implementation of the Strategy for the development of small and medium-sized enterprises in the Russian Federation until 2030, approved by the government.

In the Moscow region, solid waste sites continue to be closed.
This year, the authorities promise to eliminate the latter.
Some of the 39 landfills in the area are being modernized into modern waste treatment complexes.
But this option is not possible for every polygon - many of them have grown up with dense housing.
After the pollination site is closed, it is re-cultivated - the body of the pollination site is flooded with soil, and the desalination and infiltration systems are installed.
This allows the chemical processes inside the landfill to be stopped, so that it does not ignite, cause odor, or poison the soil and groundwater.
And then the old dump stays up a useless pile of debris in the middle of its fallen housing estate.
Why don't we make something useful out of it?
For example, in Rose, where the Annino field has recently been renovated, the authorities are considering making a mountain ski slope.
This field, which operated from 1976 to 2016, expanded beyond the boundaries of the land allocated for it.
So when we were restoring, we had to buy up the neighboring land, which had been covered in garbage for a long time.
"Some time will pass, the field will "settle", build up fortresses, and we'll think about what we can do to make it start to benefit.
It's a mountain ski resort", said Nikolai Parfenov, head of the district of Ruz.
Two sites will be used for renewable energy production
The "Torbeyevo" and "Timohovo" polygons in Lubersko will be sites for the extraction of renewable energy sources from landfill and biological gases.
The Torbeyev gas piston power plant will be operational by the end of the year, producing up to 8 million kilowatt hours of electricity and about 0,95 gigacalories of heat energy per year.
Timokhov will produce 72.5 million kilowatt-hours and continue its activities as a waste treatment complex.
And at the Balashihino "Kucino" field, which was closed after residents complained about the "Direct Line" with the president of the country, a museum could be created.
"It was an idea to create a museum of the re-cultivation of the Moscow city's polygons", said the deputy government minister, environment and natural resources minister, Dmitry Kurakin.
Israel reported a drone crash in southern Lebanon
An Israeli army drone crashed in southern Lebanon.
The military said it collapsed "during operational activity".
The cause of the crash has not been reported.
"Some time ago, during an operational operation near the Lebanese border, an Israeli drone fell on Lebanese territory.
There is no risk of information leakage", the Israeli army tweeted.
Recall that this week the Israeli army decided to strengthen its military units on the border with Lebanon, fearing revenge from the Lebanese Hezbollah movement for killing its fighters in Syria.
Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has promised not to leave the death of any of his "brothers" unanswered.
More on the situation is in the "Israel Waits for Hisbollah's Revenge" column.
The Furgalla switchman first came out to the protesters
The acting governor of the Khabarov region Mikhail Degtyarov for the first time after his appointment came out to the participants of the actions in support of the arrested former head of the region Sergei Furgal.
The meeting was broadcast on his Instagram page.
"Moscow hears everyone, so I sent you a warrant so that the region does not go without power... About Furgal I repeat once again: he "a" - my comrade, "b" - a co-party member, "z" - I am very worried about his fate, the party provides him with help, delivers him products, Zhirinovsky knocks in all the cabinets", - declared the governor's warrant.
According to Degtyarov, now the Khabarovsk region cannot be left without a leader, so he was appointed by the decree of President Vladimir Putin to the position of head of the region so that "the remarkable building (the government of the region) functioned, everything worked, the budget was spent on social needs".
The governor's deputy explained that he had not gone to the protesters before because he could not communicate with thousands of protesters.
So he's running social media and reading all the comments.
On July 25, two protests were held in Khabarovsk.
Protests in support of the former governor have been taking place in the region since July 11.
On the eve of the next action, Mikhail Degtyarov announced that he would leave the city on the day of the rally.
His cortege was stopped by protesters and called for an opinion on the fate of the arrested former governor Furgall.
Degtyarov has previously refused to go to the participants.
"There's more to the head than going out and talking to people who are screaming under the windows", the governor said.

What connected the Vatican to Nazi Germany
This week marks 87 years since the treaty between the Vatican and Nazi Germany was signed.

The beautiful high minarets have only decorated Ayya-Sofia
Once again about Aya-Sofia - there is a text about Vladimir Zelinski, which, I say, you should protest.
First, there's a free entry.
I've never been to Istanbul, but it's better to go to the House of God for free than to pay.
Second, the Muslims conquered this land as fairly as the Orthodox conquered the Volga-Ock inter-river, the Muslim Caucasus (and built a church in Grozny) and planted apples on Mars.
God help you!
The Jews conquered the Holy Land.
The Americans have conquered America.
Are we gonna give it all back to everyone?
Do you think there will be no heathen who will demand their drop back, which is where the Church of the Tenth is?
Third, the Muslims improved the building, invested in it.
That is, it is them, just like the factories and estates that the Leninists took from the bourgeoisie, belong to the Leninists - Putin and other nomenclatures.
They've improved everything from the Kremlin to Angara, so they're all rightfully progressive.
The beautiful high minarets have adorned Ayya Sophia very much.
There was a stupid ink shop, there was a stupid ink shop with beautiful minarets.
Fourth, there are no "Islamic" and "Orthodox" civilizations.
There are believers, there are hypocrites, there are hanjis who combine faith with hypocrisy.
A person who believes in the categories of civilization doesn't think.
That's the thinking of a British Foreign Office official, Toynbee, who is ashamed to think so.
And for the believer, there is a place of prayer everywhere.
And always will.
The believer does not pray except where he is asked to leave, but he goes to another place and prays there.
He is a believer, not a disbeliever.
We're the loggers, not the rock diggers.

A Rwandan confessed to setting fire to a cathedral in Nantes
A Rwandan who worked at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in the French city of Nantes on a voluntary basis confessed to his incense a week after the fire.
This is reported on Sunday by the French TV channel France 3.
According to him, the man who was already detained on July 19, the day after the fire, was detained again the day before.
On Saturday night, he appeared before the investigating judge.
After being charged with deliberately damaging property, the man admitted to setting fire to three sites - under a large organ, under a small organ and under electrical protection.
He now faces up to 10 years in prison and a fine of 150,000 euros.
The motive of the 39-year-old Rwandan has not yet been disclosed.
All we know is that he volunteered to help the cathedral and had to close its doors on the day of the fire.
However, according to video surveillance footage, he left the religious institution 15 minutes after the building fire was called.
The fire at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul occurred on July 18.
More than 200 firefighters fought for hours for the Gothic architecture monument.

No one was injured as a result of the accident.
This fire is not the first in the history of the temple.
In 1972, a fire destroyed its roof.
It took 13 years to eliminate the aftermath of that fire.

I knew that Bryant's selfishness couldn't be tampered with by some kind of trick-or-treating to keep him from being a sporting rage.
Kobe had a killer instinct, so on the pitch, I tried to talk him out of playing the game in an aggressive way.
I complimented him on the stage, "Oh!
Kobe, good shot, great pass!

We had a good conversation with Kobe", Kirilenko quotes "Veternia Moskva".
