This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but also provides details that fossils cannot normally provide, such as color and three-dimensional disorder.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were upper-caste with a pale or carotenoid colored underside.
The fund also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers did not have well-developed scales (called spindles) but had other features of feathers  beards and rays, the researchers concluded that the spindle was likely a later evolutionary development compared to the other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight, but for temperature control or appearance. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample is from adult feathers and not from the plumes of a giraffe.
Researchers have suggested that although this is the tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the sample comes from adult feathers and not from the plumes of a giraffe.
A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.
The governor's office said nineteen of the injured were police officers.
Police said they suspected an alleged ISIS activist to be responsible for the attack.
They found that the Sun operates on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, their rotation and nothing else.
The luminous flux and rotation are combined to determine the Rossby number of a star associated with the plasma flux.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less the star is active in terms of magnetic perturbations.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect that Ekip had observed would be caused by interactions between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a gravitational force on the earth and causes winds, so does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
The scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory holds that most dark matter is in a halo around a galaxy, and is composed of many small particles.
Television reports show white smoke coming from the plant.
Local authorities warned residents in the vicinity of the plant to stay inside their buildings, turn off air conditioning and avoid drinking tap water.

This extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the South African region of KwaZulu-Natal.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "very worrying and alarming because of the very high mortality rate".
Some patients may have committed suicide in the hospital, Dr. Moll believes, and at least two were hospital staff.
In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
The percentage of XDR-TB in the overall group of people with TB, however, seems to be still low; 6 000 of the total of 330 000 people have been infected at some point in South Africa.

Infrared imagery shows that the temperature fluctuations of day and night suggest that they are probably caverns.
They are cooler during the day than the surrounding surface and warmer at night.
"Their thermal behavior is not as stable as large caverns on Earth, which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but they are consistent with having deep holes in the ground", said Glen Cushing of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) astrogeology team at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth, place a pre-printed piece of paper indicating their candidate's name in an envelope.
After officials check the voter's identity, the voter takes the envelope and wallet and signs on the voting list.
French electoral law codifies the procedures rather strictly.
Since 1988, elections have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added except those of duly elected and authorised voters.
Candidates can send representatives to see every part of the process.

The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while the rescue service freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was charged with the murder of her son at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is being held in custody pending charges and trial, but all evidence could be withdrawn because her photo was widely published.
This is common in other parts of the UK, but Scottish justice operates differently, and courts have considered the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous tightrope when they publish photos of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is responsible for all criminal prosecutions, told reporters it would not comment until the clock had been set.
According to the leaked document, the document refers to the disputed border area that Palestine claims on the basis of the borders before the 1967 Six Day War.
Other topics covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years, as soon as an agreement is signed, while the Palestinian Authority wants to allow this presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplemental pest control study should be monitored by rangers, as the study was monitored and their effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, deputy director of conservation and heritage at the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the four gunmen selected for the first shooting event received instruction on safety and training.
Martelly yesterday swore in a new pre-election committee (CEP) with nine members.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to widespread protests against the regime in October.
The sometimes violent protests were triggered by the failure of elections, which have been held in part since 2011.
There have been about 60 cases of iPod overheating reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of one of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had been involved in 34 additional heating incidents that the company had deemed "non-threatening".
The ministry reacted to Apple's ridicule of the report, calling it "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7.19am local time (Friday 9.19am GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Agency said there were no reports of damage across the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine police officer took hostages of tourists from Hong Kong by hijacking their bus in Manila, the Philippine capital.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some hostages were rescued and at least six were confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, as were the Philippine photographers.
The photographers later replaced an older dam that had collapsed on the toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature babies in his spare time.
His research showed that when a hormone was disrupted, it would accelerate the fetal lung contraction of the baby.
Xinhua reported that government officials have recovered two black boxes on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid their last respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the Extremers. My first manager. Luna left us on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman".
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as crazy as I was... maybe even a little more... I loved her and I miss her... hopefully she's on a better watch".
Of the 1,400 voters who voted for Australia as a republic before the 2010 federal election, those who oppose Australia as a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of survey respondents share this view and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the survey's extremes, 29 percent of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medallist was due to swim the 100 m and 200 m freestyle and the triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his plains his fitness was questioned.
He was unable to take medication to overcome his pain because they were prohibited while gambling.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
Some people verified the discovery using various hardware up until early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water supplies to Earth, along with organic substances that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, because comets have collided with the Earth long ago.
Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year at age 53 and signed a bill last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and stupidity".
He is speculated to run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow airplanes to fly short distances and save millions of tons of fuel and reduce CO2 emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to the older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
There are no additional means of transport deployed and overflow trains do not stop at Wembley and parking lots and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
Fears of a possible transportation issue have raised the possibility that the match could be held behind closed doors without the support of the team.
A study published in Science on Thursday reported the emergence of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala Universitet in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process probably took much longer due to the overlap between an endemic Darwin's frog, Geospiza fortes, and the extinct cactus frog, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be processed into all sorts of shapes. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be turned into fine wire, which can be crushed and ground. It can be worked with a hammer and rolled into leaves.
It can be made very thin and then smeared on other metals, so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures and books, called "picture manuscripts".
This is called the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator using red juice cables.
The color of the cabbage juice changes depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen (the H in pH) ions in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then press them into a ball using clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which fall down and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to an unconnected mains water system.
Relics of surface water systems have been found in the buildings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Bathrooms were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, and the Romans sometimes used them as part of public bathhouses, where men and women could mingle in a social setting.
If you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're calling a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it back down almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light in the sky.
It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet [30 m] high to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an indescribable way, and the biggest advantage we owe to the wheel is that it makes transportation much faster and easier.
It has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Among them are more medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to antelopes and red wolves.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging domestic cats) that eat much larger numbers of small prey than insects, rodents, lizards and fleas.
The secret to their success is the nesting concept, a special task that every cat has, which keeps them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cats, living in large groups, also called packs.
The Ruddel consists of one to four adult males, together with up to thirty females and males.
The women are usually close relatives, as they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion cubs behave similarly to those of wolves or dogs  Animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behaviour  and are also very aggressive to their prey.
As a well-trained athlete, the tiger can clatter (though not well), swim, jump far and pull with the five-fold strength of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full roar of a lion, but rather like a sentence of spoken words.
Ocelots love to eat small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, reptiles, and birds when they can. Almost all the animals that the ocelot eats are much smaller than it.
Scientists think that the beetles hunt and find prey by sniffing where they were on the ground.
They can see well in the dark and can move about freely. They attract their prey by becoming aware of their surroundings and then by preying on them.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it came (such as when they move across a mountain or a river, or when they move to a new island and cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one in which they were before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so the new population needs new characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than it was before.
The population of the species has not changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As the new population adapts to its new surroundings, it begins to look less and less like the other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations look so different that they can never be called the same species.
We call this process evolution, which is just the formation of a new species. Evolution is an inevitable form and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Plants produce their nutrients from the sun by photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes and produce our food from plants, and most of the food we eat is plant-based.
The mosasaur was the largest predator of its time, so it was afraid of nothing but other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional saw on the gum, meaning that there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a split tongue, and its diet included deck snails, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may even have been a cannibal.
It also took everything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't take it with him.
Although most of their meals were familiar to us, the Romans had some strange or unusual meals, including wild boar, poultry, snails and a type of rodent called the sleeping mouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women sat down and ate, the rich men liked to sit at the banquets where they ate on the side.
Meals at Ale Roum could not include foods that had arrived in later centuries from America or Asia to Europe.
For example, they had corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no old Roman ever ate Schnuddelhong.
The Babylonians built a primary temple to each of their gods, which they considered the home of the god.
Men brought sacrifices to the gods and the priests tried to fulfill the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had its own court and its own sanctuary, into which the priests did not enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Near East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent in the open.
Women cooked in the garden, shops were only open doors on the street.
There were no big forests in Canaan, so the wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In the Norse mythology, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and as he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of its discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences in the people, kings, kingdoms and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie The Templars' Legacy, you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a back cover, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text is found on the reverse of the document below.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (measuring 75.57 cm x 62.23 cm) was rolled up for storage early in his life.
So it's likely that the mortgage was simply added as a description.
The D-Day landings and subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French, who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies fell in southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
In less than two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and had joined Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people living and working together in a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, meaning civil, cognate with the Latin civis, meaning citizen, and civitas, meaning city or city-state, and also in some ways determines the size of society.
City-states are the predecessors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge over several generations, a continuous cultural footprint, and an orderly diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any significant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary Wars, thirteen states under the Articles of Confederation first formed a weak central government with Congress as its only component.
Congress had no power to raise taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state agencies, often uncooperative, to enforce all its actions.
Nor did it have the power to suspend tax laws and excise duties between states.
The clauses required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government to task, so that their representatives were often disagreeable.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German national team, the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
His favorite sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 motor sports.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European seafarers sailing along recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, transforming the core production of the Ura people and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) troops took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and Taiwan was declared a province of Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun and the Room with the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they looked like before.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
The most commonly used format for still photographs worldwide is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analogue era.
It is still produced today, but its aspect ratio has been largely replaced by the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format is actually, what you can do is you can actually make it a little bit more colorful, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to get the simplest integer ratio) is here referred to as 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS format family) match or approximate this aspect ratio.
The much misused and often derided rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates momentum while maintaining a measure of order in an image.
They realize that the most effective place for the main motif is at the intersection of lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally into thirds (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, Christianity held European nations together despite differences in language and culture.
Her all-pervasive power has worked on everyone, from the king to the common man.
One of the most important Christian teachings is that wealth should be spent to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the funds of the church are specifically there for that purpose.
The central authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has caused many to doubt whether this basic principle has been fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective in cutting vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade has violated generally accepted international law, codified by multiple international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain has designated international waters to prevent ships from navigating entire stretches of ocean, putting even neutral ships at risk.
Since there was only a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a response to its unrestricted U-boat warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors of World War I, the nations determined to prevent a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to take a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager in his last job) at Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different eras: Each phase of China or each family in power was a different dynasty.
The most famous of these eras was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years and was between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, a fierce war took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the highest seat in the great palace at Xian.
There are many social and political effects such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just one ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to take them.
The same goes for the military, because instead of army lists based on class, they were now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired other tyrannized workers in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was keenly interested in things outside of this worldly life. He frequently visited a cave known as 'Hira' on the mountain 'Noor' (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the centuries, is a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located on a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists.
There is only the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains to be seen. If one is in the mountains, one can see or hear very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid at Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing.
Built by the Egyptians in the third century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramidal structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
Around the Giseh Plateau, or "Giseh Necropolis", in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead are several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created to honor the Pharaoh Khufu, and a series of smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected to honor the wives and family members of Khufu.
The "boomerang up" looks like a V and the "boomerang down" looks like a parenthesis or square, missing the underside.
Up means you start at the top and press the button and down means you start at the fridge (where your hand is holding the button) and press the button.
A high note usually generates a darker tone, while a low note is stronger and more decisive.
Do not hesitate to mark your own markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed markings are there for musical reasons, so they should be kept as normal.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (the 11-year-old Marie Therese and the four-year-old Louis-Charles) and the king's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced back to Paris by a mob of merchants from Versailles on 6 October 1789.
They were driven back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who were shouting and shouting against the king and queen.
The mob of people forced the king and queen to keep their carriage windows wide open.
At one point, a mob member held up the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles in front of the frightened queen.
The war expenses of US imperialism in conquering the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime, as a large part of the expenditures and interest on the bonds were paid by Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the super profiteers who emerge from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would represent the underlying forces of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the world.
The era in which the Renaissance unfolded is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, the age of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000  1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages preceded the Early Middle Ages, which generally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice; from the technology-push or the technological must to a strict sense that human destiny is driven by a fundamentally guiding logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence and that technology in turn has "effects" on societies that are inherent in, rather than dependent on, society.
For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily led to the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a fleet of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost to vehicle owners.
Mass motorization also leads to a higher accident rate on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the health sector for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romanticism had a large element of cultural determinism from writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In connection with Romanticism, geography shaped individuals and in the course of time, there were bridges and cultures that were connected to this geography, and that were, because they were in harmony with the place of society, better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
Their status declined during the twelfth century mainly due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than those offered by Byzantine markets.
It was at this time that the title of Fashion Capital was passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its height in the period between the 10th and 14th centuries.
Early Byzantine culture in the east had a strong influence on Geze.
However, due to the slow communication channels, the western styles may have been able to survive for 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the major developments of that time as a result of the Crusades was that people began to use buttons to fasten their arms.
Subsistence farming is the farming that is done for the production of enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often biological system that combines crop production with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to optimize yield.
Historically, most farmers were subsistence farmers, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together equals who feel neglected by societal standards and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be irreconcilable due to age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through an unmistakable and symbolic style that includes fashion, behavior, and argot.
One of the most commonly used methods of attempting to explain the meaning of socialization is to draw on the success stories of children who were not socialized by neglect, bad luck, or excessive abuse by adults while growing up.
Such children are called "wolves". Some wanted children to be held by humans (usually their own parents); in some cases, this task was to relieve the child of the burden of mental or physical abuse by the parents.
Adolescent runaways may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are to be raised by animals; some are to live alone in the wild.
When the child is raised by non-human animals, it exhibits behaviours (beyond physical limits) that are almost entirely those of the respective pet, such as fear or contempt towards humans.
Although project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method but a supporting tool for people who are experiencing a new learning experience such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, in other words, a schoolmaster is a form of scaffolding, but this also applies to the small office scraper in Microsoft Office.
Virtual assistants are embedded in the software and are supposed to ask, initiate and explain processes that might have been too difficult for the student to handle on their own.
Children are sent to care facilities for poor reasons, ranging from neglect, to abuse, and even to extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not welcoming, social and educational, but it is now.
We see the care system as a safe zone for these children.
Our care system should provide a safe home, caregivers who have a very warm manner, stable training and reliable health care.
The care provider should provide all necessities to those who are in need in the home from which they were previously removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The inherent properties of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the use and reward of the Internet.
For example, learning and socialization are considered important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
'Personal engagement' and 'sustained relationships' were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they studied audience responses to Internet sites.
The use of video recordings has led to relevant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions  facial movements of a few milliseconds .
It is primarily claimed that one can recognize whether a person is suffering by correctly interpreting a microexpression.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper The President's Speech, pointed out how people who cannot understand speech because of differences in speech are able to make accurate judgments of sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior are shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
Twenty-century research has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation adds a new genetic variation while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
The separation and recombination move the variation with each generation between the two poles back and forth.
In the savannah, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
And there are serious consequences if you don't: stunted growth, malnutrition and eventual death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
In contrast, seafood, termites, and eggs are not only easily digestible but also provide a protein shell containing all the essential amino acids.
All in all, it should not be surprising that our own ancestors solved their protein problem in much the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savanna.
Sleep apnea is the process of awakening during normal sleep and returning to sleep shortly afterwards (10  60 minutes later).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively slow alarm clock to bring you to consciousness but not fully awaken you.
When you put the watch back on in the bedroom, it can be placed on the other side of the room, so you don't have to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bedtime, which forces one to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely correlated with the degree of tension in his body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force, and every human being has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own negativity and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and by many techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini Yoga is the awakening of the Kundalini energy (enlightenment energy) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central point of Tibetan meditation is Guruyoga, whereby various deities are visualized, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated and enlightened consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to a collaboration between the USSR and the United States. By the end of the war, the combination of systems, processes and cultures had led to the breakdown of the countries.
Two years after the war, the former Allies developed into enemies, which sparked the Cold War.
It will last for the next 40 years and be expressed in real time by the deputies on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize through the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were thwarted almost overnight when 800,000 Red Army soldiers marched from the Soviet Union into the White Russian and Ukrainian fronts, after falling into the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for the transport of goods is by far the most efficient way to transport many people and goods across oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that its country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously hindering the ability of its enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most notable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II, where the Americans tried to get men and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried, mainly with submarines, to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would have been in a position to conquer Britain and the rest of Europe.
Geese were apparently first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
Ancient cultures and peoples kept them for easy access to milk, hair, meat and skin.
The house ghosts were kept in the grass and traps, which were moved to the mountains or other pastures, often by ghost keepers, who were often children and youths, just like the widows of the familiar places. This method of herding is still used today.
Dunnebuns were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although dunes were mainly made of parallel wooden dunes, they allowed horses to pull carriages faster and with larger loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Early on, railway sleepers were used to hold tracks in place, but it was discovered that tracks were more efficient with an ice stand on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden railings of the tracks.
Eventually, wooden bars were replaced by iron bars.
The first known form of transport was walking; humans started to walk upright 2 million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus.
Their predecessor, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Twenty-two specialisations have been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start to live more environmentally friendly, we can join an environmental movement and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment, but if we want more than just a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problem and we should address it.
It is obvious that the scientific and technological advances of mankind have greatly changed the world and the problems have increased due to the overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of mankind.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few pages farther to the printer by John Dunlap.
Night was made between 150 and 200 copies, known today as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent on 6 July to George Washington, who sent his troops to New York on 9 July. A copy reached London on 10 August.
The 25 Dunlap Flea Leaves, which we know still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Today, paleontologists are convinced that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people do not consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, laying eggs and going on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Virtually all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are considered binary digits  or bits (to use computer language).
Internal toxicity may not be immediately detected, and symptoms such as fractures are so common that a direct diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of indoor poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
The label contains specific first-aid instructions for each poison.
The term "chewer" is used by entomologists in the formal sense for this group of insects.
The term derives from the old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects that are highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both the carnivorous and the bed bug are scavengers, adapting to life in the nest or the habitation of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disorder in middle-aged adolescents and adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Researchers have found that women have twice the risk of MS as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest - or that of their child - to raise a child.
These couples may decide to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the birth parents relinquish parental rights so that another couple can become parents of the child.
The main goal of science is to explain how the world works through the scientific method, and this method definitely drives most of the scientific research.
Experimentation is a test used to test one or more hypotheses. Asking questions and making observations are also part of conducting scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West lost its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Errors in physiology and in the observation of behavioural rhythms often depend crucially on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply reactions to external periodic cues, have been documented for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to run for a period of time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments, either marking the DNA in phage with a radioactive phosphor or the protein of phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the part of the genetic material affected and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere could result in cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns in cars to drive to their workplace and drive past those whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system that is based on private cars, and supports them.
Science now suggests that this massive carbon economy has disrupted one of the stable states of the biosphere that has supported human evolution for the last 2 million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transport systems.
In industrialized countries, complaints about water quality or the lack of bridges are rare.
Why do transportation systems generate such waste, why do they wear out every day? Are transportation planners just incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental behind it?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, the investigation of traffic flow is difficult, because the behavior of the driver cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave in a uniformly consistent area; thus traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically accurately.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relationships were established between the three main properties: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) velocity.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air, and their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to retract their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, waterfowl and one-day-old insects alone cannot fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but others thought the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That makes sense, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river on Earth, and it carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon River is the widest river on earth, at some 9.7 kilometers (9.5 miles) wide.
A staggering 20 percent of the water that flows from the world's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long, and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Ale Kingdom, the size and technical performance of the pyramids of Giseh were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were well over a thousand years old.
With a population of about 800, Vatican City is the world's smallest independent country and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Already in antiquity, humans knew basic chemical elements such as gold, silver and copper, as they can all be discovered in nature in natural form and can be mined with primitive stories relatively easily.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything was made of a mixture of one or more of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more than the 4 aggregate states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma; although he also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mainly a mixture of two or more metals.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals, but there are also metals like silver and gold.
There are also alloys with small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so surreal that billions of them could fit into the dot at the end of this sentence.
The common snake was a good friend to many people, as it was found.
Unfortunately, the lead pen has become less important and used with the development of new writing methods.
People now write messages on computer screens and do not need a pen.
One can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atom works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a cell nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like a heavy wound that tears a limb apart, the division of the nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they break up with little or no damage.
The moon's surface is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the mantle.
The thickness of the ice is about 70 km on the upper side and about 100 km on the lower side.
It is thinner below the seas and thicker above the highlands.
There may be more mares on the leaved side because the coating is thinner. It was easier for lava to climb to the surface.
Content theories focus on figuring out how people are ticking or what they're saying.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that were suppressed as they entered adulthood.
This theory considers what it is about certain people who want the things they want, and what things in their environment lead them to want or not want certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, there are two behaviors that can arise when managers start to lead their former colleagues: one end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the colleagues".
This type of leadership has difficulty making unwanted decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting performance reviews, delegating responsibility and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, you become an unrecognizable person who feels like he has to change everything the team has done and make it his own.
After all, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often led to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as interlocutors for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams can meet according to the corresponding time zones, which is not necessarily understood by the local management.
The existence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The invisible team is the management team, to which each individual member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization take on the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively deployed in the functional areas of an enterprise, creativity and resourcefulness can come to the fore.
Here, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process that serves the needs of the clients.
For an organisation to be innovative, it must first create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organisational learning.
Den Angel (2006) defines continuum management as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and in doing so, they expand the field of research and make it much more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of injury, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
New technologies are allowing us to see and explore brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
This provides us with valuable information and material to create simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although strongly associated with science fiction, AI is a major area of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
AI research involves the re-creation of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to diagnose and answer customer queries, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
Things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real problems.
AI systems are now widely used in the fields of economics, medicine, technology and military, but are also integrated into many home computer and video game software applications.
Excursions are a big part of every classroom, and often a teacher would like to take her students to places where a bus ride is not an option.
Technology provides the solution with virtual exploration, allowing students to view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in a classroom.
Sharing experiences virtually is a good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, each year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state's capital, the website is updated annually, but old versions are kept online to serve as a compilation album.
Blogging can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with poor grammar and spelling, it changes the attitude of an audience in general.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts to strive to improve his writing to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also forces students to become more familiar with the world around them". The need to capture the interest of the audience inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
By actively responding to online material, students can define their positions in the context of comments by others and also emphasize their own perspectives on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and is home to a wealth of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and future.
Further south lie the Niagara Falls and to the north the untouched natural beauty of the Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things and more make Ontario what is considered by outsiders to be typically Canadian.
Large areas further north are fairly sparsely populated and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For a population comparison that surprises many: There are more African-Americans living in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent in terms of flora and fauna.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations or associated with France and are known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the countries and it was a long way to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape of Europe near India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that traveling women say they are married, regardless of actual family status.
It also helps to wear a ring (not just the expensive one).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to what they might consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be stalked, beaten, and so on.
Don't be shy about dating men, and don't be afraid to assert yourself (cultural differences here and there, so it's not even true!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Merindia as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya and Spanish traders who established trading bases there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old town of Medina you can easily find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tajin, faience, leather goods, hookahs and a sheath of geisha are sold, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of Congo and in the vicinity of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by lava from the volcano Nyiragongo, which covered most of the city's streets, especially the city centre.
While Goma is relatively safe, any visits outside Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the fighting that is ongoing in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, and also for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla excursions in Africa.
You can take a Boda-Boda (motorcycle taxi) to get you to Goma. The normal (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic, far-away lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and overtakes an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage Sites due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main stations during the PBS Special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in stark contrast to the country's other cities, as it has more of an Arab than African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique in the east, Zimbabwe in the north and the Crocodile River forms the southern border.
The park covers an area of 19 500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which provides different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and park admission fees.
It may also be beneficial to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island lends its name to the area of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider to be the main focus.
The parade of buildings forming the skyline of Hong Kong was compared to a glittering balcony diagram, which is illustrated by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront across the street.
Much of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is packed tightly on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the area that the British colonists tried to claim, and if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove area in the world and extends from the coast for over 80 km (50 mi) into Bangladesh and the Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans have been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
The forests are not just mangroves, however, they are some of the last remaining remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Ganges.
The Sundarbans extends over an area of 3 850 km2, of which about a third is covered by water/supply basins.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a nature reserve and it is estimated that there are now 400 king tigers and over 30 000 axishirks in the area.
Buses run all day from the Interdistrict Bus Station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leaving between 6.30 and 7.30am.
As the district-wide buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses, which are compact and robust.
Collector taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places like Paro (No. 150) and Punakha (No. 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that spans the Oyapock River and connects the city of Oiapoque in Brazil to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 metres, are 378 metres long and have two 3.5 metres wide footprints.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was opened to traffic only in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational by September 2017, when Brazilian customs control is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group in modern Paraguay and lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "The Rise Province of India", was born as a result of the Spanish conquerors' encounter with the indigenous indigenous groups.
For Spain, the colonial era began, lasting three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has maintained much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
Smaller tours and games can also be watched here at other times of the year.
For information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo games, look at the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is equal to that of one British pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store.
The British pound is commonly used throughout the islands and credit cards in US dollars are also commonly accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are unlikely to be accepted in the remote islands, although both the British and US currencies are accepted; check with the owners beforehand which is an acceptable payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange the Falkland Islands' currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures usually exceed +30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: Temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it colder than the thermometer says it is.
There is no particular "clean" or "dry" season: the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Although animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is wild and should not be disturbed.
According to the park authorities, keep at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters away from all other wildlife.
No matter how they look, bison, elk, deer, bears and so on can attack all large animals.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep enough distance. These animals are big, wild and potentially dangerous, so leave them their distance.
In addition, be aware that smelly bears and other wild animals attract, so avoid carrying or cooking solid food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, with a population of just under 40,000, and is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbour was the scene of a notorious naval scandal in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave the harbour.
All ships were sunk except for one British cruiser, and nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the assassination of the top chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches on the shores of Auckland's two harbours, the most popular of which are located in three areas.
The North Shore beaches (in the North Harbour area) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches where one can swim safely, and most offer shade from Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at the Waitemata Harbour and the coastal suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in central Auckland.
The beaches are sometimes crowded with family beaches with a good selection of shops along the coast.
There are two local beers, the main one is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but is brewed and served; the other one is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that one must try, but the New Zealand and Australian wines may be easier to find.
The local tap water can certainly be drunk, but mineral water is easy to find if you're not confident.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is exotic. A short black coffee is an 'espresso', cappuccino has a drip on top (no foam) and tea is served without milk.
The hot cocoa is of Belgian standard. The fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many attempts to climb the reef are made throughout the year and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, authorities are asking for advice, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Since 1770, the sea turtle has been found on beaches and estuaries from October to April, and is occasionally found outdoors during this time.
Sharks do, but they attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live actively in the ocean, their primary habitat being in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
If booked in advance, the traveler can be assured that he will be able to sleep somewhere when he reaches his destination.
Travel agents often have deals for certain hotels, although you may be able to book other accommodations such as camping through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include groceries, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel baggage.
They can also hold off on your reservation if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
Changes or requests should be addressed first to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of music festival participants choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be in the moment, you have to get up early to get a campsite next to the music.
Please note that while the music on the main stage closes at the end, there may be areas of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you are crossing the North Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as the drift of ice can cause rather gruesome noise for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make a great effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers. Windows and clocks are usually missing and exits are difficult to find.
They regularly had special food, drink, and entertainment offerings to keep guests at ease and on the property.
Some venues offer alcohol on a drink-on-the-go basis, but alcohol impairs judgment and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On the roads, the traffic is low and you can't drive like you would drive on a snow-covered road.
When snow falls, enough snow can fall in a very short time to keep one dry.
The view may also be restricted by falling or blown snow or condensation or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries and traffic generally continues unimpeded throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
The term safari in popular usage refers to overland travel to see the amazing African wildlife, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to get close to cars, and standard equipment allows good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs and leopards are sometimes shy and you can see them better with a binocular.
A bush safari (also known as a "bus trek", "walking safari" or "walking safari") consists of hikes, each lasting several hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021. Some events will be held at various locations across Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a tight situation.
Cancellation terms vary, but as of the end of March, most coronavirus-based cancellation guidelines will not apply until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with typical tickets costing around ¥7,000.[1]
Stretching a handkerchief can help to keep them dry. Many hotels have a stretcher and a stretcher that can be borrowed even if you are not in the room.
If no track is available, or you don't feel like wearing stretch socks, you can try using a fence, if available.
Care should be taken not to overheat the fabric (which can cause it to crack or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, and in others, it takes a few minutes.
Filters have different effects, and if you have doubts, you should buy your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travellers may encounter pests in their home regions that they are not familiar with.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst cases, cause allergic reactions, spread poisons, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill humans are not normally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the ability to buy goods in certain places, which are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which often runs through remote forests.
If you are used to driving on country roads, keep your senses: go up hills, narrow lanes and over steep curbs.
The speed limits are significantly lower than on the previous and subsequent sections - usually 56 to 64 km/h (35 to 40 mph) - and adherence to them is even more important.
Strangely, however, the mobile service here is much stronger than along other stretches of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German Bakehouses are quite good and in Bavaria they are quite rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbour Austria.
Fruit baking is commonplace; apples are baked all year round and baked and cherries and sweet potatoes are added in the summer.
Many German bakeries also include almonds, hazelnuts and other legumes.
If you are looking for small but rich pastries, try the regional Berliner, pancake or potato pie.
Curry is a dish made from herbs and spices, cooked together with meat or vegetables.
A curry can range from "dry" to "dry to a sauce" depending on the liquid content.
In rural areas of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often mixed with curry; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is often mixed with curry.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide selection of regional cuisines from across the nation.
However, when used without further specification, the term usually refers to food from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widespread throughout the archipelago and offers a variety of simple dishes, with the predominant flavors of Javanese cuisine being cacao, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The scabbard is a support for the rider's foot and hangs on both sides of the saddle.
They provide more stability for the rider, but they can raise safety concerns because the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but one foot is stuck in the stirrup, he may be able to catch the horse when the horse runs away. To reduce this risk, safety measures may be taken.
First, all riders wear riding boots with a valley in a smooth, rather narrow, sole.
Next, some suits, especially English suits, have safety pins that allow a climber to fall off the suit if they are reversed by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley is the most important clay destination of Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with its large granite walls and cliffs.
Some offer breathtaking views of the peaks, and climbers from all over the world are finding new routes through the infinite potential of the walls.
Downhill sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports involving traveling, snow-covered terrain with skis attached to the feet, or descending a snowboard.
Sailing is a major tourist activity with many enthusiasts, occasionally called "shippers", planning their entire vacation around sailing in a particular place.
The idea of the sailor is very old. Cave paintings depicting sailors date back to 5000 BC.
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century and in 1861 the first free-range ski club was founded by Norwegians in Australia.
Shipwrecking: This activity is also called touring, shuttling or shoveling.
It is associated with, but is not usually associated with, alpine-rural tours or mountaineering, the latter of which takes place on rough terrain and requires much more rigid skiing and footwear.
Think of the skiing route as a long hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover a little more distance than on foot, but very few of you will reach the speed of running without having to suffer heavy back-swing on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would involve some visa and passport checks.
The Schengen area functions in this respect just like a country.

Rip currents are the backward-moving currents of waves that break on a beach, often at a reef or at a headland.
Due to the subsurface topology, the backflow concentrates on a few deeper sections and a fast current can be formed in the deep water.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue in trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the flow, the sponge is not as hard as it usually is.
