Not only does this confirm that at least some of the dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is now well accepted, but it also offers details not so often found in fossils, such as colours and the three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's upper plumage was brown and the lower part was clear or carotenoid.
The discovery also provides clues to the evolution of feathers in birds.
The feathers of dinosaurs, known as raccoons, do not have a well-developed stem, but they do have other features, such as fins and barbels. In view of this, the researchers concluded that raccoons were possibly the result of a later evolutionary development of these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they were not used in flight but rather for display or temperature control. The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen has the plumage of an adult, not a pup.
The researchers suggested that although the tail is from a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult plumage, not a plumage.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty others.
The governor's office said 19 of the injured were police officers.
Police reported that they suspected that the attacker was an alleged Daesh (ISIL) militant.
They found that the sun operated on the same basic principles as other stars: the activity of all the stars in the system was determined by their luminosity, their rotation and nothing else.
The luminosity and rotation are used together to define a star's Rossby number, which relates to the flow of plasma.
The lower the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of magnetic reversals.

The work was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made by the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a pull on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way as normal matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter in a galaxy's environment is located in the environment of a galaxy in a kind of aurora and is composed of various tiny particles.

Voting in France has traditionally been a low-tech experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and deposit a pre-printed sheet indicating the candidate of their choice in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the ballot paper.
The French electoral law codifies the procedures in a very strict way.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that no envelopes are present at the start of the vote and that no envelopes are added, except those of the voters duly numbered and authorized.
Candidates may send representatives to observe all parts of the process, and at night, votes are counted by volunteers under careful supervision, following specific procedures.

Four skiers in the women's group failed to finish their races, and 45 of the 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
Madhya Pradesh Police has recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swede and recovered their cell phone and laptop".
The accused were named as Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
The accused appeared in court with his face covered, Police Superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated.
Although three people were inside the house when she was hit by the car, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services released the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court ever since, charged with her son's murder.
She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be compromised because her image has been widely circulated.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates in a different way, and the courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists seem to be going in a dangerous direction when they post photos, videos, etc. of suspects".
The Crown Office, which is in overall charge of the prosecutions, has indicated to journalists that no further comment will be made, at least until the indictment.
The document, according to the leak, will refer to the boundary dispute, which Palestine wants based on the borders before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other issues covered include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the question of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years as soon as an agreement is signed, whereas the PA agrees to leave the presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control test were under close supervision of the forest engineers while the test was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, qualified volunteers were recruited in accordance with the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Acting Director of Conservation and Park Heritage for the NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunt operation received comprehensive safety and training instructions.
Martelly yesterday promised a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the early resignation of the CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the general protests organized against the regime.
The occasional violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which had been planned since 2011.
About 60 cases of iPods with overheating problems have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI revealed that Apple had notified it of 34 more overheating incidents, which the company classified as "not serious".
The ministry responded by calling the delay in Apple's report "truly regrettable".
The earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 0719 GMT on Friday at 2119 GMT.
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office said there were no reports of damage in the country.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has hijacked a tourist bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and held them hostage in Hong Kong.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Then the photographers took the place of an old lady who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
Although working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births in his spare time.
His research demonstrated that if a hormone were administered, it would accelerate fetal lung maturation in the baby.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes", flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Other fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said that "Luna was the first Extreme Queen, my first manager, Luna passed away on a night with two moons, something exceptional, just like her, strong woman".
Dustin Goldust Runnels said, "Luna was as crazy as I was ... or maybe even more ... I loved her and I will miss her ... I hope she's in a better place".
Among the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, the percentage of those opposing change in Australia to become a republic has grown by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 national election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view, wishing that Queen Elizabeth II be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the poll, 29% of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was due to swim the 100 and 200 freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness was called into question.
He was unable to take the medication necessary to overcome the pain, since these are forbidden in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25.
Several people verified the discovery using different types of hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It's possible that comets have been a source of water distribution to the earth along with organic matter that can develop proteins and make life possible.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how the Earth formed, since comets have been colliding with the Earth for a long time.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a law last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "politics and nonsense"
There's speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology as opposed to older ground-based radar technology to allow air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater accuracy and offer more accurate information to pilots.
There will be no extra transport and no surface trains will stop at Wembley, and no car parks or connections to public transport will be available.
The problem of lack of transportation increased the possibility that the game would have to be held behind closed doors, without the presence of the fan.
On Thursday, Science magazine published a study reporting the discovery of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University, U.S.A., and Uppsala University, Sweden, reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although this process was believed to have taken much longer, due to breeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza forte, and the migratory finch cactus, Geospiza contris.
Gold can be worked into any shape, even rolled up into small formats.
It can be stretched to form a thin thread, and it can be twisted and braided.
It can be very fine and glued onto another metal, and because it was so fine, it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called illuminated manuscripts.
You can make a marker using purple cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two powders and, with clean hands, mold them into a ball.
The moisture in the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet in almost every home, connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remnant parts of sewage systems have been found in the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, frequented by both men and women.
When you call someone who's thousands of miles away, you're using a satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the call and then routes it back to you almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and vision.
It takes a giant rocket more than 100 feet high to put a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in incredible ways. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is give us a much easier and faster transportation.
He gave us the train, the car and various other means of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized cats that feed on medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-ranging pet cats) that eat small, much more numerous animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The key to their success is the concept of niche, a special function that each cat performs that prevents them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social of the felines, living in large groups called packs.
Herds consist of one to three adult males from the same family, along with up to 30 females and young.
The women are usually closely related to one another, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion pack animals act similarly to groups of wolves or dogs, animals surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and also very deadly to their prey.
A well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and wild boars, and these four are the only cats that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the full-voiced roar of a lion, but more like a phrase of shouted and growled words.
The jaguars like to eat small animals, and they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can, and almost all the animals that the jaguars hunt are much smaller than the jaguars.
Scientists believe that jaguars follow and find their prey by smell, sniffing where they have been through the soil.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and they can also move stealthily. Jaguars hunt their prey by blending into their surroundings and then attacking their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or a river, or go to an island from which it is not possible to return easily), they often find themselves in a different environment from that in which they lived before.
This new environment has different resources and new competitors, so the new population will need to acquire different characteristics from those it already possesses and adapt to become a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all, they still need the same adaptations as before.
As time passes, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, exhale)
Plants use the sun as their food through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our homes using plants, we make our clothes using plants, most of the food we eat is plant food, and without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its era, so the only thing it feared were other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were riddled with over 70 sharp teeth, along with an extra set in the roof of its mouth, which shows that nothing that crossed its path could escape.
We're not sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
It also attacked anything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like T-Rex would not be a match for it.
While most of their food was familiar to us, the Romans still had their share of strange or unusual foods, such as wild boar, peacock, snail and a type of rodent called the arganaz.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the rich men enjoyed holding banquets together where they lay on their sides while making their meals.
Ancient Rome's diet did not include supplies originating in America and Asia for Europe, as it did in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomato, no potato, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians made a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of their respective gods.
The people would bring sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would seek to meet the needs of these gods through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary into which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special tower-shaped pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special shrine to the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, home was not so important.
Most Hebrew family life was outdoors.
Women cooked in the courtyard, shops were just open balconies facing the street, stones were used to build the houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so the timber was extremely expensive.
Greenland had its colonization in a sparse way. In the Norse sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, while traveling west, found Greenland and gave it that name.
But regardless of their discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there at the time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've ever seen the movie The Legend of the Lost Treasure, you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text appears in the lower corner of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that early in its existence the large parchment document (it measures 293⁄4 inches by 241⁄2 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Thus, it is likely that a note was simply added as a label.
The landings and subsequent battles on D-Day had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy", who were Frenchmen who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, American and Free French forces had liberated southern France and were turning toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a large, significant group of people who live and work cooperatively, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin civilis, which means civil, related to the Latin civis, which means citizen, and civitas, which means city or city-state, and which also, in some way, defines the size of society.
The city-state is the precursor of the nation, and the culture of civilization requires the passing of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural reach and a fair dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and are no longer recognized as civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government  with Congress as its only component  under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress lacked the power to exact taxes, and because there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state authorities, who were usually uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
Furthermore, there was no authority to repeal the tax laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles required unanimous consent among all the states before they could be amended, and the states gave so little importance to the central government that their representatives were almost never present.
Italy's national football team, along with Germany, is the second most successful national football team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey and F1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Because of the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often referred to, in a geographical position, as an "archipelago"
The founding of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when Europeans sailing through the region named the place Formosa Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company opened a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation in Aboriginal grain production practices and employing Chinese to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a better idea of how they originally looked.
In the year 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was recovered, and this recovery continues to this day.
As an example, the most common form of still image photography on the planet is 35mm, which was the most common film size in circulation at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly its proportion has been inherited by digital camera image sensor formats.
The 35mm format is actually confusingly 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The screen ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to get the smallest ratio between whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS family of formats, for example) are equal to or very close to this ratio.
The much abused and often demoralized law of thirds is a fairly simple guideline that provides a dynamic while maintaining a relative order in a figure.
According to him, the intersection of the lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example) is the most effective place for the main subject.
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, came under scrutiny.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion has united the European states, despite differences in language and customs.
Everyone was affected by its influence, from the king to the commoner.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that the church's money funds are there specifically for that reason.
The central leadership of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to question whether that principle was being fulfilled.
Soon after the start of hostilities, Britain began a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international regulations and stipulated in various international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire areas of the ocean, bringing danger even to neutral-flagged ships.
Germany, having had limited response to this tactic, expected a similar attack to its unrestrained submarine warfare.
During the 1920's, the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and nations were those of pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of war during World War I, the nations desired to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to accept a job with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with no money, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (the boss of his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of demonstrating different epochs; each stage of China or each family that was in power was a distinct dynasty.
The best known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which occurred for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, thousands of people died fighting to sit on the throne of the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Furthermore, post-Revolution, vacancies were opened to all male candidates, making it possible for the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same goes for the military, since instead of patents being based on class, they were now based on character.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond the mundane life. He used to frequent a cave that became known as 'Hira' on the mountain of 'Noor' (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's religious inclinations.
Perched atop one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find even if you know it exists, because once inside the cave, it's completely isolated.
You can't see anything but the clear blue sky above and the mountains around, and very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century B.C., the Great Pyramid is one of many great pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza", in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, has several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The "upward-pointing bow" mark has its V-like appearance, and the "downward-pointing bow mark" has its V-like appearance with a staple or a square without the bottom side.
Up means you should start at the tip and push the bow; down means you should start at the heel (which is where you hold the bow) and pull the bow.
In general an upward bow produces a softer sound, whereas a downward bow produces a stronger, more assertive sound.
You can write your own notes, but do not forget that the printed bow notes exist for a musical reason, so these must be respected.
On October 6, 1789, the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young sons (Maria Theresa, eleven, and Louis Charles, four) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women.
In a carriage, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage wide open.
At one point, a protester waved the head of a dead royal guard at Versailles in front of the terrified queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to pay a large part of the expenses and interest on floating rate bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the super profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic gains of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that led to the creation of the order.
The time when these events occurred is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period of European history between the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Late Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which by convention ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a range of ideas in practice, from the technology offer or the technological imperative to a narrow notion that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: first, that technological development itself follows a path that goes beyond cultural or political influence; second, the idea that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are inherent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one might say that the automobile necessarily results in the development of roads.
However, a national road network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of having an automobile.
Car ownership in mass leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new techniques in the health system to heal the injured bodies.
Romanticism had a great element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
Geography, in the context of Romanticism, caused citizens to be shaped and, over time, the customs and culture linked to this geography emerged, which, because they were in harmony with the place of society, became better than the laws that eventually became mandatory.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as an epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its status declined during the 12th century mainly due to the fact that participants in the Crusades brought back gifts such as silks and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this time that the transfer of the title of Capital of Fashion from Constantinople to Paris took place.
The Gothic language reached its zenith in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and also in the 14th century.
At first, the clothing was heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the eastern region.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West may lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
By the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the greatest advances for the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people began to use buttons to close their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet the needs of farmers and their families only.
Subsistence farming is a simple, usually organic, system that uses stored seeds native to the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in most developing nations.
Subcultures bring together like-minded individuals who feel neglected by society's standards and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures may be distinct due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographic, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinct and symbolic use of style, which includes fashions, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to draw on the few regrettable cases of children who were, through neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, not socialized by adults while they were growing up.
Some of these children have been confined by people (usually by the parents themselves); in some cases, the abandonment of this child has resulted in the rejection of the child by parts of the parents because of his or her severe intellectual or physical disability.
Children who are rebellious may have suffered serious trauma or abuse in childhood, before they were abandoned or ran away from home.
Others are supposed to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived on their own in the jungle.
When fully raised by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to that of the pet pet, such as its fear or indifference toward humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more interesting, the scaffolding method goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a help for students who are going through a new learning experience, such as using a new computer or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual or physical, in other words, a teacher can be considered a scaffold, just like that talking Microsoft Office clip.
Virtual scaffolding is internalised in software to question, alert and explain procedures that can be challenging for the learner to handle on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a multitude of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment that does not nurture, care and educate, but it happens.
We see the foster care system as a safe zone for these kids.
Our adoption platform has a duty to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, regular education and guaranteed medical care.
Adoptive care is supposed to meet all the needs that were missing in the home from which they were taken.
The Internet combines elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
The distinct characteristics of the Internet take it to additional dimensions in terms of approach to uses and rewards.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are indicated as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and continuity relationships were also identified as new motivational features by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they studied public reactions to web pages.
The use of video recording has led to important breakthroughs in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that a person can detect whether another person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article The President's Speech, indicated how people who are unable to understand speech because of brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggests that such human-behavior interpretation abilities may be shared by animals like domestic dogs.
20th-century research has concluded that there are two ways of genetic variation: secret and overt.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation and selection removes it from the grouping of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination blend the variation between the two bases with each generation.
In the savanna, it's difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans, consuming available plant resources, to meet its amino acid requirements.
Moreover, failure to act accordingly leads to serious consequences - severe depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant-based resources that are most accessible would be the proteins in leaves and legumes, but they're difficult for us primates to digest unless they're cooked.
However, animal foods (ant, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
With all this in mind, it would not be surprising if our own ancestors solved their "protein problems" more or less as modern-day savanna chimps do.
Sleep disruption is a process of intentionally waking up during the normal sleep period and falling asleep shortly after (1060 minutes).
This can easily be done by using a semi-silent alarm clock to bring him to consciousness without waking him up at all.
If you find yourself resetting the clock while you sleep, it can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off
Other biorhythm-based possibilities include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bedtime, as it forces the person to get up to urinate.
A person's level of inner peace is inversely related to his level of physical and spiritual tension.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force is present.
The only thing that stands in the way of that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but they have been expanded by the Mahayana path of love and many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, it consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the kundalini (illuminating energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central part of Tibetan meditation is Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated and the consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common villain in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the U.S. With the end of the war, the clashes of system, process and culture led to the disintegration of the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
The goal was to last for the next 40 years, and, indeed, there would be leadership of replacement troops on the battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences were already destroyed and the only way out was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Union's Red Army created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading Poland's eastern regions in violation of the Peace of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral and multilateral treaties.
The use of ships to transport goods is by far the most efficient means of moving people and goods on a large scale across the oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that their country maintains the ability to move people and goods while, at the same time, interfering with their enemies' ability to move their own people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic battle of World War II, where the Americans were trying to move men and material across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German naval organization, using mainly U-boats, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have the ability to conquer Britain as it did the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to facilitate access to milk, fur, meat and furs.
Domestic goats were usually kept in flocks that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, similar to the best-known shepherd.
Wagonways were built in England from the 16th century onwards.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, this allowed the horses to pull them to higher speeds and to carry larger loads on the slightly more rugged roads.
Dams were implemented early on to keep the rails in place, but gradually it was realised that the rails would be more efficient if they had a metal cover on top.
This became common practice, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Its predecessor, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedal adaptations are found in Australopithecus fossils dating to between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, however, Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs much earlier, seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be activists to reduce future suffering to some degree.
This is exactly like symptomatic treatment in many cases, but if we want to have more than a temporary solution, we must find the source of the problems and stop them.
It is quite obvious that the world has changed a great deal because of the scientific and technological advances of the human race, and problems have become greater because of man's overpopulation and extravagant life-style.
After Congress adopted it on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to a John Dunlap printing plant.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap attacks".
The first public reading of the document was made by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
On 6 July, one was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops in New York on 9 July. A copy arrived in London on 10 August.
The 25 surviving Dunlap attacks are the oldest surviving copies of the document.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there are still many similarities between birds and dinosaurs.
They have scaled legs and claws, they lay eggs and they walk on their two hind legs, like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers in use today are based on manipulating information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can have only one of two values, that is, 0 or 1, and these numbers are classified as binary digits - or bits, using the language used in computing.
The symptoms, such as vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The strongest indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions related to that particular poison.
The term "insects" is used by entomologists in a formal sense to refer to this group of insects.
This term derives from our long-standing familiarity with bedbugs, which are insects structured enough to cling to human beings.
Both beetles and bedbugs are nest-lovers, adapted to live in the nests or shelters of their hosts.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 known cases of MS, making it the leading neurological disease in young people and adults
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have MS.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or that of their child.
Such couples are allowed to decide to make a plan to adopt the baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can take care of the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method, and it is this method that guides scientific research.
It's not, in fact, just experimentation; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one of the possible hypotheses or more, to ask questions.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
All of Aristotle's scientific thought was accepted, including psychology.
As knowledge of Greek declined, the West found itself distanced from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Various rhythms observed in physiology and behavior are normally fundamentally dependent on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not absolutely responses to external periodic stimuli, have been observed for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to operate for a period of continuous cycle, even without the interference of the environment.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main indicators that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase use phages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
They did two experiments that labeled either the DNA of the pheasant with radioactive phosphorus or the protein of the pheasant with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting nature areas with the aim of enjoying the landscape, including fauna and flora.
Examples of local activities include fishing, taking photographs, bird watching, visiting parks and studying the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph and learn about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from small towns in the countryside to work in other towns, and they meet other people who work in those very small towns from which they came.
In this dynamic transport bus, everyone is somehow connected and supporting a private car-based transportation system.
Science now points to this carbon-based economy as having displaced the biosphere from the steady state that had allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone complains about those transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear similar levels of complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transportation systems generate such complaints, why do they fail daily, are transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two different points and the interactions they make with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100 percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a relatively consistent range; thus, traffic flows tend to have some reasonable consistency and can be represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
Such relationships assist in the planning, design and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them to escape enemies more easily and to find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along their body.
This gives them a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that can't fold their wings back are dragonflies and aphids.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system moved around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system moved around the earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
That sounds sensible, because planet Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the largest river and the second longest on Earth, and it carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching nearly six miles (10 km) wide.
A total of 20 percent of the water that goes from the planet's rivers to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the building of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size and in the excellence of construction technique.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom marveled at the constructions of their predecessors, which were by then well over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800 people, and it's the smallest independent country in the world, and it has the smallest population.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the common language used by most of those working in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Since ancient times, people have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver and copper, because all of them can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a mixture of one or more of four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more related to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are simply a mixture of two or more metals, and don't forget there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered to be metals.
You can also get alloys that include small amounts of nonmetallic elements, like carbon.
All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so amazingly small that it would be possible for trillions of them to fit into the end of this sentence.
So the pencil was a good friend to a lot of people when it was first released.
Sadly, as new methods of writing appeared, the pencil was relegated to a less important paper and use.
Today, people write messages on computer screens and do not have to go near a pointer.
We can only imagine what the keyboard will become when something new comes along.
The fission bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to build a nucleus with several protons and neutrons.
It's kind of like driving a heavy truck up a hill, and the splitting of the nucleus releases some of that energy back.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning they tend to separate with little or no incentive.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the invisible side.
The layer is thinner under the seas and thicker under the mountains.
There may be more maria on the near side because the crust is thinner, so it was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what motivates people or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they reach adulthood.
These theories look at what it is about certain people that makes them want to do what they do and what things in their environment will make them do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two Factor Theory.
Broadly speaking, two patterns can emerge as managers begin to lead their former co-workers: One side of the spectrum tries to remain "part of the guys' (or girls') group".
Such a manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, making performance reviews, delegating and holding people to account.
At the other end of the spectrum, the person becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels like he has to change everything the team has done and do his own thing.
After all, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of a team.
This behavior often leads to conflict between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have to maintain the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, however, there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members usually act as the point of contact for your immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members, as their teams may be in varying time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The presence of a true 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to whom each member must report. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organisation want to go through the difficult process of establishing organisational learning?
When all available resources are effectively used by all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity come into play.
As a result, the process of an organisation working in teams to overcome a difficulty can lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's need.
Before an organisation can even be innovative, leaders need to create a culture of innovation as well as a shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) clarifies the Continuum approach as a methodology used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition, so they narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain and behavioral pathology is a major sticking point in the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, injury and tumors affect behavior and cause alterations in some mental functions.
The emergence of new technologies allows us to see and investigate structures and processes in the brain that we've never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to design simulation models that help us understand the processes that exist in our minds.
Although AI has a strong science fiction connotation, AI forms a very important branch of computer science, addressing behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation in a machine.
Research in AI involves the production of machines to automate tasks that require intelligent activity.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer questions and diagnostics, as well as handwriting, voice and speech recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines, which focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is often used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as it is integrated into various home computer software applications and video games.
Study tours are very important for any school class, and oftentimes teachers would love to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual field classes, where students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium or admire beautiful works of art.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina develop a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year, the website is redesigned, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a memorabilia.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing, and since students often start their interaction with blogs using poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience often changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blog author begins to strive to improve his writing and avoid criticism.
In addition, having a blog "forces students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them".
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can make students more analytical and critical; by interacting with Internet content in an active way, students can position themselves in the context of the writings of others, as well as define their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital, and boasts a number of art galleries and museums that demonstrate the Canadian past and present.
Niagara Falls is farther south; the north has the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and more.
Because of all this and more, Ontario stands out as what outsiders consider to be the essence of Canada.
Large areas further north are also fairly sparsely populated and some are virtually uninhabited in nature.
For a population comparison that surprises many people, there are more African-Americans living in the United States than there are Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, some distance off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest, and a continent unto itself, when it comes to wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach hotels.
The Arabs also brought Islam to the lands, which gained much popularity in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded on the north by the Sahel, and on the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all travellers state that they are married, regardless of their current marital status.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that seems too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to acts that they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Do not be afraid to stand your ground (whether it is because of cultural differences or not, it doesn't mean that everything is fine!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans and Menenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, which was given the name Casablanca by the Spanish traders who established trading bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco as a whole.
Near the historic part of Medina it is easy to find traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, narguile and a lot of trinkets, all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried a large part of the city's streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, any visit outside of Goma must be studied to understand the state of the battle that persists in the province of Nord-Kivu.
The city is also the base for climbing the Nyiragongo volcano, along with some of Africa's cheapest gorilla mountain trails.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to tour Goma. The normal (local) price is about 500 CFA francs for a quick tour.
"Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor to refer to distant and exotic lands, in view of their relative inaccessibility.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city despite its reputation as a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was placed on the list of World Heritage in Danger, due to the danger of desert sands.
It was one of the main stops during Henry Louis Gates' Wonders of the African World program, broadcast on the PBS channel.
The city contrasts sharply with the rest of the country because it has an Arab touch rather than an African one.
Kruger National Park is in northeastern South Africa, along the border of Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River on the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each sustaining different animal species.
It is one of South Africa's top attractions and is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
There are fees for entry and conservation of the park, as with all national parks in South Africa.
It can also be very useful to acquire a Wild Card. With it you can gain access to several parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the site that many tourists consider to be their main attraction.
The parade of buildings forming Hong Kong's skyline has been compared to a scintillating bar chart made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront on the opposite side.
Most of the urban development of Hong Kong Island is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists chose to live in, and so if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a great place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest strip of mangrove swamp in the world, extending for 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coastline of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within the Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they have some of the last great forests that once covered the remaining Gangetic surface.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km2, with one-third of it covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer sighted in the area.
There are several bus departure times from the interdistrict bus station (across the river) during the day, but most, especially those going east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are almost always crowded, it is advisable to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by Japanese coastal minibuses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Oiapoque River to connect the cities of Oiapoque, Brazil, and São Jorge do Oiapoque, French Guiana.
The two towers reach a height of 83 metres, have a length of 378 metres and two runways of 3.50 metres wide.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 metres (49 ft).[citation needed] Construction was completed in August 2011 and did not open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to enter service in September 2017, when customs inspections in Brazil are expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaicurus and the Paiaguás, who lived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies", emerged from the encounter of the Spanish conquerors with the native groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the creation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has succeeded in retaining many of its indigenous peoples' characteristics and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Minor tournaments and matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
To stay up to date on tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, consult the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands which is located in Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
The pound is generally accepted anywhere on the islands and credit cards and U.S. dollars are accepted in Stanley.
In remote islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currencies may be accepted.
It is virtually impossible to exchange the Falkland currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there, while it is winter in the northern hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be disappointingly cold: temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the combined wind and humidity make the feeling colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain remains basically the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park's animals are accustomed to the presence of humans, they are still wild animals that should not be fed or disturbed.
Following the instructions of park officials, keep at least 100 yards from bears and wolves, and 25 yards from all other wildlife!
Despite their docile appearance, bison, elk, and bears, as well as all large animals, can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they didn't maintain a proper distance.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, yet avoid carrying or cooking strong- smelling food and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the site of a well-known naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave.
All ships were sunk except one British cruiser, and nearly 200 German and American lives were lost.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the assassination of the supreme chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland being between two coves. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches on the north shore (in the North Harbour district) are washed by the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches with safe swimming, and many have shadows from the pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
These are sometimes family beaches crowded with a wide variety of shops around the coast.
The main local beer is 'Number One'. It is not an elaborate beer but it is pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'.
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines may do better.
Local tap water is completely safe to drink, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're apprehensive.
For Australians, the concept of flat white coffee is strange. A short black coffee is "espresso", the cappuccino comes full of cream (not foam) and the tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is according to Belgian standards, the natural juices are expensive, but they're great.
Many trips to the reef are made throughout the year, and injuries from any of these causes, occurring on the reef, are rare.
Continue to heed the reminders of the authorities, obey all signs and pay close attention to safety alerts.
The cubed medusa occurs near beaches and river estuaries from October to April, north of 1770. They may occasionally be found at other times.
Sharks do exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most are afraid of humans and tend to swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean, their main habitat being the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents usually do business with specific hotels, although it is likely possible to book other types of accommodation, such as camping parks, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transportation to and from the airport, or even combined packages with flights and hotels.
They can also guarantee your reservation if you need time to think about the offer or gather other documents for your destination (e.g. visa).
However, if you have any changes or requests, these should be first addressed to the travel agent, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of music festival participants choose to camp on site, and most of them consider this a key part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to get there early to get camp near the music.
Remember that even after the music closes on the main stages, some sections of the festival may continue playing late.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the northern Baltic in winter, check the cabin's location, for crossing the ice creates a terrible noise for the most sensitive.
The cruises in St. Petersburg include sightseeing tours of the city, and passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms).
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by their visitors. There are generally no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink and entertainment to keep the guests in good spirits and to keep them in the house.
Some places offer alcohol on the house, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of keeping sober.
Whenever one is to drive in high latitudes or on mountain roads, one should take into consideration the possibility of encountering snow, ice or freezing temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, friction is low, and you cannot drive as if you were on clean asphalt.
During blizzards, it is possible for enough snow to fall to leave you trapped in a very short time.
Visibility may also be reduced by falling snow or wind, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic remains almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably Africa's biggest tourist attraction and the apple of many visitors' eyes.
The term "safari", in its colloquial usage, refers to overland travel to observe the impressive African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, and basic equipment allows for good viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
Also known as "walking in the woods", "walking safari" or "passada", a walking safari is equivalent to walking, whether for a few hours or many days.
The Paralympics will take place between August 24 and September 5, 2021, with some events hosted in other locations across Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you scheduled your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may have a complicated situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of late March most coronavirus cancellation policies did not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most tickets for the events are expected to cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with regular tickets costing around 7,000 yen.
Many hotels have iron and ironing board for borrowing, even if there is no one in the room.
If an iron is not available, or if you do not like to wear socks, you may try using a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the tissue get too hot (which can shrink it or, in more severe cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, some more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, many minutes are needed.
The quality of filters varies, and if you are in doubt, you may want to consider buying gallons of water from a trusted company.
Travellers may encounter animal pests with which they are not familiar in the regions from which they came.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, cause allergic reactions, spread poison, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves, or dangerous animals that can hurt or kill people by force, do not usually qualify as pests.
Duty free shopping is the chance to buy goods free of taxes and duties in certain places.
Travelers visiting countries with high taxes can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging conditions for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, who frequently pass through isolated backcountry areas.
If you are not used to driving on inland roads, use your judgment. Steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are common.
The posted speed limits are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections - usually 55-65 km/h - and strict adherence to them is even more important than the opposite.
Interestingly, however, cell phone service is much stronger here than along many other stretches of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German sweets are very good and in Bavaria they are quite capricious and varied, similar to those in the southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit desserts are recurring, with apples baked in the desserts all year round, and cherries and plums making their presence felt during the summer.
Many German bakery goods also have almonds, hazelnuts and other nuts. The famous cakes often go well with a cup of very strong coffee.
If you want some small but tasty sweets, try what, depending on the region, may be called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a range that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But when used without other qualifiers, the term tends to mean that the food is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes a variety of plainly spiced dishes, the predominant Javanese preferred condiments being peanuts, peppers, sugar (mostly Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
To provide support for a rider's feet, stirrups are used, which are hung on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but can present safety concerns, as the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but has one of his feet caught in the stirrup, he may be dragged if the animal eventually runs away.
First, a large proportion of riders wear riding boots with heels and flat soles, which are quite narrow.
Then, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow a leather stirrup to fall off the saddle if pulled back by a falling rider.
As Chile's premier climbing destination, the Cochamó Valley is known as the Yosemite of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The meetings include thrilling views of the peaks. Alpinists from all over the world are continually establishing new routes within their infinite potential of walls.
Snow sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve sliding across snow-covered terrain with skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity for many enthusiasts, occasionally known as "ski bums", who plan entire vacations just to ski at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to the 17th century at least, and in the year 1861, the first recreational ski team was opened by citizens of Norway in Australia.
Skiing: activity also known as backcountry skiing, skiing or ski-climbing.
It is related to, but generally does not involve, alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter done on steep terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski trail as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you will be able to cover slightly longer distances than on foot  but only very rarely will you achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean having to go through visa applications and passport controls several times.
The Schengen area, however, functions as a country in this respect.
If you stay in this area, it is possible to cross the border without going through passport control posts again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for visas for each of the Schengen member countries separately, thus saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that specifies which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define what items over 100 years old are antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America than in Europe.
Craft goods can be defined as antiques, although they are younger than mass-produced similar goods.
Reindeer husbandry is an important means of subsistence among the Sámi, and the culture surrounding trade is important for many other classes of professionals as well.
Although it is a tradition, not all the Sami participated in reindeer husbandry on a large scale, but they lived from fishing, hunting and such, having the reindeer as mainly draught animals.
Today, many Sámi work in modern businesses. Tourism is an important income in Sápmi, the Sámi area.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive for being associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions about the Romani people.
If the country you are visiting is subject to travel guidelines, your travel health insurance or your travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
It is also advisable that you consult other governments besides your own, but their advice is made for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face situations different from those faced by Europeans or Arabs.
Councils are only a brief summary of the political situation in a nation.
The views presented are usually superficial, general and simplified in relation to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world and encompasses different types, varying according to geographic location, topography and weather conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and effects of a severe climate, as are storms, tornadoes, water storms, and cyclones.
Severe regional and seasonal weather events include snowfalls, as well as snow, ice and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of any risk of bad weather in their area as this may affect travel plans.
When planning a visit to a country that is considered a war zone, one should first receive professional training.
An Internet search for 'Hostile environment course' will usually indicate the address of a company in the area.
A course will usually cover all the topics discussed here in much more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course usually lasts between 2 and 5 days and involves dramatization, several first aid rides, and sometimes training in the use of weapons.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the jungle are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Travellers planning a sex-change surgery abroad should ensure that they are carrying valid documents for the return trip.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with gender undefined (X), or updated documents to find a desired name and gender, varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents varies widely.
Security checkpoint searches also became much more intrusive after 9/11.
Transgender people who have not yet had gender reassignment surgery should not expect to go through the scans with their privacy and dignity intact.
Backflow currents are the reflux of water from the waves on the beach back to the sea, usually on a reef or similar area.
Due to the subaquatic topology, the return flow is concentrated in some deeper sections, and a fast current can be formed to deep water there.
Most deaths are the result of fatigue from trying to swim against the current, which may be impossible.
Once you can get out of the chain, swimming back in is no more difficult than it usually would be.
Try to aim from somewhere where you can't be caught or, depending on your skills or if you've been spotted, wait for rescue.
Re-entry shock occurs earlier than culture shock (it occurs less honeymoon time), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture sometimes have a special difficulty readjusting to their native culture.
When you returned home after living abroad, you adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your local culture.
When you first went abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adjust.
People don't realize that patience and understanding are also key for travelers who are returning home.
In the children's area, one of the most interesting things is the pyramid's light and sound show.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and also in the silence before the show starts.
Usually you always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The history of sound and light is like a storybook.
The Sphinx is defined as the background and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed in the pyramids and different pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the largest number of bases, with sixteen active by 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula.
The others are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the peninsula, coastal to the Bellingshausen Sea.
The Peninsula mountains here merge into the plateau, then reemerge to form the 200-mile chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, cut by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, rising to 16,550 feet (4,892 m) at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations without cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone generally does not replace a cell phone, since to make a call you need to be outdoors with a view of the satellite.
The service is often used for transportation, including recreational vessels, as well as expeditions that have remote data and voice needs.
Your local telephone operator may provide more information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those who intend to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among high school dropouts, allowing them to take a year off before college without compromising their education.
In most cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can actually increase your chances of gaining entry to higher education in your home country.
Usually, there will be a tuition fee to enroll in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boaters.In the lakes and coastal archipelagos, the 'Land of a Thousand Lakes' also has thousands of islands.
In archipelagos and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
While the coastal archipelagos and the larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a distinct experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every seven or eight people.
This is combined by Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but a very characteristic form (for example, in the Netherlands, the number is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruises offer extended stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for two full days and return to the ship for a night's sleep.
If you only embark on sea excursions, you will not need a separate visa (valid from 2009).
Some cruises show Berlin, Germany, in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a city visit is not included in the cruise price.
Flying can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if those people have never flown before or if they have never experienced a traumatic event.
It is not something to be ashamed of: it is no different from the personal fears and antipathies for other things that many people have.
For some, understanding something about how aircraft operate and what happens during flight can help overcome fear based on the unknown or being out of control.
Freight forwarders are well paid to deliver things quickly. Time is often very important in sending commercial documents, goods or spare parts for urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, there was a problem.
If they sent stuff by air freight, depending on the route, it could take days to get to the landing and through customs.
The only way to get through faster was to send it as checked baggage, because airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, which is where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a large sum of money for the privilege (or, better yet, to have your company do it for you).
However, it is not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal business-class fare and eleven times the first-class fare!
In general, it is not worth even looking for discounts on business class or first class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know very well that there is a small group of passengers who are willing to pay a high price for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The country's language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member country.
Economic relations have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is Turkey's third largest city, with approximately 3.7 million people, and has the second largest port after Istanbul, as well as an excellent transportation hub.
Once the ancient city of Smyrna, it is now a modern, developed, bustling commercial center, located around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-fronted buildings and modern shopping centres are marked by traditional red roofs, the 18th-century marketplace, and the old mosques and churches, though the city has an atmosphere that is more Mediterranean European than classical Turkish.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the neighbouring island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the church's adjoining courtyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on people's graves.

To the north, and easily accessible, is the romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after Lord Byron's enthusiastic account of its splendor.
Bus Scotturb 403 travels to Sintra frequently, with a stop at Cabo da Roca.
Also to the north, visit the large Shrine of Our Lady of Fatima, a world-famous site for Marian apparitions.
Remember that you are basically visiting a huge cemetery, also as a place that has a meaning that is virtually incalculable to a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who survived their time here and many others both Jews and non-Jews whose loved ones were murdered or who worked there until they died.
Please treat this place with all the dignity, solemnity and respect it deserves, and don't make any jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not damage the site by staining or cracking the constructions with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, most understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most of the signs are only in Catalan, because this is the language that has been established by law as the official language.
Yet, Spanish is widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned interruptions are announced by an automated system in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being self-centered, rude, and arrogant.
While this is often just an inappropriate stereotype, the best way to get along in Paris is still good behavior, to act like one who is "bien élevé" (well-educated).
The rough exterior of the Parisians will quickly fade if you show some basic courtesy
Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, mainly with beech, spruce, and pine trees, and features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There is a remarkable diversity of plant communities, due to varied microclimates, different soils and different levels of altitude.
The area is also home to a wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare animals can be found there, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wild cats and tetraxes, as well as several other common species
While visiting the monasteries, women are required to wear skirts covering the knees and also need to have their shoulders covered.
Most monasteries provide costumes for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially brightly colored, you will be greeted with a smile by the monk or nun.
Similarly, men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can pick up borrowed clothes at the entrance; however, they are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato and any ingredient available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word Sie for you, always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between some verbs and objects.
This also makes reading easier, no doubt, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to find out whether a verb or an adjective is used in a substantive form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, since most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch for are C and G, as their pronunciation varies with the following vowel.
Also, make sure to pronounce r and rr differently: caro means dear, while carro means car.
Persian has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
So reading this grammar booklet will help you to learn a lot about Persian grammar and to understand sentences better.
Needless to say, if you have knowledge of a Romance language, it will be easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who speak some Spanish may conclude too hastily that Portuguese is similar enough that it is not necessary to study it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are mostly outdated today and remain in museums or schools.
As light pollution in their golden age was not a problem, they are usually found in cities or university campuses, easier to reach than the more recently built ones.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in remote areas that have favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the eighth century.
The concept came from China, where plum blossoms were the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look best in a natural environment, so resist the urge to remove even "just one" slime.
If you are visiting a formally arranged garden, collecting "specimens" will also cause you to be expelled, without right to discussion.
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place and very easy to explore, and you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
But in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to deal with both heat (constant) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
There are also some buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and their wives.
Check to see if the bus you are planning to take goes to Hebron, and not just to the nearby village of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways may be a good theme around which to organize a holiday.

They also define routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity and is celebrated as the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the holiday's traditions have also been adopted by nonbelievers in Christian and non-Christian countries around the world.
There's a tradition of spending Easter night awake somewhere open to watch the sun rise.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it may be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
The more traditional churches usually hold an Easter vigil on Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with congregations often breaking the celebration at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally came to the islands came here by swimming, flying or floating.
Due to the long distance from the mainland, mammals could not make the journey, which made the giant tortoise the main grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, mice, cats and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a great opportunity to see the northern lights, for the sky darkens at about the right time.
Since the areas are sparsely populated, and consequently light pollution is not a problem, you will also be able to appreciate the stars.
In Japan, cultural labor relations are more based on hierarchy and formality than Westerners are used to seeing.
Suits are the standard business attire, and coworkers call each other by their last names or titles.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing team effort rather than individual achievement.
Workers generally need the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to obey the instructions of their superiors without question.
