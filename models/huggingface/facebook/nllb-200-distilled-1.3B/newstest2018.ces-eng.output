The civil rights movement has issued a travel advisory for Missouri .
The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) has issued a warning to people of color traveling to Missouri based on the state's discriminatory policies and racist attacks.
The NAACP Missouri Travel Advisory, effective August 28, 2017, urges African American travelers, visitors and residents of Missouri to exercise heightened caution when traveling across the state due to a series of controversial racially motivated incidents currently occurring throughout the state, the association said in a statement.
The NAACP said it took this step because of current Missouri laws that make it harder to defend racist acts in court, as well as due to actions by law enforcement agencies that inappropriately target minorities.
There's been a violation of civil rights.
People are stopped by police because of the color of their skin, attacked or killed, "said the president of the NAACP for Missouri Rod Chapel to the Kansas City Star.
We're getting the highest number of complaints yet.
This is the first warning of its kind issued by the organization to a U.S. state.
Incidents cited by the organization included racially motivated abuse directed at black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, a black man from Tennessee.
Sanders died in controversial circumstances earlier this year after running out of gas while traveling across the state and being taken into police custody without charge of a crime.
The travel guide also draws attention to a recent statement by the Missouri Attorney General's office that states that black drivers are 75% more likely to be stopped by police.
"The purpose of the travel advisory is to alert people and warn their families, friends and coworkers about what could happen in Missouri", Chapel said.
People must be prepared - they should carry money with them to pay possible bail or notify their relatives that they are going to travel across state lines.
According to the latest FBI hate-reporting program, there were 100 hate crimes in Missouri in 2015, making it the 16th most violent state in the country.
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that makes it harder to sue a company for discrimination in the provision of accommodations or employment.
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona after the states passed an immigration law that allows state officials to detain people for violating the law, which the ACLU says is designed to improve racial profiling.
Travel advisories are usually issued by the State Department for foreign countries, but recently advocacy groups have resorted to these measures in response to specific laws and trends within the US.
The model was killed by the chef.
Her family is still not at peace after 12 years!
Model Sally Anne Bowman was murdered.
A Croydon girl was murdered in 2005 by chef Mark Dixie at the restaurant where she worked, stabbed.
The victim and the killer were supposed to have sex and smoke marijuana together, then he killed her.
The killer then sat in a nearby cafe and watched the forensic team do a thorough crime scene sweep.
Dixie, a former chef, was sentenced in 2008 to 34 years to life for the murder and rape of model Sally.
He only admitted to assaulting a minor in court, and the lawyer claimed that his client had already found a girl lying dead in the street.
After three years, the police convicted him.
Dixie claimed that Sally and her ex-boyfriend Lewis Sprotson had a fight the night of the murder.
The killer said, "He was really angry and the girl started screaming after his attack".
"It even attracted the attention of the taxi driver", he falsely claimed.
The girl was supposed to fight back, but it didn't work.
Lewis was supposed to stab her in the street.
Dixie's story was proven false and she indicted him.
After Dixie confessed, he talked about his horny and his taste for the girl.
When he dressed her after sex, he felt so satisfied, he had to smoke marijuana.
Before the incident, Sally and his ex-girlfriend were drinking alcohol and taking cocaine, Dexie told the police himself.
He said he felt adrenaline.
Sally started screaming for help, so he attacked her from behind and put his hand over her mouth", added the Mirror Linda.
And 12 years later, the family faces another attack from vandals destroying her grave.
It's been damaged four times in the last six months.
There are so many cruel people out there who dig these graves.
"So our daughter is no longer there", the Mirror reported, "the mother of the deceased girl Linda, has revealed the information about the missing urn of ashes.
Linda was waiting for the attackers, but they always had to attack when she left the cemetery.
Design vibrators cost tens of thousands.
"Czech people are neither prudent nor conservative", says Martin Ráž, who runs the Prague boutique Intimity.
It's where you'll find designer and luxury erotic accessories.
Including those from Czech designer Anna Marešová.
It started quietly, about 12 years ago.
Martin Ráž and his friends went on a bike ride through Moravia.
One of them brought not only a bicycle but also a box of unusual-looking vibrators.
"Various moths and dolphins and everything was green and yellow and just completely different", he tells me over lunch.
His friend and another partner decided to work with the German designer erotic-toys company Fun Factory, which impressed Martin, so he offered to help with marketing.
When the partner left to pursue another profession, he replaced him.
Today, she runs the Intimity boutique on Prague's Benedict Street, where she sells erotic accessories in the same way that luxury handbags or shoes are usually offered.
Why wouldn't I?
They're also design objects.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. This is what you're talking about at lunch, right?
Come on, don't be such a puritan!
The Berlin Fun Factory, designed by renowned designer Karim Rashid, was the inspiration for Intimity's boutique.
It opened in 2010, and it was a completely different concept of the sex shop than what everyone here is used to.
No hidden windows, everything done in a beautiful, decent style, products displayed more like a perfumery.
Martin and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka began to think about how to describe the Prague store, where it should be and what it should be called.
The name Intimacy appealed to both of them.
"It's about intimacy, and it's kind of gentle", she says.
This was followed by the purchase of an Internet domain and the search for a suitable space, which went in parallel with various interior visualizations.
In the end, the variant that divided the store into a pleasure garden and a bedroom led by a bed won.
It was made by Dagmar Stepanova from FormaFatal.
We found the space in 2013.
At first, it didn't seem ideal because it wasn't on Main Street, but it made him sit next to Intimacy.
It's intimate.
It's in the alley next to the main one, so nobody looks at the customers", says Martin Ráž.
We wanted to be first.
We wanted to make a business that was different, with branded, nice products, in an environment where the women who are our customers mostly feel good.
And not to be ashamed of entering into such a business.
When I walked into Intimacy's boutique a half hour ago, the street was empty.
Besides, I didn't even feel like going to a sex shop.
I was surprised by the sheer elegance of the interior, which I know from fashion boutiques.
Just because there's only female waitresses in the store, the fact that women are not ashamed to ask for help doesn't mean a man's foot won't be welcome.
Usually, gentlemen come here to buy gifts for their girlfriends.
"Men usually don't know the right size and choose the bigger one", Martin smiles at a common mistake.
It's just this kind of bias, this old cliché that women need some big tools, and it's not true.
So a man of good faith would choose an unnecessarily large vibrator.
Similarly, men prefer black underwear, while women tend to prefer pink.
The absolute bestseller right now is a product aptly named Satisfyer.
You can tell by the look on my face that I don't know which one is beating because Martin immediately explains how it works.
It's like a non-contact clitoral stimulator.
I have a teenage urge to stare in admiration at the serious tone of the interpretation.
It's like it never happened.
And it's not actually going to blink.
It's a good price and has perfect user references.
We didn't think it would be so well received.
It's some kind of revolutionary new thing.
The first revolution was caused by a vibrator shaped like a sea horse.
He made sure that women became more interested in designing these kinds of products.
The other was a We-Vibe couple vibrator.
He completely broke down the taboo that some men may still have on seeing their competition in erotic aids.
"Various variations are being made", he continues.
It's single-engine, dual-engine, remote controlled.
That's a popular category.
During a lovemaking connection, a woman can hold a controller and determine the intensity of the vibrations.
On the contrary, the category of attachment vibrators is a certain failure.
At least not in our house.
Czech women seem to prefer multi-purpose devices and buy conventional vibrators, even though they may only use them externally.
It is very popular in Western Europe, especially among younger customers.
What about men?
It's hard to say if a similar concept would work exclusively for men.
I guess we'll have to take it a little differently.
The question is what to offer men", Martin thinks.
"We have aids for them too, but to a limited extent". The best seller is a masturbator, in this case from the manufacturer Tenga.
It does not look like an anatomical imitation of a vagina, but "more like a shower gel or an egg or a futuristic object.
It's very focused on functionality and user experience.
In Japan, it's a very different story.
It's a wonder to me.
I thought Japanese women were very fond of erotic devices, I object.
"This is the reality of the Internet", I'm told.
The everyday one is completely different.
Here in Europe, the use of erotic devices is more likely to be associated with women.
In Japan, they are perfectly normal for men, and conversely, taboo for women". Interestingly, the worldwide sales of the Japanese brand Tenga, which is represented in Intimity's boutique, still account for about half of the sales in Japan alone.
In our waters
The Czechs and the Czechs are not prudent.
On the contrary, we are a friendly nation.
Certainly not in countries like Catholic Poland or Italy.
The typical shop customer is between 35 and 50 years of age and "has some experience with both sex life and some accessories.
She comes for something nice, better, to complement her life as a partner or for herself". To ensure that she returns, Martin Ráž and his business partner Zdeněk Šebelka make sure that each product is functional.
We also don't want to go into specialties like bonding and latex, because we don't have the space for that, and it's not really a good fit.
Things like that could be a deterrent to what we're trying to target.
Which are people who were always too shy to go to a sex shop because they were afraid that something like that would come out.
Many of the products on the shelves are really nice.
This is also reflected in the selection of renowned brands represented.
Some of them have even won design awards, including the Red Dot Design Award.
The first prize was awarded to the sea horse mentioned above, 'and it set off a revolution in the whole industry.
They started to move away from cheap materials and instead work with health-friendly ones, they started to produce different designs, different colors...
The nice thing is that some of them are designed by the Czech Republic, and it's popular designer Anna Marešová.
I have to say, I was pretty pleasantly surprised how many people in my area buy these designer Whoop.de.doo things from Anna Maresh, even though they're relatively more expensive.
There are customers who go straight to Anna Marsh's for Venus balls.
She did a really huge job by representing within the Czech Republic and abroad exactly what we try to present - that erotic aids can be done differently, nicely, with a story.
Anna's story started as a school project.
Now it's a finished product, which is also made in-house.
I wanted to have control of the manufacturing process and I also wanted to know what materials and how Whoop.de.doo products are made.
Since it's not mass-produced, but a small batch, it's definitely more expensive than a large batch.
I may be going a little against the grain, but I think it's important to keep things moving in our country.
It could be that in a few years we won't be able to produce anything", Anna later tells me, and she and Martin agree that our society is becoming more open.
He does not encounter negative or negative attitudes.
They say people are just embarrassed.
"But then they'll smile too". Anna Mares has a vibrator that you can write a personal message on, and she's planning her own lubricant this year.
Next year, we'll have vibrating eggs and more.
The Limits of Healthy Sex
I wonder where the line is between what's right and what's wrong.
Is there anything Martin Rage doesn't sell?
It's very hard to define.
What seems normal to one person may seem completely abnormal to another, so we're more defined by the range of branded products.
None of them go to any extremes.
Before we say goodbye, I have one last question: what was the craziest request they ever made?
Just this week, I got an e-mail from a lady asking for a masturbator for her 8-inch-tall boyfriend.
So we had to write that we don't have any.
"One wonders if one of us was joking", Martin looks at me suspiciously.
Even that happens from time to time...
A shot for Karl Gotta.
After two Alzheimer's cancers!
His friend Charles the Snowman is battling a serious illness.
Karl Gotta's best friend is battling a disease that steals people's memories.
"Yes, it's unfortunately true", confirmed the sad news to The Flash himself.
I know my illness, and I'm doing pretty well under the circumstances.
"I take medication to slow the progression of the disease", he adds, thanking his loved ones for their support.
The whole extended family came together to make Karl's life easier.
Eva's wife tries to stay at home as much as possible, and her daughters from her first marriage, Suzana and Teresa, also go to visit her father in the White Mountain.
Christmas had fought cancer twice and passed on his experience to Slavík to support him during his difficult treatment.
He's had 60 chemotherapy sessions.
He was able to return to work and the tennis courts and ski slopes afterwards.
"The astrologer has predicted that I will be here by ninety", said Charles the Flash.
He's a fighter.
She still wants to sing.
"I keep repeating the words of the song to keep them in mind", admits Karl.
The actress Kveta Vialova is now in a hospital battling the same disease.
Do you have a family history of Alzheimer's?
See how you treat him.
The Chilean parliament has lifted the ban on abortion, the law will be reviewed by the Supreme Court.
In Chile, abortion is still completely banned, and therefore cannot be performed for medical reasons.
"I regret that the legislators have filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court and that now ten people will decide what we have been arguing in Parliament for more than two years", complained Socialist Senator Isabel Allende.
Chile's Constitutional Court has ten members and is due to have a new president at the end of August, who is close to the opposition, according to AFP.
A bill to repeal the absolute ban on abortion, initiated by current President Michelle Bachelet, passed the Senate on July 19.
The right-wing opposition then announced that it would challenge the law in court, claiming it violated the right to life of the unborn child.
The lawmakers postponed the vote on the bill last month until it is considered by a joint parliamentary committee.
On Wednesday, the House of Representatives approved the bill, and then the Senate did it again.
The new legislation would decriminalize abortion in three cases: if the woman's life is at risk, if the fetus has no hope of survival, or if the pregnancy is the result of rape.
Similar exemptions existed in Chile as far back as 1931, before women were granted the right to vote in 1949, according to the Spanish newspaper El País.
The absolute ban on abortion was introduced in 1989 by right-wing dictator Augusto Pinochet, just months before he left office.
Chile is one of the few countries in the world with an absolute ban on abortion.
The other countries are Nicaragua, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Haiti, Malta, and Honduras.
In El Salvador, for example, about 20 women are now serving prison sentences of up to 30 years for abortion.
Many of the cases involved spontaneous abortions, which human rights advocates say the court ruled were murder.
Is there anything sacred anymore?
The target of Trump's White House is now the Statue of Liberty.
A sure sign of regime change is criticism of statues.
Americans could tell a story about it as well as anyone else - see the carefully staged toppling of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad's Firdos Square in 2003.
Stephen Miller, one of the Trump regime's key supporters, surely knew what he was getting into when he went to the Statue of Liberty with a symbolic ax in a passionate debate with CNN reporter Jim Acosta about the president's proposals to drastically curb legal immigration.
It's fair to add that Miller did not attack the statue itself.
For that, he would be lynched by a mob of cruise ship owners and Statue of Liberty impersonators.
However, he attacked its significance, specifically the fact that a plaque with the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was placed on the pedestal in 1903, 17 years after the monument was completed.
Miller rebuked Acosta, saying, "I don't want to go into history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that shines a light on the world.
The poem that was placed on the pedestal in addition to the one you refer to is not part of it.
Miller is actually right, but as he himself points out, this isn't about history.
These are the most striking words of Emma Lazarus, which resonate today, inviting not only immigrants but the poorest of the poor: "Let the fallen come to me, the poor, those who can hardly breathe, the wretched worm in the midst of crowded cities".
And it's in this modern age that we can watch these poor worms on our screens more than ever.
Miller wasn't trying to criticize poetry - he was trying to make it clear that these people are not welcome in the United States.
This conflict over the meaning of the statue is part of a larger political and cultural war: it's essentially a conflict over the meaning of America.
Emma Lazarus, like her friends who, after her death, sought to place a plaque with the poem on the base of the statue, knew full well that she was playing a high political game.
The statue was meant to express the union of the French and American republican governments by representing the classic theme of female embodiment of freedom.
Emma Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is not abstract, but has her own voice.
She also has a very different name: the Mother of the Exiled.
Merging poetry with the idea of woman is a brilliant feminist move and a devastating attack on American nativism.
And just as Emma Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the right wing has long sought to distort that meaning.
Renowned commentator Rush Limbaugh - John the Baptist on Trump's rise to power - argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is actually inviting no one into the country, but represents early neoconservatism, bringing the American flame to the backward world: The Statue of Liberty moves forward.
He's taking the torch of freedom out of the United States and offering it to the rest of the world.
The torch is not to light the way to the United States.
Limbaugh strangely stumbles upon something important.
The meaning of a statue depends on the angle of view.
Emma Lazarus describes the sculpture from the perspective of an exhausted and doomed traveler, who often arrives with hope in his heart to a new land after a long and terrifying voyage across the ocean.
It's literally a view of the world through the eyes of people who are looking for refuge and a chance at a better life.
From this perspective, the statue expresses hope and listens to their needs.
And that, of course, is a perspective that Miller and Trump will not accept.
Their torch is not to light the way, but to fan the hatred that is their only source of power.
World Championships in Athletics 2017: Neil Black sings the praises of the Scottish members of the British team
Eilidh Doyle recalls the days when the British team had only two Scots
The director of the UK Athletics Federation, Neil Black, said a strong squad of 16 Scots in the World Cup team would be a huge asset to the teams.
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for the 2017 London Olympics, which begin on Friday.
Black believes that something special is happening in Scotland and that British athletics could learn from the Scots.
"We are trying to understand and adapt - we will work on it", said Black.
I spoke to the people at the Scottish Sports Institute and they think it has something to do with what they did.
Scottish athletics officials think it has something to do with what they did.
British athletics: it has to do with what they did.
That's what people on the street think, too.
Whatever it is, it's absolutely amazing.
Several Scottish athletes will be in contention for medals, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah in the 5000m race, while Eilidh Doyle has been chosen as team captain.
Eilidh is modest.
Her opening speech was amazing, Black said.
Several athletes, whether Scottish or athletes of other nationalities, left the room with a feeling of immense pride and motivation.
The passion and the unvarnished feelings with which Eilidh spoke were unrepeatable.
The Commonwealth silver medallist, who will compete in the 400m hurdles at her fifth world championships, said it was "incredible" that the British team included 16 Scottish athletes.
The previous record from 1983 and 2015 is seven.
The middle distance runner Muir has set five British and two European records in the past year alone.
She will be competing in the 1500m and 5000m at the World Championships.
Another great Scot is Chris O'Hare, who will run the 1500m track and this season has won the British Team Race and the Annual Games.
Doyle recalls her first championship, where she was the only other Scottish member of the team, Lee McConnell.
The team captain said she was very proud of the fact that not only did a large number of her teammates make the team, but in many cases they will also attack for a place in the final and a medal.
"The unusual thing about being a team captain is that I was chosen by the other team members.It was a great honour for me, but knowing that I was chosen by the team members is all the more gratifying", she added.
Obviously, I'm very proud of all the Scots who made the team.
It just goes to show how far we've come.
They're athletes who'll be thinking about the front of the podium.
What about my opening statement?
Yes, I think she did.
I was just pointing out the fact that we can be proud of this year's championship because it's being played on home soil.
It's important to take advantage of the support of the home fans and to celebrate the fact that we're back in the Olympic Stadium.
I've been given a second chance at the race and I'm going to enjoy the incredible atmosphere.
Blocking critics on Facebook: Don't run for public office if you can't stand criticism from voters
The father of our country knew about his criticism.
The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to start criticizing him for everything from domestic politics to his political views.
Yes, this criticism did not leave him cold.
But he didn't try to silence the critics.
Because in 1783, Washington said, "Freedom of speech can be taken away from us, and we will be led dumb and dumb like sheep to the slaughter".
Which brings me to Maryland's Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work on acting like Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted posts from at least 450 people who freely expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page.
He was sued this week by the American Civil Liberties Union for these actions.
The governor's staff dismissed the lawsuit as unfounded and there were many "who cares" comments on the Internet.
"It's just Facebook", said many users.
It does matter, though.
Especially when it comes to people like Hogan.
In an absolutely democratic state, he's an extremely popular Republican governor.
He boasts the second-highest popularity among all 50 governors.
Hogan is not sexy.
As you can see, he runs his country with confidence and strict principles.
It turns out he's also adept at using Facebook as his primary means of connecting with his constituents - not least when he posted his first nude photo after undergoing chemotherapy.
Blocking people who visit the governor's website - which is a public forum, branded as official and run by his employees paid with taxpayers' money - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous.
In an interview with the Washington Post, Hogan's spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor by saying that the comment blocking was done from a moderating position.
But using images of internet trolls, spammers or angry people is too easy.
The Washington Post interviewed several real people whose posts were deleted.
And that's exactly what they are -- real people speaking to their elected leaders; a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls.
As all have noted, their comments were polite and considerate, not abusive.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his commentary, appealing to Hogan's Catholic faith.
Bowie lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani, Jr. asked about hate crimes, but her comment was not hateful.
"I politely noted that I was disappointed in his lack of response to hate crimes and other current news", she wrote in the Washington Post's comment section.
I don't like the idea that once a certain number of people comment on the same topic, they are labeled by some people as promoting a so-called collective effort, instead of being recognized as a larger group of concerned citizens.
What the governor's staff called "concentrated spam interest" would probably be called "defense work" by others.
The modern age of Facebook allows us to easily manage posts by blocking critics or deleting negative comments.
It's much more convenient than in the past, where the same procedure would have required sending employees into the streets to collect and burn all critical publications or arrest or silence protesters.
And that's exactly what's happening, only in digital form.
Hogan isn't the last public figure to be criticized for defaming Facebook and other social media.
President Trump is facing a lawsuit from Twitter users who were denied access to his account.
One of the first major regulations was born last week in Virginia.
The chairwoman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment in Alexandria, according to District Judge James C. Cacheris, where she blocked one voter from accessing her Facebook page.
Governor Matt Bevin (R) of Kentucky also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
That shouldn't be so hard.
In Washington's day, low postal charges had almost the same impact as the Internet.
Between 1776 and 1800, the number of daily newspapers quadrupled, and his position as leader was challenged by many anonymous writers.
And even in those days, Washington had to deal with anonymous trolls.
People writing under pseudonyms such as Juricola, Valerius, Belisarius and Portius wrote letters to the newspapers questioning Washington's decision.
According to historical documents collected by people in the online Papers of George Washington Project, petitions were piling up in his office criticizing his stance on the Treaty of Amity, Commerce, and Navigation with Britain.
But he did not silence them.
Freedom of speech, dissent and intimidation lies at the very foundation of our nation.
And a true leader must accept that.
The Czechs are quick to take advantage of free roaming, they use more data abroad than at home.
The Czechs consume more of their tariff abroad than at home.
They are most frequently in Austria, but Croatia leads in the consumption of data during the summer season.
On vacation, they spend more time surfing the web, and they don't have access to Wi-Fi under the umbrella.
Beach, swimming and a smartphone in hand.
This is what a typical Czech holiday in Croatia looks like after customers can use the services of local operators at domestic prices.
That's according to the latest O2 stats.
Thanks to the new roaming rules, most Czech travellers abroad have more data available under the flat-rate than at home.
It is no wonder that in Croatia, where winters are spent with a minimum of snowmobiles, data consumption has increased 50 times this summer.
Italy then came in second place in the data consumption ranking.
The Czech people call most of the time from Germany, where many of them go to work during the summer.
Croatia is visited by 800,000 Czechs a year, according to the Association of Czech Travel Agencies, making it our most popular holiday destination.
But people here have traded books for sharing experiences on their cell phones.
The record was July 7th of this year.
"The data transferred would have taken tens of millions of photos", said Silvia Cieslar, head of mobile at the O2.
Although Croatia leads in data volumes, the highest number of Czech users is in neighbouring countries.
Austria is first, followed by Germany and Slovakia.
Croatia is up to fourth and Italy is sixth.
We're going to Austria for hiking and active holidays, where we don't have as much time to surf the Internet.
"Through Austria, the Czechs are also heading for the Adriatic", Cieslar explained.
While data has recorded a high year-on-year growth after the roaming charges were released, the growth in telephone calls is much lower.
The number of minutes spent roaming has doubled compared to last year.
Germany is dominating, with a huge lead over the rest of the world.
"Roaming calls are more likely to be used by business customers on business trips", added Cieslar.
Ronan Rafferty hopes for a homey atmosphere at the Renaissance Club.
Former world number one golfer Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for a relaxed atmosphere over the next three days at the Renaissance Club in the Scottish administrative region of East Lothian, hosting the 25th annual Scottish Senior Open.
Ronan Rafferty, a Northern Irishman who lost to Paul Eales on his way to the final at nearby Archerfield Links last year, will be acting as the tournament ambassador for the club's founder and CEO Jerry Sarvadi this year.
"I've watched the Renaissance Club slowly grow before my eyes and this year's tournament will show the world its beauty", Rafferty said.
Players will be able to admire the first-class quality of the pitch.
Jerry did a great job.
He's a passionate advocate for the game and proud of his accomplishments.
This year's tournament is in the right hands.
Englishman Eales will be defending his title for the first time, despite having won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career.
"I feel good about it", said the Southport golfer.
I didn't get a chance to defend my win at the Extremadura Open because the year after I won, the tournament was canceled.
It's magical to come back to this part of the country.
It's a beautiful place to play golf.
I remember last year when winning meant a lot to me and my wife Sharon.
It was a beautiful time I will never forget.
On home soil, Gary Orr returns to join the European Senior Tour after celebrating 50 years on the circuit this year.
This event will be his first appearance since Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.
"I always like to play on my home turf", Orr said of Helensburg.
You want to succeed, but you feel a lot of pressure.
I'm really glad I got to play again, and I think I'm doing great.
I'm happy with the result so far.
The trio will also be joined on the field by former Masters champion Ian Woosnam and senior tournament winners Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNulty.
Orr and former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scottish players on the field; the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond.
The entrance fee is £5 for a car with one passenger and £10 for a car with two or more passengers.
All profits will be donated to Prostate Cancer UK.
Poverty and Death in the Indonesian Land of Gold
When Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she doesn't use the stove.
In fact, he rarely uses the sink.
In her wooden hut in the capital city of Paniai Enarotali, in the Indonesian province of Papua, a woman usually simply throws a sweet potato - in the local nota language - directly into the fire.
After half an hour, he takes out the potatoes and enjoys them with his unwashed hands.
Bardina sits on a muddy ground - the house is not furnished - while doing her daily chores, such as washing laundry in the murky water from a nearby swamp.
A bucket in the room without a roof supplies the toilet.
As the youngest of her husband's four wives, she had no land to cultivate.
Polygamy is common here.
Working late at night is dangerous: Most of the men in the village are unemployed and often drink alcohol.
"No one dares to wander around the village after 5pm", says Bardina.
It is a rare glimpse into daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was declared part of Indonesia in 1969 after a controversial referendum in which only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by publicly waving their hands in front of the occupying army.
The current movement protesting Dutch rule quickly turned its anger against the Jakarta government, which controlled the entire region except for foreign journalists or civil rights watchdogs.
In 2003, the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua - independent Papua New Guinea occupied the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is such a remote and desolate city that it takes you a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabir, and then a five-hour stomach-chilling drive.
Public transportation is not functioning in this place.
The town of 19,000 is made up of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences, with roofs of gray and rusty wooden planks.
Very few Indonesians, let alone journalists, have visited this place, and virtually no foreigners.
Before the arrival of Christians, the local people worshipped a god named Uga Tamee.
And that's not all.
"We were not used to wearing these clothes", says Bardina, pointing to her colorful, hand-knitted turban, dark shirt and bright skirt.
We used to carry nothing but leaves.
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia - 28 percent of the population lives below the poverty line, and its infant mortality and literacy rates are among the worst in all of Asia.
But it's also Indonesia's land of gold.
The world's largest and most profitable gold mine, Grasberg, owned by Freeport McMoran of Phoenix, U.S.A., is located just 60 miles from Paniai, a rocky province about the size of New Jersey and home to some 153,000 people.
In 2015 alone, Freeport produced $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper here.
In addition, Papua supports an estimated $78 billion worth of timber production.
Yet, these riches are a source of suffering for the Papuans and a guarantee of oppression by the powerful Indonesian military.
A 2005 New York Times investigation found that Freeport paid local military officials and units about $20 million between 1998 and 2004, including $150,000 per officer.
The Papuans who call for self-government are threatening this golden goose and are being severely suppressed.
According to human rights activists, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed since 1969, and thousands more have been raped, tortured, and imprisoned by the Indonesian military.
Mass killings in the tribal areas of Papua during the 1970's amounted to genocide, as the Asian Commission on Human Rights has noted.
Last year alone, Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters in the region.
We Will Lose Everything, a 2016 report by the Archdiocese of Brisbane, describes atrocities that have taken place in the past year, including extrajudicial killings, torture - another report said rape and electrocution are particularly popular - and the brutal suppression of peaceful protesters.
"It is difficult to count the number of victims because incidents happen every week", said Andreas Harsono, an Indonesian researcher at Human Rights Watch.
To make matters worse, Papua's resources have attracted settlers to Indonesia.
Of the province's 3.5 million inhabitants, 83 percent are Christian, but the demographics are changing with the influx of Muslim immigrants from the Indonesian islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra, and Sulawesi.
Javanese canteens sell fried chicken and gado-gado, or a mix of vegetables and peanut sauce.
The locals are fighting for their lives.
"The immigrants started selling chicken and vegetables in traditional markets at lower prices than the local Papuans", explains Abeth You, 24, who was born in Paniai and moved to the capital of Jayapura province for work.
The aboriginal people of Papua - mama-mama (women) - lost their jobs.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo, who goes by the nickname Jokowi, promised to address inequality and rights violations during his 2014 presidential campaign.
The former carpenter has secured his way to the presidential palace in Jakarta in 27 of Papua's 29 districts, including Paniai.
But in Papua, very little has changed, and the local people feel betrayed.
"Our hearts were broken because in 2014 we voted for Jokpwi in the hope that he would hear our call for justice", You said.
The fact is, just two months after Jakowi's inauguration in October, Paniai was in for a big shock.
On December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children were singing Christmas carols by a campfire in Enarotali when two Indonesian soldiers emerged from the darkness of the night on motorcycles.
Two of the surprised children told them to turn on the lights.
One of the soldiers was hurt by the rebuke and the tone of the words, and he later returned with four other soldiers, said local priest Yavedt Tebai.
Two soldiers, both drunk, chased a group of children and beat them with the butt of their guns, victims and witnesses said.
One of the soldiers then opened fire on a group of children.
One of the children, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was beaten so badly that he fell into a coma.
Hours later, someone set fire to the nearby Election Commission building, and the next day, things escalated.
About 1,000 young Papuans gathered on a football field outside the local police station and military headquarters, demanding justice.
They came with ceremonial bows and performed the waita - a dance in which people run in circles and imitate the song of birds - of the Papuanian tribe Mee Pago.
A few protestants started throwing rocks at the buildings.
As tensions mounted, the soldiers were given a radio order: "If the crowd tries to resist at least three times, you have permission to fire", according to TIME magazine in an official document, the contents of which were never published in the local media.
Yeremias Kayame (56), the head of Enarotali Kego Koto, recognized the imminent danger and urged residents to disperse to their homes.
But no one paid attention to his words.
"When I turned around, someone shot me in my left wrist", he told TIME magazine on the porch of his brightly painted wooden house.
Kayame still doesn't know who the shooter was, but he says the bullet belonged to one of the soldiers present.
"There were a lot of people around and a lot of shooting", he added.
One of the residents, Alfius Youw, was shot three times, according to his cousin, who witnessed the shooting.
"I ran to the body to make sure it was really him", said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, uses only one name, in a sad voice.
I saw him dead... and I kissed him.
Papua's police inspector, General Yotje Mende, told reporters that his officers were merely securing the station that was under attack.
"We must defend ourselves when people threaten us with death", said Papua's police spokesman, Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015.
It's a matter of life and death.
According to Human Rights Watch, five protesters were killed and many others escaped with injuries.
The news of the murders was reported in Jakarta media the next day.
Three weeks later, Jokowi gave a passionate speech in Jayapura expressing his sympathy for the families of the victims and vowing to address the violence in Papua.
"I demand an immediate solution to this problem so that it can never happen again", he said.
In October 2016, Minister of National Security Wiranto announced that he would establish an extrajudicial mechanism to address past acts of violence.
Almost immediately, however, excuses began to be made.
Most violent acts have happened a long time ago.
Some of these occurred in the 1990's and some in the early 2000's.
I mean, we're committed to punishing these violent acts, but it won't be an easy task, he said.
However, in a June 5 interview with TIME magazine in Jakarta, Wiranto said that he had no plans to implement any measures in Papua.
Instead, he said all the cases would be taken to court.
Wiranto, who has been accused by the UN of "crimes against humanity" based on more than 1,000 deaths during East Timor's 1999 independent elections, said 11 human rights violations in Papua had been resolved so far, including the incident in Paniai.
The families of the victims of the Paniai shooting greeted his claims with distrust.
"I have been questioned four times in the last three years, but so far I have not received anything", said Yohanes.
I'm tired of it.
He says that years later, he still lives in fear.
I'm afraid, as he says.
I'm afraid of being arrested by the army or shot.
His brother Yacobus confirmed the view of many in Paniai who are afraid to talk about the incident.
He said he was beaten by members of the military after helping to bury four of the victims.
"After the bodies were buried, the army started looking for me", he said.
And the shooting still goes on.
On Tuesday, Indonesian police opened fire on villagers in nearby Deiyai.
A fight that left one person dead and 17 injured was between villagers and a construction company manager who refused to help transport an unconscious man to the hospital.
Ravianus Douw, 24, who drowned while fishing in a nearby river, died on his way to hospital.
Angry villagers protested outside the society building.
According to police, villagers threw stones at the officers and responded with warning shots.
However, locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian paramilitary police) opened fire on the crowd, killing one person.
"There was panic, we were afraid of retaliation", said 29-year-old Dominggu Badii, who lives near the hospital and witnessed the arrival of the injured.
I haven't left the house in two days.
The Deiya parliament demanded that the police involved be punished and that the mobile brigade be withdrawn from the area.
Paniai has always been a thorn in the Indonesian government's side.
The lack of meaningful development only deepens the isolation of the indigenous Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal people who live in the central highlands.
Many of them joined the Movement for the Liberation of Papua (MOLP), a rebel army that protects the rights of Papuans by attacking and kidnapping Indonesian police officers.
Some of the OPM leaders are from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.
As a result of attacks in recent years, the army has arrested and arbitrarily detained thousands of Paniai residents, all under the pretext of "ensuring national sovereignty".
Some of them will never be seen again.
Paniai is known among the people of Papua as a "tragic and forgotten place".
Poverty adds fuel to the fire.
The little rice that is sold in Enarotala is too expensive for the locals.
And bread is just as elusive.
The local people grow their own food, mainly sweet potatoes, fruit, and leafy vegetables.
The women work in the fields; each of them cultivates four or five fields of sweet potatoes.
Most of the harvest is for the family's needs, the rest is sold at the local market.
Ten pieces of sweet potatoes cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Since the opening of more air routes at Nabire Airport and the influx of new immigrants, economic inequality between native Papuans and immigrants has increased.
So few jobs are usually filled by more educated and wealthier immigrants.
Papuan people rarely have the capital and education to start a business.
"Young people are moving out of villages because of lack of job opportunities and money", said John Gobai, chairman of the Paniai tribal council.
The isolation of Papua province has kept it hidden from the world.
The strict rules for foreign journalists also contribute to this.
Earlier this year, two French journalists - Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp - were expelled from Papua for "lack of cooperation with the authorities", despite the fact that they had received such rare filming permits.
Phelim Kine, deputy director of the Asia branch of Human Rights Watch, promised Jokowi during his election campaign to end strict rules on journalists and achieve transparency and development.
"Foreign journalists working in the rebellious easternmost areas of Papua and West Papua face a high risk of visa denial and blacklisting", he said in a statement.
The lack of press coverage from foreign journalists means that international pressure on Indonesia on the Papua issue is largely limited.
In March, six Pacific nations - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and Solomon Islands - urged the UN Human Rights Council to investigate various and widespread acts of violence in Papua, including the shooting in Paniai.
These countries have also supported the OPM in the past.
Indonesian Foreign Ministry spokesman Arrmanatha Nasir deflected the accusations, telling reporters in Jakarta that:  Indonesia is still a democratic system and the media are free, so it is difficult to mask evidence of human rights violations.
Local people are calling for foreign governments to participate.
When an official delegation from the Netherlands, led by the Ambassador for Human Rights Kees Van Baar, visited Jayapura on May 4, locals chanted "We want freedom", according to a source who also attended the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous.
In 2019, Indonesia is scheduled to hold another election, but the Papuans say they will not vote for Jokowi.
"Yokowi is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by people connected to the Paniai shooting", said Gobau, chairman of the tribal council.
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Paniai - in addition to living in constant fear of a marauding army - are struggling with poverty, poor education and poor healthcare.
Gobai claims that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, consider their vote a "debt" to be paid to Jokowi.
"They don't want money, they want justice", he added.
Despite threats and intimidation, the families of the victims of the panic shooting continue their last symbolic act of defiance: they bury the bodies of the victims on the property opposite the police and army station.
Knowing that justice will never be done enough, at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"A member of our family has been killed", said Yacobus, his head bowed.
What can we do?
The French Navy intercepted a huge shipment of cocaine heading to Australia.
The French Navy intercepted a yacht in the Pacific carrying 1.46 tons of cocaine worth approximately $256 million.
The shipment was bound for Australia.
The four crew members of the ship, apparently Lithuanian and Latvian, were arrested during the raid.
The yacht, named Afalina, had sailed from South America and was detained by police and towed to the port of Nouméa, a metropolis in the French overseas territory of New Caledonia in the Pacific.
The Australian intelligence service said it would work with its international partners to determine exactly where and when the drugs were coming from and to expose a "Lithuanian syndicate".
"We are grateful to the French authorities for the measures they have taken to stop large quantities of drugs from entering Australia", said its executive director, Col Blanch.
Drugs were destroyed in Noumée this week.
Australia is an attractive target for drug traffickers because of high street prices.
The country is also struggling with the growing number of people suffering from drug addiction.
This raid isn't the first one we've had lately.
Last month, three men were charged with transporting a large quantity of drugs from the United States to Australia, which they tried to smuggle across the Pacific Ocean in a small plane.
The elderly don't feel thirsty, they need to be reminded to drink.
The solution, according to a doctor from the Geriatric Clinic of the General Faculty Hospital in Prague, Pavla Mádlová, could be infusions of physiological solution that are injected with a thin needle under the skin.
But so far, they're only used in medical facilities.
The older you get, the more water your body loses.
"And they lose the thirst, so seniors generally take less fluids and become dehydrated very quickly", said Mádlová.
Two liters should be a sure thing.
"But getting into an old man so much fluid is a big problem", she added.
She says that in nursing homes, there is often no doctor to watch.
In hospitals, they usually treat dehydration with IVs.
"I think it should be introduced gradually so that they can get subcutaneous infusions", she said.
She says that as many as two gallons of saline can be given to elderly people a day.
Fluid deficiency can cause nausea, headache and reduced performance.
Dehydration will manifest as a complete loss of self-sufficiency.
"One day the old man says he can't get out of bed, he talks confused", she added.
If neglected, it can lead to a stroke.
Blood clots and clogs the blood vessels in the brain, and kidney failure is also a risk.
Lying patients should not be covered with a blanket, a cotton sheet at most.
Disposable diapers can also be a problem.
"It's more nursing-related, but the ideal would be to uncover the patient occasionally and let the skin breathe", she said.
Dubai's second fire at The Torch
In Dubai, one of the world's largest residential skyscrapers caught fire on Friday, forcing firefighters to evacuate all occupants of the 337-meter, 79-story building.
This is the second fire in the last two years at the high-rise, aptly named The Torch.
All occupants of the building have been evacuated and no injuries have been reported.
We were asleep and the alarm woke us up.
It took us ten minutes to run down from the 50th floor, said George, one of the residents of the skyscraper.
Dubai Civil Defence said firefighters had brought the fire under control at around 4am (0:00 GMT) and continued to cool the building.
Government officials added that they were providing alternative accommodation for the affected residents.
The incident could once again spark a debate about the safety of materials used to clad tall buildings around the world.
The results of the investigation initiated by the Torch management after the fire in 2015 showed that the cladding and external panels used for decoration or insulation were the most damaged.
British police say the insulation and cladding system at London's Grenfell Tower may have contributed to the rapid spread of the fire that killed nearly 80 people in June.
The results of the survey showed that more than one in five passengers in the United States say prohibited items on board the plane
A survey of passengers found that more than 20 percent of them had knowingly or unknowingly carried prohibited items through the U.S. government's Transportation Security Administration checkpoint on board an aircraft, and at least 6 percent of the passengers had boarded the aircraft with a knife or other sharp object.
Less than one percent of travelers say they were late to discover that they were traveling with a firearm, ammunition, or explosive.
A survey of more than 1,000 people by Stratos Jet Charters Inc. found that younger passengers are more likely to break rules.
Of the respondents who admitted to knowingly trying to travel with an item prohibited by the TSA, 19.7 percent of the travelers had several thousand hours of flight time, compared with less than 15 percent of Gen Xers.
Among the most common items that have escaped the TSA's attention are food and alcohol.
More than three percent of respondents knowingly carried a sharp object through security, while 2.2 percent of women and 3.7 percent of men also admitted to deliberately bringing illicit drugs on board.
The company said it had conducted research among passengers worldwide to find out how many had accidentally passed unauthorised items through airport control and how many had done so intentionally.
Not surprisingly, most people who carry illegal items - whether consciously or unconsciously - travel by plane very often.
As the company points out, the TSA guidelines are a bit complicated and confusing.
People often don't know what liquids and how much they can take on the plane.
It's no surprise that the TSA has seized the largest amount of prohibited liquids.
For a while, people thought the TSA would treat books the same way it treated contraband.
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights, not international flights.
EPA chief Scott Pruitt on the delay of the Obama administration's planned emissions reduction guidelines
After the EPA was sued by 15 states, its chief executive Scott Pruitt reversed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the former Obama administration's carbon reduction plan.
Pruitt has introduced changes to his plan, responding more quickly than previous administrations to the needs of state environmental regulators.
He did not, however, mention the legal challenge filed against his previous position at the Federal Court of Appeal.
This concerns the deadline set for 1 October when States should start complying with the 2015 ground-level ozone reduction regulation.
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the deal by one year and order a more detailed study of the plan to avoid "interfering with local decisions or threatening economic growth".
Pruitt, who served as Oklahoma's attorney general before being named EPA chief by President Donald Trump, has long served as a staunch opponent of stricter environmental regulations.
Since settling in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly moved or delayed regulations proposed by the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden turnaround is the biggest legal failure of Pruitt's regulatory agenda.
Last month, a federal appeals court in Washington ruled that the EPA's enforcement officer exceeded his authority to try to delay the implementation of an Obama administration plan that required oil and gas companies to reduce methane leaks.
In a statement issued Wednesday night, Pruitt proposed his version of ozone standards and reinforced the EPA's commitment to working with states through comprehensive processes and meeting new standards within a time frame.
"Under previous administrations, the EPA often missed deadlines and waited to be sued by activist groups and others, agreeing to settle and further set up plans", said Pruitt, who in his previous position filed more than a dozen lawsuits against the EPA.
We don't believe in regulating by litigation and we take deadlines seriously.
We never joke about our status and the authority that comes with it.
However, the EPA statement states that Pruitt may at some point use the "opportunity for delay and all other legally available authorities" to ensure that regulations "are based on sound policy and the most accessible information".
Republicans in Congress are pushing for a broader overhaul of ozone regulations.
The White House budget approved last month seeks to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.
The measure still hasn't passed the Senate.
New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a coalition of states that sued the EPA this week, said the group will not allow legal pressure.
"The EPA's reversal - following our court ruling - is an important victory for the health and safety of the 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans directly affected by air pollution", Schneiderman added.
New York City was joined by California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Washington, D.C.
Ground-level ozone is produced when common harmful substances emitted by cars, power plants, oil refineries, chemical plants and other sources react with the sun's rays in the atmosphere.
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive people and thousands of premature deaths each year.
Public health advocates and environmentalists are welcoming Pruitt's sudden change of heart.
"It is worrying how much pressure we need to put on to change the minds of those responsible and protect the air we breathe", said Lori Ann Burd of the Centre for Biological Diversity.
We must continue to fight the Trump administration's ideological drive to help polluters and special interests.
He doused the man with acid, yet the court found him not dangerous.
You never know what might happen.
One minute you're at home with your family, laughing, and the next, your whole life changes completely.
And the worst part is, there's nothing you can do about it.
A similar fate befell Andreas Christopher of the United Kingdom, who was acid-stained in the face by an unknown assailant and was eventually acquitted.
The news was reported by Reuters.
In December 2014, there was a knock on the Christopheros' door.
Andreas said he was going to open the door.
He thought there was probably a courier at the door delivering Christmas presents for the family that day.
Instead, he was in for a cruel surprise.
A man he had never seen before poured acid on it as soon as it was opened without warning, saying, "This is for you, my friend".
The pain was indescribable.
The clothes fell apart like nothing, and I felt nothing but an incredible pain in my skin", Andreas said.
His family rushed him to the hospital, but there his loved ones received the terrible news - doctors said he had no chance of survival.
For weeks after the incident, doctors were constantly worried that their patient would succumb to an infection that threatened to enter his wounds.
His injuries were very serious.
Ninety percent of the victims had their faces affected, which doctors tried to repair using skin from other parts of the patient's body.
A major complication for Christopher was the loss of his eyelids.
It's probably the most torturous thing I've ever experienced.
"You can't hide from the unexpected light, you can't close your eyes", he described his anguish.
Today, Christopheros has completed 12 operations, far from his last.
According to plastic surgeons, the injuries suffered by acid attack victims can take hundreds of surgeries and years of treatment.
Even after long and strenuous treatment, the victims have scar tissue for the rest of their lives.
"Sometimes people don't recover and struggle with deformity and disfigurement for their whole lives", said Professor Peter Dziewulski, a spokesman for the British Association of Plastic and Aesthetic Surgeons.
The attacker made a mistake.
As for the attack, Christopheros is sure the unsub must have mistaken him for someone else.
The perpetrator believed he was avenging a man who had sexually abused a person close to him.
The police conducted a thorough investigation and eventually tracked down the attacker.
The man was originally sentenced to a minimum of eight years in prison.
However, later the verdict was changed dramatically, much to the astonishment of Christopheros' family.
"The three judges finally concluded that the sentence should be lifted because the man is not considered a threat to the public", Christopheros said.
In recent years, the number of attacks with corrosive substances has increased significantly.
The Ministry of the Interior has expressed its views on the matter by planning to establish new guidelines for prosecutors on the classification of grain products.
They should be classified as dangerous weapons.
But the victims of such attacks are not going to give up.
They are demanding that the UK government impose harsher and longer prison sentences on people who attack their neighbours with acid or other corrosive substances.
They also call for stricter controls on the sale of dangerous substances, which are often commonly available in different stores because they are different cleaning products.
In Dubai, the largest city in the United Arab Emirates, the world's tallest residential building, The Torch, caught fire last night.
According to Dubai Civil Defence, the residents of the 80-storey building were evacuated in time and no one was injured.
According to a spokesman for Dubai Police, the fire broke out on the ninth floor and spread upstairs.
According to several residents of the house, however, it was the opposite.
"It started on the 67th floor, that's what we were told", said one tenant.
Another tenant, quoted by Reuters, said the fire broke out on the top floors and spread downwards with the falling burning debris.
We were asleep.
We woke up to the alarm, people screaming.
"We ran down the stairs, and it took us about ten minutes to get down from the 50th floor", tenant George described the event.
Another witness told CNN that the flames had engulfed about 40 homes.
On the ground, a fire destroyed at least two cars as burning parts of the building fell on them.
After about two hours, the fire was brought under control, according to the Civil Defense.
The cause of its occurrence is not yet known.
Witnesses in the surrounding buildings said the power went out.
A massive fire damaged Dubai's The Torch skyscraper in February 2015, destroying more than 100 homes.
There's about 680 apartments in the whole building.
Even then, no one was hurt, as the residents were evacuated in time.
The Torch was built in 2011 and at 1,129 feet [352 m] it became the tallest residential building in the world.
The record was broken the following year by another skyscraper in Dubai.
The bodybuilder had an incredible 14 doping substances in his system.
He didn't win anyway.
According to the newspaper Corriere della Serra, the 23-year-old Ippolito's sample contained a diverse array of illicit substances, from steroids to diuretics to drugs for Parkinson's disease and anorexia.
Ironically, even this wild mix didn't help him to the title, finishing fourth.
Now the bodybuilder faces a four-year ban and criminal prosecution.
The record was 11.
Last year, Italian rugby player Davide Vasta tested positive for 11 doping substances, a record for any athlete caught up to that time.
The triple-A player said he started taking steroids a year ago when he fell out of bodybuilding.
Lucka Vondráčková in the Czech Republic.
She was hugging her ex-lover passionately!
As soon as Lucka Vondráčková has stepped on Czech territory, she's in a wheel.
And he's also a sight for sore eyes wherever he goes.
The last time she fell in her arms was her former lover Michael the Long, with whom she lived for three years.
The actor was 12 years older and already yearning for a family.
At that time, Lucia was only 19 years old and had no desire to put her career on the line.
So they parted, but they remain friends to this day.
And they proved it at the TV Prima press conference, where they met after a long time.
They both happened to match the blue color.
At first they didn't notice each other, but then they got closer and Lucie laughed at Michal's pranks until she grabbed her stomach.
Then they hugged and posed for photographs.
But their meeting was no accident, as they will be playing a lovers' couple in Prime's new series Captain Exner.
Islamists have been given life in prison in the UK for plotting an assassination.
A British court on Thursday sentenced four members of an Islamist cell calling itself the Three Musketeers to life in prison for plotting a terrorist attack on police and the army, prosecutors said.
Four men, two of whom attended a training camp in Pakistan and had previous convictions for similar offenses, were arrested last August.
The authorities at the time believed he was about to attack immediately.
In the car of one of the men, security agents found a semi-fabricated pipe bomb, knives with inscriptions that mean "infidel" in Arabic, and a model of a pistol.
It happened when an MI5 agent planted a bug in the car.
"Recent assassinations have shown the horror that the defendants could cause if left unchecked", said prosecutor Sue Hemming.
Three convicts aged 28, 25 and 33 can apply for parole after 20 years.
The fourth convict, who is 38 years old, can do that after 15 years behind bars.
The men, during their trial in London, claimed they were innocent and that the weapons found in the car had been planted by an MI5 agent.
The court heard him too, but then rejected the defendants' claims.
Thursday was the hottest day of the year.
The temperature in Hodonínsk was 38.3 °C.
Tuesday's record high of 37.3 degrees Celsius has only been at its peak for two days.
With a record of 38.3 degrees Celsius recorded in the watchtower in Hodonín, Thursday surpassed it, making it the hottest day of the year so far.
This was confirmed by the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute.
But Thursday was not the day for many temperature records.
On Tuesday, records were broken or equaled at 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term temperature stations recorded record highs.
For example, in the Watchtower, Thursday's temperature was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In Frydnica in Břeclavsk, Thursday's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Pohořelice in Brno, the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as well as the Guardian, were from 2013.
It was ten degrees cooler in the west.
High temperatures were recorded on Thursday, mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
The hottest after the Strážnici were in Dyjakovice in Znojemsk and Brod nad Dyje in Břeclavsk, where mercury also rose to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
By contrast, in western and northwestern Bohemia, for example, Thursday's high temperatures so far have been only about 70 degrees Fahrenheit [22°C], according to the CCHMU website.
"Temperatures did not begin to rise until this late afternoon", the forecasters said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside and on Sunday, more heavy rain could come.
But in most parts of Moravia, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
China is short of tourists.
Beijing is losing billions because of visa policy.
For decades, China has tried to exert its influence without the use of force.
It spends ten billion dollars a year to promote language schools and universities abroad, pushing its entertainment industry into foreign markets, and trying to attract Western tourists.
Beijing is not doing well.
The state media there are talking about a plan to make tourism a driving force for economic transformation and modernization.
However, the number of visitors increased by only 3.8 percent last year, and about 80 percent of tourists to China came from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.
One reason for this is that despite all its global aspirations, China does not welcome foreigners with open arms, says economics professor Christopher Balding of Peking University in an article for Bloomberg.
An example that speaks for itself is China's visa policy.
Only 13 countries have visa-free travel with China, and citizens of the other countries must obtain visas in advance.
The crowds at the Chinese embassies in the United States are therefore comparable to the celebrations of the Chinese New Year.
The visa costs $140, but if you do not want to wait in line for hours, you must pay an additional $100 or more for extra services.
Such restrictions create significant economic barriers.
A study in the Journal of Economics and Finance showed that visa requirements reduce the number of visitors to a country by 70 percent.
In 2015, only two million Americans visited mainland China, while 1.8 million Americans visited Hong Kong, which accounts for less than 3 percent of China's gross domestic product and has less than 1 percent of its population.
China often exacerbates the problem itself by using tourism to advance its political goals, such as in its disputes with Taiwan and South Korea.
When China cut off shipments to South Korea in the spring as part of a rift over South Korea's missile defense system, the South Koreans retaliated by avoiding China.
In May, the number of visitors fell 42 percent year-on-year, while Japan saw an 85-percent increase.
All of this affects macroeconomic stability.
According to a recent report by the U.S. Federal Reserve, as much as $190 billion may have left China as a result of Chinese travel abroad, while China earns about $35 billion a year from selling currency to incoming tourists.
According to official figures on the balance of payments, China had a tourism deficit of $217 billion last year, equivalent to 44 percent of China's total trade surplus in goods.
So the small number of tourists is dealing a very painful blow to a country that anxiously blocks the flow of capital.
However, the above factors are just one example of a general reluctance toward foreigners.
In many parts of China, immigrants are virtually unheard of.
As recently as 2013, there were fewer than a million foreigners living in China.
There are more in the United States and some cities.
Even Japan, which isn't exactly a crossroads for immigration, has double that.
A number of studies show that immigrants tend to fuel economic growth, entrepreneurship and innovation.
But in China, you can hardly find them.
The solution to these problems will be politically difficult, but the step being proposed is to simplify the visa system.
Other Asian countries, notably India and Vietnam, have recently made a major effort to simplify and lower the cost of visa procedures.
If China wants more foreign tourists and their hard currency, it should be easier for them to get there.
The Plzeň Zoo has been breeding deadly venomous reptiles.
The Pilsen Poison Kingdom can boast of the young of three rare, deadly venomous reptiles.
In the exhibition, visitors will see only all nine newborn Turkish snakes.
This species lives in northern Anatolia, even at an altitude of 2,000 meters.
"It grows to a meter in length", described zoo spokesman Martin Vobruba.
Meanwhile, the young of the other two species, the death-bearers and the red cobras, will gather strength in the garden's breeding grounds.
We can't tell when people will see them.
"We would not want to lose them", said nurse Miroslav Dohnal, adding that it could take a year or two.
Eight of Australia's deadly snakes have been born from a breeding pair from a population around Sydney.
"The one thing visitors can see in the exhibition is a Perth-based vector", said Vobruba, adding that in human care, vectors must be frozen for six to eight weeks at a temperature of 43 degrees Fahrenheit [13°C].
A hundred percent success was accompanied by a swarm of African spitting cobras.
A pair at the Plzeň Zoo hatched four eggs, giving birth to four young.
"The incubation period lasted 65 days", added the Vobruba.
In the wild, this species sprays venom on its victims up to four meters away.
It's aimed at the eyes, can cause permanent blindness.
The young of all three species feed on mouse scales in the zoo.
Within 40 days in the garden, they still expect the young to hatch from the black mamba's brood, and the eggs are laid in an incubator.
According to an unverified transcript of the phone call, Trump is putting pressure on Mexico to pay for the border wall.
The Washington Post has published a transcript of President Trump's phone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
In a January 27 phone call with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly announcing that he would not pay for the proposed wall.
The US president blamed him for publicly condemning the wall, allegedly saying, "You can't talk like that in the press".
Trump campaigned on promises to build a wall along the southern border and announced that Mexico would pay for it.
A transcript of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has also leaked, revealing a tense exchange.
President Trump told Turnbull that the US oversight deal on refugees heading to Australia was "ridiculous" and "stupid", and insisted that if he agreed to such an agreement - which came under President Obama's administration - he would look "dope-toting" after proposing a ban on refugees entering the US.
Trump ended the call after explaining to Turnbull that this was the most unpleasant call I'd had all day.
Tusk has testified again at the prosecution's office about Smolensk.
"He has something to fear", said the brother of the late president, the leader of the ruling Law and Justice party, Jaroslaw Kaczyński, in Tusk's address.
"I have nothing to fear, Kaczyński will not intimidate me", Tusk replied, blaming the current leadership for trying to abuse justice against political rivals.
According to TVN 24, a crowd of people were waiting for Tusk as he left the prosecutor's office, chanting Donald Tusk! and wishing the politician a hundred years.
Tusk thanked for the support and assured that he had a clear conscience: "I have nothing to fear and Kaczyński will not intimidate me".
He says he doesn't blame the prosecutors, but he has no doubt that the judiciary is meant to be a tool for the current Polish rulers against rivals, the opposition or people they don't like, and I'm afraid I'm one of that group.
That was his second time being questioned.
The former prime minister was questioned at the prosecutor's office for the second time, this time about the autopsy of the victims of the Smolensk disaster.
Additionally, there was a mix-up of bodies in the coffins.
Families were forbidden to open the coffins, and there must have been a reason.
And the reason was they were afraid of scandal, because it would weigh on Polish-Russian relations.
"Maintaining good relations at all costs, despite such a terrible event, should have served to make Donald Tusk a very important person in the EU", Kaczyński argued on Catholic TV channel Trwam.
He added that a possible conflict with Russia would ruin Tusk's chances of winning the most important seat in the union, of which Poland has absolutely nothing.
Kaczyński also said he warned German Chancellor Angela Merkel that things could go differently with Donald Tusk, but she didn't take notice.
Tusk was questioned for eight hours at the prosecutor's office on April 19.
Even then, he didn't testify as a suspect, only as a witness.
However, many considered his summons for questioning to be part of an apparent attempt by the Polish government and PiS leader Kaczyński to discredit Tusk as a political rival by linking him to various scandals.
The Prosecutor's Office in Poland is subordinate to the Minister of Justice, who acts as the Prosecutor-General.
The summons to the hearing came shortly after Tusk was elected head of the European Council, which Kaczyński had tried to prevent, but failed, during Merkel's visit to Warsaw.
At the EU summit, only Polish Prime Minister Beata Szydło protested against Tusk's mandate extension.
In this case, the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán also left Warsaw on the sidelines.
Burma and Senegal.
Where can Czechs vote?
In the autumn parliamentary elections, registered voters will be able to vote again on the composition of the chamber from Burma, Senegal or Luxembourg.
In these and several other countries, the Czech Republic has opened its representative offices since the last parliamentary elections in 2013.
It's a decree that regulates the delivery of ballots abroad.
The State Department has prepared an update, and it's currently in the comments process.
Four years ago, 10,000 Czech citizens abroad voted for MPs.
'Since the last amendment of the Ordinance in 2013, there have been some changes which need to be taken into account in these lists,' the Ministry justifies its approach.
"In some countries, new representative offices have been established, some offices have been closed down or the level of representation has changed", the report says.
The decree contains two annexes, the first of which lists the representative offices to which paper ballots are supplied.
This group of authorities includes the Czech Republic's representations in neighbouring countries, namely Germany, Poland, Austria and Slovakia.
More than 100 other Czech authorities will receive a press-edition ballot.
It's their list that's being changed by decree.
Four years ago, Czechs could vote, for example, at the Czech embassy in Libya or Zimbabwe.
Both embassies are closed today.
The Czech Republic also cancelled its representation in Bamako, Malaysia and Kyoto, Japan.
There will be no vote at the Consulate General in Donetsk.
The Czech Republic closed it in 2014 because of the war in eastern Ukraine.
New ones are on the embassy lists in Nairobi, Kenya, Dakar, Senegal, and Lusaka, Zambia.
In Asia, the Czech Republic has expanded its representation since the last parliamentary elections to include a consulate general in Irbil, Iraq, and Chengdu, the capital of the Chinese province of Sichuan.
The voting cards will also be available to registered voters at the Czech embassies in Burma and Cambodia.
Czechs abroad have been able to elect MPs at polling stations in representative offices or consulates four times so far.
Before each election, the State Electoral Commission draws lots to determine the district for which the candidates are voted abroad.
The first time was in 2002, when it was decided between the South Moravian candidates.
In the following two elections, Czechs abroad voted among South Czech candidates.
In 2013, as this year, the Central Bohemian Region was selected.
The number of Czechs voting abroad is steadily increasing.
At the premiere 15 years ago, some 3,800 people came to vote, in 2006 there were about 6,700 and four years later 8,222.
In the early parliamentary elections four years ago, 10,571 voters turned up at the embassies.
Moore's Ford Bridge massacre: activists remember racist lynching
The 1948 Ford Mercury passed by the onlookers of Monroe, Georgia, and peered toward Moore's Ford Bridge.
But before the car with four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge, a group of armed whites barricaded its way.
The leader of the group - a middle-aged man in a striped suit - pulled out a cigarette and looked at the windshield.
The passengers inside were trembling with fear.
"We want that Roger!" shouted the man.
Bring him to me!
Silence is broken by the roar of a young black man being pulled from the passenger seat.
This scene is fortunately a mere reconstruction of the events that occurred on July 22.
But when one of the men throws a rope over Roger's neck, the audience sighs with excitement.
Since 2005, a group of activists have returned to Moore's Ford Bridge to reconstruct the fateful night in 1946 when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcolm and George and Mae Murra Dorsey - were killed by members of the Ku Klux Klan.
No one's been tried for murder yet.
"It's amazing that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - even though we still see them in our community; even though we know their identities", said Tyrone Brooks, who is helping to re-organize the event.
It's a stain on our history and a burden on our souls.
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Georgia state congressman and a lifelong civil rights activist.
In his eyes, the reenactment of the event is a dramatic call to action, reminding the Monroe community every year that justice has not been done enough.
"We demand prosecution and closure of the case, we want peace of mind and reconciliation, but justice first", Brooks said.
Until then, the process of healing and reconciliation cannot begin.
A coroner covers one of the bodies of lynch victims at Moore's Ford on July 27, 1946.
According to FBI files obtained by NBC News, up to 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were expected to participate in the lynching.
But no one has been prosecuted yet.
Although the suspects remain at large for decades, civil rights advocates claim that both reasons for the lynchings - political and sexual - were known to all the townspeople.
In April 1946, the Supreme Court granted black citizens of Georgia the right to vote in elections scheduled for the summer.
And just in time for the summer election, the FBI says a black farmer, Roger Malcolm, was stabbed in a brawl by a white landowner, Barnett Hester, allegedly over his wife.
According to Brooks, there was a townwide rumor that Hester had been having intercourse with Malcolm's wife Dorothy and had brought her into a different state.
According to the FBI's statement, on July 25, 1946, then-prominent white landowner, Loy Harrison, posted a $600 bail for Malcolm.
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey.
On their way back from prison, just before entering the Moore's Ford Bridge, they were surrounded by a group of suspects.
As it turns out, the murders were planned and orchestrated by Harrison, and conducted by the FBI.
It is also clear that there was a collusion between state and local law enforcement who not only participated in the lynching, but also disposed of evidence and concealed the identities of witnesses.
Brooks was a little more concise on the whole thing.
"It was a massacre for the right to vote", he said.
The murders had a clear message for all black people in the area: "This is what happens if you register and vote".
The annual reenactment of the Moore's Ford Bridge event has been organized for nearly a decade by Cassandra Greene.
Her performance is graphic, engaging and apt, showing the deep-seated racism that many would like to see extinct in modern America.
Watching this reconstruction is not easy, and it's even harder to look away, but Greene says it makes sense.
"Nobody wants to talk about lynching because we have to face the uncomfortable feelings that lurk inside each of us", Greene said.
But we can't have a relationship unless you listen to what I've been through.
The main rehearsals for this year's production began in June, and on the very first day, about 30 actors - a dozen white, the rest black - swarmed into the room, where Greene introduced them to a very carefully planned performance.
Wade Marbaugh is acting as assistant director.
He's played the leader of the Kuklux Klan for many years, but he says the role is exhausting.
"I feel bad about it because it goes against who I am", Marbaugh said.
I think it's very important to remember this part of history regularly because we never want to go back to that time.
Actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, who play the roles of Roger Malcolm, also Barnett Hester, rehearse their roles.
The show opens with a fight - Malcolm argues with Hester and blames him for sleeping with his wife.
Get off my property!
There's no such thing as rascón.
There's a fight going on.
At that moment, everyone (at least every black actor) bursts out laughing.
Greene's the one who laughs the most.
"What happened?" he asks Rascón.
He's confused.
Was I too rude?
"No", Greene says cheerfully.
I just don't think white people used to say "n-r" in that tone.
That's right, one of the black actors is going to pop.
You have to put more emphasis on the R.
The energy in the room is suddenly better; the hostility is replaced by a sense of closeness.
Everyone wants the show to be authentic, just to be done for enough four victims of the massacre.
The actors repeat the scene.
Rascona's emphasis this time is on the correct pronunciation of the N word.
No one laughs anymore.
The show ends violently and quickly.
The roar, the gunshots... and the silence.
A woman dressed in black stands over the bodies of the actors and sings Billie Holiday's mournful song "Strange Fruit".
Every word, there's a sadness in the room.
Against this backdrop, a dozen or so onlookers wipe sweat and tears from their eyes.
There are practically equal numbers of blacks and whites in the audience.
One couple came all the way from Ithaca, New York, and many onlookers are from the surrounding area.
Each of them endures the local humidity for nearly eight hours, and Brooks leads them in droves to the graves of Malcolm and Dorsey.
Up until this point, the murders could be viewed from a distance, but now, standing in the same place where the lynchings took place, the atmosphere is eerie.
With the last words of the song, Greene calls the crowd to inspect the bodies.
Children kneel at the heads of their victims, watch for fake blood and still bodies, and whisper in their ears.
They're not dead, they're a little boy.
A few minutes go by and Greene thanks the audience.
The actors clean the rope and wipe their tears.
Bradshaw hugs Marbaugh, the man in the suit who played the leader of the Kuklux Klan.
Nick Rascona hugs his two fellow actors and cries in their arms; eventually, he is overcome with emotion.
"It's all right", one of the women whispers.
We know you're not gonna like this part.
But you had a reason.
Later that day, the audience will sit down with the actors for dinner.
At one table, a young white couple is talking enthusiastically about a show with a black couple they met today.
Denise Duplinski could hardly find the words to express her feelings about tonight's performance.
"It's hard to hear those ugly words and watch those ugly acts... that people who look like you do because they look like you", she said to the reconstruction.
"It makes me realize that lynching is still a hot topic", she added, "it's just called police fighting".
On the other side of the room, Tyrone Brooks is sitting in the courtroom enjoying dinner while talking about civil rights.
He says he's already started planning a show next year.
The reconstruction of these events is inspiring as it describes the fear we had to live with - but it is also a moment for reflection, he said.
If we don't learn from this, who knows... it could happen again.
People who don't know and study their country's history are doomed to repeat it.
I love the instructions.
A friend of mine says only a coward reads the instructions.
I disagree, quite the contrary.
It's one of the modern art forms, often pure surrealism.
I'm nostalgic for a time long ago when instructions for how to use anything were a rare occurrence.
So, for example, my first phonograph had just one piece of paper, and there were hieroglyphs on it that showed the connections of some of the components, and all of them had some kind of secret symbol.
When something broke down inside me after years, I offered that sheet to a shaman who wasn't afraid to unscrew the back plate.
He smiled and told me what the paper with the maze of lines was for.
Yes, it was a common aid in chronic toilet paper depletion.
He playedfully found the cable and allowed me to listen to the expensive vinyl records again.
The new age has brought new directions.
Even a relatively simple fruit juicer that simply held a cut grapefruit required about ten pictures.
A particularly successful design was a diagram describing how to insert one part into the other.
The setup was two-part, and there was simply no other way.
Reversing it required considerable effort, with the need to dismantle certain plastic parts.
My disregard for instructions ended up in my Seat Leon self-propelled.
The 2003 model year had a booklet with instructions for minor repairs, including the replacement of the flashlight bulb.
It was easy.
Three steps in all, and the job was done.
Unfortunately, the author of the manual failed to mention that while the bulb on the right was replaced, it was really only in three steps.
First, remove the cover.
Two, screw in a broken light bulb and screw in a new one.
3rd, pull the cover.
The bulb on the left had a problem with the battery housing.
At first I thought that by inserting my right upper limb into the car's interior, I would strike a spring, a screw, that would easily remove the cover, and then I would follow the points 1-3 of the economical author's service manual.
The bench is wrong.
That cover had no place, no room even for Cinderella's thin arm, let alone the fat Slytherin.
I've wasted half an hour of my life, and I've done it without any success.
The situation was further exacerbated by my wife's entrance into the garage, which was brought about by a roar and words that she heard from my mouth quite unusually.
"What are you doing here?" she asked, unashamedly.
My response took about 90 seconds, but, except for the vulgar terms, there were only two published words left.
I'm changing the light bulb.
"And what's taking you so long?" she risked a sentence that could be her last in a long-term relationship.
I slowly explained the problem to her, focusing on the torture of the author of the manual, where requiring a hot iron on the hand that wrote the manual, followed by her running away so that he could never write anything again, was merely an introduction to Hammer's wide range of instructions to witches, including his commissioned burning on a hill above Losin Castle.
"How about disassembling the box?" the woman spent disassembling the battery.
It was in desperation, and then step 1-3 was as easy and quick as the right side.
I thought I couldn't be surprised.
Until the day I got a call from a colleague who was just recovering from a breakdown after a screening by two State Drug Enforcement Administration officials.
I know him as a colleague of moderation, who has experienced the possible and the impossible in the industry, and who can tell wild stories in a calm voice.
"Suppose I get a ticket for not having a handwashing manual", he said in a low voice.
I gradually got the whole problem out of him, which was that he didn't have a picture of a hand washing manual above the sink in the patient's bathroom.
His argument to the commissioner that adults can wash their hands and that they do not need pictograms to do the usual decent work was not a cure and cost him a lot of money.
"She's not just like that", she told him.
He understood that simply rinsing the soapy palms with running water was a primitive act at the level of the cranial, that modern man, Homo sapiens sapiens, performed this ceremony in ten steps.
It is necessary to inform the public that the tap water must be drained.
The whole process has eleven steps, but at the end, the happy thing is that the person washed their hands exactly as the S.U.C.L. landlord ordered.
Finally, I must say, I've been inspired to prepare a detailed plan of action for the restroom.
The procedure is uniform in the matter of defecation, where there is no problem, but in the matter of urination, given certain differences between the two sexes, it will be necessary to display two instructions.
The problem remains with the pictograms, for perfecting the procedure involves drawing out all the anatomical details, which might provoke a certain indignation in the prudent visitor to the toilet, even though he may finally learn that he has spent his entire life wiping the hole with the completely wrong procedure.
Pearson will lay off 3,000 more employees and cut dividends in an effort to revive business
British education group Pearson said on Friday it would lay off an additional 3,000 employees and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent in response to another restructuring programme aimed at changing its business model.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the interested parties on the measures in question.
Pearson announced a plan to cut costs by a further £300 million ($394 million) in May as part of its third cost-cutting programme in a bid to revive a declining business due to the rapid development of digital education.
The company, which last month agreed to sell its stake in Penguin Random House to Bertelsmann, said its outlook for the year remained unchanged after reporting a one percent increase in first-half base sales to £2.05 billion.
Attack on convoy in Kabul: NATO soldiers killed in suicide bombing
A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in the Afghan capital Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and wounding several others, officials said.
Five soldiers and an interpreter were injured, NATO said.
According to unofficial reports, three civilians were also killed in the attack in the Qarabagh urban district.
Afghanistan has been hit by a bomb attack this month - more than 30 people were killed in a bombing at a Herat mosque on Tuesday.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.
NATO said in a statement that Tuesday's explosion occurred after a patrol along with members of the Afghan army were attacked by a "local person with a homemade explosive device".
The statement further stated that all wounded soldiers are out of danger and are in the US military hospital at Bagram Air Base.
According to the report, the Taliban and the Islamic State group's growing power in the Qarabagh region is a major source of concern for NATO Allied forces in nearby Bagram.
According to the UN, at least 1,662 civilians died in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, 20% of them in the capital.
In late July, a car bomb killed at least 30 people in Kabul's Shia neighborhood.
The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack.
A major explosion in the city centre on May 31 killed more than 150 people, the deadliest militant attack in the country since US forces toppled the Taliban government in 2001.
Violence is undermining the already dubious situation in Afghanistan and US President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of US troops to assist military and police forces in the country.
According to the report, the suicide attacks that he has witnessed in recent weeks have shaken public confidence in the government, its regulations and especially in the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
In response to the lawsuit, the EPA has reconsidered its decision to delay the smoking rule.
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has reversed its decision to delay an Obama administration law that required states to reduce emissions, just one day after 15 states sued the agency.
The EPA announced its decision to move forward with the Ozone Standards 2015 on Wednesday night, saying it was submitting the agency's commitment to cooperate with States.
We believe in dialogue with our national partners and we will listen to their views, said EPA Director Scott Pruitt in a statement.
Pruitt announced in June that the EPA was trying to delay ozone standards - which measure actual air pollution in specific areas of the country and then use the measurements to set limits to be met by October 2018.
A group of 15 mostly democratic states, including Washington, D.C., filed a lawsuit Tuesday, claiming that the EPA's actions were illegal.
President Donald Trump's administration is seeking to avoid many of the environmental regulations proposed by former President Barack Obama in what Trump says is an effort to kick-start economic growth.
But the new government's efforts have sparked a backlash from Democrats and conservative groups who fear the public health impact of emissions.
The EPA says on its website that breathing ozone-containing air can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms such as asthma.
The singer Ladislav Drummer was hit and bleeding!
This, a relatively new singer in our country, you may have already registered in June this year, when this almost unknown singer organized a monstrous event in Czech conditions, which was attended by such leading personalities as the master Karel Gott, Lucie Biała, Simona Krainová and many others, and the event was moderated by no one else but Leoš Mareš.
The purpose was simple, to appear to the public and present their music video for the song Sara, whose christening was attended by the above-mentioned personalities.
But few people know that the filming of the video, which took place in Russia, was not without problems and the singer Ladislav Bubnar himself had to be treated.
It was his first big production with the stars of the Russian National Ballet and it was not without its problems.
Sara's song is very emotional and it's based on the unhappy love of two lovers.
For the dramaticity of the scene, the singer's juice should have suggested a slap in the face in the video.
At one point, however, he hit him so hard and directly in the nose that the young singer had to be treated by doctors.
"It was a blow, I didn't expect it, I immediately had a nosebleed", Ladislav said.
The producers and colleagues on set said it was an unfortunate accident and Ladislav didn't respond in time.
Fortunately, the injury was not so severe as to affect the continuation of the filming.
We bring you the video clip of the young artist mentioned, you can also see the scene with the blow.
The bad version with blood, however, was not used.
Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko were discussing the possibility of a duel at a meeting.
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia, two fighters who could stage the most exciting lightweight boxing match ever, met for the first time at a meeting on Tuesday.
They were each in separate rooms at ESPN's offices in Los Angeles until Garcia, the undefeated lightweight champion of the World Boxing Council, sat down in the lobby to welcome Lomachenko, the World Boxing Organization featherweight champion.
After Garcia's unanimous victory over former four-time world champion Adrian Broner in Saturday's Showtime fight, both boxers have moved into the top five in the lightweight division.
Garcia reached out his right hand and said, "How's it going, champ?"
Good luck to you.
Lomachenko defends his title Saturday night at 7:00 p.m. against Miguel Marriaga on ESPN.
The boxers are posing for photographs and Lomachenko's manager Egis Klimas adds that a potential fight between the boxers would be "the perfect test".
"I'm a former featherweight champion", Garcia adds.
I must have gained weight because of the match with Broner, but I'm not that big.
I'm small at 130 pounds.
I'd like to get back into the lightweight division.
Lomachenko needs to put on weight again to get to the lightweight... then we can fight.
That's the fan he wants.
Why not fulfill it?
The little bugger agrees.
Boxing would benefit from this match.
Klimas has demanded a pay-per-view - part of his strategy. Lomachenko is set to make his lightweight debut later this year and next year face Garcia (37-0, 30 KOs), who has also expressed interest in a match against the eventual winner of the match Jorge Linares vs. Luke Campbell, who will face off for the lightweight title at the Forum Arena on September 23.
"The match should be a pay-per-view, the fans want it", said Garcia, who later said he was open to the possibility of the match being broadcast on the television station with the best bid.
We're the main attraction.
No one else will attract that kind of attention.
We wait for the right opportunity...
Garcia said he recognizes Lomachenko as a great boxer and he might be able to attend his fight on Saturday.
But Lomachenko wasn't swayed by Garcia's praise when he said that the three-division champion from Riverside looks too slow... sorry Mike, but you're talking about a knockout.
Garcia said his goal was to show strength and then box.
Both boxers reported feeling the rising tension before the duel.
You won't forget this match.
No other fight has attracted this much attention.
And I'd be happy to put it on the fire", said Garcia.
Lomachenko said, "I was waiting for the best boxers, and this is Mikey".
It's going to be a great game.
A young couple disappeared without a trace 12 years ago.
They just found their car at the bottom of the Volga.
The Russian twins Ilya Zhirnov and Kira Cherkasov have been missing since December 2005.
An extensive search was launched, but without success.
And the police finally closed the investigation for lack of evidence.
The families of the missing couple lived in uncertainty about knowing what happened to the couple.
After 12 years, the story came to a sad end.
The wreckage of their car was found by a lay diver on the floor of the Volga River in the town of Cheboksary, Chuvash.
Only the IDs left in the car have allowed the officers to identify a couple.
The documents survived a decade underwater, without which it would have taken the police a lot longer to identify the ones they found.
The couple was last seen when Zhirnov borrowed a car from his father to pick up his girlfriend from work.
The diver who discovered the car remains anonymous.
He reported his find to Cheboksary police, who pulled the car up to the beach the next day.
Investigators believe the young couple's death was an accident caused by an icy road leading up the river.
However, the investigation is ongoing and further details will be disclosed once it is concluded.
Recent results of age-limit tests in Sweden
Recent results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden who were subjected to a new age-assessing method show that over 80 percent of those interviewed were over 18, but not everyone believes their accuracy.
The Swedish Forensic Medical Agency (Råttsmedicinalverket) started conducting new tests earlier this year.
The aim of the method is to assess applicants more accurately in the evaluation of asylum applications. e measure was taken after the Swedish Migration Agency (Migrationsverket) was criticised for failing to correctly age some refugees who lied about their age.
To date, the Swedish Migration Agency has referred 6,880 cases for investigation and the Forensic Medical Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests carried out from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
80 percent (2002) were assessed as over 18 years of age, while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medical Agency judged that the respondent was possibly over 18 years of age.
In a further 423 cases it was decided that the respondent was under 18 years of age.
The tests shall only be accessed if the age of the respondent is disputed.
According to Johan Gransson of the Forensic Medical Agency, the results are consistent with the previous month.
Compared to last month, the statistics are holding in busy lanes and the numbers are very similar, he told The Local.
The higher number of applicants whose age was estimated to be over 18 does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lie about their age.
In May, the agency published results of 581 tests and said that 442 cases had been found to be 18 years of age or older.
Svenska Dagbladet investigated 581 published cases and found that in 243 cases the respondent said that he would be 18 this year.
Criticism has also been directed at the medical method of ageing, which involves X-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of the knee joints, which are then evaluated by dentists and radiologists.
One skeptic is Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, which, among other things, assesses the biological maturity of humans to determine when they have passed puberty.
I had reason to think about this issue, and I don't think these types of measurements to assess age are right.
Assessing biological age is in some ways highly uncertain.
"If we can't determine age with any accuracy, we shouldn't pretend otherwise", he told Metro.
The Agency's forensic medical agency GÃ¶ransson defended the decision by saying: In general, the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is small.
The highest risk is that the respondent is just under 18 years of age, which in this case corresponds to 10 per cent of all respondents.
Trump made a phone call threatening the president of Mexico.
US President Donald Trump threatened to withdraw his meeting with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in a January phone call if he publicly said his country would not pay for the wall.
Trump said in the interview that funding would be arranged somehow, although he admitted that it would have to be secured from other sources.
Trump has spoken openly to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull.
This is according to transcripts of the interviews published Thursday by the Washington Post.
Trump made building a wall on the southern border with Mexican money one of his main campaign promises last year.
In his first conversation with the Mexican president shortly after taking office, Trump undiplomatically reprimanded Pena Nieto for being critical of his wall plan.
He portrayed his southern neighbor as a growing political problem and pressured the Mexican president not to say publicly that his government would never pay for the wall.
"You can't tell the press this", Trump repeated in a January 27 interview, threatening to cut off contact with the Mexican president if he continued to issue defiant statements.
He says the funding will work out somehow and it will work out.
"But if you say Mexico won't pay for the wall, then I don't want to hang out with you gentlemen anymore because that's unacceptable to me", Trump said, according to the Washington Post.
He said the wall was the least important thing we were talking about, but politically it was probably the most important.
The executive order to build the wall was issued by Trump shortly after he took office.
Mexico's refusal to build and finance a 2,000-mile wall has strained relations between the two countries.
In late March, Trump said the project would be paid for by the United States.
Trump finally met his Mexican counterpart for the first time at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July.
The Washington Post also reported on Trump's phone call with Australian Prime Minister Turnbull on January 28.
The White House chief called the conversation ridiculous.
He reached this conclusion after discussing an agreement under which Australia would grant asylum to Central American refugees in exchange for the United States taking in people from detention facilities in Pacific Island States.
Trump thought the deal was stupid at first, but later he signed it.
"You can certainly say this is not the deal you made, but you're going to have to stick to it", Turnbull told Trump.
There were some passages in the phone conversation with Turnbull that were almost cheerful, like when Trump praised Australia's refusal to accept refugees arriving in boats as a good idea.
"You're worse than me", Trump joked.
Suddenly, though, the tone of the conversation sharpened.
"I hate to see these people", Trump remarked.
I assure you, they're bad.
That's why they're in jail now.
"They're not going to be great people who go work for the local dairy farmers", he said.
He also noted in the interview that a fugitive could become a Boston bomber in five years.
Trump held phone calls with a number of world leaders in late January, about a week after he took office, often several in one day.
He ended up calling the call with Turnbull the least pleasant of his day.
Before he finished, he pointed out that he had a pleasant conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin earlier.
They executed Rana's killer in front of a crowd.
Her father was watching.
The execution took place in a square in the Yemeni capital Sana'a.
Muhammad al-Maghrabi chose a little girl named Rana Almatari, who lived in his neighborhood, as his victim.
Al Maghrabi kidnapped the girl, took her to her father's house, where he raped her and strangled her with his bare hands.
He then raped her body and dumped it near the mosque.
The violent death of a little girl has shaken the entire country, which faces the threat of civil war.
Yahya Almatari was in the front row of a crowd of 1,000 who had gathered to witness the execution.
Muhammad al Maghrabi was convicted under Sharia law.
The victim's father told the media about his feelings after the execution.
I feel like I'm reborn.
I'm relieved to hear that.
It's a new day in my life.
Other family members were present, joining the crowd in shouting "Long live justice".
The rapist was brought to the square by a police van, from which he was pulled out.
The officers tied him up and put him on his stomach.
One of the officers turned his gun on him and opened fire at close range.
The crowd cheered every shot that was fired.
Mr. Almatari told MailOnline that justice was served in accordance with the country's legal system.
"Justice, Allah and Sharia law have prevailed", he added.
I was standing in Sana'a's Liberation Square waiting for the execution of my daughter's killer.
Then my family and I went to the morgue.
We took Ran's tiny body and buried it in a nearby cemetery.
My wife Jamileh and I are grateful that justice was served.
The police feared that the crowd gathered in the square would go mad, the killer would be caught and lynched.
The execution was ordered by a court run by Shiite Houthis.
Originally, Maghrabi was sentenced to 100 lashes immediately after his arrest, but his act aroused such outrage that the judge ruled in favor of the death penalty.
Al Maghrabi was arrested two days after the girl disappeared on June 27.
Ran's family knew him well.
When police searched the basement of his home, they discovered evidence that the man had planned his act.
Mr. Almatari described him as a monster.
What could his motive be?
Even an animal would be more merciful to the Wrath.
"Our family has no enemies and the injuries that Rana's body sustained were terrible", he told the media.
"The wound disappeared in the afternoon, we reported it to the police that day, we told the newspapers and all our TV stations, posters with her picture were everywhere", he continued.
Everyone thinks the police got a tip from the parents of the murderers who suspected their son of a terrible crime.
The girl's mother, Jamileh, had to be hospitalized after learning that her daughter's body had been found.
Rana used to go out and play with the other kids in the neighborhood.
After about 10 or 15 minutes, I went out to see where he was.
We looked everywhere, but Rana was gone.
We walked around our block, our friends took cars and drove around, but we looked in vain.
Yemenis, disgusted by the crime, began to gather outside the police station where al-Maghrabi was being held, demanding immediate punishment.
A representative of the Ministry of Justice read the investigation record to the crowd to calm them.
The defendant did not appear to show any remorse for his actions.
Just before the execution, the officers read the sentence to him, but the condemned man looked at his executioner only slightly.
The whole event was filmed for national television, but many of the footage was taken by the crowd and posted on the Internet.
The governor of West Virginia announced a change of political party.
West Virginia's Democratic governor Jim Justice announced Thursday night at a rally for President Trump that he was switching parties.
"Whether you like it or not, the Democrats have turned their backs on me", said Governor Justice.
"Today, after much prayer and thought, I announce... "as a citizen of West Virginia, I can no longer support you as the Democratic governor.
The crowd of onlookers burst into exultation.
"I'm running for the Republican nomination tomorrow", Justice added.
As your coach, I can tell you it's time to jump into another game.
Trump has promised to make a major announcement to the people at a rally in West Virginia.
Trump won West Virginia by 42 points, and Justice did not endorse Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
Justice, who Forbes magazine says is the only billionaire in the entire country, was elected in 2016.
Forbes adds that Justice inherited a large fortune from his father and owns several coal mines.
His net worth is estimated at $1.59 billion.
Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee issued a statement Thursday night saying, "The departure of Governor Justice is another blow to the Democratic Party, which is putting obstacles in our way instead of lifting our country".
"For a Democratic Party with only 15 governors and the fewest legislatures in history, the Justice Governor's announcement is the last straw for an already-dissatisfied leaderless party that is desperately trying to find a positive and unifying message", RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement to CBS News.
Sebastian Coe praises Russia's sincere apology for the doping scandal
Former world champion Sebastian Coe praised Russia on Thursday for its sincere apology over the doping scandal, but reiterated that the time had not yet come for Russia to return to the world of sport.
At the IAAF Congress - held on the eve of the World Championships in Athletics - Russian athletics chief Dmitry Shylakhtin said that his country's expulsion from the world of sport was the right thing to do and that he was determined to fight doping.
He apologized to all the athletes who lost their gold and silver medals in this way.
Despite his comments, members of the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban, which took effect in November 2015 after a World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) report found that Russia had encouraged doping of its athletes.
"I think we saw a very honest response and presentation today", IAAF President Sebastian Coe told reporters.
All the members of the Council and the Congress were pleasantly surprised that Russia had admitted its mistake and was working with all its might to correct and restore the proper functioning of the entire Federation.
Coe said he was also 'pleased' that Russia had adopted the criteria for its reintroduction.
"I think today was a very successful day and we've moved on to the next stage, but Congress supports the crisis team's recommendation to maintain the sanctions imposed on Russia", Coe added.
We must do everything we can to stabilize the situation in the coming months.
Our goal has always been to separate the honest athletes from the dishonest", he concluded.
At the World Championships in Athletics, which begin on Friday in London, 19 Russian athletes will compete under a neutral flag, meeting strict IAAF rules.
IAAF crisis chief Rune Andersen said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet several criteria before it can be allowed back.
Drug tests are still inadequate and the suspended coaches are still in action, he told reporters in London after a presentation to the IAAF board.
The CzechTrade public contract was awarded to a company led by František Savov, which is being sued by the State.
The public contract for the state pro-export agency CzechTrade was awarded to the publishing house of the Young Front, František Savov.
The officials gave him a 100% score on all quality criteria.
They didn't mind that the Czech state was prosecuting Savov for tax evasion and requesting his extradition to the Czech Republic.
The pro-export agency of the Ministry of Industry and Trade, CzechTrade, awarded a four-year procurement contract for the provision of editorial content for the BusinessInfo portal in April.
The contract, worth a total of CZK 30.8 million, was awarded to the publishing house of the Young Front of businessman František Savov.
The Czech police accused him of tax evasion in 2014 and are pursuing him on the run.
Savov has fled to the UK and the Czech Republic is seeking his extradition.
The case was reported to the server Aktuálně.cz.
According to the original criteria, CzechTrade was to decide on the award of 60 per cent of the contract on the basis of the price offered and the remaining 40 per cent on the basis of the beauty contest, i.e. the quality of the project.
The second criterion was particularly helpful for Savovo's company.
According to Dotyk.cz, it received 100 points in all sub-criteria of quality.
This was what eventually pushed it ahead of another candidate, Vltava Labe Media VLM, which offered a better price.
While the Young Front operated at 404,900 CZK per month, the VLM offered 324,350 CZK.
Unlike Young Front, however, it received below-average ratings from the reviewers on all qualitative criteria, with a total of 62 points.
The tender also involved the consultancy firm BDO Advisory and the digital agency R-Media, which, like the Aktuálně.cz server, is owned by Economia.
VLM's publisher raised several objections to the tender result, considering that its evaluation was unfair and insufficiently reasoned.
Following their rejection, it was decided to challenge the competition to the OHIM.
It considers that CzechTrade acted unlawfully.
'The applicant is convinced that the contracting authority has reached a decision on the selection of a public procurement contractor on the basis of a purely subjective assessment, clearly favouring the participant Mladá fronta, a.s., to the detriment of the applicant and other contractors,' reads the request for opening proceedings filed with the OHIM this week, published by the Aktuálně server.
According to VLM CEO and Chairman of the Board of Directors, Michal Klýma, the scores of the selection committee appear to be unreliable and the 100 percent evaluation of the Young Front project by all its members as extremely suspicious.
"Any independent observer must consider such a miraculous success of one of the contestants unlikely and suspicious", he told Actualidad Climática.
CzechTrade has not yet commented on the situation.
CzechTrade does not comment on public contracts until they are concluded.
All information on the contract you mention is published in accordance with the law in the Profile of the contracting authority and in the Procurement Bulletin.
"After the contract is completed, a full written report will be published, but we cannot comment on its progress during the contract", said agency media representative Štěpán Dlouhý to Dotyk.cz.
The youth front responded by saying that it considered it extremely problematic that Economia had interfered with a competition with an article in Aktuálně.cz, where it had its own business interests.
However, this fact was mentioned in the article mentioned.
She was able to benefit from the tender because she had been providing editorial services to BusinessInfo for the previous four years.
The contract was first awarded in 2013 when the Ministry of Industry and Trade was headed by Mr. Martim Cuba ODS.
Františka Savova blames the police for tax evasion in connection with excessive VAT deductions by his companies, which he has allegedly caused the Czech state up to CZK 770 million in damage.
The Czech Republic has been requesting his extradition from the United Kingdom since 2014.
According to Savov, the leader of the ANO movement, Andrej Babiš, who controls the Mafra publishing house, is behind the criminalization.
A London court last year rejected Savovo's appeal against extradition, but the businessman appealed.
"From our point of view, the case has not moved anywhere since last year, we have not received any information from the UK on the acquisition of legal force of the judgment to date", said to Aktuálně.cz the spokesperson of the Prague city prosecutor's office, Štěpánka Zenklová.
In addition to owning the Young Front, Savov was involved in Harvestor Limited, a Cyprus-based company that controlled the Samson brewery in Český Budějovice, and in the Cypriot company Maraflex, which profiles itself as an investment fund buying distressed assets.
He also controls a bankrupt company, Heavy Machinery Services, formerly Legios, which is over three billion crowns in debt.
In the past, Savov was also linked to the expropriation of property from the former Socialist Youth Union.
The biker was riding on sidewalks and parks, ended up in the dirt.
The motorcyclist drew attention to himself by recklessly driving through the streets, sidewalks and park trails of Úšovice.
When the patrol started chasing him, he decided to run away from it in the direction of the Observatory.
"Police were following the man with caution when he lost control of his motorcycle on a side road behind Mariánské Lázně and crashed into a field", police spokesman Daniel Dvořák said.
The accident eventually brought an emergency helicopter to transport the injured motorcyclist to a hospital in Pilsen.
Later, the police discovered that the motorcyclist did not have a license, the license plates on the motorcycle were stolen, the license plate number was erased, and the license plate itself was removed.
So it's possible the machine was stolen.
The motorcycle's origin is the subject of further investigation.
"A breath test at the scene ruled out the presence of alcohol in the driver, but the test came back positive for methamphetamine", a police spokesman added.
How football's financial rules will affect Neymar's move to Paris
The rules restricting European football club funding in no way affect Neymar's record transfer from Barcelona in Spain to Paris Saint Germain in France.
Any penalty for Paris Saint-Germain will be imposed by EUFA, the body that oversees European football teams and has the power to ban teams from the prestigious Champions League.
The financial fair play rules (FFP) introduced by UEFA in 2011 stipulate that PSG will have to prove that Neymar's transfer was not financed without large losses.
Barcelona paid, in reverse, €222 million just to buy Neymar out of his contract and Neymar will be demanding a salary of several tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are some financial terms of Neymar's move to France.
With PSG being funded by a wealthy Qatari family that has made a fortune from energy sales, they can afford to bring Neymar into an already star football family.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not provided any evidence that the aid was granted in breach of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
The FFP was introduced by Michel Platini after his appointment as UEFA Director in 2007.
The former French player believed that clubs that go into debt in their pursuit of new players end up cheating and risk bankruptcy if the banks or owners refuse to provide them.
In 2011, the FFP rules shifted their focus from club debts to monitoring their losses.
This change meant that the business model Roman Abramovich used with Chelsea in 2003 - buying a club with potential and spending huge sums on players and building a global brand - suddenly wasn't so profitable.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet decided whether the aid measure is compatible with the internal market.
And despite Platini having to step down in 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin is determined to uphold the ban on overspending.
"The FFP rules are still in place and we are committed to strengthening them in the future", Andrea Traverso, FFP enforcement officer, told The Associated Press last week.
The Commission notes that the sale of the assets of the two clubs was not a transaction between the two parties.
Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so the transfer can be broken down to EUR 44.4 million annually for five years.
The first wave of the FFP's highest sanctions hit PSG in 2014 along with Manchester City, which is owned by the Abu Dhabi group.
The Commission notes that the Commission has not yet received any comments from the French authorities on the measures taken by the French authorities to comply with the conditions of Article 107 (1) TFEU.
UEFA is wary of teams that may try to circumvent financial regulators by increasing their revenues through companies linked to club owners.
The Commission notes that the Qatari authorities have not provided any information on the financial situation of the club.
The Commission also notes that the Commission has not yet received any information on the financial situation of the club.
Some of Neymar's earnings at PSG could be paid by the 2022 World Cup Qatar organizing committee, according to some reports.
However, PSG and the officials of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar denied the fact that Neymat should become a World Cup ambassador in football and that such a maneuver would be easily detected by UEFA officials.
Previous sanctions placed on PSG mean that UEFA will closely monitor any attempt to circumvent the rules,
According to a statement from insiders on Tuesday, UEFA has not opened any investigation into Neymar's move to PSG.
The source of this report wished to remain anonymous as he is not authorized to comment on the situation with PSG, The Associated Press reported.
The Commission notes that the French authorities have not provided any information on the financial situation of the two airports.
The accounts for the current financial year have not yet been published.
PSG expects Neymar's arrival to be a huge opportunity for sponsors, merchandising and shirt sales.
The club promises to increase their turnover by up to 30 percent.
Spanish league officials, obviously concerned about the departure of one of the biggest stars, sought to thwart Neymar's departure, arguing that PSG would violate FFP rules.
"It is a clear case of 'financial doping' by club and state", La Liga president Javier Teba told Spanish newspaper AS, referring to the ownership of PSG by the Qatari syndicate.
Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, whose club is owned by an American sports mogul, shares the same La Liga stance on club funding.
"It's the result of a property that has fundamentally changed the world of football over the last 15 years", Wenger was heard saying on Thursday.
Once you become the club owner, anything is possible.
The rules of financial fair play are very difficult to enforce because the state may have different interests in such players joining its club.
Change is painful, but we must believe.
16,000 cheering fans on their feet.
Tomáš Rossky is going to the square.
Same scene as Sunday's game against the Bohemians.
The Spartan midfielder was making a play against Red Star, scoring a few goals, but his teammates didn't go for the black.
The flying team, pumped with new multimillion-dollar reinforcements, finishes the European Cup after an opening double.
Was it hard to do anything else with the game after Belgrade's goal?
After the goal, we had to shoot four, which was difficult for us.
We wanted to at least not lose, to build our confidence so we could bounce back from the next game.
We had some chances.
We need to work together as a team and move our game.
Why has Sparta not been able to get into the fight for so long?
The game is so elaborate.
The rivals' combinations were much better than ours.
We didn't get anywhere, we only fired once in halftime.
It's a very small amount of money, of course, when you have to win by two or three goals.
The second half was much better, we managed to play them in the final third.
But you have to push your opponent into positions like this more often.
Is the problem with the large number of changes in the lineup?
Of course, it's one of the pains of forming a new team.
We've only played three competitive games and the lineup keeps changing.
It's about the coach finding the perfect eleven to sit in.
Is it encouraging to you that you've already played parts of two games in a row?
It's still just part of the game.
I don't know how my condition will develop or when I can finally play again.
Are you still optimistic about the changes that have taken place in Sparta?
We have to be, or else.
It's the same as with an injury.
If you don't believe, you can't go back.
Sparta has made a decision, we must be optimistic, or the situation will get worse.
Fans came in large numbers again, but left in dismay.
What message can you send them?
There was another wonderful visit, just like with Bohemia.
I'm terribly sorry we can't please them with a better performance.
Show them something to come back for next time.
We can thank them for coming.
I don't remember having visitors like that when I played here 15 years ago.
Can a season without trophies at least be a benefit to the league?
We're fighting each other right now, playing games, so it's not that big of an advantage.
Extreme tax evasion carries a businessman up to ten years in prison.
The Constitutional Court has rejected a complaint by businessman Jiří Tomán, who is serving a 10-year prison sentence for tax evasion.
The estimated damage is CZK 645 million.
Toman claimed in his complaint that the justice system had violated his fundamental rights, and that the findings of the Zlín and Olomouc courts were incomplete.
However, the Constitutional Court judges declared the complaint unfounded, the Czech Criminal Court found from the court's database.
The Supreme Court is not another court of appeal.
'It cannot, as a fourth instance, deal with the factual or legal issues allegedly raised by the ordinary courts, unless they constitute a violation of constitutionally protected rights and freedoms,' the resolution states.
Toman was tried as a fugitive.
The verdict is binding since November 2015, when it was confirmed by the Supreme Court in Olomouc.
At the time, Toman was in extradition detention in Argentina, where he was, according to the resolution, at the time of the ICC decision.
The penalty imposed is at the upper limit of the legal rate, which the verdict says is equal to the damage done.
The Supreme Court has described the case as an extreme tax evasion that has a macroeconomic impact on the state budget.
The man was chairman of World Service from 2005 to 2008.
The damage of CZK 645 million was caused only in the period from January to July 2008, the total leakage exceeding one billion according to the expert.
However, for procedural reasons, it was no longer possible to prosecute Toman for the full amount.
According to the indictment, World Service failed to include all invoices in its tax returns.
Instead of monthly VAT and excise duties of at least tens of millions of kroner, she paid taxes in the hundreds of thousands.
World Service and some of the companies it did business with have a relationship with businessman Radomir Vybíral, who was sentenced to 13 years in prison by the courts for VAT fraud in the fuel trade.
His complaint was also rejected by the Constitutional Court.
The shows "Summer of No Survival" and "Comrade Detective" play on a nostalgic string.
This iteration of the story is nostalgic for both the famous characters of the 1980s; the dirty 1990s (when the geniuses David Wain and Michael Showalter introduced the MTV comedy sketch show The State); and of course, the modern times, specifically 2001, before stars like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd broke into bigger projects.
As a cultural artifact, it's a light parody, but also the epitome of our modern Facebook era of lasting memories.
From the franchise's perspective, it looks like someone's running out of breath.
The series First Day of Camp did surprisingly well - not only because of its absurd humour (for example, the story of the invention of a talking can of vegetables, which was narrated by H. Jon Benjamin).
The authors strayed from the main point of the joke - middle-aged actors playing horny teenage children - and could not mock the previous events.
The sequel to Ten Years Later, in which the adults play the adults, does not push the emotional plane as much and the satire is sporadic, including parodies of '90s thrillers like The Hand in the Cradle.
At one point, the character finds a pile of junk, an Apple Powerbook, roller skates and "a lot of other stuff from 1991".
Many of the main story lines are repeated.
The good-hearted Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a writer, still hasn't moved on from his love for Katie (Marguerite Moreau).
Victor is still a virgin.
Not to mention the crazy plot involving Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) being instigated by George H. W. Bush (very well cast Michael Ian Black).
As always, the best part of the franchise is the many side stories.
Especially amusing is watching the eternally young Rudd with the long hair, aka the character Matt Dillon from The Young Ones, whose once respectable Andy character is now an old fart.
The franchise could be triggered by moments of random madness, like the return of Seven Up, until it reaches what I assume will be a logical conclusion: Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later, when in the final scene, the entire group heads to the premiere of Years to Die.
Comrade Detective on Amazon, meanwhile, appeals to a different kind of nostalgia: the Cold War revival of the series Such Normal Americans, the film Atomic Blonde: No Regrets, and even the series GLOW, which pits the icons of the Eastern and Western wrestling scenes.
The comedy by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, directed by Rhys Thomas, is a television adaptation of a play about two Romanian police officers in 1980s Bucharest who fight for truth and atheism in the Marxist-Leninist way.
The main roles - the tenacious Gregor and the idealistic Joseph - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Street, dubbed into English by Channing Tatum (executive producer of the series) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
It's a wonderful idea.
Unfortunately, it's not much more than that.
Some jokes make you laugh (like cops watching chess on TV - a parody of football).
The series was voiced by many well-known actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny.
But Comrade Detective is too focused on a clumsy propaganda drama - including a Reagan-masked killer - and that's how it looks.
Six long episodes is too much fun and comedy moments are not enough.
At a shorter clip, the propaganda satire in Comrade Detective could work, as in the scene where Gregor and Joseph repeatedly visit the U.S. Embassy, in whose lobby two fat people are eating hamburgers piled on a large pile.
The clear message to an imaginary communist audience is the fact that Western culture can turn everything into food and orgies.
The Romanian inventors were right: we do this to our own culture, just as we do to theirs.
Russian athletes have not waited for the lifting of the ban from the IAAF.
The International Athletics Federation IAAF at its congress in London confirmed the extension of the international ban on Russian athletes due to a state-sponsored doping program.
The voting on the World Championship field, which begins on Friday, has gone as expected.
166 delegates voted to renew the ban, with only 21 voting against.
The main reason for the refusal is, in particular, the failure of Russia to meet all the requirements for the introduction of an anti-doping system, as stated by the head of the IAAF Special Investigation Group, Rune Andersen, before the congress.
His group recommended that the ban be maintained.
Some of the older doping cases remain unsolved, many suspected athletes have not yet been heard, and the country still has coaches with a disgraced reputation.
The Russian Anti-Doping Agency RUSADA, which does not meet the standards of the World Anti-Doping Agency, is also not yet fully functional.
However, RUSADA can now conduct testing under the supervision of foreign experts and the British Anti-Doping Agency.
"While progress has been made, much more work remains to be done", said IAAF president Sebastian Coe.
The Russian Athletics Federation was suspended in November 2015, and Russian athletes missed the Rio Olympics last year, among other things.
Despite the ban on the upcoming World Championships, 19 Russians will compete who have previously proven to have been tested for extended periods outside the Russian anti-doping system.
But they will not be allowed to race in the national colors and if they win, they will not be allowed to play the Russian anthem.
The Bank of England will maintain the interest rate at 0.25%
The Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rate will remain unchanged, following sluggish economic growth and weak inflation that has stifled speculation about strong growth.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue to lag behind interest rate maintenance - despite the tightening of household budgets.
The policy makers of the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted six to two to keep the interest rate at 0.25%. e results of the vote to raise the interest rate supported sluggish economic growth, supported by weak growth.
In its annual inflation report, the bank forecast growth of 1.7% in 2017 and 1.6% in 2018, and warned that the contraction in household budgets would continue.
The Bank also indicated that growth was expected over the next few years due to Brexit-induced inflation and that rents from liquidity should increase more than expected on the financial markets.
Committee members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package, which was designed to boost the economy and was put in place a year ago in response to Brexit.
As a result, the Temporary Rate Facility, which will offer cheap subsidies to banks, is due to come into effect from next February, although the Bank of England has said it will now offer £15 billion less than the planned £115 billion.
Just before the decision, the Bank stated: MPC forecasts that gross domestic product (GDP) will stagnate in the short term, together with pressures on real household incomes and burdens on consumption.
On the issue of interest rates, the Bank stated that monetary policy will need to tighten its belts to calm inflation, at a higher rate than the markets expect.
Markets are currently forecasting a first increase in the third quarter of next year and further increases in 2020.
The Bank stressed, however, that any increase would be 'gradual' and 'limited'.
The Bank has lowered its growth forecast for this year and next year from the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.
The Commission established the profitability of the sampled Union producers by expressing the pre-tax net profit of the sales of the like product to unrelated customers in the Union as a percentage of the turnover of those sales.
The pound has fallen against the dollar and the euro since the forecast was published.
The pound fell by 0.5% to $1.31 and by 0.4% to €1.11.
The decision to maintain the status quo came after disappointing growth dampened hopes for further growth - GDP stalled at 0.3% in the second quarter, compared with 0.2% in the previous three months.
The growth is likely to remain at 0,3% in the third quarter, although it is expected to increase slightly towards the end of the year, according to the Bank.
The latest inflation report is little comfort to households hit by soaring inflation and poor wage growth, which the bank said will only get worse before it increases.
The report also states that monetary policy cannot prevent income declines in the coming years, but wages are expected to increase significantly towards the end of the three-year forecast.
The economy is also expected to grow thanks to strong demand for British goods due to the weak pound, which offsets the lower percentage of consumer spending.
The decision comes a year after rates were cut to 0.025 percent in August last year in response to the shocking vote on the EU referendum, which caused the pound to fall.
The Bank estimates that full price and economic integration will take at least four years.
Prior to the Bank's decision on the latest rates, many were demanding a rate hike, coupled with rising inflation, which was putting increasing pressure on households.
Inflation fell back to 2.6% last month from 2.9% in June, despite the bank saying it expected this change and that inflation should rise again over the course of next month.
The Bank stated that the excess relative to the 2% target was wholly due to the weak pound.
Andrew Montlake, CEO of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said: Given the recent drop in swap rates, it looks like competition in the mortgage market will only increase once lenders start vying for contracts with a good outlook for the end of the year.
The market is looking particularly good for those who are ending existing contracts and re-mortgages - with no-fee options as well as low rates that are gaining in popularity.
The NHS is prescribing a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 patients
Patients will be able to access 'transformative' HIV prevention treatments from September following a Supreme Court ruling on NHS funding.
England's National Health Service (NSH) has announced that the pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) pill, which is taken before sex and reduces the risk of infection in high-risk patients by up to 86 percent, will be offered through the NHS to around 10,000 patients over a three-year trial period.
NSH agreed to fund the trial after an appeal court upheld a Supreme Court decision last year that the NHS had the funds to pay for PrEP despite a statement that the drug should be funded by local authorities.
The decision, announced on Thursday, was welcomed by NHS England from the mouth of CEO Simon Stevens as a 'significant intervention', while the National Aids Trust (NAT) described the decision as a 'decisive moment'.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to start admitting patients, with more clinics to join in October and full implementation across England by April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an HIV medicine given before sex to reduce the risk of contracting HIV.
Tests have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the risk of HIV transmission between patients at risk.
PrEP before sex means that there is a sufficient amount of specific medications in the patient's body to prevent infection.
These medicines can be taken every day or at least two hours before sex.
Patients tested included gay or bisexual men, transgender people, and people with HIV-positive partners who were not successfully treated.
Clinics will identify eligible participants who sign up to participate in the trial, including men, women, transgender people and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not yet controlled by appropriate treatment.
People living and registered with a GP in the UK can also register with their local sexual health clinic and apply for potential participation in testing.
The programme will cost taxpayers £10 million and NHS England signed a contract this week to distribute the drugs after winning an international public procurement.
The trial period is designed to collect clinical evidence and assess the full potential, targeting, use and implementation of PrEP at large scale.
Simon Stevens added: This important intervention should complement and fully leverage the ever-expanding and increasingly successful HIV prevention effort.
It is another milestone in more than 30 years of trying to stop one of the greatest challenges to human health.'
Deborah Gold, executive director of the National AIDS Trust, said: "We are at a critical juncture in the fight against HIV.
If PrEP is given correctly and to patients at risk, it offers the possibility of reversing the English HIV epidemic.
Starting in September, NSH will offer patients at high risk of HIV infection a powerful new tool that is individually controlled and does not require a partner to be persuaded, resulting in improved quality of life for many.
We welcome this declaration.'
Ian Green, chief executive of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said: "The number one priority must be to rapidly roll out testing across the country; we must ensure it is available to every patient.
We now have an experimental drug, PrEP, and we are well on our way to protecting the more than 10,000 people at risk of HIV infection.'
Shadow Health Secretary Sharon Hodgson said: "The start of the PrEP trial period is a welcome and long-awaited change after months of delays and delays by the government.
The evidence suggests how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to preventing HIV and ending transmission of this life-threatening infection.
The following tests will bring us one step closer to fully understanding the benefits of PrEP.
It is now important that we start testing nationwide as soon as possible to protect people who are exposed to HIV and together to stop the spread of HIV in society.'
High-rise living: a mezzanine and clever design turned this tiny apartment in Earls Court into a spacious home
Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, exchanged a large house in Knightsbridge for an apartment in Earls Court in 2014.
It's on the first floor of the Queen Anne smart terrace - a striking example of modern design that makes the most of available space.
"I used to live with my ex-husband in a much larger house in Knightsbridge", Joanne said.
I was looking for something more affordable.
I came across this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same ceiling height.
I fell in love with him instantly and nodded to him the very same day.
Since then, the 1,000-square-foot apartment has undergone a complete renovation.
A one-room apartment with a complicated layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage and a mezzanine to take advantage of the high ceiling.
I wanted high ceilings, big windows and lots of light.
Those were my demands, she said.
To this end, she hired Erfan Azadi from the Notting Hill-based design and development studio Duck & Shed and used a nearly 13-foot ceiling to create a home that was not just a project but a place to live.
The ceiling was not high enough to accommodate two gaps - so the challenge for the architects was to create a floor space that could be walked upright.
Erfan had to engage his creative mind.
"The steel structure is quite complicated", he explained.
We had to arrange both spaces so we could walk upright.
It was not only a matter of building a simple platform, but also bending the steel structure so that it was at the right height above and below the ceiling.
This arrangement allowed Erfan to construct two full-fledged rooms on top of each other - and at the same time add to the drama.
In the attic, she looks out onto the beautiful living room of the old Retrouvius-designed copper window frames.
The mirrored furniture in gold, the silver lines and the retro chandelier Serge Mouille create a unique style.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in dramaticity, space and lighting.
The short corridor is mirrored on both sides, making it look longer.
The mirror bar in the kitchen looks like a window to the next room.
There are storage areas with mirrors at the entrance doors for the storage of cutlery and glassware.
The advantage of the living room, which gives the whole apartment the impression of being considerably larger, is that it can be separated from the kitchen when not in use.
Folding kitchens are nothing new.
But what's unique about this solution is the folding doors.
We had to work out the technical side, Erfan says about the reinforced hinged doors.
The doors are equipped with counterweights to make them very easy to unzip.
By using space and storage wisely, Joanne gained an additional 50 square feet [16 m2] of living space, a second bedroom, and a better overall layout.
"When it comes down to it, what you're selling is living space - or an appreciation of your property", Erfan said.
A real estate agent basically calculates the price of an apartment based on the living area when entering it.
In this case, the living area has been increased while maintaining quality materials that give the space a luxurious appearance.
"The material is very important because you touch it and you form an emotional bond with home", Erfan added.
You're not gonna fall in love with the power lines in the walls.
Yes, they are important, but they won't win your heart.
As it turns out, quality design and enhancement of living space can turn a simple apartment into a masterpiece.
And like Joanne, you may eventually decide to stay.
The United States is disengaging.
The cultural and political divide between the blue and red states is widening.
California has issued a travel ban for its citizens to Tennessee and seven other states.
The state of Tennessee retaliated by imposing a retaliatory travel ban on its citizens to California.
Of course, this is not a complete ban, but US citizens can travel freely in all 50 states.
The point is, California has banned the spending of state funds on travel for its citizens to eight other states, namely Alabama, South Dakota, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee and Texas.
Who's gonna stop this madness?
California is very LGBT-friendly, and it considers any expression of disapproval of the LGBT lifestyle discrimination.
Tennessee, however, has passed a conscientious objection law that says a psychotherapist who has a moral problem with therapy for LGBT patients is not obligated to provide it, but is obligated to provide those patients with another therapist who does not have that problem.
Texas and other states have passed laws that exempt religious charities that have given birth babies to same-sex couples from the obligation to give the babies to same-sex couples.
Because of these conscientious objection laws, California has banned the funding of travel by its citizens to eight states of the Union from its own resources.
In practice, this means that California professors cannot have trips to science symposia in, say, Texas paid for by their universities, because they're co-funded by the state of California.
Similarly, school sports teams cannot travel to tournaments or competitions, for example, in Tennessee with the financial support of their schools.
They have to get either federal grants for their travel, but it's absurd for the federal government to fund travel for citizens from state A to state B, or private sponsorship.
Tennessee ran out of patience and its legislature passed a bill with a resolution saying it also dislikes California's policies of high taxes, high government spending, high deficits and tolerance for illegal immigrants, but still, it is not reversing the travel ban in California.
He's importing them in retaliation for the California travel ban on Tennessee.
The same shall apply to any Member State of the Union which, for any reason whatsoever, imposes a similar travel ban on another Member State.
He also called on the parliaments of all countries to stop this madness.
That's the facts, now the commentary.
The situation is toxic.
First of all, it's all constitutional, nothing is unconstitutional.
States have the right to enact laws on conscientious objection and to decide what their money is and is not allowed to be used for.
Second, what's wrong with a conscience reservation?
If the butcher has a religious problem selling pork, why can't he just offer beef, lamb, poultry and fish?
Why, under penalty of imprisonment, force him to sell pork when there are plenty of butchers offering pork?
In Colorado, a baker faces an anti-discrimination lawsuit and a hefty fine for refusing to bake a cake at a gay wedding.
But he also refuses to bake Halloween cakes or alcohol-containing ones.
Why not punish him and leave him alone and order the appropriate cakes from hundreds of other bakers?
Third, the beauty of the federal system is that the constitutional rights of all citizens of the federation are guaranteed, but individual states can adjust their internal, domestic policies in non-federal jurisdictions according to their own, i.e. according to the preferences of their citizens.
Then there is diversity, diversity, diversity.
California can be California and Texas can be Texas.
But California wants California to be California and Texas and seven other states to be California!
Fourth, members of the LGBT community once rightly sought tolerance for their lifestyle.
Today, many in this community follow the "live and let live" rule that all reasonable people should follow, but some activists seek, not tolerance toward themselves and others, but extreme intolerance toward others.
They believe that no one should ever again express moral, religious or philosophical dissent to the LGBT lifestyle, and that if they do, they should be criminalised.
The mentality of these activists is totalitarian.
They are the modern-day enemies of freedom.
Fifth, I don't know of any situation in American history where states have done this deliberately for political reasons, except in one case.
Even in the days of the civil rights movement, when the North and West were on the side of integration and the South on the side of segregation, the states didn't impose sanctions on each other.
The only case was the 1850s, when the political cause was slavery and the North was on the verge of war with the South.
Of course, nothing like that is happening now, but the situation is toxic nonetheless.
The cultural and political divide between the blue democratic states and the red republican states is getting deeper and the United States is mentally disconnected internally.
Unauthorized agitation.
A critic of Putin got a fat fine.
Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny was fined 300,000 rubles for violating campaign rules ahead of next year's presidential election.
The court fined him for calling people to participate in unauthorized demonstrations.
Navalny has staged two major anti-government street protests in the past two months and announced that he will run for president in March next year.
The acting Kremlin chief Vladimir Putin has not yet announced his candidacy, but it is widely expected that he will do so and win again.
Navalny said the police came to his house this morning and took him to court.
He was fined for calling for demonstrations through videos posted on the YouTube website.
The fine is three hundred thousand.
"We'll take it out of the judge's salary later", a Kremlin critic joked on Twitter.
The Russian election commission recently concluded that Navalny cannot run for president because of his previous convictions for embezzlement.
However, Navalny, who is considered an anti-corruption fighter, considers the relevant judgment to be politically motivated.
A fine of 300,000 rubles, or 25,000 rubles, was also imposed on two members of Navalny's campaign team, Leonid Volkov and Nikolai Lyaskin, by the court on Thursday.
Navalny entered Russian politics as an anti-corruption blogger and gradually became a dominant figure on the fragmented opposition scene.
The authorities are trying to prevent Navalny from campaigning.
In February, he was sentenced to five years probation for robbing the Kirovles Forestry Company.
In May, the verdict was upheld by the Court of Appeal.
The verdict is so final, it prevents Navalny from running under Russian law.
Brothers fighting for an empire worth over $ 500 million
Now, more than four decades after their Italian family founded an empire, two brothers are vying for one of the most expensive Victorian properties in the world, worth over $500 million.
Former Carlton Football Club manager and developer Colin De Lutis is staying at the Toorak estate, just three rooms from his younger brother Paul, who has taken a dispute over joint ownership and commercial property all the way to the Supreme Court.
Paul wanted to leave the family business back in 2014, but the bitter dispute is continually being litigated in the Supreme Court.
Together with their mother, Anna, the brothers own a total of 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars.
The family founded Westco Jeans in this location, which grew into a chain of 160 stone shops.
In 1999, the family sold the entire company for $85 million in cash.
The money was used to purchase other properties, and the De Lutis family portfolio now includes offices, building sites in Brunswick and Sorrento, apartments on the Gold Coast and Mt Buller, and suburban shopping centers.
Paul owns about one third of the company's assets, while his father Colin, who Paul says is "a major driving force and dominant figure" in the De Lutis family, owns less than two thirds.
Court records show that Colin owns real estate worth $316 million, while Paul manages real estate worth $176 million.
Paul's problem was the division of property and funds.
"Colin's motion sounded strongly in his favor in my eyes", Paul wrote in a 2015 affidavit to the court.
Last Friday, after several failed attempts at reconciliation, the Supreme Court held its first session.
The brothers now also vie for control of an existing business - which Paul says Colin cut off.
Colin objects by saying that it's not true and accuses Paul of mismanaging some properties.
In his previous oath of office, Colin stated that he believed in a successful resolution of the conflict.
"My Italian background dictates that family is the most important thing", he wrote.
Hundreds of pages of affidavits, emails and messages from companies including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer are flooding lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC and defense attorneys on both sides.
Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who had run dairy bars and deli joints since the 1950s and bought a store in Brunswick in the 1970s.
With the money they got from the mortgage, they bought a property in Collingwood, where Colin opened the family's first jeans business.
Colin said that when he started Westco in his senior year of college, Paul was a little boy, about 10 years old.
Anna De Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped that the transfer of the property to the sons would go smoothly.
"Luigi often said he never wanted his sons to end up in court", she wrote.
Colin stated that Mark was compensated $10 million and Luke $26 million when they left.
As Paul, Luke and Mark stated, they were "not satisfied with the terms of their financial compensation".
Colin has since held back, despite the fact that he is a former AFL board member, as stated in his 2015 autobiography by Eddie McGuire, a well-known television personality and Colin's best friend.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul de Lutis and their lawyers on Friday.
He only replied to Colin via text message, stating that, given the fact that the dispute was before the court, he had nothing to add.
"It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to take the whole matter to court", he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin stated in a court statement that he had tried to conform to his brother's demands.
"Our father would be very unhappy to see our current situation", he said, adding that he still hoped for a successful solution.
On Friday, all hope was gone.
"Our dispute will be resolved in court soon", wrote Colin.
Hot in the Czech Republic.
Teachers shower the children.
The MHD drivers are filing water and summer clothes.
At the Na Chodovci nursery school in Prague 4, where about 35 children now attend, they go out only in the morning.
The school is renovated and the trees planted do not provide much shade.
There's no pool, but the teachers take the kids to the fog.
In the afternoon, the children stay in classrooms with the blinds drawn and the curtains drawn.
They're trying to cool the air with a vacuum cleaner because they don't have air conditioning.
It's hard for teachers and cooks.
"The temperature inside and outside exceeds the hygienic limits for kindergartens, so we should not even have open traffic during this period", said the director of the kindergarten Miloslava Makovičková.
There's a glass hallway in the nursery where she says the temperature is around 40 degrees.
We'll vent after 6:00 in the morning, the windows will close and we'll have blinds on the south side to protect us.
"But it doesn't help much", she added.
They have better conditions in the forest nursery at the Hraz in Hostivice, where children spend most of their time outside.
We have trees growing on the property, so we're under them.
"We have a beautiful nuthouse, a table under it, and we do things there", said preschool principal Barbora Kompan.
Teachers try to take their children to the woods where it's cooler.
They're getting the kids' hats wet and they're having water games.
"We have a handheld pressure sprayer that is used to spray flowers, and we use it to shower the children", said Kompan.
Also, the director of a kindergarten in Novoborská Street in Prague's Prosek Jitka Vilimovská said that teachers try to keep children in the shade and splash them with water.
"We have a fairly large garden, so they're under the trees", she said.
He goes out in the morning and then after 3:00.
Every child must have a head covering.
Teachers also remind the children that they should drink.
They may choose, for example, low-sugar tea or juice, and they have a water pitcher in the garden.
They also have a daily salad and a snack of fresh fruit and vegetables, sometimes brought by their parents.
"Maybe one of the moms brought a ten-pound watermelon for the kids today", Makovic added.
Drivers get water or the summer equinox.
The Prague transport company DPP provides them with water, soft drinks or summer equinoxes on hot days.
The cabins of the drivers of trams and buses are in most cases air-conditioned, said DPP spokeswoman Aneta Řehková.
In addition to the cabins of some trams, the passenger compartment is air-conditioned.
High-temperature tram tracks have not yet caused any serious damage.
There was a small damage to the loop at Hostivar.
In the current high temperatures, we are particularly concerned about ensuring that drivers have sufficient amounts of beverages available.
'Cold drinking water is available in all loops, junctions and roads,' Řehková said.
In the railway stations and at some switching points, the employees have so-called soda bars at their disposal, which produce chilled soda.
Drivers are also given soluble ionic protective drinks.
"They can also use summer uniforms, which increase the comfort of drivers on their daily shifts", the spokeswoman added.
The hot and dry weather of the last few days has resulted in an increase in the number of fires.
On Tuesday, firemen across the Czech Republic eliminated 108 of them, double the long-term daily average.
On Tuesday, when temperatures in the Czech Republic soared to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit [35°C], firefighters were busy fighting the blaze.
"Fires in the wild and those associated with harvesting work are prevalent", said fire spokeswoman Nicole Zaoral.
Even the evening change in weather, when the heat was replaced by thunderstorms and torrential rains in many places, did not bring relief to the firefighters.
Firefighters were on 236 missions in connection with the storms.
In particular, the removal of fallen trees and branches.
"The most significant intervention was in the Central Bohemian region", continues Zaoral.
But firefighters were also needed in Stvolinki, Czechoslovakia, where 60 people from a children's camp were evacuated to safety because of the storm.
Tropical temperatures have also added to the workload of Prague's emergency services.
Ambulance services were called on Tuesday and Wednesday night to a dozen cases of carbon monoxide poisoning from the karmic acid.
People should have their water heaters checked, warn rescue workers.
Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas that is released by imperfect combustion.
Symptoms of poisoning include nausea, vomiting, headache and a feeling of fainting.
If poisoning is suspected, the infected room should be evacuated.
Trump's new chief of staff plans to curb the president's media diet
Many before him have tried and failed.
Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.
If he does, he'll be the first.
Politico reported that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information about President Trump - including television news reports - in the hope of keeping Trump in the loop.
Here's an excerpt from a report by reporter Josh Dawsey:
As the new White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, met with his staff on his first day in office, he outlined a key problem the Trump White House intends to fix: misinformation getting into the hands of the president.
Kelly told the staff that he had to personally approve all information - whether it was on paper or spoken word - because the president could make better decisions based on the correct information.
Kelly's diagnosis makes sense, but many of his predecessors were outraged by Trump's control and media coverage.
Trump's relationship with the media dates back decades - and now that he's sitting in the White House, his habit of watching TV news is even stronger.
"If Trump as a candidate was upset by honest reporting, it was convenient to show him that he was being talked about in a positive light by a lot of other media outlets that were easier to convince", Sam Nunberg, a former campaign adviser, told Politico in February.
Tara Palmeri of Politico wrote at the time that the key to keeping Trump's tweets in check - at least according to six former campaign organizers - is to ensure that Trump regularly watches the media praising him.
I'll take that.
But the idea that Trump's tendency to post his opinions on Twitter was ever "under control" is ridiculous.
Maybe these campaign organizers know something that others don't - that Trump's tweets would be more outrageous if they weren't monitored.
The tweets that Trump never sent are very likely never to be heard from.
If his employees managed to keep him in check at least a few times, then their efforts were not in vain.
But no one has been able to stop Trump from regularly stirring up controversy.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, which is made up of rival factions, people regularly try to bolster their agenda by pushing Trump materials - which may or may not be reliable - that support their worldview.
Politico, which covered the issue from all sides, published a report in May on the tendency of advisers to provide dubious information to the head of state.
Here's an example of this kind of information from reporter Shane Goldmacher:
Present and former Trump officials say the president often reacts very angrily to negative media reports, especially leak reports, and tries to trace their origin.
This situation came to a head in late February when someone planted a copy of an article on the president's GotNews.com - the website of provocateur Charles C. Johnson - which accused Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh of being the "source of many leaks" from the White House.
Regardless of whether Johnson was banned from Twitter for harassment forever; or that he didn't back up his claims with any evidence; or that he had previously published false accusations and later retracted them.
Trump read the article and started asking about Walsh.
Goldmacher added that then-Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and White House Secretary Rob Porter were trying to implement a system to manage and document information that President Trump received.
Would that work?
Now, three months later, Kelly is trying to push the same strategy.
He may prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump's impulsiveness won't go away and his aides are still competing for power.
These variables will certainly make Kelly's mission more difficult.
Tourists negotiate a ditch and return to the "Millionaire Quarter"
Some of the most affluent homeowners in the English county of West Midlands are once again engaging in a dispute with determined tourists who are negotiating with local authorities for the rights to reclaim the land behind their homes.
Tourists have parked 20 caravans in a field off a thriving street in Solihull, nicknamed the "Millionaire Quarter".
Bringing horses, children and an army of caravans, tourists return after being expelled in May, not even to fear the moat that was dug at the site by order of the authorities to prevent their entry.
The tactical group found gaps in the defenses and penetrated the field with the caravans through an unprotected gap that served as a way.
Angry neighbours have attacked Solihull City Council for not being able to solve the problem.
One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "They occupied the site on Monday evening after being moved to Bentley Heath Street where they were throwing stones at other people.
The board should be ashamed of their inability to solve the problem.
All the tourists were moved to another place and now they're back.
More arrived last night, and more are expected today.'
She added that: Birmingham City Council knows how to deal with this problem.
I live on Streetsbrook and I'm not going to pay any more taxes until the board deals with the tourists.'
Another anonymous resident said, "It's ridiculous, we just recently watched the last tourists leave and now they're back.
And this time there are more of them, and this time they brought horses with them.'
A spokesman for Solihull City Council said: "We are aware of the unauthorised presence on the property near Streetsbrook Road and are working with the local police to take the necessary legal action to resolve the issue.
To gather as much evidence as possible, it is imperative that as many local residents as possible report any unsocial or illegal behavior to the police on 101.
This will give us a complete picture to present to the court.'
The husband of an MEP was hit by a car in Brussels.
He's been brought in by a government special.
A government special transported Robert Zitnanski to Bratislava on Wednesday afternoon.
Two ambulances were waiting at the airport and he was under constant surveillance by Slovak doctors on board the plane.
The long-planned flight went smoothly.
According to TV JOJ, Robert Žiitňanský had a serious accident in Brussels earlier this summer.
He was hit by a car and has been in serious condition ever since.
After being repatriated, he was transported to a specialized workplace in one of the hospitals in Bratislava.
He is married to Slovak MEP Jany Žitňanská from NOVA.
She wouldn't comment on the incident.
Couple has three kids together.
Italians are stepping up their fight against NGO rescue ships with migrants on board
Italy has announced that it will prevent the arrival of NGO rescue boats that are arriving on Italian shores with migrants from the Mediterranean unless the NGOs sign new rules governing their operations.
If NGOs do not sign the new code of conduct, it will be hard to imagine them continuing their operations, said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with Turin daily La Stampa.
Minniti's warning comes a day after Italian authorities seized a boat belonging to German rescue organization Jugend Rettet on suspicion of human trafficking, which greatly facilitates illegal immigration.
The first-year rescue organization declined to comment on the case due to accusations by Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosios.
"Saving lives is and will always be our number one priority, so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the emergency zones at this time", the organization said in a statement on social media.
We can only comment on any allegations made at this time after gathering all the information and evaluating the situation.
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the ship of the Jugend Rettet since October.
Her crew is suspected of carrying migrants on board, handed over directly to them by human traffickers, repeatedly.
At least one meeting, according to the plaintiff's file, allegedly took place just 1.3 miles off the coast of Libya.
The ship's crew is suspected of breaking the law by bypassing the Italian Coast Guard, which oversees rescue operations in the area - out of humanitarian zeal, more than anything else.
The code of conduct provides for the presence of an Italian police officer on board ships such as the Iuventa to monitor activities.
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in the rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code: Save The Children, Malta's MOAS and Spain's Pro-Activa Open Arms.
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules were not necessary but acceptable as they did not represent any "substantial change or obstacle" to rescue operations.
The new code of conduct, for example, has been rejected by the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF).
Minniti, meanwhile, said that the sharp drop in migrants landing in Italy in recent weeks as part of rescue operations suggested that efforts to strengthen patrols along Libya's coast and work with local mayors were bearing fruit.
"In the last few days, we're starting to see a light at the end of the tunnel", the minister said.
He also revealed plans for further talks to be held this month with the mayors of Libya on the economic development initiative, as well as with representatives of Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe.
Her overalls were all silicone and cellulite!
Hot summer days are all about wearing only the essentials to cover the most intimate parts.
Only Dominika Mesaroš does it the other way around.
At an afternoon gathering at the Prague Zoo, where actors, hosts, singers and everyone connected with TV Prima were in full swing, she wrapped her little body in a mini overalls.
And with just a few simple moves, the model showed everyone her silicone boots and butt.
He checked how many times he cut her in half, and she was vomiting so high, she had to adjust it all the time.
She certainly didn't need the attention of the gentlemen and the photographers present.
Michelle Carter convicted of sending text messages urging Conrad Roy to kill himself.
A Massachusetts woman has been sentenced to two years in prison for inciting her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and phone calls.
Michelle Carter, 20, will serve 15 months of a two-year sentence behind bars, followed by five years of probation.
Carter was convicted in June of the manslaughter of Conrad Roy, who took his own life on July 13, 2014.
Roy's father testified in court Thursday that the whole family is devastated.
My son was my best friend.
Carter was left at large pending a decision.
She faced up to 20 years in prison, but her lawyers argued that she and Roy were suffering from mental illness.
Dressed in red pants and a cream blouse, Carter stood on the scene as the verdict was pronounced with tears in her eyes, her hands clasped and her eyes pointed to the ground.
"Her actions killed Conrad Roy", the prosecution told the judge.
She ended his life to relieve herself.
She couldn't take responsibility for herself, she said.
She didn't show any remorse.
Carter's attorney, however, said it was an unfortunate circumstance that he deeply regretted.
Judge Lawrence Moniz added that "her age or level of maturity or even mental disorder does not have a significant impact on her conduct".
The plaintiff read a statement from Roy's mother, Lynn Roy: "Not a day goes by that I do not grieve the loss of my son.
I want him to be proud of me, taking care of his sisters, and we will bear the enormous pain together, which we will carry with us forever.
Roy's sister Camdyn Roy testified that she was haunted by the knowledge that she would never attend his brother's wedding and would never be an aunt to his children.
"Losing the person I've known since I was born is a pain I'll carry with me for the rest of my life", she said.
The state of Massachusetts has no law that punishes a person for aiding and abetting another person's suicide, so this case sets a legal precedent.
Carter was 17 when Roy was found in the back seat of a car in 2014, carbon monoxide poisoning.
The case drew national attention after Carter's suicide-promoting text messages were published.
"Hang yourself, jump off a building or stab yourself, I don't care", said a text message Carter sent just two weeks before he died when Roy was on a family vacation.
Minutes before she killed herself, she wrote him, "You have to do this, Conrad", and "Just turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy".
Judge Moniz said that Carter desired attention through Roy's death and ordered her to refrain from any comment in the press.
The case raised many questions.
One of the people who sided with Carter was Amanda Knox, who was convicted of murdering her British roommate in Italy in 2007, but was acquitted two years ago.
Ms. Knox, 30, published a statement in the Los Angeles Times: "Michelle Carter deserves understanding and help, not prison".
Audi will modify up to 850,000 diesel vehicles in response to the acute response
Just a day before the announcement, Audi, the carmaker BMW, said it would offer its customers a software update on more than 350,000 vehicles.
The BMW chairman said the company believes that there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions in response to European cities - including BMW's home city of Munich - considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes cars across Europe to reduce diesel emissions.
None of the companies referred to this decision as a withdrawal.
European carmakers have promoted the use of diesel powered cars in Europe and the United States to a large extent to comply with carbon dioxide regulations.
However, nitrogen oxide emitted by diesel engines is considered a carcinogen and can cause asthma.
At the same time, the cost of installing equipment to neutralise diesel emissions is increasing for cars, making it difficult for cars to compete.
While German carmakers face scrutiny, Chancellor Angela Merkel faces accusations of spoiling powerful car companies and ignoring their problems.
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which installed software in its cars to reduce emissions in testing to meet emission limits, but the software was disabled under normal conditions.
Several senior Volkswagen executives have been indicted in the United States and others are under investigation on both sides of the Atlantic.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics at Audi's engine development department was arrested in Germany.
Former manager of Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio is of Italian nationality and therefore not subject to extradition, so he may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi became involved in a criminal investigation by German police into the Volkswagen case after authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circumvent European emissions limits - expanding the charges Audi faces in the US.
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation may have a negative impact on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer accounts for a disproportionate share of Volkswagen's profits.
The plane made an emergency landing on the beach.
A man and a little girl died.
The accident occurred on the beach of Praia de São João, in the Costa da Caparica region, about 20 miles [30 km] south of Lisbon.
One witness told the SIC Noticias television channel that the plane flew close to people sunbathing on the beach before landing.
Some people on the beach were reportedly fleeing the danger into the sea.
Unfortunately, two people failed to escape the machine.
A 50-year-old man and an eight-year-old girl were killed on the beach, according to local media.
"The plane hit them and they were dead on the spot", local police chief Pedro Coelho Dias described.
Their nationality is not yet known.
There were two people on board the plane, both survived the crash and were taken away for questioning by the police.
D11 or how not to build a freeway.
And are the highways in the Czech Republic even complete?
I'm going to give you a riddle.
It's uncrowded, even though it was built as far back as 1978.
Even though it's not fixed, it's constantly being fixed.
And it can't be built even if it has a building permit.
What's that? What is that?
Yes, the castle highway D11.
The construction of another section of the canal has been halted for at least a few months by the Earth Children movement.
We East Germans get the highway in pieces, like cutting salami.
The wheel will be cut and then we'll see if and when we get another one.
We don't want anything miraculous.
We just want to reduce travel times and get trucks going to Poland or from Poland from villages and cities.
Endless streams of trucks drive right through the town of Jaroměř or Náchod, which is not as reasonably surrounded.
But the last stretch of our dream highway was put into operation in 2008, an incredible nine years ago.
Not a sound since.
That's why when the last four kilometers of the unfinished section to Hradci Králové and the other sections to Jaroměří were recently started with the archaeological survey, with construction starting at the end of this year, you could hear loud sputtering in eastern Czechia.
No one believed that anymore.
Last week it turned out he wasn't coming this year.
Or maybe not next year.
The Children of the Earth Club for Sustainable Transportation from Brno filed a breakdown.
Earth Children are repeating their tactics from D1.
They challenged the building permit decision in its entirety.
In the timetable, they request a review of all binding opinions already issued by all the authorities concerned.
For example, the city council, the Ministry of the Environment, but also the Ministry of Defense or the Port Authority.
So we're off the D11 near a village called "Spoonful".
So we get off, we just drive down the freeway, and then we're on a side road, and we prefer to line up next.
The worst part is, you see similar stories all over the republic.
Scary, constantly congested road to Beneshov, highway D1 or D8.
Everybody has their own little Pussycat.
What do the Children of the Earth demand?
What is the essence of the problems of road construction in the Czech Republic?
And why is the highway network virtually unfinished in the current system?

Lavender from Provence at risk of climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of Provence, in the southeast of France, but it is now threatened by climate change.
The decline of lavender is being caused by a dry climate and pest insects, which is causing horror to researchers and farmers who are looking for solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: The cultivation of lavender in Provence is under threat because in recent years the plant has been exposed to climate change, which has led to less rainfall in spring and autumn.
It affects the shelf life of the lavender.
Also to blame are the cicadas and the locusts, which carry the microorganisms that thrive in dry climates.
There's a lot at stake.
Lavender attracts tourists, and the oil produced from it is an important ingredient in perfumes and cosmetics.
Eric Chaisse said: "Instead of long and beautiful flowers, smaller, undeveloped and often weak plants grow.
The amount of oil obtained from these lavender is of course less.
The solution may be to distribute water more efficiently and to slow down evaporation from the soil, but also to spray lavender with a protective clay-water mixture and to breed more species that are resistant to dry weather.
Journalist murder highlights growing threats in Mexico
The staff of the weekly Riodoce meets regularly every Wednesday to discuss news of the unrest in the Sinaloa area involving organized crime, corrupt officials and relentless drug wars.
Today, however, under the pressure of recent events, it is meeting primarily for its own safety.
They learn the importance of changing their habits.
Two award-winning journalists discuss what would be safer: taking their children to an office that was bombed in 2009 or leaving them at home.
The security experts wrote three simple words on the blackboard: adversaries, neutrals and allies.
They ask the reporters to name every word - no proof needed, just use your imagination and your hunch.
Choose from - drug dealers, politicians, businessmen, and journalists suspected of taking money from the government or drug cartels - a catalog of criminals whose job it is to cover up criminal activity.
Violence continues and bodies pile up across the country; journalists are increasing in number: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists; 589 journalists are under federal protection after attacks and threats; and seven have been killed in all seven states this year.
Among them is the co-founder of the magazine Riodioce, editor and inspiration for colleagues, Javier Valdez Cardenas.
"The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and work as a journalist", Valdez wrote in one of his many books on the violence linked to the drug trade.
His loss is palpable, even though his presence is all-pervasive - a large photo of Valdez with the words Justicia pointed at by the middleman hangs in front of the building; two journalists - Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez - in their 30s, wearing a T-shirt with Valdez's picture with a smile on their face, glasses on their nose and a Panama hat.
The meeting takes place less than two months after his death; journalists talk about each other's trauma, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Despite the establishment of a special federal prosecutor's office in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists, the Committee to Protect Journalists has so far indicted two suspects.
Most of the thousands of murders that occur each year are linked to drug trafficking and organized crime, making it extremely rare for journalists to be put on trial.
Journalists from Rio de Janeiro insist on reporting on the violence in Sinaloa, even though they are devastated by grief and the territory is currently very treacherous.
Without information on the killers and a vision of justice, a security meeting is pointless, says Ibarra.
"It's foolish to waste time on such meetings", he adds.
Unless we get more information, we can't trust anyone.
On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the headquarters of Rio de Janeiro in Culiacán, the capital of Sinaloa.
He managed to get away a few blocks when his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men who pulled him out of the car and killed him with 12 rounds of ammunition, apparently because of the article's title - which translates as "Twelve River".
The gunmen then got into his car and hit him near the scene.
Valdez died at the age of 50.
He left behind a wife and two grown children.
It seems that word is spreading fast in Culiacan.
But in Valdez's case, there's suspicious silence.
Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlegrounds as rival factions try to fill the void.
Several people are killed every day on the streets of Sinaloi, and the cemetery is filled with sparkling two-story mausoleums for drug lords, many of them bigger than houses.
Forget for a moment that the word "peace" means that one drug cartel controls a coastal state with precious ports and important routes for drugs to travel to the United States.
Despite this, as well as the fact that Valdez was intimately aware of the risks of his job, Ismail Bojorquez (60), co-founder and CEO of Riodoca, still blames himself for not protecting his friend.
He believes two doubts contributed to his death.
The first was a February issue of an interview with Damaso Lopez, the leader of one of the rival drug cartels that waged war on Joaquin Guzmán's sons.
The peace would have angered the sons; the suspicious gang members had bought all the copies of the newspapers the moment they landed on the counter.
The second mistake was not forcing Valdez to leave the country for his own safety after other newspapers with the same story were seized.
Valdez has become a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death is seen as a major milestone in the fight against Mexican criminals against journalists.
He managed to survive for so long, and all his friends and colleagues believed that it would never change.
He was a veteran of Noroeste magazine when, in 2003, he decided to sell his $50 stake and start Riodoce with five colleagues.
In Sinaloa, it was impossible to run a newspaper and not mention the drug trade, Bojorquez said.
In time, the newspaper gained a reputation for courageous and truthful reporting; it began to prosper.
Journalists enjoyed investigating problem topics and publishing uncensored texts - readers were fascinated by stories that no one else dared publish.
Eight years after its founding, Riodoce won the prestigious Maria Moors Cabot Award for reporting on Latin America.
That same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for his courageous reporting on the Mexican drug trade.
Valdez openly admitted he was afraid.
"I feared for my life", he said at the award ceremony.
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a "way of life", Valdez said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October.
You have to take on the role of a journalist or play dumb.
I don't want anyone to ask me, "What did you do in the face of death... why didn't you tell me what was going on?"
The staff of Rio de Janeiro misses Valdez, a man known for his wit and his unselective language, a good friend who liked to give advice and hugs, a teacher who knew how to survive.
Everyone relied on his daily routine.
He always wore his hat.
He used to go to the El Guayabo bar across the street from his office and sit at the same table.
Now they ask: Did this routine cause his death?
His death also raised questions about their own assumptions - how to do their job best and stay alive?
They don't like you messing with their wives, their kids, their clean businesses, their secret airstrips.
"These things were forbidden", said Bojorquez.
As a result, there is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.
You have to trust your instincts.
If you feel something's wrong, get your hands off me.
The problem is, Riodoca editor Andres Villarreal said that the sense of smell is something that can be fooled... and then the thing with Javier happened.
He says the old rules, like others, no longer apply in Sinaloa - as they do in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states that are home to a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak governments and corrupt politicians.
The landscape is always changing.
No cell phones are allowed in the meeting room where Riodoca employees meet, because a few days ago spyware was discovered that was purchased by the government to monitor Mexican journalists and activists.
Two policemen find relief from the 40 degree heat in the shade of a nearby tree.
They were selected by the state to protect the Riodoca offices, which are located in a four-story building in the urban district of Culiacán.
Journalists mock whether these police officers are among the 50 percent of law enforcement officials that the government says are corrupt.
It's been months since journalists last went to the mountainous areas that are basically controlled by the drug cartels.
There are three main stories on this week's program.
The first is the murder of the brother of former boxer Julio César Chávez in Sinaloa.
They've also been alerted to suspicious government spending in the governor's hometown.
There have also been several recent kidnappings at one of Culiacan's most luxurious restaurants, just blocks from the D.A.'s office.
Officially, no one had announced the identity of the people or the circumstances of the abduction, so journalists were on guard as they prepared to report what every citizen in the city knew: that the restaurant was a favorite destination for drug dealers and politicians.
One journalist read from public records that the restaurant was registered under a name associated with a politician who is a member of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), which has dominated all levels of the political scene for most of the last century.
Several PRI governors have recently been accused of high-level corruption.
Villarreal asked reporters to cover earlier incidents that took place at the restaurant, including an incident in which one of Joaquín El Chapo Guzmán's sons escaped an army task force.
A month ago, readers would have read about this in Valdez's column, which was the best source of information on kidnappings.
"Valdez would definitely solve the case", said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" for his slender figure.
Now all the informants have turned their backs on us.
Valdez's office has become a warehouse of signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists, and the employees certainly didn't expect them to become activists on behalf of the press.
Journalist Miriam Ramirez grabbed some signs and went to demonstrate outside the DA's office the next morning for another journalist.
Salvador Adame disappeared just three days after Valdez's murder in the western state of Michoacán.
Authorities say that the DNA analysis indicates that it is Adamea.
Activity by journalists is escalating across the country, many of them organizing protests and marching on sidewalks and buildings.
The editor of the newspaper Bojorquez is in Washington today, trying to rally international support and seek justice for Valdez's death.
In a meeting with Governor Sinaloy the day after Valdez's murder, Ramirez accused the authorities of monitoring and killing journalists for reporting the truth.
Meanwhile, she asked to be transferred to another ward, fearing that her anger might jeopardize her neutrality.
Valdez has repeatedly said that Mexican journalists are being victimized by organized crime, corrupt officials and an indifferent public.
In his latest book, Narco-Journalism, he wrote that journalists are dying not only at the hands of drug cartels, but also at the behest of politicians and security forces who work with organized crime.
The media watchdog group Articulo 19 blamed police and public officials for more than half of all attacks on journalists.
"In Mexico, you die because they want to silence you", Ramirez added.
Murders obviously work.
No one will forget the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macías six years ago near the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was found with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: "This is how I ended up because of my messages".
Next to the severed head was a keyboard and a headset.
Some of the branches have decided to shut down, such as El Norte, based on the northern border of Chihuahua state, in response to the murder of reporter Miroslava Breach in March.
Others are still going on, just like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after killing its director in 2004.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a front-page article titled "What do you want from us?"
Some journalists have fled their homes or even across borders.
It's a difficult decision.
Finding work in exile is difficult, as is getting rid of the feeling of being constantly being stalked.
And journalists are being persecuted and killed, as in the case of Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 along with four other women in a Mexico City apartment, three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who choose to stay and not give up their jobs, every day is a big risk.
Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that writing about drugs scares him.
"Mexico is going to hell, that's why I became a journalist", he said.
It is Friday midnight, and Riodoca employees are sitting on the sidewalk outside their office - the latest issue has been shipped to the printer - sipping beer when the phone suddenly starts ringing.
They learn that 19 people have been killed in a shootout between gang members and police near a beach resort in the city of Mazatlan.
The war is escalating, just as promised by the many messages left in the area by the syndicate members.
Journalists are reporting the news from a mobile phone on the Riodoce website.
Not a day goes by and the opening headline changes again.
The sound of police sirens indicates another gunfight.
Bojorquez takes a quick look at the police patrol to make sure they're paying attention.
If they're scared, they don't show it.
Beneath the huge portrait of the fallen co-founder of their magazine - whose middleman is a talking slogan for all Sinaloe - all Riodoca employees follow in his footsteps.
"How could we even think of leaving", said Bojorquez, "when on the same day Javier was killed, an internist asked me to send her out into the streets?"
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid their enemies
At first glance, it looks like a statue, however terrifying.
Researchers have now uncovered the first findings of a remarkable creature the size of a rhino, whose perfectly preserved remains - dubbed the "Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs" by experts - were found by a Canadian miner.
The remains were so well preserved that experts were able to determine the reddish-brown color of its scaly skin and stated that the dinosaur had a "troubled past".
An article in Current Biology stated that it is "the best preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur species in the world".
The fossil is a new species of the family Nodosauridae, a dinosaur that lived during the Cretaceous period, about 110 to 112 million years ago.
Its perfectly preserved condition literally shocked researchers, who described it as "truly remarkable".
The armored whiting is the best-preserved fossil of its kind to date, according to National Geographic.
The discovery was made by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
He came across what looked like a foreign object and decided to examine it more closely.
The fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.
Researchers spent the next six years working to uncover the animal from a huge patch of land weighing 1,100 kilograms.
Once the work is complete, the dinosaur is ready to be unveiled.
"Just blink a little and you believe it's asleep", said Caleb Brown, the project manager and naturalist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the animal is on display.
"It will certainly go down in history as one of the most beautiful and well-preserved dinosaur species - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs".
By studying its skin, researchers found that this herbivore - although covered in armor and resembling a walking tank - likely faced a serious threat from carnivorous dinosaurs.
The heavily armored dinosaur used red and white camouflage to protect itself from predators and used a camouflage system that many animals use today.
Experts say it allowed it to blend in with its surroundings and avoid enemies, and its camouflage system suggests it was a favorite food of larger dinosaurs.
Reports of a 110-million-year-old dinosaur from the family Nodosauridae first appeared in newspapers in May.
Researchers named it Borealopelta markmitchelli after museum technician Mark Mitchell, who and his team spent more than 7,000 hours painstakingly uncovering the fossil.
Thanks to the amazingly preserved state of the fossil, Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the patterns and shapes of scales and armor throughout the body.
They discovered a camouflage method commonly used by modern animals for defense - the upper part of the animal was darker than the lower part.
Although this camouflage effect is common in nature, the researchers' findings are surprising because the size of the Borealopelta far exceeds that of today's animals using the same technique.
So it's possible that dinosaurs were so numerous predators that evolution preferred camouflage to confrontation in order to survive.
Many modern camouflaged animals - such as deer, zebras, and or belts - are much smaller and also more vulnerable as prey, suggesting that Nosodurus had to literally fight for its survivors.
"The surrender of a huge and heavily armored dinosaur vividly illustrates the dangers posed by predators in the Cretaceous", Brown said.
Chemical analysis of the organic components in the scales also revealed that dinosaur skin was likely reddish-brown in color.
Researchers continue to study the animal and search for further information about its life, including the preserved contents of its stomach, to trace its last meal.
They believe that the dinosaur fell into the river after it died and was washed into the sea, where it sank to the bottom.
Alberta had the same climate as Florida today, and rivers and oceans stretched farther inland than they do today.
"This nodosaur is really remarkable in that it's completely covered in perfectly preserved scaly skin and at the same time it's preserved in three dimensions so we can see its original size", Brown said.
For these reasons, the animal looks virtually the same as it did during the Cretaceous.
You don't have to use your imagination to reconstruct it; just blink a little and it seems like he's just sleeping.'
In the Cretaceous, the Earth was roamed by giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs that walked on two legs.
Although the king of all dinosaurs - Tyrannosaurus rex - lived several million years after Borealopelta, this armored dinosaur may have been a favorite prey of its equally fearsome ancestors.
Among them is Acrocanthosaurus, a 11.5-meter-long monster that weighed over six tons.
Researchers, whose latest findings were published in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta's body was washed out to sea after being mummified in mud.
The discovery was made by Shawn Funk, who discovered the fossil on March 21, 2011, while drilling at the Suncor Millenium mine near Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the jaw to the hip.
The average length of the animal was 15 feet [5 m] and it weighed up to 1,300 pounds [1,300 kg].
Two 50-centimeter spines sticking out of his shoulders.
Researchers believe that this herbivore roamed the territory of present-day Canada until it ended up in a river that emptied it into the sea.
His underwater tomb preserved his body in perfect condition.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armor around the skull still covers the remains of the skin.
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, "Finding a preserved individual like this is like winning the lottery.
The longer I watch it, the more shocking the find seems.
The fossil remains of this species are also preserved to the extent that the armor around the skull still covers the remains of the skin.
His right front leg is on his side with his toes pointing upwards.
I can easily count the scales on his foot.'
How did one activist learn the answer to the question, "Whose Streets?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrell shook her whole body.
The day after she arrived in New York, a St. Louis native sat on a bed in an Airbnb room and was browsing Facebook posts on her phone.
She came across a post from a high school student.
"Police just shot an 18-year-old man whose body is still lying in the street, "standing in it.
She was surprised that no one else had posted this to her, so she closed Facebook and opened Twitter.
User @TheePharoah has been constantly retweeting her posts on her wall.
The St. Louis rapper posted on Twitter his thoughts on the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old who was shot by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a photo of Brown's body lying helpless in the street, no one picking him up after four hours.
"This is crazy", Ferrell thought.
But death was nothing new to her and her community.
She hung up to go back to him the night she was watching tweets about people gathering on Canfield Drive.
She was looking at photos of police belts and screaming people, and one of the men claimed to be the father of the victim, holding a sign that said, "Ferguson police killed my unarmed son!"
She was watching live news - one of the police officers was standing in front of a group of protesters, holding a leash and a barking dog at the other end.
In another video, another police officer, she said, held a gun and pointed it at the crowd, shouting, "I'll kill you all... animals".
"This is not normal", Ferrell said to herself.
This is not the kind of murder we're used to, which we can call normal.
I felt goose bumps all over my body.
I was angry and I cried.
She immediately booked a return flight and left the next day.
After landing at 11:00 p.m., she picked up her six-year-old daughter from her father and decided to leave for Ferguson in the morning.
The story of what happened to Ferrell and the city of Ferguson over the next three years is told in the new documentary Whose Streets?
It's a story of survival and protest, love and resistance, strength and resilience told from the perspective of people in the community who take to the streets and demand answers.
On the way to Ferguson, Ferrell engaged her daughter in a dialogue - dressed in a floral sweater and the same floral headband - about a subject they had discussed many times before - the black experience.
"Remember how I taught you about how black people had to fight for what they believed in?"
We're on our way to Ferguson right now because the police killed an 18-year-old, and that's not right.
"It was never in the question not to take her with me", Ferrell later said.
Today's events are the culmination of what happened in the past.
She had to know and see it with her own eyes and grow up with it.
She needed to develop not only in activism and organizing, but also to learn the difference between the different layers of the black experience and what we need to do to free ourselves.
Even though I'm able to provide her with conditions where she won't experience racism firsthand, she's no different than any other black child-woman.
I feel like protecting her from this experience would only hurt her.
Upon arrival in Ferguson, the first stop was South Florissant Road opposite the police station, which became a base for activists awaiting a statement from Officer Darren Wilson about his possible involvement in the incident.
It was here that Ferrell and her daughter met a local businessman who prepared food for the others.
Together, they bagged food and helped to distribute it to Protestants.
In Ferrell's eyes, a new kind of activism was slowly emerging.
"My activism was turned upside down after 9/11," Ferrell said, adding that while in college at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association and worked to introduce health care and food in black communities.
I had no experience with organizing.
It was natural.
A few weeks later, Ferrell met the later co-director of the documentary, Sabaah Folayan, during an evening demonstration.
Folayan said that he and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to "just document" the ongoing events.
But Ferrell thought, "Are you working on a documentary or are you trying to find a story that can be used?"
This kind of skepticism was infiltrated into the community by many people, often white people, who wanted to profit from the pain and determination.
As Folayan explained in an unreleased interview: "We heard that the voices of people born and raised in Ferguson are often overlooked and we wanted to change that".
Folayan has already teamed up with co-director Damon Davis, a highly regarded local artist who deals with death row inmates.
His involvement in the project also interested Ferrell and six other locals who were followed by the Whose Streets? team in the years following Brown's murder.
"No one speaks for us in this document, but it is our statement", Davis said.
It was important to me - how these people would be represented - because that's how I would be represented.
While the documentary was not meant to focus on Ferrell's experience - in an attempt to show that the movement is not about a saving leader but about bringing the community together, Folayan said - it turned out that she was the most open to participating in filming.
The documentary Whose Streets? describes a very personal aspect of Ferrell's life, such as how he fell in love with his wife.
"I felt naked", said Ferrell, with a smile on her face, thinking back to the first moment she saw the final version of the documentary.
But I realized that in order to do this job and humanize black people, I had to open up.
Ferrell's story also highlights the role of the eccentric black woman in the broader Black Lives Matter movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement - who created the #BlackLivesMatter social media campaign in response to the 2012 killing of teenager Trayvon Martin - call themselves freaks.
"Black eccentric women in leadership positions are ultimately behind the preservation of the movement", Ferrell said, "because we're constantly fighting on multiple fronts.
Black eccentric women have to carry the weight of these events.
Folayan agrees with this statement, adding that the movement is actually supported by black women and a lot of queer black women.
He insists, however, that this is not a mere affirmative matter and Ferrell is not the main character of the documentary because of her views.
"She was the driving force and the source of energy", she said.
But it's no accident that she's on the front lines, because living at these crossroads as a black woman is dangerous.
You can feel the energy surge in front of the screen.
Meanwhile, back in Ferguson, the television cameras have cleared their positions, but heavy racial ties between the community and the police persist.
Ferrell is serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence for blocking a highway during a demonstration.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in the area she calls home as "Chaos".
Yet she has not stopped in her quest, which she has been committed to since she took to the streets of Ferguson three years ago.
It is our duty to fight for our freedom.
It's our duty to win.
We must love and support each other.
The only thing we can lose is our chains.
There was a field fire in Cologne.
Dozens of firefighters were called to the scene, and a helicopter was also on the scene.
Near Český Brod on Kolín, between Bylany and Liblice, a field of about 15 hectares was burning from 14:00.
The fire stopped spreading at about 3:15 p.m., and the fire department has declared a level three fire alarm out of four possible.
According to firefighters' spokesman Ladislav Holomčík, a helicopter was also used to help put out the fire from the air.
At 18:00, the firefighters managed to put out the fire, the fire caused damage of 700,000 crowns.
Dozens of professional and volunteer firefighters battled the flames on the spot.
The fire was caused by a technical malfunction in the engine compartment of the combine.
Hassit was also helped by a helicopter that made six waterfalls.
"Instead of the intervention we handed over to the owner, until tomorrow 8:00 a.m. he will be guarded by a unit of volunteer firefighters", said Holomčík today.
And Becoming Resemblance: an artist creates portraits using DNA from Chelsea Manning
In the center of one room at the Friedman Gallery in New York City, there are several faces of different shades of skin - white, black, and brown - hanging from the ceiling on wires, each one as if out of the eye of the other.
All 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from oral swabs and hair sent to her by Chelsea Manning.
Manning sent her samples from Fort Leavenworth, where the former analyst is serving a 35-year sentence for illegally leaking classified cables to WikiLeaks.
The new exhibit, which opened on August 2, is called A Becoming Resemblance.
It's the result of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, who combines her expertise in technology, computer science and the arts, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident whose sentence was commuted by Obama three days before she left office as president of the United States.
By algorithmically analyzing Manning's DNA and using 30 portraits to illustrate what a person with this genotype would look like, Dewey-Hagborg created a sharp, if not intellectual, commentary on the susceptibility of DNA - as well as the many ways in which DNA can be interpreted - and the inherent determinism of those interpretations, as well as identity.
Manning, born Bradley Edward Manning, has spoken openly about being a woman since she was a young girl, and was convicted in 2013 on 20 counts, including six counts of espionage, computer fraud and theft.
All of her photographs were seized by prison staff, with only one black and white photograph leaked to the public, a lower quality photograph showing Manning, visibly distraught, sitting in the driver's seat in the platinum blonde wig she's now associated with.
In 2015, there was still a positive response to Dewey-Hagborg's 2012 project Stranger Visions.
In this project, Dewey-Hagborg used various forensic objects - such as cigarette butts and chewing gum - to create a picture of the possible shapes of these people.
And just about this time, she received an email from Paper Magazine.
"They were planning to interview Chelsea Manning in prison and wanted to add a portrait to the article", Dewey-Hagborg explained at the opening of the new exhibition.
But visitors and photography were not allowed, so they approached Chelsea and asked if she would be interested in a DNA portrait.
The artist and her imprisoned muse became friends over the course of two years through correspondence.
They even created a comic called Suppressed Images, illustrated by Shoili Kanung, which presented a vision of what would happen if Chelsea was pardoned and allowed to attend the exhibition in person.
President Obama did, in fact, ask for Manning's release a few days after the comic was published, which was a welcome change after several excruciating years in a military prison in Kansas.
Interestingly, the exhibition comes at a time when Donald Trump is waging war on people who seek to leak government information and transgender soldiers, while trying to find new ways to tweet hate speech in areas he is supposed to be supporting.
In response to a question about this particular timing, Dewey-Hagborg stated that "everything happens for a reason".
Under the artist's statement on one of the gallery walls, Manning calls with her huge signature (the  in her last name is a heart) for an end to self-inflicted factionalism based on gender, race, sexuality and culture.
On the opposite side are the sequences of her mitochondrial DNA -- the centipede letters C, G and A, written in pencil.
By listing 200 letters (or nucleotides, according to the artist's sophisticated scientific dictionary), Dewey-Hagborg wanted to illustrate how surprisingly similar, at least biologically, we are all.
"I hope people will learn that our genome doesn't matter who we are, and that genetic data is subjective and can be interpreted in a different way", said Dewey-Hagborg.
DNA tells many different stories, and this is 30 of them.
The last copy of the exhibition, located in a separate room, is a single page of the aforementioned graphic novel.
It shows Manning emerging in a King Kong fashion from the United States Disciplinary Barracks with a megaphone in her hand.
"Once they stop you from speaking, they win", it says.
Never be silenced.
"It's a direct transcript of one of the letters", said the Philadelphia artist.
I get goose bumps when I think about it.
Manning has not yet visited the exhibition in person, as predicted in the comic book, but when she does, she will be welcomed into the center of the room with her masks, her own genome images, lined up like a mob of Protestants.
That was also the purpose of the exhibition, including a nearly five-foot-tall statue of Manning, which is marked with pencil with her genetic haplogroups.
"In the past, they were on the walls, but this time I wanted to make them feel like a crowd", Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits.
I wanted to create the impression of a mass movement taking the form of Chelsea and liberating her.
A professor at Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford University are wanted for murder.
A nationwide manhunt is underway for a Northwestern University professor and Oxford University staff who are being sought on suspicion of murdering a man found stabbed to death in a luxury Chicago apartment, police said.
On Monday, a warrant was issued for the first-degree murder of a man named Wyndham Lathem, 42, and Andrew Warren, 56, for their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, according to Cook County court records.
The document states that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died from multiple stab wounds.
Chicago police say the body of the deceased was found on July 27.
Officers were alerted by telephone, and upon arrival at the Grand Plaza Apartments, they found the victim in one of the apartments with several minor injuries.
Cornell-Duranleau was pronounced dead at the scene and detectives are investigating the case as a homicide, while police are searching for both suspects, authorities said.
Lathem has been an assistant professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
Alan K. Cubbage, the university's vice president of public affairs, said in an e-mail statement that Lathem is now on administrative leave and has been barred from the university campus.
"The whole matter is now under investigation by the relevant authorities and Northwestern is cooperating fully with them", Cubbage said.
Warren is an executive financial manager at Oxford University.
A spokesman for the university and Somerville College said in an e-mailed statement: "We have been contacted by British police and stand ready to assist American police as well".
The statement also states that Warren's colleagues were shocked by the whole thing and wish he would turn himself in to the police.
Anthony Guglielmi, head of public relations for the Chicago Police Department, said he's urging suspects to turn themselves in to authorities.
"Police have information on their whereabouts and the search for suspects is intensifying", Guglielmi said.
Guglielmi added that local, regional and national authorities are assisting the police in the search for suspects.
According to Guglielmi, the police received a call from the manager of the Grand Plaza building, who was alerted to the events that were to take place in apartment 1008.
Police described the whole scene as very violent.
Guglielmi said it's unclear if the incident happened on July 27.
He added that Lathem and Warren were caught on security cameras.
"We believe Professor Latham knew his victim", Guglielmi said.
Grand Plaza officials issued a statement to all residents: Police are now working to compile a timeline and profile of the victim and are investigating various motives, including domestic violence.
 In the near future, we will complete the WADA plan - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it would not be long before the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) criteria were implemented and the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) was re-established.
 At present, part of the criteria for the new plan have been finalised and RUSADA has already obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD).
In light of this, the WADA plan has been updated, Mutko said on Thursday.
The Vice-Chairman commented on the second part of WADA's Code Compliance Plan - which describes the criteria for the renewal of RUSADA - which was recently published on the organisation's website.
According to Mutko, the code contains nothing that should concern Russia.
Everything has been announced and everything will be implemented.
The results will be available to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA shortly", he added.
One of the criteria mentioned, however, calls for the public announcement of the results of the WADA investigation, which was investigated by Richard McLaren, into alleged government sponsorship of Russian athletes.
On this subject, Mutko said: "We are conducting an investigation because our anti-doping system has obviously failed.
All measures have been taken.
But there were no government programs in our country, so we can't confess to something that never existed.
Mutko's words were confirmed by Vitaly Smirnov, director of the Russian Independent Public Anti-Doping Commission.
In an interview with RSport Russia, Smirnov acknowledged the problems of Russian anti-doping officials, but added: We have stated on many occasions that the report contains controversial positions and regulations.
No one plans to accept the report completely unconditionally, Smirnov concluded.
WADA suspected RUSADA of conducting doping controls within Russia in November 2015 immediately prior to the doping scandal.
However, the organisation authorised the planning and unification of testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping Agency (UKAD) in June this year.
Following a visit to the organisation's Moscow headquarters in July, WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA was on the right track to be reinstated.
Police have charged three people, one of them a juvenile.
Police have charged three men with starting a fire Wednesday at a rare wooden church in Třinci-Gutech on Frýdek-Mistec.
One of the accused is a minor, all three are Czech nationals.
They face up to 15 years in prison for a felony of public order.
The Moravian-Silesian police chief Tomáš Kužel told reporters today.
He said it was a premeditated crime.
"It's a very recent matter and the police are currently working on the motive of the whole matter", said Kužel.
He said the police would be discussing the possibility of taking the accused into custody.
The Director has stated that no further information can be released.
"I can't say anything more because the criminal police and the prosecutor who is overseeing the case are actually working on it", said Kužel.
The wooden Church of the Body of God in Gutah dates from the 16th century.
It was a valuable monument with many original furnishings and paintings from the first half of the 16th century.
The material damage is estimated to be in the tens of millions of crowns, but the historical loss is incalculable.
Soon after the fire, the church was rebuilt.
Most of the costs should be covered by insurance, the Ministry of Culture and the city are ready to share the additional costs, a public collection is also being prepared and the contribution of the owner of the monument, the local parish, is expected.
A similar wooden church of St. Catherine in Ostrava-Grabova, built in the 16th century, was also destroyed by fire 15 years ago.
It was caused by a faulty electrical system.
An exact copy was made in its place.
The state counts on its citizens to defend the state.
It will support their training.
The financial support for associations used in the defence of the State, for voluntary marksmanship training or for a team of training instructors is part of the substantive purpose of the Law on the Preparedness of Citizens for the Defence of the State.
The Ministry of Defence, which was commissioned by the government to produce it, promises that it will improve the physical fitness of the Czechs and their capabilities, which the state can then use in crisis situations.
That's according to a proposal the Ministry has put together.
If the law were passed in the future, the state would spend hundreds of millions of crowns to support the defense.
The main objective of the proposal is to create an effective system that would help to increase the readiness of the population of the Czech Republic to defend the state, outside the exercise of military duty and on a voluntary basis.
For example, the State would provide financial or material support to amateur radio, marksmen's or cynologists' associations and would allow their members to improve their skills.
In return, it would obtain data on the people willing to come to the country in times of crisis, and their capabilities or material equipment.
Accredited instructors could also be available to assist associations and other interested parties in training or education.
The organization also plans to hold talks with war veterans or people who have performed heroically.
One possible option is to set up a new office to administer and coordinate the project.
The authors of the proposal stress that people's participation should be voluntary and the state would use their abilities only after a state of emergency was declared.
'The whole concept must respect the gradual erosion of previously obvious boundaries between different types of threats,' the intention states, referring to the dangers of so-called hybrid threats.
Ministerial officials noted that the focus should therefore be on supporting the widest possible range of capabilities, not just military ones.
'The basic objective of the plan is to create a very broad base that will enable every citizen to respond qualitatively to situations threatening the sovereignty of the state or the life, health and property of persons, to protect themselves, or to contribute to the protection of others, and not to impose a burden on the armed forces of the Czech Republic by misbehaving,' the plan states.
Passage of the bill would bring considerable financial demands.
The amount will depend on the variant chosen, according to the Ministry.
The Authority foresees, for example, financial support for projects to prepare citizens for the defence of the State up to CZK 100 million.
If an administrative and coordination centre were set up, its operation could cost around CZK 60 million per year.
The rest of the money would go to payroll or building an information system.
The proposal also envisages that the regional military commands would have to be expanded to employ a total of 42 additional soldiers.
The Ministry has previously said that the law should also help resolve some Czech politicians' disagreement with the introduction of the EU directive on the possession of weapons.
Its adoption would allow the shooters who will be part of the system to keep some of the weapons prohibited by the directive.
Startups that will help your company avoid another Uber
Amy Errett wanted to measure employee satisfaction at her e-commerce startup, but she couldn't find a survey that matched her.
The answers were often inaccurate, unhelpful, or even misleading.
And despite her promise of anonymity, some employees expressed their distrust of the entire process.
"I was looking for consistency and objectivity", says Errett, owner of Madison Reed, a San Francisco-based e-commerce hair care company that employs 75 people.
So she asked for outside help.
New HR startups are constantly emerging in the market to help companies with employee satisfaction surveys.
By building and licensing software with the specific intent of measuring employee engagement, startups allow companies to conduct quick voting, target specific teams and demographics, offer complete employee anonymity and a complaint hotline, and in some cases also allow whistleblowers to bypass superiors and contact the CEO directly.
"There are tools on the market like Strava and Fitbit that track your health, but where's Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and CEO of Reedwood City-based startup Glint.
Errett said that Glint has helped her to become more aware of what her employees think and feel in three years.
In addition to quick surveys and team-specific voting, Glint offers a company temperature map and a concise overview of the groups with the highest number of complaints, as well as an overview of low-rated managers - allowing users to work on a fix.
Companies are starting to realize the need to take care of the workplace culture - in case they become another Uber - which is being mired in scandal after a former employee posted a blog post describing the workplace and harassment of employees who dare to speak out.
For startups like Glint, the demand for culture surveys is a lucrative business opportunity.
According to the Let's Talk Payments website, which focuses on technical and financial advances, the global control, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.8 billion by 2020.
Denver, Colorado-based startup Convercent, which helps companies prevent and detect inappropriate behavior, saw a small surge in interest and activity earlier this year, just before the Uber scandals.
Convergent's nearly 600 clients include Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.
He recently took Uber under his wing.
Similar to Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customizable flash surveys, collect sensitive information in real time and display temperature maps of problem areas.
It also offers an anonymous text hotline that allows employees to report inappropriate behavior.
If the Director-General is involved, complaints shall be sent directly to the Management Board.
"The court of public opinion has regulators on its side", said Patrick Quinlan, founder and CEO of Convercent.
If a company is convicted of mistreatment or unethical behavior - and if regulators do not act - it can face costly consequences from customer boycotts, employee exhaustion or lawsuits, Quinlan added.
The Ruby Tuesday restaurant chain, which employs over 25,000 people across 500 locations, has been using Convercent for more than a year to raise awareness among employees of company policies and procedures and provide an easy way to contact corporate management.
In the past, if an employee wanted to report any problem, he had to look up the company's phone number or e-mail address, formally file a complaint, and hope for a successful solution.
Often, it was a daunting and unpleasant experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesday's general counsel, who said there was no reliable way to track employee complaints before.
Now, when companies use Convercent, they can quickly detect and resolve problems that have never before been addressed by managers sitting in offices miles away from actual complaint resolution - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair treatment.
"It's getting closer to a holistic, holistic view of the employee experience", said Vitrano, who heads Ruby Tuesday's risk management group.
We also protect shareholders from employee lawsuits.
Companies stopped taking ethics, values and employee participation lightly in 2002 after accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed after Enron's collapse over the abuse of employee ethics rights, Quinlan said.
But it wasn't until social media brought the whole thing to light that companies started to realize that in the online world, they can't just hide their skeletons in a closet.
"Before people started using technology to track ethics, they relied on faith", added Quinlan.
Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service for which the companies pay a regular fee.
It's a business model and an opportunity that's been embraced by the bold venture capitalists who backed both startups.
Convercent raised $10 million in its February campaign from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, and ultimately took in $47 million in equity.
Glint raised $10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and raised $60 million throughout the campaign.
These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, cultures and venture capital.
A growing body of research clearly confirms that today's employees expect more from their workplace than ever before.
And in competitive markets like Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects aren't the main advantages.
Employees want to feel accepted and valued and that they are giving their time to a company that strives for a positive mission.
When people are happy in their jobs, feel their voices are heard, and feel their work is rewarding, they contribute to the success of the company, said Nina McQueen, VP of Global Benefits and Perks at LinkedIn, which uses both Convercent and Glint.
Investors make money when companies thrive, and companies thrive when their employees are happy.
And when an analytical tool comes on the market to ensure employee engagement and commitment to the company, it's no wonder there are a lot of investors who will support this effort.
According to experts in work culture, it is important to have data on employee satisfaction.
But data alone is useless unless society takes the necessary steps.
The reality is that once a company asks for feedback from its employees, big changes can happen.
And if change is not made quickly - or at worst not at all - it can cause frustration and disinterest among employees.
"Once you ask for 4,000 opinions, you have to be prepared for 4,000 conversations", said Russell Raath, director of consultancy at Kotter International, who has seen many companies rely too much on data alone.
Because once you don't get things done, the employees start asking themselves, "Did they even hear me?
Are they interested in me?
And if not, why should I care?'"
Madison Reed, which now conducts regular monthly employee surveys, can solve the problem in a day with Glinto, Errett said.
After gathering feedback from employees who were frustrated with the slow decision-making and quality of communication, Errett was able to reorganise several teams within the company and start communication training to successfully solve the problem.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining a very important perspective on its employees and hopes to achieve high employment in the long term in a sector that is known for frequent layoffs.
If you do not strive to create a transparent work environment, employees will not trust you, added Vitrano.
And once you start losing employees, you're going to lose customers.
And with the flow of customers, the whole company goes bankrupt.
Thursday turned out to be the hottest day.
Thursday is the hottest day of the year in the Czech Republic, with 38.3 degrees recorded in the Hodonín region.
It surpassed Tuesday's previous record of 37.3 degrees.
The Czech Hydrometeorological Institute has reported this.
But there were not many temperature records on Tuesday compared to Thursday.
The storm hit mainly Moravia, in the Czech Republic it was mostly cloudy.
On Tuesday, records were broken or equaled at 35 of 145 weather stations measuring over 30 years.
On Thursday, only nine long-term measuring stations recorded a record.
For example, in the Watchtower, today's temperature was the same as the previous record set in 2013.
In the fridge at Breslau today's 37.4 degrees exceeded the original maximum by four tenths of a degree and in Pohorelece in Brno the current 37.1 degrees exceeded the record by three tenths.
Both records, as well as the Guardian, were from 2013.
High temperatures today were mainly in the south and east of Moravia.
The hottest after the Strážnici were in Dyjakovice in Znojemsk and Brod nad Dyje in Břeclavsk, where mercury also rose to 37.8 degrees, but did not break the record.
In contrast, in western and northwestern Bohemia, for example, the highest temperatures so far have been only about 70 degrees Fahrenheit [22°C], according to the CCHM website.
"Temperatures did not begin to rise until this late afternoon", the forecasters said.
The current heat in the Czech Republic will gradually subside and on Sunday, more heavy rain could come.
But in most parts of Moravia, high temperatures will remain on Friday and in the southeast of Moravia on Saturday.
We're in a lot of trouble here.
Billionaires don't get the same vote in the election as every single adult in the country.
They want to decide directly, and because not everyone is as bold as Andrej Babiš, who wants to own the state, they buy political parties.
Pentha owner Marek Dospiva, along with other underwater colleagues Martin Burda and Antonín Frych, sponsors the Robejškov Realists.
The second life of the Civic Democratic Alliance is financed by insurance company owner and real estate entrepreneur Pavel Sehnal, who is also the chairman of his party.
Convicted corrupt and king of Czech gambling Ivo Valenta has bought the Party of Privateers.
The political movement Agrofert, as Andrei Babis' project was accidentally named by the mayor of Krumerich, Jaroslav Nemec, is a chapter in itself.
The mayor's office recently caught their billionaire.
He's Dalibor Grandfather, the owner of the Jablotron security firm.
He says he's going into politics to do good.
But Grandpa didn't do very well in the mayor's uniform.
"I never dreamed of small goals", he said at a press conference.
That means my goal is for the YES movement, for the Mayor's movement to win 20 percent of the vote.
Everyone laughed.
But Grandpa's overstatement is more of a symptom.
Billionaire Dalibor Grandfather is a man of strong views.
Although he intends to run for the voters in the mayor's jersey, he continues to support Andrei Babis.
My grandfather supported Grandma in the last parliamentary election.
"Grandma is not a sharp orator and does not master the pleasant rhetoric of political snakes", he wrote of him before the 2013 election.
But he's definitely not into politics because he wants to improve himself.
To me, Grandma will remain a hero.
He's willing to step out of his world, which he controls, and do something for all of us.
Shortly after the Mayor introduced him as a new addition, he confessed his admiration for Babis again.
And he said he wanted the mayor to learn to imagine a possible collaboration with Grandma.
Some may appreciate that Grandpa doesn't change his mind and stands by his side no matter what jersey he wears.
Others may speculate that Grandma is sending someone this clumsy to the Mayor's office to build her own Bean.
Others may ask if the head of Jablotron and the head of Agrofert have broken up over a bad deal in the store and are looking for another way to defend themselves from their business rival.
But Grandpa's first public appearance wasn't just about Grandma.
Grandpa promised to send the mayors 10 million crowns for the campaign.
And he said if they need more money, he'll send more.
A few years ago, it would have been hard to argue with that statement.
In addition, the court-recognized thug Zdeněk Bakala spent millions on all sides before the 2010 elections.
The political division of the Vit Barty Security Agency, TOP 09 and the Citizen Democrats have thus combined almost 30 million.
But today is a different time.
The law prohibits anyone from giving more than $3 million to a political party.
If Grandpa's going into politics, he could at least learn the rules of the game.
Perhaps you won't have to wonder why our politician has such a bad reputation.
In his first days in politics, Grandpa crowned it with a proposal for tax breaks for families with educated children.
People with college degrees come to us about 50,000 a month.
The ones with the base at less than 20.
A man with 50,000 is rich by local standards.
The one with the 20 poor.
In Dedek's vision of a society where the poor pay their taxes fairly and the rich enjoy the benefits of the welfare state, they have little to do with the running of the welfare state.
The rich simply need help so that they do not add poverty to poverty.
The trustees can congratulate each other on their new acquisition and Grandma can wave.
The rest of us, thanks to Grandpa, can attest to the fact that billionaires aren't always good people.
Then there's the question of who to vote for.
For me, those who know the rules of the game and want to play by them.
Those who have neither party members nor citizens of the state as their employees and the country as their property.
And finally, those who want a prosperous country to be a place where all people live well, not just a few.
Nobody wanted Trump's paradise.
The mansion must have been reduced by 234 million.
Selling real estate isn't always easy.
And oftentimes, it's not even the 11 bedrooms, the beautiful view of the ocean, or the fact that the property is being sold by US President Donald Trump that helps.
When the Le Chateau des Palmiers estate was sold, the price dropped by an incredible £8 million.
This was reported by Mirror.co.uk.
The brochure on the property says, "Hello, Donald J. Trump".
Escape to a place like no other.
But even the real estate company's connection to the president of the United States didn't justify the extreme pricing.
Donald Trump had to lower the price of his Caribbean estate by an incredible £8 million.
The original price of the property was £21.5 million, the final price has been reduced to £13 million.
Even after the discount, a villa complex costs about 76 average apartments in the center of Prague.
And that's not surprising.
The stunning 5-acre property on the Caribbean island of St. Martin has 12 full bathrooms, 11 bedrooms, many dining rooms, a gym, and other facilities.
It's made up of several buildings.
The property also includes a swimming pool and tennis court.
There are dozens of palm trees on the property.
The terrace has a beautiful view of the sea.
Real estate experts say the price reflects the fact that the president's connection isn't enough to attract potential buyers.
Now the property is closer to the normal property prices on the island.
Trump bought the property in 2013.
Speculation is he paid about £15 million.
He was supposed to buy the property for rental purposes.
Le Chateau des Palmiers was the most expensive property on St. Martin's Island.
But with the new award, he's second in line.
The property in the neighbourhood was valued at £13.5 million.
The NCAA has decided to end two practice sessions a day.
It's almost 11 a.m. and the UCLA football players are cuddling at the sideline of the new school field.
Some of them take off their jerseys and reveal their sweaty backs, an unmistakable sign of the first day of training camp.
For most of the team, those few minutes of idleness are a substitute for lunch.
Players enrolled in the summer semester will return to their rooms after three hours of practice to study for their final exams before returning to the Wasserman Football Center for a meeting at 6:30 a.m.
"These guys are going to have a tough three days", Bruins coach Jim Mora said just before Monday shifted to Tuesday.
By eliminating two practice sessions in one day, the NCAA wants to make it easier for players - paradoxically, it makes the practice days even longer - at least until Friday, when the final exams end.
That's why the first three UCLA practices are scheduled for 7:15 p.m. - to fit into the already overcrowded schedules of many students.
For the first time in Mora's six seasons as Westwood coach, Bruins training camp starts a week earlier than last year and training is limited during the summer semester, as is the decision to limit training from two to one a day.
A total of 18 practice sessions are scheduled through August 20th, with formal preparations to begin for the first game against Texas A&M in September.
The sea has been heard to support the NCAA's decision, even as it adds another item to the already crowded roster.
"Three or four days are a stressful time for the players and it's very exhausting for them", said Mora.
But nobody gave up, everybody's trying.
I think on Saturday, when we have more time, everything will calm down.
UCLA will be closed after training camp, which won't be easy given the clear lines of the surrounding grounds from the adjacent parking lot and the luxury Luskin Center Hotel, which the players occupied after collecting the net behind the goal post.
The Bruins are scheduled to occupy the hotel starting this week, but Mora acknowledges that when rooms are empty during the season, there could be a problem.
"The land will be guarded by the security service", added Mora.
Security is provided, but it's not impossible that someone might rent a room and record our training.
It's a good trade.
Fortunately, the hotel will have security, as will the number eight parking lot.
We'll use our resources to the fullest.
I hope everything works out.
It's all planned.
Facebook plans to do more fact checking to limit the number of fake news
Facebook will send more potentially fake articles to third-party reviewers and display findings underneath original posts in an effort to combat so-called fake news, the largest social network said on Thursday.
The company says in a statement on its website that it will start using updated machine learning to detect possible hoaxes, which it will send to third parties for verification and potentially display the survey results under the original posts.
Facebook has been identified as a major source of fake news, and many believe that these unconfirmed reports influenced last year's US presidential election.
There is a political debate in Europe, French voters are inundated with fake news about the May presidential election, and Germany plans to fine the social media network before the September election if it does not swiftly remove the angry posts.
Facebook said in another statement released in Germany on Thursday that it was planning to launch testing of a new fake news control feature in the US, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
"In addition to seeing third-party verified posts, people are requesting more content to be better informed and make informed decisions about what to share", said Sara Su, Facebook's product news manager, in a blog post.
She added that Facebook is continuing to test the "related articles" feature and is also working on other changes to reduce the number of fake news.
The creation of a graphic novel: the story of A Castle in England
Scotney Castle was recently featured in the music video for Squeeze and was also a refuge for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s.
But from his cozy little town on the River Bewl in Kent, England, Scotney witnessed 700 years of turbulent history that inspired the curly-haired Jamie Rhodes of Yorkshire - known for his fondness for historical documents - to create a graphic novel.
"I'm fascinated by the writing of a man who's 300 years dead", says Rhodes, with a serious face.
When I hold a letter in my hand, I feel a personal connection.
A graphic novel documenting the lives of the families who lived at Scotney Castle from the Middle Ages to the Edwardian period, each story illustrated by a different British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.
However, this is not Rhodes' first book inspired by archives: he is also the author of Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories (2014), a collection of British Library inspired documents - a project that was very emotional for him.
"I was intrigued by a fingerprint on a letter written by a double agent in the 1970s who worked for the Jacobites", he said.
That's his fingerprint!
And letters always smell like smoke because in those days you had to light a candle to read.
When I smell the letter now, 300 years later, it's like I've traveled back in time.
I love the archives!
For someone so fascinated by old papers, the support of the National Trust and the Arts Council England and the opportunity to spend almost four months at the castle is almost like a dream.
Rhodes spent his time exploring the Victorian New Castle, going through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities, such as the hyena's head on the wall and the bottles that had been thrown into the ditch for centuries.
He walked the grounds and explored the ruins of the old castle, talking to the witches, gardeners, and occasionally the artists who worked on the illustrations for his book.
He drank whiskey and wrote at night.
Scotney's private history is relatively unknown, as the National Trust did not gain access to the documents until 2006 after the death of the last heiress, Elizabeth Hussey.
When Rhodes arrived on the scene ten years later, the staff were just beginning to penetrate the archives, which Rhodes described as the aristocrats of many centuries waving their hands with the words, "Take it to the attic".
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps of property: "You may think a land dispute is boring", said Rhodes, "but I came across one case where two families were fighting over a birch.
Stop it people!
Some of the stories in the book use the castle as a springboard and delve deeper into English history, including a story called The Labourer, which follows a man who leaves a newly built castle to join the English Rebellion of 1381.
"I found a record of a rebellion at the castle in 1380, which was called the Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex", said Rhodes.
The English rebellion actually started in this area, and I thought the rebellion was a good starting point.
Maybe they're connected after all.
Other stories are firmly linked to the castle's history - for example The Priest, which tells the story of a Jesuit priest who was hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation.
Or The Smuggler about an 18th-century smuggler named Arthur Darrell who allegedly faked his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (which was not discovered until years after the coffin was discovered).
Rhodes' favorite family is the Darrells: "I was interested in the male generation - men were always in debt and spending money on things they couldn't afford.
Different generations of the Darrells have dealt with this by marrying rich or old ladies - I imagine they were handsome gentlemen who liked to screw with heirs.
With his stay at the castle over, Rhodes is looking for more adventures.
He recently returned from a two-week stint in the Finnish wilderness, where he was inspired to write his next book about Elämänmäki, a former sanatorium from the early 20th century that has been absorbed by nature.
But it's a special place for Scotney.
"I was sad when I left", he said.
I was like, "Now I'm going to get back to fucking real life".
Washington is changing the terms of the green card.
The media has reported President Donald Trump's remarks on a new US immigration plan that will also change the green card system.
The number of legal immigrants is projected to fall by 50 000 per year as a result of stricter rules on temporary work visas and restrictions on family visas.
The new rules are being proposed by the Republicans and the president.
The bill will be submitted to Congress soon.
This bill will reduce poverty, raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers by changing the rules for issuing green cards to people in other countries.
The bill would limit the number of immigrants and replace the current scheme.
"The new application process will give preference to English-speaking applicants who are well-funded and demonstrate skills that will benefit our country", Trump was quoted as saying by the media.
Sex robots on the rise - we should be on guard
Just when it seemed 2017 couldn't get any more bizarre, a report about the technological advances of sex robots pops up on the Internet.
- I know.
Sex robots are really popular these days.
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently released a statement on the development of sex robots within the next five to ten years.
According to former professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, Noel Sharkey, the rise of sex robots needs to be taken seriously.
Customers can choose the color of the eyes, the shape of the nipples and the appearance of the robot's nails.
"People are laughing at them, but sales are increasing and we must be prepared to see them more and more", Sharkey said at the launch of the report.
Modern sex aids are changing from inflatable panels to robotic women with silicone skin that is pleasantly warm to the touch - of course, artificial intelligence that mimics human behavior.
The user can customize the robot to suit his or her image - from eye color and nipple shape to the appearance and color of the nails.
But what is very disturbing is that many robots have their own "personality" that would embarrass even the Stepford Lady.
Modern inflatable virgins have evolved into robotic women with silicone skin.
The owner of the RealBotix robot can set his surrogate wife to various character traits, including shyness.
And then there's the sex robot woman Roxxxy Gold from True Companion, who comes with pre-programmed personalities, including the frigid Farrah, who is characterized by a shy nature, and the wild Wendy, with an adventurous nature.
The Roxxxy Gold personality is set to match your personality as closely as possible, says the True Companion website.
So she likes what you like and vice versa.
She's even moody, just like people.
She may be tired, talkative, or in a bad mood.
The rise of sex robots is alarming for several reasons, not least because they are mistaken for real human relationships, but because of their inferior female character traits and violent references, such as the frigid (or defiant) Farrah.
True Companion's website likened the Roxxxy to a male vibrator.
"If a woman can have a vibrator, why can't a man have a Roxxxy?" says the page.
But sex robots are not just a fetish or a sex tool.
Their emergence and near-perfect sophistication point to something darker and more deeply rooted in our culture -- a shift away from ideal or gender equality toward the desire for compulsive sex with optional compulsion.
Most men, of course, won't buy a robotic wife, and while FRR talks about their growing popularity, sex robots still remain on the fringes of the general public's interest.
But this fringe interest can become a mirror set for the modern age.
And most people aren't weird or violent until the free market gives them an excuse to be.
It's no coincidence that these sophisticated sex robots are appearing at a time when women around the world are fighting for their rights and the White House has a president who often speaks very disparagingly of women.
The most terrifying aspect of The Handmaid's Tale is not what we see - hanging bodies and gouged out eyes, but rather the reality of these visions.
The Handmaid's Tale is a step in the right direction, but at the moment it seems like a small step.
Sex robots should be as much like real women as possible (albeit to the extent of a porn actress).
Their makers design them to be pleasant to the touch and to appear at first glance like a real woman.
But when it comes to their personalities, a robot can't replace a real woman.
They can't break up with their partner or just walk away.
They have no job, no history, nothing that would encourage their independence or compromise their loyalty to their master.
In other words, they're pleasant slaves.
It's 21st century language: the servants.
NBA star on the green belt.
Curry's fighting for the cut in California.
Basketball star Stephen Curry, despite a blown first pitch in the opening round of the professional golf tournament, did not lose.
The two-time NBA Most Valuable Player award winner played in the Ellie Mae Classic of the Web.com Tour's lower division in Hayward, California, in the first round on 74 hits and will be fighting for the cut.
The Golden State quarterback, who won his second NBA title with the Warriors this season, started very nervous and his first shot ended up in a drink holder in a golf cart parked on the fairway.
Even then, he wasn't as accurate between the holes as he was under the basket, yet he still outscored the pros by a score of four.
"It wasn't the ideal way to start, having to call the referee right after the first shot, but then it kind of stuck", Curry said, with a huge shiver falling on him.
It was very nervous, firing the first shot in the tournament, but it was everything I had hoped for.
"If you told me I was going to play 74 in the first round, I would have taken it immediately", he added.
If Curry can fight through the cut, which will likely be set two strokes below par, he will become the first athlete from another sport to do so on the Web.com Tour.
"I want to play better next time, and now that I've got rid of my fear, I hope I can", said the enthusiastic golfer, who has played in celebrity tournaments and mixed amateur and professional tournaments.
It's his first time at Hayward, competing in a PGA event.
He won a sponsorship exemption to participate in the Ellie Mae Classic and retained his amateur status.
The Web.com Tour is one division below the elite PGA Tour.
Trump's big win?
On the other hand, Mitt Romney is the epitome of common sense.
A defining feature of the Trump era is the political divisions that are dividing American voters and, on a micro scale, also tearing apart entire families.
During the Christmas and Thanksgiving period, the American newspapers were awash with advice on how to deal with relatives who voted for Trump.
Supposedly, we're just waiting for our nerves to relax.
Less attention is paid to Trump's ability to raise a family.
I'm talking about this because I had a visit from my cousin in New York this week -- a poet and left-wing fan who lives in Chicago and who has been a longtime Republican fool in our family.
It reminded me that coming together in the face of a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
Now, with Trump in the White House, suddenly the whole family-- including all the Republican siblings she's been fighting over politics with for years-- is on the same page.
It's a good thing when you're having dinner at the family table, but I'm struck by the fact that in the larger context, it poses a significant risk.
Trump is strengthening the left, but the negative impact of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.
When we talk about "normalization" and Trump, we're referring to the frightening possibility that his clowns may one day lose their appeal.
But there is an even more terrible long-term scenario where Trump "normalizes" right-wing Republicans who, in defiance of his standards, will suddenly become the epitome of what can be called rational.
In these today, with nostalgia in my heart, I think of Mitt Romney and his version of crazy behavior - dog on the roof of a car, 14% income tax (at least we were aware of his tax return) - both of which look like very minor infractions compared to Trump.
After Trump leaves, all we need is for the next Republican nominee to be at least normal, which will be a huge improvement.
We took my cousin's visits and took the kids to Central Park to the biggest carousel run by the New York City Department of Parks -- you can't get a better use for your three dollars, unless you need caffeine.
The horses are huge, the center cylinder is covered in glass - clowns and animals roll over and stare in horror at their own shoulders - the look is gloomy, and the rustling music strangely resembles public transportation.
Many clichés soon get tired: the view from high-rise buildings, the panorama staring at you instead of breathing in the atmosphere, and the reality of the city not reaching your imagination.
Thirty-five years later, I still can't get over the fact that Swiss Cottage isn't really Swiss cheese -- not counting the theme bar Ye Olde Swiss Cottage -- but a London Underground station.
Nevertheless, the carousel in Central Park is a remarkably magical experience, to the extent that it is a great place for two-year-olds to enjoy as well as two mature women.
If I could rate the carousel, it would deserve the maximum points, but thankfully, no one asks.
This week I had a similar experience in a store, where I was asked to rate my "experience" on a scale of one to five when paying with a credit card.
It's the same at the coffee shop on my street corner, except I can tip 15% on something I buy at the counter.
Not only does it slow down otherwise fast sales, but the waitress is forced to intrude on the customers' favor when it's not necessary.
The woman at the store smiled and apologized for my reluctantly giving my credit card a five-star rating.
Oscar Pistorius was taken from prison to hospital with chest pain.
This is the second time Pistorius has had to be taken to the hospital.
Last year, he was treated for a cut on his wrist, which the prison said he inflicted on himself after falling in his cell.
Pistorius was convicted of murder after an appeal of his original murder conviction.
He killed his girlfriend Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day 2013 with multiple gunshot wounds through the toilet door of his home in Pretoria.
Pistorius claimed he mistaken her for a thief.
The plaintiffs have announced their intention to appeal again, this time against Pistorius' six-year sentence, which they say is too lenient.
The National Prosecuting Authority said it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and a trial would take place later this year.
If successful, Pistorius could face a 15-year prison term.
There is no death penalty in South Africa.
For the first time in history, a captive panda has given birth to a calf that mated in the wild.
This is a huge success for the panda rescue program.
The center is trying to expand the genome of captive panda.
Center worker Zhang Zhong told the New China Agency that the panda breeding is at great risk from crossbreeding.
At the end of last year, there were only 471 pandas in captivity.
Only two thousand remain in the wild.
Trying to get captive pandas to mate with wild ones is the first step in helping to protect the species.
Fifteen-year-old Chao-chao was released into the wildlife reserve at the start of the panda mating season on March 11.
With a tracking device on her neck, scientists could observe her every move.
She met her chosen one 12 days later.
The sexual intercourse with the male panda lasted a minute and a half and was successful.
Even this may be considered a small miracle, since male pandas are not considered the most successful lovers in the animal kingdom.
The males are rather poor at estimating when the female is ready, and they are often confused and unsure of what to do.
The cubs were born healthy and, even though Chao-chao had an extraordinary appetite during pregnancy, they weighed 216 grams at birth.
The average newborn panda weighs 70 grams less.
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced the arrest of two Bulgarian tourists in Greece for illegal camping, bTV quoted the statement as saying.
A group of tourists, including two Bulgarians, were detained by Sithonian police in the early hours of August 1.
All were released the same day, but the investigation is ongoing.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs told bTV that the Bulgarian tourists were later released.
The Greek authorities have tightened the rules for camping and are imposing heavy fines on anyone caught in a place where camping is not allowed.
The checks will be in place throughout the season.
The Ministry said the court could impose a fine.

Golfer Clara Spilková is tied for 50th place after the first round of the British Open.
The Kingsbarns field in Scotland was one stroke under par when she made three birdies and two bogeyes.
The 22-year-old Czech player hopes to make her first cut at the famous major.
The entry for the $3.25 million grant went to top-ranked American Michelle Wie, who won the first round by a record 64 runs, eight under par.
Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands are withdrawing millions of toxic eggs from the market.
The Netherlands itself has already temporarily closed 180 poultry farms because of the incident.
According to Reuters, the Dutch food safety authority NVWA said it was investigating 20 percent of all poultry farms in the Netherlands, which means that 80 percent of the eggs on the market are safe.
The Authority stressed that only a limited number of egg types recognisable by specific numbers represent a risk.
According to German authorities, the amount of toxic substance in eggs is small and poses no danger to adults, but it is a potential threat to children.
Czech SVS spokesman Petr Majer said that eggs and chickens from the Netherlands and Belgium, where authorities have even proceeded to close farms, have not been imported into the Czech Republic recently.
However, veterinarians shall take a random sample of eggs and chicken meat originating in Belgium, the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany and Poland where problematic brands of the insecticide have appeared on the markets.
According to the veterinary administration, eggs from Belgium were last on the Czech market in April and eggs from the Netherlands in May.
Chicken from Belgium last appeared in the Czech Republic in June.
In the Czech Republic, however, there is a certain amount of chicken meat from the Netherlands.
Fipronil is a substance that is used in anti-fleas, ticks and lice products.
However, it must not be administered to animals intended for human consumption.
The World Health Organization considers the preparation to be moderately toxic.
High doses of it cause nausea and dizziness.
Riga is beautiful, I'll miss it, says goalkeeper Peasant and seeks engagement.
I'd like to catch another ten years.
"Maybe I'll go back there one day", laughed the 27-year-old Farmer, who could start the season in the Zlín shirt.
It depends on whether he gets a new year's engagement.
What were the four years you spent in Latvia?
If I had to rate it like high school, I'd rate it three.
I didn't catch much the first year, I had a seasoned goalie in front of me.
I was studying.
Second year, I started catching.
Before season three, I thought they'd give me more space.
But they brought in a new goalie, and I took turns with him.
Last year, I assumed I'd be catching all the time.
But we only got about five points in the first ten games, so the coaches started shooting.
My colleague was catching more by the end.
But that's the way it's done.
They wanted to play him next season.
How was life in Riga?
It's beautiful.
It's little Prague.
It's a beautiful, European, historic city.
I'm going to miss him.
I made a friend there.
We're in our third year together, we're getting married next year.
So I brought something.
How tough is the NHL for goalies?
The top ten teams are really good.
Then there are teams like us or Slovan, who have to change their style of play against them.
Skill is on the other side, so you have to replace it with something.
That means more back-to-back, more fighting.
I didn't see a problem with the width of the court.
The difference is the Russians want to play it by ear.
They shoot less, and even though they have a half-empty goal in front of them, they prefer to record.
They shoot more in the Czech Republic.
Did you have any trouble traveling and traveling across the seven time zones?
If you don't have a family, it's not a problem.
He can sleep in peace.
The program is usually done by playing four games outdoors and then you have two days off.
How do Latvians even see their club in the KHL?
Like the national team.
The whole of Latvia watches hockey, along with basketball, it's the national sport.
They all cheer.
Even though it didn't work out, a lot of people came.
Did Dinam's performance in the KHL help Latvia to reach the quarterfinals of this year's World Cup?
The KHL has been around since 2008, and the Dinamo have been there since the beginning.
And from that time on, their World Championship results started to go up.
At the 2014 Sochi Olympics, they lost in the quarterfinals to Canada, narrowly 1-2.
It was a remarkable result for them.
KHL got them to the next level.
More and more Latvian players are heading to the Czech Extraliga.
Roberts Bukarts has won the Zlín and Ralfs Freibergs is about to sign the contract.
Why do so many people come here?
They're not really B players, they're really good.
The local teams are looking for cheaper and younger players from abroad, Latvians being one of them.
It's a natural course.
The NHL starts in three weeks.
Why are you still unengaged?
I knew at the beginning of February that I would not continue in Riga.
So we started looking for something.
Sparta was on the table.
But because they didn't have the budget for a goalie, we didn't make the deal.
Then it was a classic.
We talked to different teams, but they chose someone else in the final.
So I'm training at home in Zlín and I'll wait for something to come up.
Aren't you nervous about this?
That was me four years ago when I left here, not knowing what was gonna happen.
The current situation is not the best, but I'm home after a while.
I caught something in the NHL, so I'm taking it differently.
The only question is when and where I sign.
How realistic is the possibility that you'll start the new year in Zlín?
Anything can happen.
We'll see what happens next month, where it comes out.
Now I can only wait to hear what the agent says.
Do you prefer a competition?
Last season wasn't one for me to choose from.
So I'm waiting for a call.
The government's flight at the airport continues.
In January of this year, in the article "The Care of a Good Steward", I wrote about the camp at Letech u Orlíku.
The essence of the problem remains the same, so I will allow myself to recall the key passages of the article.
There's been talk of a camp in Letech for years.
For readers who do not know exactly what it is, it is probably best to look for example at the official website of the cultural monument Pietní místo Lety.
There, in the introduction of the historical overview, they learn that the camp was two kilometers east of the village of Lety, that from 8 August 1940 it served as a labor camp, from 1 January 1942 it was a concentration camp and from 2 August 1942 it became a gypsy camp.
Another text describes the course of life in the camp, including inhumane conditions, up to March 1943, when the first summer prisoners were included in the Auschwitz transport.
On May 4, 1943, the largest transport to the extermination camp was 370 people.
There were 420 in all.
A very sad history of the immense suffering of human beings, caused by human beings and perverted ideologies.
There is no question that these events need to be kept in mind.
There is no question that the commemoration should take place at a memorial at the site of the suffering of these people.
The problem is elsewhere.
During the Socialist era, the camp was somewhat forgotten, and in the 1970's, a pig farm was built nearby and on part of the former camp.
The history of the camp was accidentally discovered in 1992 by American Paul Polansky, in 1995 a monument was unveiled in Letech.
In the mid-1990s, the government promised to buy back and demolish the hog farm, but it hasn't.
In 1998 the monument was declared a cultural monument and since 2009 its administration falls under the Lidice Memorial.
In July 2013, the UN Human Rights Committee called on the Czech Republic to close the pig farm.
So very briefly the facts about the postwar fate of the camp.
It was not until last fall that the government approved the purchase of the pig and decided to have an expert opinion drawn up to determine the price.
According to the Minister of Agriculture, the government will buy the pigs.
According to Minister of Culture Herman, "some figures exist, but I would probably thwart those plans if I went public with them".
We'll see what the expertise says.
Some unofficial estimates put the price in the hundreds of millions, others in the billions.
Either way, it's not gonna be a cheap deal.
Just a few hundred yards from the former camp, a memorial was erected, which the state invested nearly $4 million in 2010.
Even if the entire transaction were nicely funded by the UN Human Rights Committee, which is not likely to happen, I still think it would be a waste of money.
Don't the government have other priorities?
The monument, a worthy place of worship, stands by the will of history in the immediate vicinity of the tragedy and anyone who wants to can pay homage to the memory of the victims.
I see no reason to change this!
Let's leave it as it is and keep the peak position with the utmost care.
The person responsible for the assets entrusted, including taxpayers' money, in this case the Government of the Czech Republic, should be treated with the care of a good steward.
At least with one like your own company!
Of course, the finance minister and the deputy prime minister are not the whole government.
But even so, in view of the above facts, I perceive the slogan of the leader of the YES movement as just an empty election proclamation.
I went to see the place myself in May of this year.
Very decent driveway, renovated parking, replicas of wooden camping huts.
One exposed, the other integrated toilet with running water.
A small natural amphitheater with seating and a view of its own picnic area, which is made of stones placed on a gentle slope.
Lots of flowers and wreaths.
All attributes appropriate to the significance of this place, as appropriate and proper.
Currently, archaeological research is underway at the site of the original camp.
It would be reasonable to consider, for example, whether it would be possible to preserve part of the exposed foundations and make them at least visually accessible in an appropriate way.
This is where Minister of Culture Daniel Herman could step up his efforts.
If he succeeds in getting the government to buy the pigs with state money, it will be just another unfortunate step in his already problematic stint as culture minister.
Red meat, dairy products, and chocolate may alleviate symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)
Red meat and dairy products can be a nightmare for your digestive system.
A new study, however, suggests the opposite: A diet rich in animal protein and dairy products could help relieve symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease.
A chronic disease that affects up to 1.3 million people in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom, it causes abdominal pain and bloody diarrhea, weight loss, and extreme fatigue.
Although patients are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve symptoms, researchers at the University of Washington have found that the essential amino acid tryptophan found in protein helps to build immune cells that support intestinal resistance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, the study's leader, explained that immune cells protect the intestines and help to break down harmful microbes in food.
The number of inflammatory cells is balanced by the number of cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue.
Once the scales are tilted to the side of inflammation, inflammatory bowel disease can occur.
In the study, the researchers found the presence of immune cells that promote the body's tolerance to a particular bacterium in the stomach of mice.
This bacterium requires tryptophan, one of the building blocks of proteins, to make cells.
Professor Colonna said: "We found a link between a type of bacteria called Lactobacillus reuteri, which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of cells that promote tolerance in the body.
The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more of these immune cells they had.
He also suggested that if the same was shown to be true in humans, then the combination of L. reuteri and a tryptophan-rich diet would help to develop a more tolerant and less inflammatory gut environment.
As part of a study of a type of immune cell that promotes body tolerance, postgraduate researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas found that one group of test mice had these cells, while another group of the same mice raised separately lacked them.
She reasoned that one group of mice had a different gut microbiome - a community of bacteria, viruses, and fungi that normally reside in the gastrointestinal tract.
The gut of the mice was tested using DNA sequencing, and the researchers found six types of bacteria in mice with immune cells that the other group of mice lacked.
Mice that were raised in a sterile environment and lacked the gut microbiome -- they didn't develop these kinds of immune cells -- were given L. reuteri, and they developed immune cells.
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system, researchers grew L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred a small amount of the liquid - without the bacteria - to undeveloped immune cells that were kept in isolation.
The immune cells have evolved into tolerant cells.
After removal of the active substance from the liquid, it was found to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indole-3-octate acid.
When the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's diet, the number of these cells increased by 50 percent, and when they halved the tryptophan doses, the number of cells dropped by half.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice, and most of us store L. reuteri bacteria in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not known whether tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri cause cell development in humans in the same way as in mice, but defects in tryptophan-related genes have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan added: "Each of us should probably strive to develop these cells, because they control the inflammation of the inner surface of the intestines.
Potentially high tryptophan levels in the presence of L. reuteri bacteria may increase the cell population.
Jose Mourinho considers signing Nemanja Matic and his move to Manchester United "genius".
Manchester United have added a genius in the form of Nemanja Matic - or so José Mourinho thinks after the midfielder made his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday.
Matić, who signed for £40m, made his first appearance in the 2-1 win in Dublin - the final pre-season game before United face Real Madrid on Tuesday - and impressed in his role as a midfielder alongside Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira.
However, as he missed the team's pre-season Asian tour, Matić was out of form and played only 45 minutes, which Mourinho said needed to be worked on before the start of the next Premier League season.
"He needs time, but he's experienced, intelligent and has a brilliant mindset - he thinks like football", Mourinho said.
We'll help him get in shape as soon as possible.
Like Matić, his new teammates Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also played their first match at the Aviva Stadium and Mourinho is slowly starting to build his squad for next season.
An independent source this week reported that Mourinho still wants to sign three more players, but insists the club has done "a fantastic job" bringing in three of the four most important players.
"Thank you to the club for helping me acquire three of the four players", he added.
Four out of four would have been more pleasing, but I must admit they did their best for me.
The challenge of a lifetime for the King of Peaches.
He wants a lesson from the Goblin!
This promising picture began to emerge thanks to a new program on TV Prima Zdenek Academy.
Peach immediately saw an opportunity.
"Dear Zdenek, I would like to apply to your cooking academy because, on my word, I think I can learn a lot from you", he challenged him in a video posted on the social network.
And since the two of them have been seeing each other for years, Ladya didn't forget to piss him off this time.
"In return, I can teach you the rental of diet chicken and American cucumbers or invite you to the water and show you why the favorite fried cheese is", growled Peach.
He's really serious about his participation in Pohlreich's new show.
It's time to move up a level and learn from the master.
"The question is, what does the boss say?" said Lightning.
Pohlreich didn't say anything because he was filming new episodes of his next show Yes, Boss!
Only Prima reacted to Pearsky's participation in the culinary academy by treating the whole affair as his personal activity, which goes beyond television.
He made a big impact on Hruška Pohlreich in December 2004 with his first cook.
In a matter of days, it sold over 300,000 copies!
The new show that Prima introduced yesterday at the press conference for the fall broadcast schedule is the genuine cooking school.
Pohlreich selects his pupils from the audience and introduces them to twelve cooking techniques in twelve pieces.
In the final episode of his show Now the Chef is Cooking in November 2014, Zdenek had a crossed-out pear ironed on the back of his shirt.
If it had my face on it, I'd laugh a lot.
"I can't help but laugh at the pear - it's a healthy fruit and it has a lot of vitamins", said the Bear.
He has his own opinion of Lado's culinary art.
"Cooking like Lady Peach is not even a possibility at home, because I'm not going to let gastropunk into my house", the boss is clear.
I have a lot of respect for the day of the Pohlreich, he even says I make chicken with honey.
But his recipes are definitely not on my show", he did not forgive Peach.
He's such an asshole!
He's not a cook to me, he's a TV clown.
"Gastronomically illiterate or an idiot", Pohlreich said of Hrušk at a lecture.
"I'm not 20 to wave my hand at them, but I don't deal with them that way", he said of the insults.
A British inventor uses a microchip in his hand to unlock a car and a house with a wave
A British inventor has become the first person in the country to have a microchip implanted in his body that can unlock doors to his home and office and even start a car with a simple wave of his hand.
Thirty-three-year-old Steven Northam has had a tiny chip implanted between his thumb and forefinger and is now offering the same service through his company BioTeq to companies and individuals who want to use technology to simplify their lives.
The implantation procedure and adherence to treatment procedures is supervised by Dr Geoff Watson, an anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester.
The technology works on the same principle as microchips implanted in dogs and cats, and the whole procedure takes 30 seconds.
Northam's company also offers a service to replace microchip-compatible car and door locks at a cost of £300 each.
A married father of one has had technology integrated into his home and his BMW Z4 car, which starts with a simple wave of his hand.

The White House's decision to fly a Navy helicopter to the South Lawn for a celebration of American manufacturing last month came at a cost of $24,000, according to Navy records published by TIME magazine.
The green-and-white Sikorsky VH-3D helicopter, also called Marine One in the presence of the President on board, was the highlight of a July 17 White House program that was a demonstration of American design programs.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and several senior White House officials were watching a showcase of products from all 50 states.
A helicopter from Connecticut was displayed alongside a yacht from Maine, a fire truck from Wisconsin, and a fork lift from Mississippi.
A White House military officer issued a fragmentary order, or FRAGO, requesting the presence of a helicopter less than 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn in an "emergency" incident, according to records from Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operating the helicopter.
"I wanted to make sure you were aware of such a significant event", wrote the commander of HMX-1 in an email to his superior, the deputy naval aviation commander, the day before the event began.
The report indicated that the helicopter would arrive at South Lawn on July 17 at approximately 7:00 a.m. for the parade, which is scheduled to begin at 3:00 p.m. and remain in place until the entire site is fully cleared, which was scheduled to take place between 6:00 and 9:00 p.m.
The e-mail also said that if there was a delay in the departure from the White House, a flight crew would be sent back for a return flight due to work hours regulations.
The original crew remained on the scene that evening with a helicopter and a security team.
The recordings - obtained by TIME - did not indicate whether a second crew was eventually sent.
The Hatch Act prohibits government officials from using government property for political purposes.
The records indicate that HMX-1 is investigating possible violations of this regulation.
"We were wondering if it was a violation of the Hatch Act and were assured that everything was in order", the commander wrote.
"Sounds like you're being blocked", the deputy commander wrote.
This "Made in America" parade was designated by the White House as an official event and therefore would not be covered by the Hatch Act.
But even official events have political overtones.
In his speech, the president was promoting health care reform that was going through the Senate and talking about trying to rein in government regulation.
The use of aerial vehicles such as Marine One or Air Force One for political purposes is hardly a new phenomenon.
Presidents use them when they travel.
However, their presence purely for presentation reasons is unusual.
Trump ordered the check in February after a presidential jet flew in the background at his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida.
"The White House is pleased with the 'Made in America' showcase, which showcases products from all 50 states made by Americans using American materials", said Deputy Press Secretary Lindsay Walters.
The crews of the HMX-1 helicopter often practice landing in the Washington area and on the South Lawn and rehearse possible arrivals with the President of the United States to the White House with maximum accuracy.
While Trump was attending the G-20 summit in Germany in early July, the HMX-1 made 58 training landings at the White House.
The Made in America show was part of the crew's ongoing training, the official said.
The helicopter unit flew on the same day on a non-presidential support mission for another 11 hours.
The White House has stated that no other props were paid for with taxpayer money.
A Sikorsky spokesman said the company was not involved in any way in the negotiations to display the helicopter on the South Lawn.
HMX-1 does not keep budget records for presidential flights and the exact costs associated with the parade are difficult to determine, according to the Navy.
According to the Department of Defense, the hourly rate for fiscal year 2017, the DoD's reimbursement for the VH-3D is $24,380 per flight hour.
Unit logs show a 30-minute flight from Marine Corps Air Facility Quantico in Virginia and back.
The White House argues that the actual operating costs of the helicopter are well below that amount.
"To cite taxpayers' costs on the basis of estimates for reimbursement is very misleading", Walters said of the whole case.
These estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual cost.
The Commission notes that the costs of the measures are not directly linked to the costs of the military.
The then White House press secretary Sean Spicer advocated using a helicopter for the purpose of the parade.
"The idea of the show this week is to showcase products made in the U.S"., Spicer said.
I'm aware that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut take great pride in the fact that they contribute to the defense of our state and that they provide employment for hundreds, if not thousands of people.
I think, like most Americans, we are proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that countless American citizens are involved in building.
This fact is worth recalling.
It's unclear if Trump was on his patrol on the South Lawn to see if the helicopter was involved, but we can only say with certainty that he was behind the wheel of one of the fire trucks.
Back at the White House, Trump addressed a Sikorsky representative and joked with the media about his own fleet of products.
"I know Sikorski very well", said the President, "I own three of them".
A young woman was trapped in a swamp at Lake Mach, and the police were on their way to her.
The girl left for the beach Sunday around 2:00 a.m.
But instead of bathing, she was trapped in the swamp.
When she decided to call the police on her cell phone for help, she had the last 12 percent of her battery.
"As a result, the police soon lost contact with her", police spokeswoman Ivana Balakova said.
Several police patrols were sent to the location she described, but finding the young woman was not easy.
"Some of the officers had to wade through hundreds of feet of reeds before they felt the ground again", Baláková said.
And she was also missing.
The officers were guided by the direction of her distress call.
"To at least keep this connection, they arranged for her to count down loudly", the spokeswoman said.
Police found the woman at 3:15 a.m. in a swamp in Borny.
She was on the verge of physical and mental exhaustion and showing signs of hypothermia.
So the ambulance called to her took her to the hospital in Czechoslovakia.
Grandpa's connection to Stan?
The bride-to-be becomes the salesgirl.
That's a little ironic.
With his web project searchameslusny.cz, it's like a billionaire is basically telling voters that STAN is suffering from a decent people deficit.
And he also claimed that the politically disconnected gang of lesser-known mayors and independents actually had no national agenda for the House election.
Her candidate for president is simply a decent person, no matter what his political views, after interviewing Grandpa.
That's how Vit Bart started out once, and it didn't turn out very well.
With his hunt for decent people and personalities, who may eventually replace some mayors in the candidates, which even Gazdík admitted, Djedek also cancels the favorite argument of the head of STAN that the greatest value of the movement is precisely the political verification and experience of mayors, traditionally the most popular politicians according to the polls.
Now they're being replaced by hastily collected unknowns.
The total break with the populists, after which STAN changed the logo and slogan, the owner explained that the movement does not want to lose its identity on the candidates of the populists.
But if STAN was suspected of identity by few then, with the arrival of Grandpa, even the simple game of identity ends.
Not only has Gazdík long been against ANO Andrey Babiš, but at the first joint press conference Dedek, who praises Babiš publicly, stated the following: "My goal is that the ANO movement, that is, the Mayor's movement, wins twenty percent in the upcoming elections".
Let's hope you didn't get the wrong movement.
Grandpa is a successful businessman and a billionaire is no accident.
He often talks about politics in the same way as Babiš, but unlike him, he doesn't have a political brand of his own.
STAN has been more of a reality show than a real political party for some time now, and Grandpa's helping hand seems to make the bride-to-be even more of a salesgirl.
For a while, Stan went with Top 9, then the Pops, and now he's looking for decent people for a change.
Let's hope someone hears from us.
Police dogs were training in helicopter flights at the bridge.
Explosives and search dogs were rehearsing helicopter flights over the Bridge today.
The police dog must not be afraid and be afraid of flying, said the head of the police cynologists of the Ústecký region Petr Tomášek.
Training a police dog takes about two years.
The Bridge was used by both adult dogs and dogs undergoing training.
In addition to standard training to detect sharp explosive samples around the lake and search for a missing exhibitor, all 12 animals had to board a helicopter and fly over the lake.
The main purpose of the exercise is to test dogs in a helicopter.
So as soon as the helicopter lands, the dog can go to work, so he doesn't have a problem with the helicopter.
"The helicopter is still there, the dog is coming and immediately looking", said Tomášek.
A dog that is restless or unable to start working immediately after a helicopter ride is disqualified.
"They are usually left in the garden by the dog-lovers", Tomášek added.
The police have 76 dogs in the Isthmus with different specialties.
German Shepherds dominate, but Belgian Shepherds are also on the rise.
The dog walker's been taking care of him since he was a puppy.
"He's raising him himself, preparing him for the service the dog will do for us", Thomas added.
The animal shall undergo repeated veterinary examinations which may reveal any medical handicaps.
If the dog is healthy and fearless, he takes his first tests at 20 months.
"The acute intervention takes about two and a half to three years", Tomášek added.
The length of service in the police depends on the dog's health.
They usually serve eight to ten years.
They usually live in their canine tubes.
Pablo Escobar is out of the game and the Cali Cartel becomes the center of a hit Netflix series
Despite the conclusion of the second season of Narcos, when Pablo Escobar's killer is uncovered, the Netflix series is far from over.
The streaming service has confirmed the third and fourth seasons - the first named one has already seen the first trailer and cast of other villains.
In season three, the DEA focuses on the world's richest drug cartel, the Cali Cartel.
Under the leadership of four powerful godfathers, they operate like a Fortune 500 company, only with the difference that they escalate violence and bribe more government officials.
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela (Damian Alcazar) is the leader of the cartel, Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela (Francisco Denis) plays the brains of the operations, Pacho Herrera (Alberto Ammann) is in charge of the connection with Mexico and Chepe Santacruz Londono (Pepe Rapazote) controls New York.
In the new trailer, Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña, a character recruiting American and Colombian law enforcement in the war on drugs.
Other actors include Matias Varela, Michael Stahl-David, Matt Whelan, Miguel Angel Silvestre, Kerry Bishé and Arturo Castro.
Narcos season three will premiere on September 1st.
According to the UN, Afghan democracy relies on women in politics.
Elections can only be credible if all members of society, including women, participate, the UN representative in Afghanistan said on Wednesday.
Nicholas Haysom, head of the UN Assistance Mission, said that hundreds of women are running for local councils, three women are running for vice president, and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women.
The role of women cannot be overlooked,he said in a statement on Wednesday.
Elections can only be fully representative and credible if women are involved, as well as in all related processes related to elections.
Local and presidential elections are due to be held in Afghanistan on April 5.
The Taliban have issued several threats against the electoral process, which is moving international combat activity into the second round.
In this year's election, for the first time ever, a democratically elected government is handing over power to a peaceful successor.
Haysom said that a strong role for women would strengthen Afghanistan's democracy.
The Independent Electoral Commission of Afghanistan said that 1.2 million of the 3.6 million registered voters are women.
The unique brewery is brewing beer again.
A good beer for a revived brewery.
The enthusiasm and honesty of the new owners brought back to life the brewery in Lobca near Mšen a few years ago.
The brewery, first mentioned in 1586, has a Renaissance core and was converted to steam power in the nineteenth century.
The years of prosperity followed, when the brewery was famous for its dark beers.
Unfortunately, production was halted during World War II and the brewery was nationalized in 1984.
Since then, the buildings have been used as state property.
The brewery's owners did the destruction after 1989.
The abandoned site was devastated and dismantled for building material.
In 2007, however, new hope was born in the form of new owners, architects Jana and Pavel Prouzov.
They began to repair the buildings with the utmost respect for the spirit of the building and every detail.
They have been and are careful to study archival materials, trying to preserve the original materials and building elements.
The brewery is as old as the 19th century, when its golden age began.
Their work was recognised by the Ministry of Culture as a cultural monument and the building was included in the European Route of Industrial Heritage.
In 2015, they also celebrated the revival of the tradition of brewing beer.
If you want to taste the excellent Lobotoma beer in the picturesque landscape of Kokorin, visit the brewery's brewery.
The brewery uses coconut water from a protected landscape area, malt from the Lobotnica fields and hops from the harvest.
The bar will feature traditional light lager, but also dark beers and specials.
And don't miss the brewery tour, Saturday and Sunday at noon and 2:30.
The largest artillery fort in Czechoslovakia?
One of the largest fortresses of its kind on a global scale?
The fortress Stachelberg was to be such a unique structure between Trutnov and Žacléř, on top of a ridge above the village of Babí.
Originally, it was to consist of up to 12 bunkers connected by a vast underground tunnel.
This was supposed to be the headquarters, barracks, ammunition depots, materials, power plant, engine room and hospital.
But the Munich Agreement ended the construction.
In less than a year, a single massive reinforced concrete bunker was built and underground chambers were breached.
Thanks to the enthusiasts of the Stachelberg Association who began to reconstruct the unique building in the early 1990s, you can see it too.
The basement is now 75 percent open!
The area includes, in addition to the infantry bunker T-S 73 with exposition and underground, an armed light fortification facility, two dismantled infantry bunkers, trenches and the fortified Trutnovsko training trail.
Refreshments, a cozy gazebo and breathtaking views of the countryside guaranteed!
This unique and beautiful Czech building has been listed alongside such monuments as the Great Wall of China, Trajan's Harbour near Rome, and the Assyrian palaces of Nineveh and Nimrud.
The Chotěšov Monastery, originally from the beginning of the thirteenth century, which today mainly consists of a massive four-winged convent building over a beautiful garden.
A list he's been on, but unfortunately, it's a unique structure that's in danger of extinction.
But the enthusiasts are not giving up and are holding many events in support of the monastery.
One of them is the next annual evening for the Choteshov Monastery on Saturday, August 5th, where Vladimir Mišik, Ivan Vlas, among others will speak, you will see the fencing performances and look at the places of the beautiful extensive building, which are usually inaccessible.
But most importantly, you'll enjoy the atmosphere of this great place.
You want to look a Neanderthal in the face?

Get to know the plant with one click.
The new free application Pl@ntNet will help both students of herbal medicine and ordinary plant lovers.
If they're wondering what plant they just came across on the walk, this app will tell them.
All they have to do is take a picture of the plant, and the app will recognize the species.
The new app, which is available for both iOS and Android, was unveiled on Tuesday by representatives of the CEEV Centre for Ethical and Environmental Education in Bratislava's Mountain Park as part of the project Secret Life of the City.
Students from 50 Czech and Slovak schools also took part in the project, taking pictures with their teachers and adding plants from their surroundings to the application's database.
A newly created French app is free to download on the Secret Life of the City website.
The main goal of the French developers was to get as many people as possible to contribute their images to the app, thus increasing the number of plants that the app can recognize.
"Children who hold a tablet or mobile phone in their hands can now go into the forest", said Ivana Poláčková, the project coordinator.
Based on a high-quality photo of a flower, leaf or fruit, the app can identify the name of the plant within seconds and then assign it to the photo in both Czech and Slovak.
The French have allowed us to translate the app into Slovak and Czech for the project Secret Life of the City.
Therefore, users are welcome to contribute a photo of a plant not yet present in the database after creating an account in the application.
"The French will evaluate whether it is useful and then add it to the database", Poláčková informed.
GMB's concerns about its investment in McVitie's factory in Glasgow
The unions are demanding assurances from the managers of McVitie's biscuit maker about a long-term commitment to manufacturing at the Glasgow factory.
The Scottish Trade Union Confederation GMB said that the company was silent about a possible investment in the Tollcross plant.
The factory employs over 500 workers who produce, among other products, Hobnob cookies and Rich Tea.
McVitie's owner, Pladis, said that over the past few years, it had invested more than £5 million in the whole area.
She added that employees and trade union representatives would be 'among the first to be informed' of any changes in the factory's operations.
In a letter to the construction company, GMB's Scottish unions expressed their concern that McVitie's will not deliver on its promises to finance and upgrade production lines.
GMB chief organiser Drew Duffy added: The fact that we have not received a clear response from the building manager on the company's needs and future investment plan at Tollcross is very worrying to our members.
Many generations of families have worked here and the staff come mostly from the local community and the Glasgow area, where working in the factory is a critical pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social exclusion.
In terms of jobs, wages and benefits - and despite the prospect of Brexit, rising living costs and declining slow manufacturing - the east end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving manufacturer like McVitie's.
A spokesperson for Pladis said: The construction manager of Tollcross received a letter from GMB only yesterday and the company will issue a statement as soon as possible, as we appreciate the continued commitment to employees and trade union representatives.
A regular meeting with GMB's employees and representatives in Tollcross took place two months ago and many issues were openly discussed at this meeting.
We told our employees that, as with all companies operating in extremely competitive and uncertain economic conditions, we assess our operations on a regular basis, which applies to all our operations, so that we can continue to compete successfully with others.
She added: 'We have invested £5 million in the Tollcross area in recent years, mainly in production lines and efficiency.
We value the heritage of Tollcross and the local area very much and will inform employees and union representatives immediately of any changes in the operations of the local mill.
Did PSG warn Barcelona about Neymar's move three years ago?
La Liga may regret their interest in Marco Verratti
Paris Saint-Germain will not allow in their attempt to get Neymar on their side after paying £189 million, the amount needed to buy Neymar out of his contract, but did this French team warn Barcelona about their record-breaking raid three years ago?
The sensational move has stirred up the waters of summer transfer pricing as the Ligue 1 club is set to more than double the previous record price for Paul Pogba's move to Manchester United, who paid £89m for him last season.
Once confirmed and completed, Neymar will become the world's most expensive player and the highest paid professional athlete in the world - after taxes, he will receive over £500,000 a week from PSG.
Barcelona is outraged by the way Neymar has been released from his contract, despite a confidential source confirming that the club has always tried to accommodate Neymar in everything since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But was the football world warned about this fact three years ago by the president of PSG?
When Manchester City expressed interest in Blaise Matuidi in 2014, Nasser Al-Khelaifi warned any club interested in signing one of PSG's top players.
"I'm not afraid because once someone tries to get one of our players, then we will definitely go to one of their players", Al-Khelaifi said.
We respect all clubs.
But if they try to get one of our players, they'll face consequences.
Barcelona seem to have crossed the imaginary line when they expressed interest in PSG midfielder Marco Verratti last summer.
PSG have made it clear that they will not allow the Italian to leave under any circumstances, so it is possible that Barcelona are now taking a bitter pill for their audacious behaviour with Neymar's departure.
Who's going to explain the sanctions?
Does political punishment have broadly understood rules?
Donald Trump has been nodding his head at the anti-Russia sanctions.
The day before, the United States imposed sanctions on Venezuelan President Maduro.
And just the day before, Trump tweeted that China was doing nothing about the North Korean threat and that it would not continue.
Even that makes the idea of sanctions sound like a straw from a shoe.
You can't just throw that stuff in one bag.
Maduro's Venezuela has indeed embarked on a path to dictatorship, even totalitarianism.
China just isn't acting the way the president of the United States would want.
Russia is a chapter in itself.
But if someone wanted to summarize it all in a way that the average voter, American, European or otherwise, understood what it was and what the rules system was that sanctions policy was based on, it would be an almost impossible task.
In sanctioning Russia, President Trump is only doing what President Obama has already done, he has just put the stamp on it.
Then why all the fuss?
Last year, Europe was afraid that if Trump won the US election, it would embrace Putin and lift sanctions.
That's a terrible thought.
In practice, it's the other way around.
With Trump, sanctions are not easing, they are tightening.
But Europe is even more frightened.
German Foreign Minister Zypries says Trump's sanctions violate international law.
So kosher is just sanctions approved by the UN Security Council?
But then there's no kosher or EU sanctions against Russia.
The European Commission chief, Juncker, has complained that Trump's sanctions threaten the EU's energy security.
Like sanctions are supposed to be so weak that they don't endanger anyone?
The average voter is a loser.
For three years, he's been told that the fate of anti-Russian sanctions depends solely on the implementation of the Minsk agreements on the ceasefire in Ukraine.
Now it is clear that the EU's energy security is at stake.
The voter is getting more and more.
Sanctions are coming on Russia for over-assembling where it shouldn't.
China is being booed for not assembling enough.
The Venezuelan president is being punished for building a dictatorship within the borders of his country.
All these punishments or just considerations have their rationality.
But does anyone see a system, an order or a rule?
Andrej Babiš: I'm not considering working with Okamura.
Andrej Babiš is married, crossing the republic with his visionary book and finalizing the electoral program.
Apart from Pardubice, he has all the candidates.
According to his own words, he didn't interfere with them in any significant way.
He even agreed to let the Moravian-Silesian school be run by the head of the ANO and shadow education minister Ivo Vondrák.
"But if he succeeds, he will have to choose between being a deputy or a captain", Babiš confirmed.
You've pissed off a lot of congressmen and state politicians with your thesis that directly elected mayors and mayors should run communities and cities by themselves, with only managers.
Are you serious?
It wasn't like that.
I'm a big fan of direct democracy, we elect the president directly, and I believe we should elect mayors and mayors as well.
I'm not talking about interfering with the delegates in my book, they could be there.
The question is, how many will there be?
When I was presenting your book, What I Dream About When I Accidentally Sleep, I overheard you talking about abolishing the House of Representatives.
I don't remember that.
I was talking about direct election and reducing the number of representatives.
New York City, with a population of nine million, has five districts and 51 congressional seats.
Prague, with 1.2 million inhabitants, has 1,171 deputies.
And the mayor is being accused of not building enough and not preparing big projects, but she doesn't have the competence to do that.
The same goes for a government that has only been run by two people in our history, Klaus and Zeman.
Which is not to say they did it right.
The current prime minister is not in charge, he's just moderating the debate.
It can't work like that.
Is that why you want to impose majority rule?
It would be ideal, but it's hard to get it to work.
The only change in the agenda is a one-round Senate election.
We also proposed a slippery mandate for ministers and an amendment to the House Rules of Procedure to avoid unnecessary exhibitionism by Members who are supposed to work mainly in committees and committees, not show off at House meetings.
It is certainly not true that I want to destroy the parliamentary system.
But that's exactly what your opponents are afraid of.
That as a dictator you would run the government, control the 101 member House, abolish the counties and the Senate, and through grateful mayors and mayors rule the entire country.
It's definitely not that.
There's nothing wrong with debating the number of Members.
French President Macron has announced a reduction of the legislative body by a third, whereas there are 57,000 French per one legislator, while in our country it amounts to 17,000 Czechs.
But nobody accuses Macron of threatening democracy.
Even if someone wins an election in the Czech Republic by a majority, we have mechanisms that would prevent them from making any dramatic changes.
The odds for whoever has the parliamentary majority are huge, but look at Poland or Hungary.
Nothing like that happens in the case of the YES movement.
We just need a team in government that works for the people, not for their own party or department.
I don't understand why we couldn't agree to raise only the salaries of teachers, cultural workers and social workers.
Why did they override me and add 21 percent to the GIBS members who are already taking 60 grand?
Would you have stepped on that as Prime Minister?
The Prime Minister is supposed to intervene when ministers are acting unprofitably, confusing the government with the travel agency and want to do business with the state's money like Marian Jurečka, who wanted to buy forests in Romania and land in Africa.
Ministers in government are not supposed to fight. They're supposed to settle their differences outside of government.
The cabinet must have the finished material, no room for coalition divisions, force voting and deals, that's where the decisions are made.
How do you expect to have a cohesive team when the ministers are mostly partisan?
Above the parties is the constitutional law.
When it came to breaking bread, Sobotka said the coalition agreement was not valid, and he kicked Babis out of the government.
Any Prime Minister can do that.
But if he is a person and has leadership skills, such a simple gesture is not necessary.
He measures everyone the same and demands perfect performance from everyone.
Have you decided who you'd recommend for the Treasury Secretary?
I don't think about it at all, because we're probably not even in that government, nobody wants to work with us, even though I don't know what I did that was so terrible.
There's no need to be so skeptical.
The mayor's got a businessman named Grandpa who'd like to work with you. Maybe the winner of the popular vote is your favorite, George Chunk.
I don't think you are.
The CPSU is led by Lubomír Zaorálek, who does not exclude a coalition with the ANO, in the ODS Václav Klaus Jr. may be promoted, who will also not be against.
I'd leave it to the voters.
The deputy prime minister and vice president of the ANO, Richard Brabec, said that you have many points in common with the SPD's Tomia Okamura, for example in the area of economics.
So the Okamurov's are a viable coalition partner?
Mr. Brabec claims he didn't say it like that.
Mr. Okamura has a political history, running as a puppet of Vit Bart for the House of Representatives, then raising money from Dawn for his company, some coup there.
He's a very distinctive character, of course.
A little brown, though.
If I take his program, he has a broad involvement of people in the management of society, direct democracy, you can agree with that.
I'm not asking you that.
I wonder if you'd consider a person with xenophobic views, who speaks at demonstrations with gallows and wants to leave the EU acceptable?
We're not considering working with Mr. Okamura's party, I can't imagine.
It's obvious he went into politics to profit from it.
What about the communists' silent support for your minority government?
I can't even imagine that, but the voters will decide.
It's gonna be a winner-take-all negotiation, but God knows who's gonna be the winner and who's gonna be number two.
Of course, it is important that they are able to agree on a coalition government programme.
Let's go back to your attempt to run the state as a company.
But the government just has to follow, Prime Minister Sobotka has been avoiding everything, never deciding.
Coalition affairs like CEB or EGAP didn't work.
I mean, he's got a crush on Sabotka, and I think that's why he fired me.
Once he did, the CEZ took control of the Czech government.
It's incredible that the Prime Minister has introduced a resolution written by the CEZ management, which dictates to the Minister of Finance how to vote at the CEZ General Assembly.
If you became Prime Minister, would you change the personnel of the supervisory board and replace the top management of the Central Bank?
Jesus Christ, if I'm Prime Minister, we'll see.
I'm not a doctor yet.
Word is the ZEC has already sent signals in your direction.
He'd like to trade a good cooperation with the CPSU for an even better one with the ANO.
Maybe after the election, things will go on.
I don't know anything about that.
I have no lobbyists for Humble or Pink, I'm a separate unit and I'm not dealing with this at all.
Then answer me directly.
If you become the head of the government, will you seek to change the management of the Czech Republic's Central Bank, Czech Television or the General Health Insurance Company, the institutions you criticize?
I want CEZ to be a transparent company.
For years, he's done what he wanted with commissions from traditional political parties.
All you have to do is look up Mr. Schwarzenberg's statements.
Although he's supposed to be the majority in the Czech Republic, he never ran it, he was only there in numbers, which is bad.
It's a trivial matter to me.
CEZ is supposed to take the Dukovans, evaluate them, put them into a subsidiary, arrange funding, do a supplier competition or get a co-investor and build a new nuclear power plant.
The concept that the state should fund and build new nuclear power plants is absurd.
What about Czech TV?
Some of her programs run a permanent, purposeful campaign against me, but I don't have and I won't have the competence to fire anyone.
But to control it.
I don't want to control anyone.
I'm just saying that citizens pay about 7.2 billion dollars a year in public radio and television bills, but they don't really know how these institutions are run.
How can they not know?
The House approves the report on their management, which has a direct impact on the positions of the CEOs of the Czech Republic and the Czech Republic.

What do you think of the articles describing how the first vice-president of ANO Jaroslav Faltýnek is building a power base by putting his son on the supervisory board of Tepláren Brno and arranging for a related lawyer Květoslav Hlin to sign contracts with city and state companies such as Prague Transportation Company or České dráhy?

If something like this happens, we'll get rid of anyone, no matter who it is.
