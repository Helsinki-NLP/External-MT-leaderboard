The Prague Stock Exchange at the market closure had a negative collapse.
After the fall in the morning, the Prague Stock Exchange regained its losses.
CEZ stock transactions reached almost half of the current daily trade.
Since early Tuesday, the Prague Stock Exchange has recovered from the crash of the day before it was almost 6%.
Behind this downturn is the collapse of Wall Street stocks.
Thus, also from us, there is a reaction of the market to the result of the vote of the House of Representatives in America, which refused to support the plan to stabilize the local financial sector.
Collapse of actions in Asia
On Tuesday, the Asian stock exchanges experienced a dramatic fall, although the indices, however, during the day subsequently erased part of the losses.
The Hang Seng index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange dropped 4 percent during the day, but later a portion of the losses also stabilized at 2.5 percent.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises index, which follows the movement of Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, fell by 3.8 percent while markets in Shanghai closed.
The Sydney Stock Exchange lost more than 5%, but eventually the losses reached 4.3%.
The Thay-Wan Stock Exchange, according to the local index, fell by 3.6%.
“The planning of the rescue action is uncertain and it will affect financial markets around the world,” said Hong Kong’s Foreign Exchange Office chief Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, despite being part of China, manages its monetary policy on its own, therefore not dependent on the Central Bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates at the same level as the United States.
U.S. lawmakers, according to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, should quickly return to dialogue and approve the proposed financial support.
Otherwise, there is a risk that other countries will suffer consequences as well.
The impact of American actions
The U.S. Parliament on Monday rejected the plan to support the financial system, for which 700 billion dollars (nearly twelve trillion Czech crowns) were to be allocated.
Legislators have thus ignored President Bush’s appeal to support the plan.
Bush said the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks on Monday experienced a crash and major stock indices recorded their biggest fall in more than 20 years.
The Dow Jones index fell by 7% and a similar collapse was last seen in 1987.
The index dropped already before the vote, but as soon as it was seen that the bill was not approved, it went into free fall.
Congress has given in: the U.S. government can give $700 billion to banks.
The highest representatives of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed on a broader form of an agreement of economic support for the U.S. financial system.
The vote will be held at the beginning of next week.
U.S. lawmakers broke the ice in the dialogue on approving the bailout plan in the form of economic aid to the U.S. financial system for a total of $700 million (nearly twelve trillion crowns).
But it is not said yet.
Representatives of Congress, therefore, must define some details of the agreement before publishing the final form of the law and voting on it.
The financial support plan will be discussed on Monday in the House of Representatives.
This was stated by Barney Frank, chairman of the House Committee on Banking and Financial Services.
The Senate, according to some sources, could vote on the plan probably not before Monday.
According to economists, the announcement that the financial plan will be approved should be the first and fundamental psychological factor that can awaken the financial markets.
But there will then be a return to reality due to the complexity of the mechanisms by which, in practice, to reach the aid of the markets.
The plan must be effective.
“We have taken a big step forward.”
"We have clarified our different views on the form of the presentation of the package for market stabilization," Democrat Nancy Pelosi told Bloomberg.
The final vote could take place on Sunday.
Legislative delegates met on Saturday night with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to shape the government’s financial funds.
These funds should be used to acquire non-transferable mortgage assets from financial companies, which bring financial companies to serious losses and endanger the stability of the entire system.
“We are fulfilling the final agreement of the plan that will work and that must also be effective in the market.”
“We still need to move forward with the recovery plan, but I think we’re doing it,” Paulson said.
Signal for Asian Trade
The global financial crisis has strongly impacted the stock markets that are falling abruptly.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to reach a final agreement in Congress before Sunday.
They want to calm investors before trading on Asian financial markets, which are, in time, the first to influence the market on Monday following the decision of Congress.
But it is not yet clear when the two houses of the U.S. Congress will vote on the bill and whether negotiations can end at the last minute on any issue.
Legislators hope it will be approved in the coming days.
The law will undergo many changes.
The total amount planned for the support of the system must be divided into two parts.
The first $350 billion must be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush called for.
But Congress can block the allocation of the remainder of the sum in case it has the impression that the program is not performing its function, blocking the next $100 billion and after the final 350.
Bush appreciated the progress in the negotiations.
Although the President can veto this decision, Congress can override his veto right.
Despite these changes, the basic thought of the program has remained, i.e. getting the finances to buy passive mortgage securities, the price of which has collapsed because of hundreds of thousands of Americans who are unable to pay their mortgages.
“We have prepared everything.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the law Sunday and the Senate Monday," the Republican senator said.
President Bush is also pleased with the progress in the talks.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday’s positive developments and appreciated “the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy.”
Reduction of gold parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the main spokesman, said lawmakers agreed on the accountability of the financial program, the protection of taxpayers from losses, the closure of the budget of cuts, the fractioning of the financial plan.
The new law should also limit so-called gold parachutes for executives of companies participating in the program and is creating a committee that will control the funds.
These should be managed by the Ministry of Finance.
"We have worked very hard and have taken a big step forward towards the deal that will work and will be beneficial to the market and also to all Americans," Paulson said.
The plan counts on helping homeowners who have problems with payments.
The government should negotiate the new rates of the mortgages it will buy with the aim of lowering monthly spending on the rates for debtors and allowing them to keep their homes.
Tagged: psychological support
The proposed plan is, according to the chief economist of Patria Finance, David Marek, a good idea but its implementation will be very difficult.
And that’s because we don’t know how and at what price the problematic assets will be bought.
This will be decisive for how the losses will be divided between the financial sector and the government," Marek said this week for the site iHNed.cz .
Whether the plan will be approved now or early next week is, according to Marek, not so crucial.
“More importantly, this week congressional representatives will come to an agreement on supporting this plan and baptize it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of this agreement that will be approved is at this time more important,” Marek stressed.
Duel to the last blood: MP3 players against mobile phones
We will advise how to choose.
While almost every cell phone can read MP3 files, no MP3 player can make phone calls.
It is better to buy only the phone.
There are a lot of reasons to find an independent reader.
The choice depends entirely on the way of use and the needs of the future owner.
Maybe you would hardly buy a costly, high-quality soundtrack to listen to Maxim Turbulenc’s latest album.
First of all, these music products do not come out as LPs and from a qualitative point of view there is not even an objective reason for this.
If, however, on your shelves there are hard-rock, jazz or blues vinyles, you probably dream of such a turntable.
It also works with portable music, i.e. compressed music or simply in MP3 format.
There are also price and quality categories.
For some it may be unacceptable to spend 8 thousand crowns on a player, just as a fan of Pink Floyd may hardly digest the 20 crowns of the market headphones.
Two extremes between which there is enough space for everyone.
The choice is wide.
It depends on the battery life.
Some high-quality music players can do much more than just read music, but that’s not even the case with mobile phones.
There is no other device as universal as the mobile phone.
In addition to the primary functions, calling and sending SMS, it can read music and videos, record both and has a camera, sometimes better sometimes worse and maybe it can even navigate.
And if we consider smartphones and palms, you will also have a miniature computer in your pocket.
It’s a small miracle because no refrigerator can make the grille and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of the mobile also brings disadvantages.
The more functions you use on the cell phone and the first the indicator on the screen will require the charger.
Reading music consumes a lot of energy.
Few phones can read music for more than twelve hours, usually, and much less.
In this sense, music players (especially the simplest ones) are much more effective.
As for cheap phones do not count that can last for more than a few hours.
If you still add us, from time to time, some calls, get to work for safety another charger, this also applies to the most expensive devices.
But you won’t have this problem with an MP3 player, even the worst last at least 9 hours at continuous functionality with one charge.
Another problem occurs when downloading music to your cell phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a universal USB port and not all can be connected to the computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly on the memory card, but only a few memory readers are able to do it without an adapter for minicards that are not used in cell phones.
Players, with a few exceptions (Ipod) do not need any special software.
Simply fill the device with music via USB from the computer.
Most mobile phones and players create a media library by themselves, sorted by the names of the performers, the name of the album, gender, or user classification.
Some devices only reproduce the tree structure of the folders, similar to the Explorer tool in Windows, and some can do both (iriver, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, operating system smartphones).
Readers are easier to handle, mobile phones can do more.
When choosing a particular device, you should primarily care about battery strength, memory capacity, quality and type of audio output and obviously ease of use.
If you need the music mostly from the background and if you listen to it every day only briefly on the tram, there is enough any cell phone that reads MP3.
Nowadays, this can be done on any mobile phone.
You don’t have to worry too much about what formats your phone or player recognizes.
MP3 players support them all, the global majority of the music that comes to you will be in this format.
In addition to this format that belongs to the most popular ones, the total majority of devices support music in WMA format.
AAC is the format used by Apple and its iPods.
The best mobile phones also allow, for example, to buy music online.
Simply visit, via the mobile internet network, the corresponding pages of the operator (or another provider) and buy the song or album.
This same service could already be a valid argument for buying a mobile phone-reader.
Unfortunately, the offer of the operators is miserable and is usually limited only to the hit of the radio moment.
Prices are not very low.
But it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether through GSM, internet or wireless internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people always carry their cell phone behind.
Anyone who wants to listen to some fry in their pocket while the MP3 player is left at home.
But it also depends on this, whether you always carry behind the headphones or at least the wireless headset.
If not, you can use the built-in player that almost every cell phone, but only a small fraction of MP3 players, has.
Per the biggest advantage of mobile-readers will be, for many, the price.
The cheapest ones usually cost less than 3 thousand kroner.
For 3 and 4 thousand crowns you will already buy a very decent walkman.
Usually, however, you will be limited by the absence of an entrance for the common headphones.
The best and most technically equipped mobile phones, and even with a 3.5mm jack for common headphones, cost up to 15,000 kronor.
Instead, the advantage of readers is, among others, easy handling.
The most simple ones not necessarily the cheaper ones (see our choice) really makes anyone handle them.
The minimum of functions, the similarity of maneuverability once with the common stereo or the turntable, is obvious.
There is no danger of accidentally stopping the start of the mobile internet network and consequently a giant bill for data transmission.
What equipment to take
Even the cheapest mobile phones (for example Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for interchangeable memory cards (M2, microSD, etc.).
As for the purchase of the respective card, you will also be paid up to 2,000 kronor.
But be careful
Basic models only support cards with a maximum capacity of 2GB.
Only the most expensive ones can do so with 8 GB memory cards.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy an inexpensive MP3 player, take Cowon, Creative, Sony, Samsung, Emgeton or iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you do not have to spend more than 1,100 SEK.
If you are one of the most demanding listeners prefer to take specialized phones - walkman (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have individual keys for MP3 and the convenience of service so it approaches the same MP3 player.
In this field has made more way Sony Ericsson, which phones of the walkman line have the same scale of use as MP3 players sold separately.
The MP3 players of the above brands guarantee you the same service and the same price category up to 4 000 SEK, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, in the line of the maximum up to 35 hours).
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe
Per the mobile phone market in the Czech Republic is quite mature and our carriers offer virtually all the services as their partners in Western Europe.
However, there is something missing here – a virtual trader that forces the traditional to lower the price.
It may not be missing for a long time.
The fact that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe we have already written many times on Mobil.cz.
In the end, ČTÚ also confirmed this, noting that the price of SMS is higher here than in the rest of the Union.
Following the latest steps of the European Commission in the field of regulation of roaming charges, a paradoxical situation may arise – for some customers of Czech mobile operators SMS will cost less from abroad than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic remain so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, it lacks the competition that would really want to start the clash.
It may sound absurd, even here we have three mobile networks and coverage highly above 100%.
Instead, mobile telephone operators like to lament the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
In this sense, the head of the Czech Telecommunications Council (ČTÚ), Pavel Dvořák, has often stressed that there is no room for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is true that the traditional operator with its own network is no longer likely to have many possibilities. (Out of the way maybe it would be difficult now to find other frequencies).
But there is still another possibility -the virtual operator.
It is precisely the entry into the market of virtual traders that has led to a significant price drop, to which traditional traders would then have to react.
At the same time, even before sharks such as Tesko Mobile and Virgin Mobile entered the market, rumors resounded in Britain similar to ours.
However, it has been shown that there is a place for such operators and that they can really succeed.
For example, we should not go too far.
In February of this year we informed you of the arrival of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just half a year, this operator managed to acquire more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest local operator.
At the same time, behind Mobilking is the financial group Penta to which in the Czech Republic belongs, among others, U:fon.
The advantage of virtual traders is the ability to focus on a much more concrete group-to-group.
In order to function effectively, it requires much fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not carry back, i.e. relatively high costs for the creation, operation and maintenance of the mobile network.
So in the world virtual operators usually present themselves at a low cost, they offer low-cost calls and SMS, which is often in balance with the narrower offer of services.
So for example Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS that cost at least half as much as its competitors.
But as the example of Mobilking in Poland shows, it can also be a fairly good move to bet on a group-breaker not so long ago.
This operator focuses, so to speak, specifically on men.
"Real men choose Mobilking operator that they like and who they can trust," says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company that produces this virtual operator.
It is difficult to say if we can claim a similar concept as in Poland.
Miroslav Čepický, spokesman for Vodafone, said: “The Czech market is relatively small for a fragmented approach, on which most virtual operators rely.
In addition, from the service point of view it is relatively saturated."
In the Czech Republic no possibility, say mobile network operators
But it seems almost certain that if there will ever be an operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"There is talk about the expansion of this successful project, but in the Czech Republic the negotiations do not have much expectation.
The activation of Mobilking will take place rather in other countries in our area," said Jana Studničková, a spokeswoman for the financial group Penta, in a telephone conversation with Mobile.cz.
He therefore indirectly confirmed that the current operators in the Czech Republic are not very favourable to this idea.
Rather, they try to do everything so that you do not create any potential competitor.
For a while, he has not hidden his interest in launching a virtual operator, the GTS Novera group, which would like to take another step to become a real competitor to Telefónika O2 in the field of corporate customers.
“We are very interested in being able to offer our customers not only fixed, but also mobile telecommunications services.
And sooner it is better.
We have repeatedly negotiated this possibility with all Czech mobile network operators.
We have already made progress in negotiations with some of them,” said Group spokesman Pavel Kaidl.
Maybe better times will come.
From the unofficial information it appears that the first virtual operator will probably have it by the end of the year.
For now, however, a wall of silence is erected around his creation.
“At the moment we do not believe that there is room for the creation of a full-time virtual trader in the Czech market.
The Czech market, unlike other markets, is very specific.
So far no subject with a complex and serious project has addressed us," Vlastimil Sršeň of the press department of Telefónica O2 said in a statement to Mobil.cz.
Other operators also resort to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobil press spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in a rare agreement with the O2 statement: "So far we have not noticed any vital and beneficial commercial project for both, on which it is possible to continue building."
And he adds: “There will hardly be a virtual operator on the T-Mobil network by the end of the year.
At this point we would have had to have a concrete agreement on the table so that it could be considered at the horizon.”
Vodafone focuses on meeting its 3G license requirements.
Miroslav Čepický adds: “We are open to negotiations with potential virtual traders, especially in terms of sharing costs and infrastructure.
We consider this, from the customer’s point of view, the most productive.
Vodafone’s main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a common network for fast mobile internet.”
Competent authorities – with complicit operators
The attitude of mobile operators can be easily understood, the entry of another operator would mean increased competition, would lead to lower prices and thus to decreased profits.
Why then facilitate the rise of such a competitor?
The disturbances surrounding the creation of U:fon testify that when the operators hold onto a thing, they can remove on the same side.
Per the great pressure was on ČTÚ during the creation period of U:fon to the company of T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly accessible information from ČTÚ’s websites.
But now just U:fon serves as an argument for which not to accept the virtual operator.
Martina Kemrová said: “The competitive environment in the mobile market has been slightly enhanced with the entrance of the fourth mobile operator into the market.
Regarding the type of mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is obvious that the entry of another competitor would put high demands on him and especially on his services.”
The attitude of mobile operators is surprising, however, the complete disinterest by the Czech regulators.
It is not only the attitude of the ČTÚ that, unfortunately, in the Czech Republic – unlike Britain and other developed countries – has no competence to interfere in economic competition.
It belongs exclusively to the Office for the Protection of Competition (ÚOHS).
This, however, has taken its typical position on the whole issue.
“The virtual operator’s entry into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of the lease agreement for the necessary infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator.
No such contract has been concluded so far because the offer of potential buyers probably has not been interesting enough for traditional traders,” said Kristián Chalupa, of the ÚOHS External Relations Department, in response to our question.
This statement by the representatives of the operators may not be surprising.
Instead, by the office, which must defend the interests of consumers and, moreover, take care that no one takes advantage of its position on the market, it is more than a delicate affair.
Especially when Kristián Chalupa adds: “In the overseas where virtual operators commonly operate, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to lower prices for mobile services.”
But obviously the pressure on the proper functioning of the market environment and the lowering of prices are not in the interests of ÚOHS.
Really shocking in the whole situation is the almost exciting harmony of these three operators resulting from their reactions.
The question of whether this is really just a coincidence arises by itself.
Just as the same price of gasoline for all gas stations is the result of coincidence and competitive struggle.
“The section has found no signs of anti-competitive behavior regarding this fact and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
No trader has a dominant position, so it has no corresponding greater responsibility for its behavior on the market.
The necessary tools for opening the mobile network market to virtual operators may also be lacking in the telecommunications regulator," Chalupa mentioned in his statement.
The interpretation of the dominant position in the market is one of the many controversial points.
Of course, there is the relevant market analysis by ČTÚ, according to which telecommunications is the only market in terms of economic competition.
On such a market, of course, no Czech trader has a dominant position.
But some legal experts offer a different approach - for the creation of a virtual operator is always necessary the agreement of the operator of the network.
And the mobile operator has – logically in the end – the monopoly of its network.
So for a certain portion must be dominant by force.
But even if we didn’t admit this argument, for ÚOHS it should be a minimum alarming that three mobile operators proceed so strangely similarly.
At the same time, complaints from stakeholders (including the aforementioned company GTS Novera) show that during negotiations with all traders they encounter very similar obstacles.
Downloading the responsibility to ČTÚ in telecommunications is a fairly frequent trick with which ÚOHS keeps itself out of all the matter.
We have seen this in some similar cases.
Unfortunately, it was not possible to promote the expansion of ČTÚ’s rights in the field of economic competition in telecommunications until the recently passed telecommunications law was updated, despite the fact that, from this, many experts expected the situation to improve.
This fact the representatives of ÚOHS must know more than well, but their interests are elsewhere.
You can do it when no one looks.
While we are unaware of the functioning of such pseudo-virtual operators, some of which even exist in Czech mobile networks.
These are companies that publish their mobile phone price lists, which are only partially public.
These are usually companies that deal with multilevel marketing.
So for example Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and a number of others offer their own mobile services.
The price lists of these companies usually reach only the pre-established people.
The magic lies in the fact that the company versus the operator appears as a classic corporate customer, who orders a lot of SIM cards.
As a major customer then receives special price offers (and more).
The problem is that the business conditions of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such a pre-sale.
“If the cases you discuss, which we will be interested in, arise, it could be a breach of contractual conditions, and could lead to the termination of cooperation with this company,” said Martina Kemrová.
But it is quite unlikely that such an activity would not reach the ears of those responsible for mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the 3 mentioned companies it can be thousands of customers.
No operator defends itself at the same time against such an attitude.
From the activity of these companies they draw a profit not indifferent and at the same time - unlike real virtual traders - they are not damaged in any way with their official marketing.
Miroslav Čepický warns of possible problems: “The law allows for such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
They also have to accept that the SIM card in their phone is not registered in their name, so they can’t dispose of it in full as regular customers of mobile operators.”
But this should be a little strange to the ČTÚ.
In addition, another issue opens up for ÚOHS.
If mobile operators close their eyes to such an attitude, why do they block the creation of the virtual operator?
It is necessary to add that ÚOHS has strong enough rights to unmask such activities and if it did not want it, it will not have to be contented with the explanation of operators who have no idea of all this and that their business conditions prohibit it.
When it is no longer expensive
As has already been said several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile phone market has led to a significant drop in prices for services.
At the same time, in virtually all countries where operators were born, traditional operators were more or less trying to prevent their creation.
The themes they used were virtually identical – too small market, too saturated boundary, problems with the quality of services, etc.
But in developed countries, regulators have intervened in these cases to defend not mobile operators but their customers.
Both with formal measures and with non-formal pressure, then we came to the creation of the first virtual operator and others came to him.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory bodies throw everything from one to the other like a boiling potato.
By our experience, we cannot get rid of the feeling that the lack of clarity of skills in these cases makes him more than comfortable.
But let’s not throw the sponge.
If the backstory information is correct and the virtual operator will really appear to us soon, the Czech mobile market will get back in motion.
If one of the operators had consented to the creation of a virtual mobile operator only hardly ÚOHS could remain impassible to the rejection (discrimination) of the other interested parties.
And we may stop calling at higher prices than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the best
Listen to four new versions of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek on the occasion of the Day of recognition of the Czech state presented in a solemn manner the new recordings of the national anthem "Kde domov můj".
The new recording of the anthem was made by the National Theatre Orchestra under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions available – solo with male or female voice, choral step and instrumental edition.
The song is directed by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the revisions of the anthem are Otakar Jeremiáš and Jaroslav Krček.
On the website iHNed.cz you can listen to all four versions.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national song one of the most beautiful hymns.
He previously told the radio "Český rozhlas" that he has chosen specifically to sing the variants alone, singers with the most representative young voices, which are expressive and popular.
"From the beginning I have tried to make sure that both and the choir, have a clear dictionary, that the text is well understood, that they are in harmony," he said.
Then the national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov můj" was played for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the Stavovskéh theatre in the original opera Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetán Tyl accompanied by the music of František Škroupa.
It acquired popularity and people spontaneously made it theirs.
The first strofe of the song after the founding of Czechoslovakia in 1918 then became the natural part of the national anthem.
It remained one of the seven national symbols even after the birth of the autonomous Czech Republic.
How the “new” hymn sounds
The MHD Wednesday in Prague will accompany you for the first time also with an electronic card
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will enter the history of the Prague Transportation Company as the date when the first passengers who will have an electronic card in their pockets instead of a paper ticket will board the metro, tram and bus.
Currently, around 100,000 people have their own OpenCard card.
Passengers can purchase the 30-day and 90-day and annual (which will be valid from 1 January 2009) and at the same time get their card recharged at the Infopoint and the Transportation Company offices and at the metro stations Muzeum, Můstek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka.
They can be purchased from yesterday on the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
More than 400 customers took advantage of the service in the afternoon.
Those who will start using the service via the internet can completely forget the gates in the metro stops where they had to make long files for paper tickets so far.
The cutting-edge is purchased via the internet and on the Opencard it is loaded on one of the twelve branches of the Municipal Library.
“In these places, passengers have a door with trained staff who will help the interested parties with online purchases and will also record on their card the credit they have acquired,” said Martin Opatrný, a project spokesman.
In addition to the libraries it will be possible to load the electronic cuts to the Opencard in ATMs and self-service that are installed at the entrances of the subway.
How are these ATMs?
They are red, they resemble ticket obliterators and passengers have already noticed them at the metro stops of Roztyly, Budějovická, I.P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská.
"There are now five in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty," Opatrný concluded.
The cutter will be checked instead of by the driver from the ATM.
The ATM service that will work from tomorrow is very simple.
Just insert the Opencard card and prior payment of the cutter, it will load on top.
The electronic cards are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in its surroundings.
That is, in the urban lines of trains and buses from number 300 to 499, which the inhabitants of the municipalities of central Bohemia take to reach the capital.
"In the trains added to Prague's integrated transport there are controllers equipped with card readers with which they check the time and zone validity," explained the ticket control method Filip from the organization Ropid, which sets up the timetables of Prague's public transport.
Urban buses have card readers integrated into the driver’s safe.
During the climb it is therefore necessary not only to show the magnetic card to the driver, but in addition you need to support the Opencard at the specified point next to the box.
So the driver checks the validity of the loaded cuts.
"If the passenger needs to check the validity of the loaded cutters, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this type of information," Drápal added.
Passengers who take urban buses and will not remember, when the cutler expires, can go back to the self-service ATMs, where the cutlery is loaded on paper.
Here you will see information about the validity of their documents on the device screen.
Sudet Germans want U.S. referendum
The Sudet Germans in 1945 demanded that Šumava be included in the United States.
This is shown in the letter deposited at the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
If we cannot be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live at least under the patronage of the United States.
With this desire, it is said, some groups of Sudet Germans addressed the President of the United States in 1945.
This is evidenced mostly by the letter kept in a private archive and now deposited in the Scientific Library of South Bohemia.
The Germans of Český Krumlov ask in the letter to the US president not to allow the return of the “Šumava district” – occupied by Hitler under the Munich agreement – to Czechoslovakia again.
"We have understood the situation and we want to be sure of the promises that American units will arrive on German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators," the letter reads with the words "People who hold the fate of Šumava with all their hearts."
Because, they say, the annexation to Czechoslovakia – knowing the Czech national character – gives the Sudet Germans hope only of brutality, disrespect, misunderstanding, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter pray the American president to take the protectorate on Šumava now and always.
"We cannot believe that without regard for the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, you would recognize this territory as a state alien to us, which oppresses and eradicates ethnic minorities and has contributed in no way to the victory of the Allies," the letter reads.
The reason why the authors cannot sign it is the alleged fear of the thirst for revenge by the “Czech oppressors.”
If the president of the United States had to doubt the conviction of the Germans in Šumava, it would be enough to organize in the district a referendum on the will of its inhabitants to become part of the United States or live under the domination of the United States.
Although the text of the letter may seem naive with our knowledge of post-war history, according to some witnesses it appropriately describes the expectations of the then Sudet Germans.
Although the Czech Germans should at least have guessed that this would be their move from the republic, only a few of them admitted such a possibility at all.
Some expected the United States and Britain to negotiate some sort of autonomy for the Sudeten peoples.
Others thought they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, born in České Budějovice.
He was mobilized during the war as a German of Budějovice in the Baltic Sea maritime power.
When at the end of the war he was captured by the British and placed in the prison camp at Holštýn, dozens of other Czech Germans went to him for him to teach him Czech.
"These believed that once they got home the Czech would make them comfortable," Chalupa said.
None of the German prisoners who lived in Czechoslovakia during the war, according to him, counted on the fact that on the basis of the decrees of Beneš they would be moved from the Republic.
Don’t think – you will pay!
The emotional campaign will attack drivers
The most expensive action in Czech history aimed at road safety.
It is also possible to describe the emotional media campaign, which the Ministry of Transport plans to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček, expects this to discourage drivers from dangerous behavior at the wheel.
The 150 million campaign will appear on television, radio, movies, the internet, but also on booklets.
It should discourage drivers from driving fast and under the influence of alcohol at the wheel.
And also remind him to put on the belt before leaving.
It wants to touch in the conscience especially young drivers, motorcyclists, pedestrians and not least professional drivers.
What will appear in the spots?
Especially the stories of people who will affect emotions.
And this is also evidenced by the “bloody” slogan of the entire campaign:
Don’t think – you will pay!
The word “don’t think” is written on the board.
And in a well of blood there is the word "you will pay."
This must symbolize that a person can, in a moment of distraction, pay with his life.
The spots will scare viewers until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where you can commonly see images with drastic scenes of victims of accidents.
It promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spot was prepared by the Euro RSCG agency.
Carrots and sticks for drivers
“With drivers the carrot and rod system works.
The carrot for them is, for example, when they pass with red and thus save time.
The stick is the danger of fine or accident.
It is necessary to remind drivers of the risk,” says Martin Kořán, a psychologist at the Ministry of Transport at the Na Homolce Hospital.
And therefore we need information campaigns in the press and, above all, negative advertising, the psychologist believes.
According to him, the panels that warn drivers of danger are already less effective.
"If the fixed panel that warns of danger has been installed, it will probably soon be confused with the environment and drivers will no longer pay attention to it," Kořán warns.
Olmert would return almost all of the occupied territories in exchange for peace
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has called for the return of virtually all of the territories occupied in 1967, including the borders of Jordan, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace between Palestinians and Syrians.
This was stated by the newspaper Jediot Achronot on Monday.
"We need to reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that it will be necessary to return almost all (occupied) areas, if not all," Olmert told the daily.
"We will retain a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to leave the Palestinians the same percentage (of Israeli areas) because without it there will be no peace," he said.
He admitted that the possible return would also include East Jerusalem.
“Anyone who wants security in Jerusalem and, above all, doesn’t want to get ridges or scratches on him, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up a portion of Jerusalem,” Olmert said in a speech to reporters, referring to the two July attacks in the city, during which some people were killed and dozens wounded.
According to the prime minister, it will be necessary to find "a particular solution for the Temple Mountain, the sacred and historic sites," which are inside the Old Town. .
“Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to add 270,000 Arabs.
This will not work,” he added.
Retreat from the Golan Heights
Olmert also called for Israel’s withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he believes is a prerequisite for concluding this peaceful agreement with Syria.
But this would also require some effort from Damascus.
“I’m not proposing the conclusion of peace with Syria solely on the basis of the withdrawal from the Golan,” he said.
“The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the Golan Heights.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah (the Shiite movement); they will have to give up their permanent support, which they offer to the terrorism of Hamas, al-Qaeda (the terrorist network) and Jihad (the holy war) in Iraq," he said.
Questions after the accident: Are stewards in buses illegal?
The law does not recognize them, you can not walk on the bus that makes long distances
In the context of the tragic accident near the Italian city of Padova of the bus company Student Agency came out the question of whether the stewards and passengers can move on board the bus during the race.
"If we want to comply with the laws strictly and formally, the steward's activity is in conflict with the road traffic law," says Transport Ministry spokesman Karel Hanzelka.
The accident last week in which a 22-year-old hostess died was caused by a truck that cut off the road to the bus.
Unfortunately, the girl was sitting next to the driver in the less secure seat in the bus, despite the fact that there were still two other seats allocated.
But the bus can make an accident or brake abruptly even during the distribution of coffee or newspapers.
It depends on whether the bus is equipped with standing seats according to the traffic book.
If it is not approved, passengers must sit.
Student Agency buses have no standing seats, the company’s director Radim Jančura confirmed to Aktuálnĕ.cz.
“We assessed this with the Ministry and at the beginning it did not allow the movement of passengers on the bus.
After it was revoked and we concluded that passengers can use the bathroom during the run if they have the assigned seat," he expressed his point of view.
The law does not recognize the steward.
“There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of the steward – no law deals with regulating this role.”
However, no regulation prohibits the carrier from performing the services.
The road traffic law recognizes only the accompanying term of the vehicle, its rights and duties are not defined," adds less clearly the spokesman Hanzelka.
The director of the Department of Road Traffic of the Ministry of Transportation Josef Pokorný, on the other hand, believes that the law is sufficiently concerned with this problem.
It depends on whether the bus has approved standing seats.
All there,” he says.
It categorizes buses in urban areas where there are seats standing and the maximum speed limited, interurban with seats standing with the highest maximum speed and long distance without seats standing with the maximum speed allowed and seats equipped with seat belts.
As in a plane, says the expert.
The BESIP road safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not find the underlying problem in the movement of stewards on board the bus.
“During a quiet race there are not so many dangers, the situation can be compared to service on airplanes.
Not even there is it safe when a turmoil comes and the flight assistant can beat his head.”
“If the bus brakes abruptly, the laws of physics of course apply.
Just like in the city bus or in the tram.
The transport company must resolve the safety of the stewards with an internal regulation," he says and also means that, from the point of view of the law, the problem is not resolved.
Jančura is prepared to suspend services.
Student Agency is the only transport company that offers the services of stewards.
It takes about two hundred.
Even after the accident, the director does not consider their job dangerous.
“As soon as I feel that I have to consider the steward’s profession a dangerous job, I will abolish it.
Passengers can receive coffee and newspapers as they board.
It would also reduce costs,” he says.
The director of Asiana Alexej Litvin, who manages a fraction of the lines compared to the Student Agency, motivated the absence of the stewards on his means as an interest toward security.
"We have no hostess, we have been opposed from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end up in a fatal accident," said less than a year ago Týden.cz.
A huge tragedy happened.
In the accident of the line to Naples died a young hostess from the Plzeň region, who had worked for the company for two years.
A Slovenian truck probably got out of the emergency lane without using the arrow and blocked the road to the bus.
The driver of the bus tried to avoid him with a sudden manoeuvre, but struck him with the right front.
Jančura denies the fact that the two seats reserved for the rest of the stewards were occupied.
“You can’t reserve these seats in long-distance buses, they’re inconsiderable.”
The company intends to denounce the truck driver.
The agency will not wait for the court’s ruling to pay damages to the girl’s family, but it expects financial compensation from the perpetrator.
Revision of the law?
Not in sight
The revision of the law, on which a group of 30 experts from the Ministry of Transport has been working for more than a year, could lead to clarification of the movement of stewards on buses.
“We have not achieved any concrete results.
The buses do not consider them so much, they are more concerned with the scoring system, maximum speed on the highway and the use of cell phones while driving," says expert Hořín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the activity of the stewards as a major threat to the safety of passengers," with this the spokesman Havelka concludes, that the control of the safety of buses is the responsibility of the police and security offices.
Dusseldorf's hopes are on Frankfurt
There are no shortcomings in the letter of the director of the WestLB addressed to the employees of the house.
In the letter published on Monday that could form "the capital market center of the financial group of savings funds" through the meeting of units of the banking institution of Düsseldorf with the Deka-Bank of Frankfurt.
West LB would launch a “competent block” with lasting profits in such a venture.
Moreover, such a whole union could be a decisive impetus for further ties in the banking sector of the Länder.
This is read, when a board of directors in difficult times wants to demonstrate the ability to act.
Because the troubled WestLB is still under heavy pressure.
Not only from the EU Commission, but also through the National Financial Supervisory Authority, having long since pointed out to the regional government of North Rhine-Westphalia that time is struggling to look for a future solution.
For example, if you are not aware of the fact that you are using the software, then you will be able to use the software.
He at the end of August the head of Deka-Bank Franz Waas at the presentation of the first half of the year's turnover that a merger of the house on Via Magonza with a national bank such as Helaba or West LB makes no sense.
But the board of directors of the Deka, which is half led by regional banks and savings funds consortia, delegated the board to conduct talks with the West LB on joint negotiations.
These may be market negotiations or parts thereof.
The negotiations have, as they say in the business square, just begun.
Deka-Bank, with its 3,000 employees, is one of the most important companies in Frankfurt, not the first time when it comes to consolidating the savings sector.
In 2003 for a short period it seemed that Deka-Bank could merge with the Regional Bank of the Rhine-Palatinate and Helaba.
Three of them did not do anything.
As soon as the projects were published, the regional bank of Assia was opposed to Helaba's participation.
The other two sides were also unable to reach an agreement.
The regional bank of the Rhine-Palatinate instead went to the regional bank of Baden-Württemberg in Stuttgart.
Nevertheless, they have always thought about a merger of Deka-Bank with regional banks.
But eventually Günther Merl, chairman of the board of directors of Helaba, spoke out against design games to reunite with his home.
In addition to this, it seems that it creates awareness that the different houses of the public sector need to be brought closer together.
Since the Bavarian parliamentary elections have passed, a meeting of the Bavarian Landesbank with the Baden-Württemberg may first take place.
This is not good news for Helaba.
If it increases the pressure for other mergers, partners will be missing.
In the South now there would be the junior partner, although so far it has overcome the financial crisis much better than houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The association of savings funds Assia-Turingia, which participates with 85 percent of Helaba, set the chain for the meeting with the WestLB.
Only the NordLB remains.
These geo-strategic considerations are just a account.
On the other hand, there is also the question of how the different business models of the individual homes are matched.
In June, Merl noted that the decisive question, which business model would ensure the future of regional banks, was not yet answered by the German Savings Association.
In the end, the division of the West LB could also come out, which by that of course is not desired.
Thus, the letter of the board of directors expresses the will to aspire in any case to a “generic solution”.
We will see how the reunification of individual parts with Deka-Bank will work.
The second weekend of the beer festival is dedicated to the Italians
It is the first time for Elena and the third or fourth time for Luca.
This time Elena is present at the party as a companion, and so she says that everything is different.
Behind them next to the Kaiser brand’s 5l barrel stands a massive beard and shows the approximately 200 travellers the deep tones it can produce from the throat.
Elena first gives Luca a pack and then a kiss.
They came from Bologna to Verona.
From here to the parking lot next to the Porta Nuova station, four couriers depart tonight at 23.45 with destination Munich, Festa della Birra", arrival scheduled at 6.30.
Three couriers are mainly reserved for Italians, in another only Brazilians travel.
In one corner of the parking lot, South Americans are singing with the flag in their hands, having already celebrated during the night.
It’s so noisy, says Marco, that it’s not something for Italians.
Mark who wears a long coat with fake fur coat and a pair of glasses with wide silver straps belong to his buses.
For 5 years they have been going to the Oktoberfest, this year there are 3 tours.
Going out at night, on the day to the party, return at 22.30.
It would only create unnecessary expenses, says Marco.
The cost of 45 Euro includes the trip, the welcome toast with the Kaiser beer, made according to the Bavarian standards of authenticity, the health box and the German guide – Marco attended a German course in Frankfurt.
And so at night the buses depart at the turn of the Brenner.
There is no beer yet.
There is silence in the bus and passengers are asleep.
Better so, they will still need their forces.
They stop at Bressanone and Holzkirchen, where other buses with Italian signage on the A9 motorway before Munich take a short break.
When, as planned, Marco’s group arrives at 6:30 p.m. at the parking lot near the Theresienwiese, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others gather together, Marco explains the attack program for the last time.
Wear the yellow hat.
On it on the left is written "Oktoberfest" next to the internet address of Marco's travel agency: "Conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: “When they open the doors of the beer tendon, it means running!” says Marco early in the morning.
"Run!" Run and occupy the seats at the bottom of the tent.
"Not in front, otherwise we block, and not all the yellow jackets sitting on the same benches, divide in the resting space!"
The bottle costs 8.25 euros, Marco cries.
And don’t forget to give the hand.
“Tell the security service that we behave well!
As soon as you leave the places, they disappear!”
Third: “Tonight at 22.30 p.m. we meet again here!
They are already out for the party.
On the street one attacks the yellow jackets on trees, road signs and even a banner of a large Bavarian popular party.
You want to be ready to beat the retreat.
It is the second weekend of the festival, known as the “weekend of the Italians”.
There are no exact data, we talk about 50 thousand, who leave to cross the Alps and invade the tendons, it is claimed that 10% of the visitors come specifically from Italy.
The Munich police are reinforced with 7 agents from the Upper Adige, Italian volunteers support the Bavarian Red Cross, which makes a statistics on nationalities, where Italians are in the top with 200 medical care ahead of the British (about 60 medical care) and the Austrians (about 80).
Particularly loved by the Italians is the Hofbräuhaus tendon.
Sleepless nights for Hypo Real Estate creditors
The German banking system is relatively stable, Finance Minister Peer Steinbrück confirmed last week.
It is good that the politician used the word "relative" and also mentioned that the German banking sector is not spared from critical developments.
The crisis began this weekend.
The DAX-listed real estate financier Hypo Real Estate receives a billion-dollar loan from a consortium of German banks to protect itself from market turmoil.
An expert on the situation told Reuters on Monday that the support claims would reach up to €35 billion.
Hypo Real Estate only has to pay interest on the requested part.
Money comes from both public and private banks.
In the end there are the losses of the Depfa affiliate.
The state financier, according to a newspaper article, has refinanced itself in the very short term – which is no longer possible because of the mistrust in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank’s reserves had decreased by 95% to €2.37 million, and the share of equity fell from €1.6 to €1.45.
Current income and net income from financial transactions fell to zero compared to last year, and profits from increases in applications and certain shares as well as the settlement of debt settlements fell by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros.
Only thanks to higher revenues from the reimbursement of subordinate compensation costs that come from both the restructuring of the former Depfa group and the reimbursement of interest under the single text of tax laws and business management for business consortia, the negative profit was quite moderate with about 16%.
The former public funder after being privatized in 1990 had lost himself in speculation with commercial real estate loans, which were incorporated into the Aareal Bank.
Since the income in classical government funding was too low, Depfa engaged more in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects of private and state investors (PPP) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to amortize the affiliate’s value, which will have a fundamental material effect on the group’s profit and loss account.
Dividends have been cancelled.
In 2007, they were reduced by two-thirds.
Hypo Real Estate after the absorption of Depfa is a major funder of the state and infrastructure.
It is more dependent on market refinancing between banks compared to other institutions, because it does not have customer trust deposits.
Due to the collapse of the US investment bank Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the lending between banks has largely drowned, because banks are accumulating liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate annually needs short-term refinancing for a portion of Depfa’s credit portfolio – approximately $50 billion.
According to the notice of Hypo Real Estate, the group’s financial needs have been covered by credit for a certain period of time and the company protected from the influx of mostly non-functioning international monetary markets.
From other sources it is heard, that thanks to the money the refinancing is ensured until the end of 2009.
HRE Chairman of the Board of Directors Georg Funke, on the other hand, said that the HRE Group will not need the currency markets in the near future.
The Bundesbank and the National Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) rely on the fact that the marketability of the HRE group is still assured.
This is expected for the shareholders and creditors of the bank.
In view of the dynamics and insignificance of the crisis, there will be no guarantee.
The funding may not be fully used.
However, the opposite is not to be excluded.
After that Sunday evening the bank as it was learned it was about to fail, the momentary rescue failed to calm the souls.
The stock price dropped by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
They run the mortgage courses quite well.
While previous-grade debts are almost irrevocable, they give up the postponed credit courses.
In addition, it is important to note that the use of the product is not limited to the use of the product or the use of the product.
Previously HRE mortgages seemed to be an alternative speculative investment, now their value must, after the strengthening of the crisis of the banks and the institution itself, which with the relief of the Depfa has struck the crisis, must be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system.
Until central banks, governments and the least damaged banks are still ready, one can count on an amortization of annuities within the deadline.
Or it comes into operation, what no one dares to hope – that the financial crisis will be overcome within the next 15 months.
But when it comes to information overturned due to partial statalizations, the almost certain probability has become a justified hope.
It will especially create long-term investors a few sleepless nights with the decision whether to split off their commitments.
Short-term investors may conclude the reporting of losses for future payments of the compensatory surplus tax.
Sylvana and the Secrets of the Bento-Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is scheduled to attend Tachibana High School on her first day of school, the girls start to laugh: German is entirely “kawaii”!
What does it mean?
Sylvana knows the word already from Mangas-in the new Exchange Log tells of Japan.
First day of school in Japan
How excited I was.
I also had fifa to go to school.
I live on the outskirts of Tokyo to Kawasaki and I need 40 minutes by train to get to Tachibana High School.
I had to find it myself and fortunately I didn’t get lost.
The beginning of the first class hour does not seem to have been set as well as by us in Lower Saxony.
The students arrive slowly at 8 p.m., until at 8.40 a brief conversation with the professor begins, the so-called "home room".
But before I started the class, it was up to me to present myself.
I am not the guy who likes to speak in front of people, in addition to a class of 40 students.
Since I didn’t have the school uniform yet, I put on an old host mother’s shirt, along with a shirt, blue socks and black leather shoes.
I put myself in front of the chair and tried to say, “Sayonara, where she is Sylvana...” – my name is Sylvana, I’m from Germany and I’m celebrating my birthday in a week.
At that time I was very happy that I already started learning the language two years ago.
The 31 girls in the class cuddled, cuddled, and made a sign and I continued to hear the word "Kawaii".
I knew it from my mangas.
It belongs to the essential vocabulary of Japanese girls to survive and means "sweet, sweet."
Then I ran quickly to my place.
The girl next to me cried, for her it was an honor to sit next to an exchange student
The rest of the class hour was continued quietly, but when it played the gong, I was attacked in the true sense of the word.
Everyone spoke disorderly and laughed and dried me with questions – then it’s really hard to understand the English of the Japanese.
During the break, everyone opened their bench.
My host mother also made me the basket for lunch – it’s different from the boring German sandwiches.
I had risotto with spices, sausages, cucumbers and algae salad, fruits and a kind of packaging with meat and tofu.
To be honest, I don’t even know exactly what I eat in Japan.
Things look strange and have a completely new taste.
The fact is, that everything is really good.
Maybe except for the snails put under salt, brrr!
Bento is not just lunch in Japanese schools.
It sometimes happens that a girl gifts a self-made Benedict, prepared quite artistically, with the hope then to make acquaintance with the boy during recreation.
I read it in my manga.
I am curious if I can find out.
“Why Japan?” asked my friends when I told them I wanted to go to school in Japan for a year.
I always said:
“Because it fascinates me.”
I have been reading mangas for years.
And to better understand the comics and the culture they contain, sooner or later I began to learn some Japanese language.
I was completely convinced that I would come there once.
I am fascinated by traditions, customs and customs.
They hold us a lot.
On the one hand, Japan is a place of technology and the latest trends - on the other hand: strict, disciplined and traditional.
Since everything is well organized, I never felt lost, even though Tokyo is the biggest city I’ve ever seen in my life.”
Even rats have feelings.
A rat or a cockroach escape when they feel the danger.
The neuroscientist Joseph Le Doux is convinced that many animals also have feelings.
But how could it happen if, when they behave in our same way, they have our same feelings?
On the Internet newspaper "Edge" for several years articles of well-known scientists are published.
SPIEGEL ONLINE in a series presents selected answers to the question: "What do you think is true, without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings or other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else having been able to prove it so far, since we cannot even prove that other men have consciousness.
But in this case we must at least hope that all human brains have the same basic configuration.
As soon as we turn to other species and ask questions about feelings or consciousness in general, we enter an impractical territory, because the reference base does not match.
When a rat is in a dangerous situation, it does the same things that other animals do.
People behave in a similar way, from which some scientists understand that there is a comparable subjective feeling.
I do not believe this.
Two aspects of the brain structure make it difficult for us to convey our feelings to animals.
On the one hand, the lateral prefrontal cortex is often connected to human consciousness, associated circuits (this is due to its direct participation in short memory and executive and control functions).
In man this wide area is much more developed than in other primates, and it seems that among other creatures it is completely missing.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, including knowledge, who we are, and the ability to plan and decide, we thus admit the foundation on the assumption that man differs even from other primates.
Another dramatic peculiarity should appear in the man’s way of speaking: since much of life is connected to language, it is often said that it is connected to consciousness.
In this case, animals may be excluded.
Although consciousness does not depend on language, it would influence it in such a way that the consciousness of the animal, as it is made, differs greatly from the circumstances of our consciousness.
This is why it is difficult to find out how consciousness can be seen in other animals.
If it is not possible to measure it as an internal and subjective thing, in analyzing it through our own experience due to the special hardware, their research will put us in big trouble.
Most interpretations refer to the content of conscious experience, but apart from this there is another aspect of consciousness to which science would have easier access.
You could analyze the processes of animal consciousness regardless of their content, and this is exactly what happens in the studies on the short memory of primates, especially in the example of visualization.
So for this principle, which Christof Koch and Francis Crick follow, we go to the neural correlates of consciousness rather than the causal mechanisms: both may be identical but not necessarily.
Interestingly, this principle also highlights the value of the prefrontal cortex for the implementation of visualization.
What is therefore outlined for feelings?
I blame them for the fact that an emotional system like that of fear is activated in one of their conscious brain activities.
What we refer to as “fear” is therefore the mental state in which we find ourselves when the activity of the defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as body reactions) occupies the working memory.
Thus, the feelings are closely connected to the regions of the cortex, which characterize the primates and in particular the human being.
With the speaking nature, subtle nuances of feeling are created, because with the help of words and grammar we can distinguish and categorize situations, to describe them to others.
Compared to this, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that the feelings result from more primitive activities of the body regions of the sensations of the cortex and paleo-head, similar to Jack Pankseep, who, however, focused more on the paleo-cephalus.
Since this network has not changed much in the course of human evolution, this could definitely be part of the feelings extended to the species.
On a purely theoretical level, I cannot contradict this, but I find it undemonstrable.
Pankseep argues that what appears to rats and humans as fear is probably so perceived by the senses in both cases: but how could it happen if rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave in a similar way?
A cockroach in case of danger flees as if he felt the fear too?
In my eyes, the mere resemblance of behavior cannot yet prove any vital resemblance.
And that is, the neural comparison continues to be helpful: rats and humans have similar paleoencephals, and cockroaches do not even have a brain.
But is the paleoencephalus responsible for emotions?
And if you could prove it for humans, how would you want to prove it for rats?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even insects (who knows?), have feelings.
I did not know how to prove it.
And since their feelings are fundamentally different from ours (since human consciousness is based on specific circuits and language), I prefer to study emotional behavior rather than rats’ emotional sensations.
In any case, there is some progress here at the neural level, as long as you give up the same procedure on rats and men.
Just as I don’t do research on language and consciousness in rats, so I don’t do it on their emotions, I don’t even know if they exist.
This may be considered short-sighted, but I prefer to take steps forward, rather than constantly hitting a wall.
I am a practical emotional.
UEFA Chairman Platini to Delay to Poland and Ukraine
Deputy Prime Minister Iwan Wasjunik said the preparations will soon be put under the direct responsibility of the President and the Prime Minister.
“The government sees UEFA’s decision in Bordeaux as a demonstration of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organize Europe with Poland,” Wasjunik said.
“This is not an amnesty for our country.
Work has just begun and there is still a lot to be done in both countries.”
Both host countries stumble on the roadmap for the construction or reconstruction of stadiums, roads, hotels and airports.
Eventually, the number of stadiums for Europeans will be reduced from eight to six.
“We can’t waste more time.
Now we have to work at the maximum speed,” said the president of the Ukrainian association Grigorij Surkis.
“UEFA will keep an eye on us.
An even more radical step has been taken in Poland.
After numerous scandals, the management of the Polish association PZPN was suspended by the National Olympic Committee and replaced by the independent administrator Robert Zawlocki.
The committee met at the request of Sport Minister Miroslaw Drzewiecki.
There would be “the serious danger that the PZPN would not be able to operate according to the rules,” Drzewiecki told the Polish news agency PAP.
“In a letter, we assured UEFA President Michel Platini that the preparation for the Euro 2012 will not suffer.”
Many first division players only in the last season were convicted of manipulation, in the end it even had to postpone the start of the League to the last moment.
Dennis Quaid is outraged
He wanted to promote a new film, in an interview he talked about the private and now has grain with his ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan has declared adulterous his ex Dennis Quaid.
He foams of anger and cries.
The War of the Roses is a delayed outbreak for the former couple Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: Seven years after their separation, the two Hollywood actors are now fighting with each other a bad fight - in public.
Meg Ryan in an interview with the American magazine InStyle last week for the first time spoke about the reasons for the failure of the marriage: "Dennis has long been unfaithful to me, and this has been very painful."
The extent of the betrayal she would have come to know only after the separation.
The occasion for the "soul wardrobe" was working with the press of Ryan for her new film "The Women" – it tells the story of an adultery.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to her publicly declared adulterous husband was clear: it would be "unheard," the 54-year-old told "New York Daily News", which "Meg once again repeats and rearranges the story of our relationship."
It would also be " deplorable" that Jack, the sixteen-year-old son they had together, again "are publicly reminded of the pain and subversion, which a separation means for every child."
While Ryan from separation lives alone, Quaid is married again and will soon become a father of twins.
And so his judgments end with the arrows: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself lucky to have a wonderful family where everything goes for the best.”
The price of air tickets and hotels
In the first half of 2008, flights and overnight stays in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, according to a recent study, flights would be up to 50% cheaper.
Flights and hotel overnight stays have again become more affordable - this is the result of a study by the financial and travel provider American Express.
The company analyzed its booking data for the first half of 2008 and after a price rise in the first quarter saw a marked drop in the second quarter.
After prices on the hotel market have risen for years, overnight stays in many places have already dropped in price.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities still surveyed increased by an average of around 6.9 compared to 2007.
However, from April to June, prices were already 3.6% lower than in the previous year.
The most obvious trend would have been in Paris and Rome, where travellers had to pay 30 to 37% less than a year earlier.
American Express sees this as a reason for the weak dollar quotation, which would lead to a "diminished desire to travel American tourists"
Even financial centers such as Frankfurt and London would be affected by the recession of hotel prices more strongly than industrial centers such as Hannover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In the Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent, even holding the record in Europe
Also in terms of flight prices the trend in the first quarter still marks upward:
Economy Class passengers paid an average of 7.1% for fuel-intensive long-haul flights compared to 2007, up to 29.2% more expensive.
From April to June, the price of Economy Class flights dropped by an average of 12.5% compared to the previous quarter, but the price changes in First Class and Business were much weaker.
In Germany prices have fallen even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, prices increased by 11.9%, and in the second quarter they fell by 23.6%.
As for domestic flights, prices have dropped by half.
The reason for the fall in prices would be, on the one hand, the declining economic growth, the company explains.
Demand in many segments of the air travel market has declined.
On the other hand, there would be increased competition pressure due to the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalizes air traffic between the United States and Europe.
A sign of the critical situation would be the suppression of non-profit routes at Airlines, as well as the high number of airlines that in the first half of 2008 would have declared bankruptcy – in Europe alone it was 24 airlines.
The HSV defeated Gladbach 1–0
With a goal and simple methods, the Hamburg SV becomes a captain.
At Borussia Luhukay still can’t find a 11 group that works.
Here Kristoffer Klein worsened the landing of fortune for national player Marko Marin.
The player of the Gladbach first came into play late and failed with a shot on the cross.
His message was formulated accurately, passing on his lips convincingly.
He knew he was absolutely right.
"We need the second goal," Hermann Rieger exclaimed in the cabin corridor of the Hamburg Arena.
Not much had happened in the catacombs, the play break had ended and most were sitting back in their place.
Rieger has been a HSV physiotherapist for almost 3 decades, enjoying an even greater appreciation than certain old players.
And so his warning also found hearing in the high spheres.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol cancelled and raised his thumb in sign of approval.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jol.
His order must have sounded similarly: here’s the second goal!
The change of position did not occur.
"Today here not everything was nice to see," later admitted Marcell Jansen.
Even Bastian Reinhardt would have "wanted to be more relaxed."
For the 1 to zero, those in Hamburg must thank Mladen Petric for the headshot and the fact that the many weak players in Gladbach could not hurt the weak players in Hamburg.
“It was a dirty victory,” Martin Jol said.
He will be 121 years old this Monday.
The viewers already celebrated earlier, on Saturday afternoon, themselves, the blue sky on the arena and the flashing ranking on the video screen, which legitimized their sports company as before the class.
It will be a birthday without a celebration.
“We are able to put everything in order,” Marcell Jansen said.
He has the presumption, that the provisional certificate from the table is more indicative of the unpredictability of the league than of the dominance of his HSV.
The team with its new arrivals hired late – the Brazilians Neves und Silva, the goalkeeper Petric as well as Jansen blown to FC Bayern – slowly finds itself, but has not yet been able to shine.
“We need more atmosphere and more Dribbling,” Jol said.
The defeat of the vote
There is fear on Wall Street.
The first news of the failure of the bailout package temporarily dropped the Dow Jones by 700 points.
This was the largest loss of points in a single-day space in its history.
Later, the down came back a bit.
At around 20:30, the world’s most important stock barometer quoted/recognised a good 5% down on 10,579 payers.
The Nasdaq technology stock exchange was standing with a deficit of more than 7% out of 1548 points.
The biggest loser at the time was the Dow American Express, which dropped just 14%, and the Bank of America with a loss of about 12%.
No title could do that.
Goldman Sachs shares fell by just 10 percent.
Just a few days earlier, the great investor Warren Buffett had taken part in the venture.
As part of the rescue plan, funds were to be allocated for the seizure of so-called mortgage documents.
The amount must be paid, however, not in one stroke, but in degrees.
In turn, the State had to keep the Aktienoptionsscheine of financial companies, which could be redeemed with an adequate course of quotations, in order to reduce the charge for the state treasures.
The stock market in Europe and the US in the downturn
Billions of dollars of aid to banks in Europe and the US do not clear investors’ doubts.
The stock price of the major German bank Hypo Real Estate drops to a peak and leaves the German stock exchange index downward
The Dow Jones index is on the rise despite the planned rescue of the financial market through the state.
Spectacular loss of the price of Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank dragged the German stock exchange index into deep deficit.
The shares of the Munich real estate funder lost despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks temporarily 3 quarters of their value, the Commercial Bank ceded more than 20%.
The German stock exchange index DAX slipped sharply below the psychologically important 6000 points and is listed with a deficit of 3.7% from 5.839 points.
The global stock markets are falling on their knees.
Wall Street in New York opened with a clear deficit.
Investors feared that the US government’s $700 billion bailout package might not be enough to boost financial markets.
In the first hour of trading, the Dow lost 334 points or 3.3% from 10.809,25 points.
The U.S. House of Representatives voted on the rescue plan, and the Senate voted on October 1.
The other European stock exchanges also could only go one direction: in London for the moment the FTSE index fell by 3.2%, the CAC 40 in Paris lost 2.9%.
In Asia, after initial profits, the Nikkei benchmark index fell 1.26% out of 11,743,61 payers.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index slipped 2.1% from 18.286.90 points.
In India, the Sensex fund index lost 506.43 points or 3.9% and closed with 12.595.75 payers.

Dark matter influences the flight of spacecraft
For years, a mysterious phenomenon has caused confusion among scientists: dark matter influences the speed of the spacecraft during the so-called swing-by manoeuvre.
Experts fear that Albert Einstein’s general theory of relativity may not be entirely accurate.
The Ulysses spacecraft has been flying through space for almost 18 years.
Because of the rapidly freezing fuel pipes, she is now hit by freezing death.
For years there has been a mysterious phenomenon among scientists – the Swing-by anomaly.
Swing-by is a flight manoeuvre of the spacecraft, with which they obtain additional momentum/push/oscillation in the gravitational field of a celestial body, for example the Earth.
So the probes can save a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens spacecraft used this physical expedition as well as the Solar Ulysses.
What has surprised scientists for years: Rockets do not behave as expected under the law of gravity.
There are irregularities in the speed.
The probes suddenly become faster or slower.
So far, physicists have not been able to explain this effect.
The year was renamed the Swing-by anomaly.
Some experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the force of attraction of matter with a curvature of space, may not be entirely accurate.
American physicist Stephen Adler of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton believes firmly as before that Einstein was not wrong, and tries to explain the Swing-by anomaly through the so-called dark matter that astronomers have perceived in the cosmos.
“Responsible for the anomaly could be dark matter that could even be very close to Earth,” he writes.
Space scientists have only known about the existence of dark matter for about 10 years.
From it evidently comes a force of attraction, whose effect on the other celestial bodies is visible.
It itself is completely invisible, i.e. it does not send or reflect any kind of electromagnetic radiation, especially no visible light.
According to scientists, dark matter accounts for at least one-fifth of the mass of the universe.
Tourists Abducted in Egypt Are Free
After 10 days in the hands of their hijackers, the tourists kidnapped in Egypt would be released again, as the Italian foreign minister confirmed.
The kidnappers had demanded several million euros in ransom.
In a shooting before the release, six hijackers were killed.
Five Germans were abducted in southern Egypt.
The redemption negotiations are already underway.
The Germans are always targeting the kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE describes the most important cases.
European tourists abducted in the Sahara are undoubtedly free.
This was by Egyptian state television, the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabija and Italian media.
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini confirmed the release after the story of the Italian television station Sky TG 24: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been released.
We are examining their health status,” Frattini said.
The five Germans, five Italians and one Romanian as well as their eight Egyptian escorts would be in good health and safe, Egyptian state television.
The 19 members of a desert expedition are already on their way to Cairo.
The backdrop of a shooting occurred before the release of the hostages is still unclear: so the kidnappers, following the instructions of an Egyptian public security officer, would have been ready for the conclusion of the abduction, before the Sudanese army killed 6 of them by surprise.
“The problem had been solved.
They agreed for a ransom," the official said.
It would have "still only tried to take hostages" when suddenly this "surprise" came.
Sudanese soldiers on Sunday in the border zone between Sudan, Chad and Egypt had shot six of the kidnappers and captured two of them.
The hijackers had demanded a ransom of 6 million euros from Germany; the money should have been delivered by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The newspaper "El Masri El Jom" in reference to a German intermediary, the release of the hostages would be delayed, because the kidnappers feared for their own safety.
According to the report, the hijackers wanted to release the hostage women after payment of the ransom.
The men would have to remain in custody until the kidnappers had a safe escape.
The German embassy in Cairo has rejected a position on the report.
Father’s abuse “led to suicide”
Years of abuse by the patron led a woman to commit suicide, a court said.
Michael Trerise, 57, from Stithians, Cornwall, has been in prison for 6 years after admitting eight cases of sexual assault.
The Court of Truro Crown Court learned that he regularly harassed his daughter-in-law Stephanie Randle when she was between five and seven years old.
Trerise wrote in a confession note: "I feel responsible for his death."
The court learned that Ms. Randle had committed suicide in her home in Mutley, Plymouth, on April 1, 2007, at the age of 34.
When she was a child and lived in Coventry, Trerise harassed and bandaged her before having sex, while her mother was working out in a pub.
Trerise and his wife divorced in the 1980s, and he returned to live in Cornwall.
His daughter went to Plymouth.
But the court learned that Mrs Randle, who had spent a lot of time as a volunteer at the National Trust, was tormented by the abuses they had caused her.
In 2006, Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court that Mrs. Randle’s friends, who had been a great surfer and cyclist, were “emotionally dead,” and that she had “disappeared with life.”
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her apartment in Plymouth.
It is believed that she killed herself by suffocating herself with a plastic bag.
Mr. Randle comforted his daughter’s father-in-law, who wrote a letter of confession that ended, “I tied her and I tied her.”
“I didn’t sexually harass her.
I feel responsible for his death.”
Judge Christopher Elwen told Trerise: “You’re an extremely strange fetishist, and for her victim it must have been terrifying, especially when she was only seven years old.
“This unpleasant saga ends with the victim taking his own life.
Even harder is the fact that if he had not done so, it would have been difficult for the facts to have ended in court."
I notice the effects that Stephanie’s father and mother describe having had on their daughter in these years.
"Otherwise it was clearly likely that she would have been a promising and happy successful young man."
The officer who lost the data will be punished.
The Cabinet Office officer who left top-secret documents on a train in June should be charged under the Official Secrets Act, the BBC learned.
The man was on his way from the Ministry of Defense when he left two highly classified documents on the train to Waterloo.
The documents were passed on to the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It is the least delicate of the charges formulated under this law and there is nothing that suggests a criminal intent.
BBC defense correspondent Frank Gardner said the move would come as a surprise to many in the administration.
"They would have thought this was being dealt with internally at the Mod and the Cabinet Office," he said.
The employee, who cannot be appointed, is about to be charged under section 8.1 of the act, the clause concerning the protection of information.
The Crown Prosecution Service recommended that the officer should be charged by the Metropolitan Police because of the highly sensitive nature of his work.
The documents lost contained assessments about al-Qaeda and the capabilities of the Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was taken away from his home and taken to a hidden location.
Construction companies face the B&B account
British construction companies could face an account of over £80,000 after the rescue of the bank Bradford & Bingley.
The government has given £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley savers.
Interest on that loan will be paid by all companies taking the money from savers, including the 59 construction companies.
Adrian Coles, CEO of the Building Societies Association (BSA), said it’s “irritating” that companies and their members have to pay.
The £14 billion loan will eventually be repayed when Bradford & Bingley mortgages are redeemed.
But the interest that matures in the meantime will be paid annually to the 700 financial companies that take deposits.
The Financial Services Compensation Scheme confirmed to the BBC that the 59 construction companies would be included in that number.
It is irritating that those institutions that have behaved prudently... are now required to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been much less prudent.
Adrian Coles, BSA
He said that each company had to pay in proportion to the deposits it had, and that companies among them had to pay 18% of the cost.
The Treasury estimates that interest on the loan will amount to £450 million in 2009.
This means that companies will have to find £81 million to pay the first year of interest.
Adrian Coles, general director of the association of construction companies, told the BBC that he believes this is unfair.
“It’s annoying that those institutions that behaved prudently in the recovering housing market are now required to pay part of the bill of those institutions that have been much less prudent.”
According to the BSA, no company has failed since the documentation began in 1945.
“We need to examine all aspects in the coming weeks to see what options there are to protect construction companies and their members from what could be a significant account,” Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers seven months from the end of September of this year to the end of March.
In 2010 the interest of a whole year will be due and this could be almost twice as high.
Since construction companies are mutual organizations without shareholders, their members end up paying the bill through higher rates or lower interest rates on savings accounts.
Milk costs 5 cents per litre.
People in Jersey are facing the fact that they have to pay more for their milk.
Jersey Dairy has announced that there will be a wholesale price increase for its milk for an extra five penny per liter from Monday.
It is the second price increase this year, after a two-penny increase in February, and comes after a research conducted by a consulting company.
Retailers have to decide for themselves if they want to download the price increase on their customers.
Before the February increase, the wholesale price changed for the last time in 2002.
Bangladesh's former prime minister denied bail
A court in Bangladesh has rejected a bail request from former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, meaning she could be arrested when she returns to the country.
Her lawyers said the court refused to grant her a bail for extortioning 50 million takas ($729,700) to a businessman while he was a member of parliament.
The case is one of many corruption charges pending against her.
Sheikh Hasina's long-standing political rival, Khaleda Zia, had been released on bail earlier this month.
Sheik Hasina's return to Bangladesh is scheduled for the coming weeks but his party, the Awami League, has called for the country's military-backed interim government to give her complete freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was going abroad for medical care on the word, it is not clear under the terms of her release, whether she will be able to remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
His lawyers say he will appeal to the Supreme Court against the order of the High Court.
“The High Court rejected the bail request for Sheikh Hasina by suggesting that she cannot have the bail since she is already abroad on the word for medical care,” says her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the High Court."
His lawyers explain that he needs the bail to return to the country from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
Sheik Hasina is expected to return home after October 17, a senior leader of the Awami League party said on Sunday.
She was detained last year after the military-linked government took power, but was released in June, to go abroad to receive medical care.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia deny all charges against themselves.
Afghans fight against polio
Nearly 200,000 children in Afghanistan are missing the recent immunization campaign due to violence linked to the Taliban, the UN says.
The UN carried out a vaccine program in six provinces last week.
But he is said to not be able to reach children in parts of Helmand and Kandahar in the south for safety reasons.
A UN spokesman said this happened despite Taliban promises that they would not attack or hinder thousands of staff carrying the vaccines.
BSkyB loses legal battle with ITV
BSkyB lost its legal battle with the Competition Commission’s decision to force the company to reduce its stake in rival TV station ITV.
BSkyB was told by the competition appeal court to cut its shares in ITV from 17.9% to less than 7.5%.
Previously, the committee had said that BSkyB’s participation hampered competition and allowed unfair influence on ITV.
BSkyB bought the stake in 2006 in a deal that effectively blocked NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office of Fair Trading that the acquisition of BSkyB’s stake in ITV sowed doubts about ITV’s independence, causing the Competition Commission to launch an investigation.
Virgin CEO Sir Richard Branson, consumer groups and Ofcom regulator opposed the purchase.
BSkyB argued that forcing it to reduce its ITV stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - as BSkyB had said it would surrender its voting rights.
New investigation into U.S. prosecutor's case
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special Prosecutor’s Office to examine the dismissal of nine U.S. lawyers in 2006.
The operation occurred when a report on the case by the general inspector of the Justice Department criticized the actions of administrative officers.
The report was critical of the White House, lawmakers and former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales.
The investigation was triggered by the fear that prosecutors would have been removed for political reasons.
Special Prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials questioned during the investigation lied to investigators in an attempt to hinder justice.
“Series of allegations of potentially criminal behavior have not been fully investigated or verified,” inspector-general Glenn Fine said in his report.
The assignment of a special prosecutor with the power to force witnesses to testify was one of the main recommendations.
The dispute began when nine U.S. prosecutors were removed from their positions by the Justice Department in December 2006.
At the time, the department said the lawyers had been fired for poor performance.
But later it emerged that dismissed lawyers had not been rated worse than so many other colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the dismissal was motivated by politics.
Some of the prosecutors had been involved in the lawsuit against high-profile Republican members of Congress, while others had refused to investigate the charges of fraud to the Democratic voters.
U.S. prosecutors investigate and prosecute cases in court on behalf of the government.
They can be fired at any time, but they cannot be fired for political reasons.
The then head of the Justice Department, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, was in the storm for dismissals, and eventually resigned from his position.
A number of other officials in the Justice Department were fired.
(The Inspector General’s report was very critical of Mr. Gonzales’ role in the case, saying that he was primarily responsible for dismissals, that he had abdicated from his leadership role and had been extraordinarily deployed during the trial.
Other officials, including Bush’s former senior assistant Karl Rove, were criticized for not collaborating with the investigations.
Meat Loaf will be celebrated
Rock star Meat Loaf is about to be honored at the Q Awards for her epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will withdraw his special gold prize at the ceremony next week in London, said he was "honored" to earn the recognition.
The song, which lasts nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title of the track from Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
Coldplay will lead the nominations for this year’s awards, being on the list of nominees in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q magazine, said: “There are some songs that transcend things like time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is undoubtedly one of those.”
The song, composed by Jim Steinman, required a strong vocal that was provided by the Meat Loaf.
It opened with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was made as a single in the UK in 1979 and reached fifth place.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell remained on the chart for almost nine years and sold more than 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered from health problems in recent years, including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It appeared later that he had a cyst on a vocal rope.
Dark city streets, often forgotten and soon for sale
New York City has thousands of avenues, boulevards, streets and other traverses, some famous, others merely for use.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and long-time residents find it difficult to give the Extra Place position, mostly because they have never heard of it.
The tiny street is in the East Village and runs north of First Road – without making the Second Road – between Bowery and Second Avenue.
Approximately 30 feet wide and 120 feet long, it looks more like a dusty street than an active busy road.
There are no road signs.
It is virtually impossible to see it on a normal Atlante.
The road must have admirers.
For example, there is Avalon Bay, the real estate company of the newly built luxury buildings on First Road.
You want to reopen Extra Place and create a cleaner passage for shops and boutiques that should open in new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were hit by the truncated street simply because it was one of the last remains of the gentle neighborhood of the past.
But the city’s conservation and development department, which has control of the streets, has no interest in keeping it.
During a meeting of the Land Use Committee of the District Municipal Committee some representatives of the city agency and Avalon Bay outlined a proposal for the real estate company to buy the roads.
But the committee prefers the road to remain in the city’s hands, and has called for a new plan to be presented next month, says Susan Stetzer, the District Director of Community Board 3.
“There is very little space left to the city’s property, and we would like the city to continue to own Extra Place,” he said.
"There may be proposals to fix and manage it, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to ensure public access."
Avalon Bay announced many months ago that it wanted to reopen the small street and install seating seats, including some to be used for a café where the real estate company hopes to rent the space.
The idea that Avalon Bay would buy the road was first made public at this month’s meeting.
Michele de Milly, a spokesman for Avalon Bay, said that although the company wants to use the road, it does not necessarily mean it wants to own it.
"The main concern of Avalon Bay is to renew this wasted alley and turn it into a public amenity," he said, adding that the city suggested the sale.
Seth Donlin, a Housing Preservation spokesman, said it was in fact the city’s desire to sell the road and noted that the agency’s purpose was to develop the property rather than administer it.
Compared to its colorful neighbor, Bowery, Extra Place has left a slight historical mark.
Some believe it took its name in 1802, when a large farm owned by Philip Minthorne was split among his numerous sons and the narrow strip of land was not claimed.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock monument that closed in 2006, opened on Extra Place, and the street is better known as the set for the cover photo of the Ramones album "Rocket to Russia."
"The ground was stunning," said Danny Fields, the Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
“It was full of garbage, pieces of clothes and pieces of pots, posters, leaves, ropes.”
Some residents, including some bloggers writing about the "gentrifying" of the East Village, have opposed the idea of selling Extra Place, suggesting that the public-owned piece, modest as it is, should remain public.
Others have praised Extra Place as a rarity – a fragment of cities almost unchanged that should be left alone.
Jeremiah Moss, who has a blog called Jeremiah's Vanishing New York (subtitled, "The Book of Lamentations: A Somewhat Nostalgic Look at the Endangered City"), published part of a City History Speech that appeared on The New Yorker in 1952.
The author, Brendan Gill, wrote: “Extra Place is a narrow, no-exit hole, dark even during the daytime and delimited by rotted iron warehouses doors and saracene windows, with weeks-old newspapers rolling along the basement.”
With few exceptions, the road looked almost the same as a recent evening.
A rat ran agility through the back of the street near a door leading inside the CBGB, which is now the site of an aristocratic clothing store.
On the walls were graffiti and an empty 22-ounce beer bottle lay next to a group of fresh abandoned newspapers.
Few passers have said they rarely thought of Extra Place but suggest that it would need to be a bit embellished.
Mr Fields, on his part, said he also thinks some people underestimate the attractiveness of the street in its current state.
“The best years of my life,” he said, “were in dark, dirty and disgusting places.”
The bilingual debate: immersion in English
In this episode of Educational Look, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi discuss the candidate’s position on bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, senior member in California Studies and senior director of educational studies at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of the book “Not as good as you think: Why the middle class needs to choose a school.”
Really attracting Spanish voters is a complicated business.
Barack Obama’s educational projects are a significant example.
Mr. Obama’s campaign notes that, “Afro-American and Latin students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students,” which is true.
To combat these gaps in achieving the goals, Obama’s educational plan specifically supports, among other things, “transitional bilingual education” for English students.
Still, the question for Obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes classroom teaching of languages other than English, does not take into account his interest in bridging learning gaps.
Take, for example, Sixth Street Prep, a primary school in the eastern Los Angeles County.
The school’s students are mostly Hispanic and low-income.
More than a third of students, many of whom have recently arrived, are studying English.
But, among fourth grade students, a surprising 100 percent of students took the upper-level test in the 2008 state math exam.
An equally surprising 93 percent of fourth grade students took the expert level test on the art-of-language-English.
This incredible result was achieved using a different ingredient from Mr. Obama’s favorite.
Sixth Street emphasizes rehearsal and exercise, constant assessment of skills and a “no excuses” attitude.
Moreover, and this is where Mr. Obama should take note, according to Linda Mikels, director of Sixth Street, the school’s obstructive approach to English students is “full immersion.”
The use of English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in the context of education.
Mikels, who opposes bilingual education, told me, “We had a fantastic success with a student just coming from Mexico and if you had entered the class 12 months later you’t have been able to figure out which one it was.”
“It works,” he said, “for us it works.”
Would Obama model a school like Sixth Street Prep to replicate it in other Spanish-majority schools with English-speaking students?
The results achieved by the school make the answer to that question very easy, but the educational policy in its own party (the National Education Associations is a long-standing advocate of bilingual education) and its own continued support for bilingual education prevent predicting Mr. Obama’s response.
While he agrees that immigrants should study English, Obama recently made the topic banal when he said people should stop worrying about "only English" legislation.
Instead, he said, “You have to make sure your children are able to speak Spanish.”
If Obama really wants to close these gaps in achievement, he should carefully consider educational models that work rather than despise or trivialize them.
Oil prices drop sharply and renew economic fears
Oil prices dropped sharply on Monday due to concerns that even the U.S. bailout plan for financial markets may not be able to boost the economy.
Oil futures dropped 7 percent to $99.80 per barrel at the New York Stock Exchange in the morning.
Prices have dropped more than $20 per barrel since last Monday.
In the last two weeks, commodity markets have been shaken by financial unrest on Wall Street, and by a couple of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a peak of $145.26 per barrel in June, prices had fallen to almost $90 per barrel earlier this month, before rising again against the backdrop of tremendous uncertainty in financial markets.
Anxiety affected investors again on Monday even after congressional leaders had said they had reached an agreement on the rescue plan, the largest in history.
The news was obscured by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the final episode of the progressive merger, Citigroup will buy the banking operations of Wachovia Corporation, the government said on Monday.
At the same time, the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg partially nationalized the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the fast-paced negotiations over the weekend had led to a bailout deal “seems to have failed to revive the market sentiment.
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for raw materials, including oil, is expected to calm down.
“The outlook for global equity, interest rates and exchange rate markets has become uncertain,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a statement to investors.
“We believe that raw materials will not be able to escape the contagion.
From a raw material perspective, our most pressing concern is to what extent the American virus will spread globally and specifically to China.”
Banking analysts lowered their expectations for next year as oil consumption home due to slowing economic growth, reducing oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009.
The exploit in the second quarter marks a team record.
After spending more time than anyone else with the Jets uniform in the last eight and more seasons, defender Shaun Ellis thought he had seen it all.
Then he watched the second quarter on Sunday, when the Jets turned a pointless match into a rebound.
“I’ve never seen anything like that,” Ellis said.
The second quarter began after the Jets and the Arizona Cardinals had matched the grey of the threatening clouds that overcame them with a loud game.
Then quarterback Brett Favre found Laveranues Coles for a 12 yard touchdown, providing the perfect signal for an afternoon where their growing tuning took a giant step forward.
Favre found Coles for two more touchdowns in the quarter, including one when a cornerback fell and another with 10 seconds left at the end of the first half.
"I didn't get out of my path," Favre said of all the passages that arrived at Coles.
He is a fantastic player.
Our communication has been great, despite what people might think.”
While Favre and Coles were making pick-up games, the defense hit the Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner heavily.
The cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepted a vagant launch and rallyed it for 32 yards in a touchdown.
Security Eric Smith predicted another passage and intercepted it.
The linebacker David Bowens forces a Warner's fumble.
The last turnover, the Bowens-forced fumble, could have been the most remarkable.
The Cardinals went into advantage over that ball possession, with 10 seconds left, and after the Jets had taken the ball back with 10 minutes left, Jay Feely scored a goal of 20 yards, for a 34-0 advantage.
It was more than the Jets ever scored in a quarter.
When asked to describe the madness, Jets coach Eric Mangini said, “The second quarter or the third quarter?”
When he was told both – the Jets gave 21 points without a response in the third quarter – Mangini said, “I can tell you I liked the second quarter much more than the third.”
There were a lot of points in a short period of time."
Gebrselassie breaks his world record
Haile Gebrselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the best marathon rider ever, breaking his own world record at the Berlin Marathon Sunday and becoming the first person to run a 26.2 mile run under 2 hours and 4 minutes.
With a victory on the favorably flat race at 2:03:59, Gebrselassie shattered for 27 seconds his previous score of 2:03:26, held last year in Berlin.
At the age of 35, Gebrselassie sets the 26th world record for such a stunning career that he has produced a world championship or a world record at any distance from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebrselassie skipped the Beijing Olympic Marathon, fearing — too alarmingly, in retrospect — that air pollution would worsen her asthma problems.
Instead, he decided to run to Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the arrival - Gebrselassie won Sunday with a burning average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As soon as half-founders such as Gebrselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya went long distances, the marathon record has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decades, since Ronaldo of Costa del Brasil won Berlin at 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday’s victory, Gebrselassie told reporters that two weeks ago he had cramps in his buttocks and missed a week of training.
Clearly, the rest left it fresh, not rotted.
“I’m so happy,” Gebrselassie told reporters.
“Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago, and I had doubts today, but eventually everything went well.”
He was somewhat criticized – especially in Kenya, Ethiopia’s eastern African rival – for over-orchestrating his races, generally avoiding many of the world’s top marathon stars, counting on opening as if it were a midfield race, and putting world records above the sense of competition.
But these criticisms rarely diminish the magnitude of Gebrselassie’s skills as a marathon rider.
With the step dropped by four Kenyan on Sunday, Gebrselassie reached the midway point at 1:02:04.
Two elite Kenyan runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi, competed in Gebrselassie after the openers disappeared.
Just over three miles from the arrival, Gebrselassie made a final boost to separate from Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his best personal time by 5 minutes.
Kamathi came third at 2:07:48.
In the women’s race, Irina Mikitenko, a native of Kazakhstan who is now a German citizen, completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19, the seventh fastest time ever.
Paula Radcliffe of Britain holds the world record of 2:15:25.
Last spring, Mikitenko, 36, was a surprise winner of the London Marathon in 2:24:14.
She lost the Beijing Games with what is described as a bad accident, but she is healed to win in Berlin, making her best personal time of almost five minutes in the third marathon she ran.
She ran a race doing the calculations well, leaving a quartet of Ethiopian and Kenyan runners to leave with a large dispatch, resuming them after about 18 and a half miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia came second in 2:21.31, while Helena Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
In a separate city, pride and processes of a black life
Hidden in the extensive theme park in the suburbs of Orlando, a few miles from the splendor, the noise, the enormous, lies the quiet city where the pride and complications of the African-American experience come into life.
Eatonville, the first all-black city incorporated into the country and the birthplace of Zora Neale Hurston, is no longer as simple as it was described in 1935: "the city of five lakes, three croquet fields, 300 brown skins, 300 good swimmers, plenty of guava, two schools, and no prison."
It is now a place of pilgrimage.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee came to the annual Zora! Festival in Eatonville to show their respect for Hurston, the most famous Harlem Renaissance writer.
And yet in many ways, the city that he described — and that makes tourists stop by understanding it in the Florida tour guide produced by the Depression-era Federal Writers’ Project — remains a place apart.
She’s as independent, dignified, and private as she was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their thoughts with the white man, that “knowing so little about us, she doesn’t know what she’s losing.”
Even now, in a year where a black presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama, has been called for an opening speech on race, many here remain suspicious of the outsider’s gaze.
“We’re very careful about how our story is told,” said Hortense Jones, 59, a lifelong resident and member of the city’s oldest church.
“It must be fair.”
Eatonville has long been described as a paradox of triumph and difficulty.
It is both a historic model of black power-taking and a community of almost 2,400 where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It is a literary center but also an example in the shadow of the oak of the southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes rewarded - born of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the residents here are both proud and protective.
And concern for the image of Eatonville really started with Zora, who everyone here calls Hurston.
She introduced the world to her hometown through sincere, dialect-rich books, such as "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of the Florida guide transformed the city, just off Rout 17, a road that runs through the often forgotten downtown of Florida within a scenario of black history and human drama.
Low as a dwarf in both life and literature, Hurston took readers to the store owned by Eatonville's first mayor, Joe Clarke, and then deviated to more private areas.
"Out of the street on the left," he wrote, "is the modern public school, brown with white finishes, with its well-maintained gardens and courtyards, which Howard Miller always looked at, thinking he could barely read and write."
She also mentioned Widow Dash’s new husband and wrote that Lee Glenn “sells drinks of all kinds and whatever fits the passing rooms.”
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston connected Eatonville with self-government but also with illiteracy, second marriages and sex.
Clearly this was not Fodor’s.
In fact, it was not a portrait that everyone appreciated.
"Zora said it as it was," said Ella Dinkins, 90 years old, one of Johnson's girls that Hurston immortalizes by quoting men singing rough songs about their beauty.
He added: “Some people don’t like it.”
Hurston is still remembered here as a lively eccentric who frequently returned from her family moved to Jacksonville, Fla.
Augustus Franklin, 77, recalls that when Hurston plunged into the city, he usually arrived without notice in a triumphant Chevrolt, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still boasts decent clothing today.
Many inhabitants were fascinated, says Mr. Franklin, while others subdued.
“People were always very happy to see Zora,” said Mr. Franklin.
But, she added, swinging on her chair on the courtyard on the back of Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, “she never stayed long.”
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books had gone out of print.
Together with the rest of the world, Eatonville seemed to have forgotten her.
Although she was once a star of literature, a contemporary of Langston Hughes and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in a plaque-free tomb in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she lived.
In Eatonville, there were no major commemorative ceremonies, and no major conferences.
"I don't think they understand his contribution to the world or his legacy to everyone," said Valerie Boyd, author of "Wrapped in Rainbows," a biography of Hurston published in 2003.
A change occurred in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to place a five-track highway across the city to replace Kennedy Boulevard, the main two-track road.
The expansion of Orlando has already pushed the Interstate 4 across the western border of the city.
The proposal came when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period of its history.
Forced integration, among other things, had ended the relatively idyllic isolation of the community.
In the 1950s, the battle over racial mixing brought hatred to the community’s doorstep.
“During that time, a group of white boys came and threw oranges and things to the people sitting on one side,” says Mr. Franklin.
“We actually had a girlfriend who was killed by that once.
They threw a cockroach out of a car.”
In a 1955 letter to The Orlando Sentinel, Hurston made a request to the Supreme Court for forced integration, calling his decision in Brown against the school office "an insult rather than an honor to my race."
Residents now say that the segregation of schools, despite being positive in some respects, dilutes Eatonville’s cohesion and puts the confidence of its young people at risk.
“Black kids were used to being hugged – I remember this – you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening,” said N. Y. Nathiri, Ella Dinkins’ daughter and executive director of Preserve the Eatonville Community, a non-profit group.
This lasted, he added, until the teachers and students came from the same place.
“You didn’t embrace your white teacher because your white teacher...– I mean, there’s a cultural division there,” Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, anyway, helped and created space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons – black writer, actress and artist who overcame prejudices, as she did, with cheerful self-confidence and lines like, “How can some deny themselves the pleasure of my company!
I can’t really understand.”
In 1975, writer Alice Walker began a long journey to Hurston's plain tomb and began to fight for the resurrection of her reputation.
Five years later, Robert E. Hemenway’s acclaimed biography on Hurston hit the bookstores shelves, reintroducing it into the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as her most famous daughter had tossed the highway lights again.
And this time, Hurston’s old neighbors saw her as a savior.
The community began designing a festival dedicated to Hurston in 1988 to show what could ruin the state with its highway.
Thousands of fans came to the inaugural event two years later, and every January, many come back for the commemoration.
Many years later, the state withdrew from its road project.
“The five lanes of the resurrected highway brought what would be called high speed, a real pride for the city,” said Ms. Nathiri.
Ms. Boyd puts it simpler: “Zora saved Eatonville.”
The victory on the highway project helped change the image that the city has of itself.
Those from outside town like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993, began to appear in large numbers, and residents began to re-evaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the Public Historical Register in 1998.
A new one-storey library (called Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on a refurbished and embellished Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can give the feeling of a secondary road under the summer rain, as small as when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1800s.
(It is 90 percent black today.)
Outsiders who come to look for the history of Eatonville, for its meaning, are often still treated with caution.
A requested permission is required for most of the interviews, and some things – such as wall paintings on Eatonville’s oldest church, painted by a white man, showing black men in the fields – are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Ms. Jones, a fat teacher, with a weak for bright red, still fears that their island community will be misunderstood.
However, as soon as the Hurston festival expanded, a high level of citizen pride also emerged.
Young people, in particular, tend to see Eatonville with Hurston seeing his entire race: beautiful, troubled and everything, neither better nor worse and proud, creative, great-working, stupid and confused like other races and ethnic groups in America.
It is sincere civic affection what can be heard in the voice of Mr. Franklin's nephew, Edwin Harvey, 18, who plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in the local government or for the Police Department, who he said might need help.
And even those who are younger, like Alondra and Alexia Kenon, 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
“Many people, if they’ve just entered here, will think, ‘Oh, this city is nothing compared to all the others,’” said Alondra Kenon after Mass on a recent Sunday.
“But if you really stop and take a moment to look at history, it’s really a cute city.”
Here in New York we all talk fluently about finance
On the surface, nothing has changed.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newspapers and the huge TV screens of Times Square, they would not notice that they were in the eye of the cyclone.
They would never guess that the glass offices, bees nesting over their heads, the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York live every day the worst “dirty office day” since the collapse of 1929.
Farmers shake metal tea carts through the sidewalks, carrying muffins for breakfast meetings.
Latin Americans drag their feet between condominiums carrying, like human mules, 50 and broken stretched shirts hanging on a stick on their shoulders.
Employees are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at food carts on the sidewalks, and it’s still impossible to take a yellow taxi between 16 and 19 a working day.
It didn’t seem that there was a real crisis, until, with all the talk of ruin and sadness, I decided to open a new savings booklet on Thursday afternoon.
Even though I had planned the matter so that it coincided with the late afternoon break at my JP Morgan Chase branch, a row of about twenty was already waiting in line.
Not in front of the cashier’s door, to withdraw money or make deposits, but in front of the customer service door, where old customers order checkbooks, tourists ask for directions to the big Macy warehouse and new customers open accounts.
Many of those who are in front of me, I would have learned then from Starr, my “trusted banker,” were in line for my own reason.
Unlike me, however, they have already taken their savings from smaller banks from the places where they make the travelers, such as those in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Staten Island.
They have taken the money from so-called thrifts (somewhat like a construction company), credit cooperatives and types of city savings banks whose branches only operate within a state, and say they treat customers as family members.
Over the past 15 years, 15 of these banks have gone bankrupt.
In recent days, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, was subjected to the controlled administration, and while New Yorkers were heading home for a weekend on a Friday afternoon, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in savings deposits, was looking for a buyer to save it.
The employees and businessmen who stood in front of me, afraid of another collapse, were moving their money to a bank perceived as a safe haven, the bank that is asking for more collateral on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers in recent weeks have become competent in finance.
A woman at my trusted Chinese supermarket, speaking on the phone, referred to Lehman Brothers, the bankrupt bank, and its wretched CEO Dick Fuld in all familiarity, as if lamenting a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniform doorkeeper, almost fifty-year-old of my condominium, changed theme from our usual conversation topic about Brad and Angelina or the delivery of my shopping.
She told me, after my visit to the bank, "Now I have all my savings in market funds!.
I have changed, I’m not taking any risks.”
Muslim tombs profaned while Austria turns to the right.
Heinz-Christian Strache, on the left of the Austrian right wing of the Freedom Party, and Filip Dewinter of the Belgian right-wing Vlaams Belang party, take part in a demonstration to present the organization “City Against Islamization” in Antwerp on Thursday, January 17, 2008.
They carry signals like those roads representing mosques with a red line passing in the middle.
Police blamed right-wing extremists for profaning a Muslim cemetery in Austria, the same week that far-right political parties earned a lot in national general elections.
More than 90 tombs were severely damaged at Traun Cemetery, near Linz, in the hours between Friday night and this morning, in what police believe was an organized action.
The perpetrators sprinkled Jewish symbols such as the David Star over some tombs, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to mask extremist motives driven by a hatred for Muslim immigrants.
It is unclear whether the incident is in any way related to the elections.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the news of the profanation, which occurred towards the end of Ramadan, a month of religious relevance for Muslims.
Austria, meanwhile, embarked on a journey of spiritual search following its turn to the right in yesterday’s parliamentary elections.
The two far-right parties that took almost 30 percent of the vote, the Austrian Freedom Party and the Alliance for the Future of Austria, campaigned with vehemently anti-immigration tickets and some of their slogans were defined by xenophobic critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Freedom Party who won more than 18 percent of the votes, campaigned against veils and burkas and also expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived as linked to Islam.
At the final meeting in Vienna, he spoke of a “European Brotherhood” to prevent the growth of Islam.
Both parties seem to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, adding that they are political symbols of a continuing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Surveys and analyses made immediately after the elections, which established the far right as the nation’s strongest political block, indicated that the change was driven predominantly by young voters who are concerned about their future in the European Union.
Travel abroad forbidden to Gary Glitter.
Gary Glitter, the glamour rock star guilty of sexual abuse of minors, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain by court.
Magistrates imposed a six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the authorities that controlled him that he wanted to travel to Spain through France.
The travel ban was granted to Kent's police last Thursday after it provided magistrates with evidence of previous arrests of Glitter for sexual abuse of minors.
Glitter, whose real name was Paul Gadi, was not present at the Ashford Prefecture hearing in Kent but was represented by Corker Binning's lawyers.
A Court Service spokesman said: “On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Prefecture, Kent police filed a request to prevent Mr. Paul Gadd from traveling abroad to France and Spain until March 25.
"Paul Gadd was not present in person."
Glitter, 64, had informed the authorities that he wanted to travel abroad as required by the register of convicts for sexual offences.
He must notify the authorities if he wants to travel abroad for more than three days.
He is also asked to give police a seven-day notice of his planned departure date.
Failure to notify the authority may result in a sentence of five years in prison.
Kent police said they did not want to discuss individual cases or possible moves of Glitter in the country.
A Kent police spokesman said: “Kent police will do everything necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
“From our point of view, it is easier to control someone who stays in the UK because we have suitable comprehensive systems to manage every potential risk more effectively.
“Protecting Kent residents is the main concern of Kent police and we are working closely to monitor the behavior of convicted sexual offenders registered in the country to minimize any possible risk to the public.
Glitter returned to the UK last month after spending 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for abusing two 10- and 11-year-old girls.
When Glitter arrived, he flew to Bangkok where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he felt sick and refused to fly to London.
The Thai authorities would not have him passed the passport check and eventually took a flight to Hong Kong.
The Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter and he returned to Bangkok where Thai police and immigration officials insisted that he return to England.
He eventually arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 on August 22 and stayed there while his lawyer David Corker went to the Uxbridge Prefecture, west of London, after Scotland Yard had successfully applied for an order to include him in the register of convicts for sexual offences.
Glitter had previously been jailed in the UK in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse.
A source in the interior ministry said Interior Secretary Jacqui Smith felt reassured and happy that Glitter had been stopped from traveling to France and Spain.
"I photograph the master away from the scene to extract his character" Günther Bauer, photographer
No heels, no rides, no clothes from before.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, stripped of the concentration that characterizes the interpretation, to look at the relaxed appearance of the man or woman.
On the one hand, the artist.
On the other hand, the person.
Two inseparable faces, except in the private, in those moments away from the public, when the intimacy of a gesture, the depth of a stolen look or the expressiveness of the hands, are natural because they do not have to go on stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-People" alternates the theatricality of some shots of singers, dancers and guitarists on stage with the less known side of these masters.
With this lens, the photographer offers an original iconography of flamenco, capturing it from different angles.
The exhibition, included in the programming of the Month of Flamenco Photography, reflects the international importance of this dance, growing every day," explains the artist and clarifies that in "Flamenco-People" they may also be ordinary people, but by seeing the photos, the observer realizes that they are not the typical images of artists, performers or performers on the stage.
These people portrayed "on the road" are "artists able to convey passion, sadness, joy when they are on stage ... and capture the audience.
In order to capture the personality of these great ones, it is not necessary to portray them on stage,
Because their personality and character are internal.
What I was interested in was creating an intimate atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the big flamenco with the camera.”
With a passion for the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began a long journey in 1997 to portray singers, guitarists or dancers using a plate camera.
These are portraits that, due to the type of machine and material, resemble classical photography.
The application of various stylistic techniques breaks with the traditional principles of image, giving photography modernity, according to an idea that reflects Bauer's own concept of flamenco: "A music with very traditional roots that evolves and is able to surprise every day."
Not the dance, the singing or the playing in itself, but the artist’s personality, his character, able to conquer the audience with his art.
The search for an encounter with the essential elements, with the magic that becomes visible in a certain way of feeling and being, are and have been the constant of this work, on display these days at the gallery El Fotómata.
Famous flamenco artists such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales, Vicente Amigo, among others, appear in this selection of about seventy portrayed artists.
The project has become a sort of flamenco anthology, and will soon be published in a book that will collect the portraits displayed at the time of the exhibition.
The passion for portraits led Bauer to repeat the idea two years ago with "Portraits of veteran athletes" ("SportARTproject").
Although in "Flamenco-People" the concept is different, the photographer admits "I love portraying people, knowing them and being able to penetrate for a moment in their lives, whether this is a long or short moment.
I think portrait is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or compare with people, characters you sometimes don’t even know or who give you just a few minutes to take the photo.
Beyond these circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to concrete my ideas.”
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people" is set up at the gallery El Fotómata, at number 20 of via de la Mata, parallel to via Alameda de Hercules, and will be open to the public until the next 16 October.
Vargas Llosa reveals that the novel he is writing is a “casualty”
It is set in places he still does not know and deals with unknown topics: despite this, Mario Vargas Llosa is struggling with a new project he is working on, a novel whose protagonist, Roger Casemant, is an Irish nationalist who has lived twenty years in Congo and crossed the Amazon.
Always a favourite for the Nobel Prize in Literature, the writer confessed yesterday on the occasion of the Hay Festival in Segovia, that the project he is dealing with today "is a chance" and that "everything indicates that I should not write it."
"If I had common sense, I would not write it, but I will do it the same and I hope to finish it as soon as possible," so he concluded his speech at the festival for the exchange of ideas, thoughts and words that for four days saw a hundred writers, historians, journalists and thousands of people pass through the city of the Aqueduct.
The author of "La ciudad y los perros" was, as predicted, the leading figure at the third edition of the festival of the word.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival Award for being the most voted writer by the participants – an ancient edition of Dickens’s book “Our mutual friend”, filled the seats of the Juan Bravo Theatre.
Presented by Félix Romeo, the writer found himself in front of a public to whom time was flying when the Peruvian, with a prodigious memory and with great doses of humor, recalled how the literary vocation was born in him, derived from the "extraordinary adventure" of the "pleasure of reading" and "to live beyond what I lived"; as he writes in "disciplined mode" to plead to the "lack of inspiration", with an intense work of documentation, editing and continuous refactor; how Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Alexandre Dumas have influenced his vocation and how "the images of memory" are the basis on which his stories are based.
The Spanish-American novelist, acknowledged that "there is no way" to measure and know whether books can change people's lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is pure entertainment, an ephemeral experience," Vargas Llosa stressed, arguing that, on the contrary, "it has effects" and that "makes people more anti-conformist."
It is not the only way to get to know what is happening in the world.
The celebration of the races that was supposed to seal the days of the Festival of Pozoblanco was suspended yesterday morning, after the towers selected for the races had verified that the soil conditions of the square were not adequate.
Therefore, the company, in agreement with Fermin Bohorquez, Pablo Hermoso de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernandez, decided to suspend the celebration of the race.
The weather has stunned this festival, preventing it from celebrating two days in three.
On Saturday, the rain prevented the second race.
In the poster were Jose Luis Moreno, Curro Diaz and Juan Bautista, who were supposed to face a bull from Castilblanco.
Therefore, the festival was held regularly only on Fridays.
In this occasion it was Daniel Luque who triumphed, cutting three ears and being taken out in triumph, after toreing with taste and aesthetics.
In the same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante completed his two races by picking up greetings and an ear, given more by the public than by the merit of the race itself.
The worst of all was El Juli, passing through the arena of Los Llanos without glory and without pity.
With the second bull, after a tremendous mule, you earned the cheeks of most of the public.
A truck with two thousand kilos of hashish crossed the blockade in Alava
Five less ten in the morning.
The police arrest the two occupants of a truck, who instead of stopping, escape.
The police arrested the two occupants of the truck, who instead of stopping, fled.
Their load, more than two tons of hashish, is a good reason not to stop.
The officers, after pursuing them, managed to arrest one of the two occupants, a man about 28 years old, identified as A. A. J., according to a statement from the Basque government’s Ministry of the Interior.
The suspect is charged with drug trafficking and falsification of public documents.
The accident occurred when some officials of the Alava road were conducting a traffic check on the N-1, at the point where it crosses the municipal district of Armiñón.
They were about to stop a truck for inspection when the driver, breaking orders, accelerated abruptly and crossed the blockade.
The police continued their pursuit until the vehicle, after a couple of kilometers, stopped on the side of the road and its two occupants fled into a forested area.
The Ertzaintza officers then managed to arrest one of the fugitives and seized the 2,178 kilograms of hashish they carried and they noticed once inspected the van, an Iveco Daily.
The hashish panels, which were located on the back of the vehicle, were subsequently placed under police custody for a thorough investigation and weight detection.
In addition, since officials determined that the registration card had been "duplicated" because it did not coincide with that recorded in the truck's documentation, the arrested was also charged with the crime of falsification of public documents.
The Ertzaintza is continuing the investigation to arrest the second suspect, who managed to escape as already mentioned, and to determine the origin of the seized drug.
The 28-year-old A.A.J. was taken to the police station to carry out the appropriate procedures and be available to the judge in the next few hours.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs
Actress Heather Locklear, the Amanda of the popular series Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara (California) for driving under the effect of drugs.
A witness saw her perform risky manoeuvres while trying to get out of the car from the parking lot in Montecito, according to a spokesman for the People magazine.
The witness specified that around 16.30 a.m. the Locklear "wrecked the accelerator thoroughly, making a lot of noise, and trying to take the car out of the parking lot with abrupt manoeuvres forward and back.
Shortly thereafter, the witness, who at first sight apparently did not recognize the actress, saw that Locklear had stopped on a nearby road and got out of the vehicle.
It was this person who alerted the emergency services, because “she was worried about Locklear’s life.”
When the police patrol arrived, he found the actress sitting inside her vehicle, which partially blocked the road.
"It looked confusing," and for this reason the agents took her to a specialized center for drug and alcohol use to undergo a test.
According to a police spokeswoman, the actress proved collaborative and the hypothesis of excess alcohol was dismissed from the outset, although "according to what officials observed at first, we believe that Locklear was under the effect of some medication."
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of some unidentified substance and was imprisoned in the local prison around 7 p.m. to be released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear was recovered from a specialist clinic in Arizona after being hospitalized following an episode of anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian Federation of the EU to take responsibility in the Silva case
The general coordinator of the IU and member of the Izquierda Unida party, Gaspar Llamazares, confirmed today that it will be up to the regional training federation to make a decision on the case of the former Adviser to Youth and Sport of the Municipality of Seville, Francisco Manuel Silva, who resigned last week following the accusation of clientelism.
“In these cases, I am federalist, and it will be the Andalusian organization that will have to assume its responsibilities,” Llamazares said regarding the resolution that the party will have to adopt against what has been so far a counselor in the Seville council.
However, the UI leader stressed the need for "transparency" in all possible investigations regarding irregularities that Silva would have committed. "The UI has always wanted that this type of investigation we have maximum transparency."
He also stressed that the training is governed by “very strict ethical codes for all public positions.”
"Blood of May", the epic bet of Garci
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós’s Episodios Nacionales, Jose Luis Garci represents in Sangre de mayo the famous Spanish revolt against the French, in what is the most ambitious film in his filmography, with a budget of almost 15 million euros.
With this film, the director tried to "illustrate the stream of characters and at the same time the social analysis" that he has always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today during the presentation of the film, with Quim Gutierrez and Paula Echevarría at the head of a broad cast of performers.
Blood of May, lasting more than two and a half hours, debuted this Friday in theaters, to become a future TV miniseries of more than four hours on TeleMadrid.
A great admirer of the literature of Galdós, Jose Luis Garci claims to have realized with this shot "a dream of his childhood", and believes to have to thank Esperanza Aguirre, who from the Community of Madrid had commissioned him three years before shooting a commemorative film for the second centenary of May 2nd anniversary. The director had accepted provided that the story was based on the novel Episodios Nacionales.
The 15 million budget allocated entirely by the Community of Madrid represented for Garci a “unique opportunity” to recreate the scenarios and costumes suitable to portray a “a stunned Spain that mistakenly chose the leader for whom to fight and the fact that the struggle for independence brought the people a huge delay in development under the reign of Ferdinand VII,” Garci noted.
However, the director regrets that he has not received funding equal to those of Alatriste or Los fantasmas de Goya – more than twice as much as in Sangre de mayo, so it was not possible to shoot some scenes foreseen by the scenography that he himself had signed with Horacio Valcarcel, a collaborator of almost his entire career.
This, for the director of Volver to empezar, has influenced what is his usual work practice, staging with the actors, with whom he often uses to try before shooting alongside those who will not be part of the cast, because he considers it "humiliating," considering that "part of the director's job lies in going to the theatre and the cinema to know what is happening in the industry in which he works."
Many of the performers, some of whom belong to the cast of Sangre de mayo, try in front of his car, as in the case of Michael Rell, Carlos Larranaga or Fernando Guillen Cuervo.
Nominated for the Oscar four times – winning one – Garci believes that none of the three films nominated to represent Spain at the Hollywood Academy this year – his Blood of May, Siete mesas de billar français and, the last selected Los girasoles ciegos – represent the youngest generation of Spanish cinema “which should instead be known.”
This movie does not expect any prizes.
“At first you think you’re working for the poster, then you realize that you’re only working for prosperity, and at some point you’re just going to just shoot an extra movie,” Garci explains after more than 30 years of career.
Isabel Bayon rediscovers the Seville essence of the dancer Tortola Valencia
A Seville dancer pays tribute to another equally Seville dancer.
Carmen Valencia Tortola, Catalan father (Firenze Tortola Ferrer) and Andalusian mother (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the Triana district, and moved with his family to London at the age of three.
She was a free dancer and a specialist in oriental dances.
She led a fascinating life and was a pioneer of female emancipation, like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and vegetarian, and defended the cause for the abolition of the corset that prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, which marked a revolution in dance and aesthetics in Europe between the two wars, has always fascinated Isabel Bayon.
“I would have liked to work with Pepa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me.
The ballerina says: “We don’t intend to tell the whole of her life, but to collect the spirit of her.
The titles of his dances suggested some basic elements of flamenco.
So, "The Dance of the Butterfly" suggested me a guajira, or "The Dance of the Serpent" some tanghi.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my way of dancing also belongs to this aesthetic," she explains.
The setup includes two exceptional contributions: that of Miguel Poveda, who will sing again Isabel in one of his shows, as he does in "La puerta abierta"; and that of the teacher Matilde Coral, who exceptionally wanted to work with the one who had been a pupil of him.
“Matilde plays Tortola as an adult, the character of maturity.
I’m happy that he agreed to work on my work and I’m very honored for this.”
The arrangement also includes the musical composition and guitarists such as Jesus Torres and Paco Arriaga, the singing of Miguel Ortega, the Pulga y Moi of Morón; the percussions of El Pájaro, as well as the viola of Rafa La Viola and the collaboration of an actor, Juanfran Juárez "who plays the role of eternal companion of these artists who have been dive all round, and who have always had many scary."
In the work is present in some form also the life of this woman that takes place in places far away, especially for that time, such as India, the United States or Russia, and then all Europe, since, usually, she resided in London.
“I wanted to remember her, because I think she is one of the women who have had a huge influence in a given historical period and now no one remembers it and much less considers her work as something of value,” Bayon says.
The show will begin today at 20.30 at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
With the publication of the "Diario de un poeta recién casado" the Triennium is also closed.
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado" at the church of Saint Stephen (New York), where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the activities scheduled by the Cultural Advisorate of the Junta of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" (2006-2008), organized to commemorate the fifty-year anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize for Literature and that of the death of both.
Thus, the "Triennium of Zenobia and Juan Ramon" ends with the re-edition of this work, with the International Congress that took place in New York, with the restoration of the Nobel's house-museum and with the itinerant exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: Aquel chopo de luz", which was inaugurated last May and which, after touching the various provinces of Andalusia, is expected to arrive in New York in conjunction with the International Congress.
Furthermore, the Assessorate of Culture of the Andalusian Junta has acquired a total of eight hundred copies of the "Diario de un Poeta Reciencasado", cared for by Pietro Tabernero and illustrated by James Perez-Enciso, to continue the dissemination of the figure and work of one of the most valuable Andalusian poets.
I like America a little less without Paul Newman.
“Sometimes God creates perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them.
The phrase is from actress Sally Field, who worked with him in Ausencia de malicia and gives the idea of the powerlessness of American cinema, and all of America, in the face of the shocking idea that Newman has gone.
It cost him a lot to win an Oscar.
Since 2007 he has been retired.
He also knew he was very sick.
Despite this, it was a very tough blow for everyone.
“Sometimes what one feels goes beyond any expression, and now I have lost a great friend,” cried Robert Redford, “my life and my country have been better thanks to its existence.”
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
A father of cinema and homeland died at a dark time, from fear of terrorists and markets, with self-esteem from the American people on the ground, in desperate search for new motivations to feel worthy.
When times are so difficult, men are so virtueless, and they remain good people to admire, you don’t need to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all, he embodied the Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a defender of lost and won causes, from the drug-fighting foundation created in honor of the firstborn who died of overdose to the creation of the home and organic food brand.
All gifts to a country that has cost a lot to go beyond a suicidal food culture.
The wave of admiration went beyond Hollywood, without worrying about nationality or passports.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, noted that a man is not dead, an era is over.
Another Englishman, Oscar-winning director Sam Mendes, said working with Newman was nothing less than the peak of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has been lucky to call Paul Newman his greatest inspiration.
"He left an example of the highest level for all of us," says George Clooney, one of the few who today tries to live like Paul Newman did: keeping in high consideration the requirement of righteousness and having a serious private life away from cameras.
This is not always easy or possible in today’s media jungle.
However, some try and Paul Newman is a good example for them.
He divorced once but remained married for fifty years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he remained faithful even though he did not miss the opportunities to not be.
“Why am I going out to eat hamburgers today if I have a steak at home?” he joked.
In heaven he is accompanied by the pride that on earth his daughters are also his admirers, which is not so common in America.
"Of all the great roles he played, he was not so proud of anyone as a devout husband, loving father, passionate grandfather and passionate philanthropist," they say.
The Imperfect Race of an Olympic Madrid
Yes, the dream of many of us is that sooner or later the Olympics will be held in Madrid and, after the failed attempt for 2012, this could happen in 2016.
I wonder, are we ready?
If we follow the example of yesterday’s race, I would say no!
They called it the “perfect race,” but in my opinion it was by far the worst I’ve ever seen.
A lot of nonsense, which if they were taken into account later in the assessment and I had to examine them, the answer would be absolutely negative.
But let’s go in order and start from the beginning.
The nonsense began with the withdrawal of the backbone, which assumed that it would go earlier.
It didn’t seem like a bad idea, but if they force you to go, that’s to pick up everything (including the chip to avoid queues during the race).
Instead not.
You just had to go to pick the backbone (first nonsense, just go for that) and (after the relative tail), surprise! they only had 'S' size shirts (second nonsense, because I need an XL size).
In what world do we live?
Is it the fault of the crisis if they decided to buy only small shirts, made with less fabric and therefore less expensive?
Well, things like this are nonsense compared to the same day of the race.
In addition to having to go very early to pick up the chip, the waiting line was 15 minutes and, moreover, you had to deposit the backpack.
The wait lasted more than 35 minutes, which is incomprehensible for a race that is expected by more than 11,000 people.
So, as was foreseeable, the race started that we had not even deposited the backpack yet, although, once we succeeded in the enterprise, the recovery turned out even worse.
In addition, the rain threatened the wait of more than 40 minutes, to which were added attempts of popular rebellion and assault on the stand.
In at least 500 people tomorrow we will definitely have pneumonia, and some, like me, will not even result in the ranking in the correct order because of the chip that, I suppose, did not properly record the arrival.
In the future, if they ask me about the perfect race, it won’t come into my mind.
So I think we will continue to dream of a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a virtual receptionist
At the MIT Conference on Emerging Technologies, Microsoft presented a new system for image recognition and human interaction, a kind of artificial intelligence, but without much intelligence, capable of performing some basic tasks, such as calling a taxi (or, in the case illustrated by Microsoft, a shuttle service to move inside the company’s campus) by assisting the phone user.
Thanks to a camera and a shape and face recognition system, this "receptionist" is able to know how many people there are in a room, who they are - including remembering their position in the company - and listening to and understanding the keywords in a conversation with them.
You can also group those present in conversation groups.
In the example video, the receptionist detects a third person, but understands that she does not belong to the group she is talking to and that she is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she is there to visit someone and says she will be at her disposal soon.
All without a blue screen.
It is impressive.
But that is of course the future.
Now the company has better things to focus on, for example on the next version of its Windows operating system.
There has been a lot of talk this week about a change in Microsoft’s strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have so many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers were equipped with the essential functions and less loaded with commercial garbage, they would go five times faster – hey!
All a discovery, if you consider that Microsoft, version after version has continuously added to Windows functionality and "extra".
The change of direction is appreciable.
Microsoft is right: the operating system is increasingly losing importance, and with it the software.
When Google launched Chrome on the network, I was one of those who supported the theory that was Google’s first step to compete with Windows.
Many rightly point out that a browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it is an indispensable element for hardware and software to communicate.
Do the same function as your wife or husband when you have something to say to your mother-in-law.
It is true.
It will never disappear, but it is necessary to think of the "death" of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but relative.
What Ballmer said this week confirms this idea.
People pay less and less attention to the operating system, and more and more to the web browser.
You take the computer just to start Explorer or Firefox – or Chrome – and daily we spend more time browsing the web than in a remote window environment.
What is half of the operating system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 should be less, much less than Vista.
Less heavy, less overloaded, less complex.
Microsoft is more interested in integrating its online services so that they are a valid alternative to Google.
They have a desperate need for it, in fact, and I will give a small example here.
I took the photo in this post in one of the recreational premises for Microsoft employees in Redmond earlier this month.
On the beverage machine a sign asks them to use their own search tool - "Your search.Our future".
In 2006, an independent study concluded that 66% of Microsoft employees use Google to do online searches.
Last week, a delay in the development of the new version of Windows Mobile 7 was confirmed.
It will not be launched in the early months of 2009, but probably at the end of the year, if not even in 2010.
Microsoft will try to launch Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
After all, the mobile phone is becoming more and more a computer.
But the delay, with Android and iPhone already on the market, is punitive.
The Fabulous Marcel
Pablo Picasso carried it to the Costa Azul, Leonardo di Caprio shone in Edward Zwick's "Diamante de sangre", as well as Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's "Il Padrino" as well as being part of the typical gay parish uniform.
And if we try to enumerate the appearances of the stars, we can recall the image of the forced with sharp cheeks lifting weights in the walking circus.
It is, in essence, the typical men’s shirt, with the inside of cotton, stitched and without sleeves.
It is the 'tank', as the Anglo-speakers call it, although the Belgian Fabuleux Marcel stands out above all of them.
The "Marcel" stands out over the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive stamp and for the small Belgian flag (nearly recognizable), which the most emblematic models of the T-shirt carry as a detail on the neck.
The "Marcel" stands out over the others for the high quality of cotton, for its unisex cut, for its distinctive stamp and for the small Belgian flag (nearly recognizable), which the most iconic shirts wear as a detail on the neck.
And be careful, because the production of the Belgian company is not just about the famous "tank".
It also includes college flips, retro boxers, cashmere cardigan, cotton pants, marinara shirts, baby dolls, mini shorts...
Clothes designed to be comfortable.
And it is a pity to use them as underwear.
They are too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, the candidate doesn't bother me"
The great resemblance to her sister did not prevent her from developing her personality.
Monica Cruz is small, but full of vitality.
Currently, the Cruz sisters have taken their new business in the fashion field very seriously.
For Monica, they are much more than beautiful girls and celebrities who borrow their name.
She was in Paris for the promotion that the signature Mango made of its new headquarters, as well as the presentation of the most important awards that the Spanish fashion house sponsors.
He is warm and shy, conquering you quickly.
Tell us what you do in Paris.
I came here to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for the fall-winter season of Mango, as well as to participate in the presentation of the second edition of the 'Mango Fashion Awards' and the dinner at the Opera in honor of Valentine.
Let’s say, a very intense day, but at the same time, exciting.
What are the elements of your new collection for Mango in this fourth season of work for the Spanish house?
Both my sister and I love the cinema of the 1950s and 1960s, from here we get a lot of inspiration.
Then, I love to get lost in the city and watch how women dress, combine and mix their clothes.
Dancer, actress and stylist, you are a very versatile woman, right?
I think yes, although in the end, everything converges and there are a lot of things in common.
I, as a child, loved clothes; I wanted to go to my grandmother’s house to wander in my aunt’s closet and see her clothes.
It was a bomb, even better than going to the playground.
Then, once a dancer, I always paid a lot of attention to dressing.
It is known that dancers like to have their own style to go to class and to essay, to look in the mirror and feel good.
And in the role of an actress, when they give you the wardrobe is the moment when you really meet the character.
So everything goes together, yes, with a lot of respect for stylists and professionalism.
Not long ago, you turned 30 years old, you entered a crisis?
But not .
Never felt better, I like the idea of the 30s.
I find that at that age women are mature and have a good experience to enjoy life by making fewer mistakes.
The biological clock doesn’t scare me.
I did the things I wanted since I was a kid and that gave me a lot of inner happiness.
Do you want to be a mother, or not?
Of course, I know that I will be a mother because my own body asks for it and I also want to be a young mother, I don’t want to miss that.
As for the candidate, I’m not too worried.
What I will do is give my son a lot of happiness and raise him with a lot of love.
As for the cinema, you are waiting for several films shot last year to appear in the halls.
It’s so, and I want to get out.
As a woman who comes from the theatre, I am very impatient and anxious, I would like everything immediately and clearly, but it can’t always be so.
I want to release "La última hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo".
Let’s see if you like it.
A few days ago you debuted on the sidewalk with Naomi Campbell, right?
Do not say so.
It wasn’t that I was on the sidewalk as a model.
Simply Naomi Campbell, whom I’ve known for a long time, called to invite me to go to London to attend a charity parade for her organization “Women for a Better World” and the clothes we showed – I brought two pieces of our collection for Mango – were auctioned to raise funds for this Naomi’s NGO.
People don’t know this tender side of Naomi.
So many things are said about her, that I, who have known her for a long time, can confirm that they are not so true.
In addition, I find myself with this good part in which you are involved.
He asked me to parade for a noble cause, but if he had asked me to do the pine, I would have done the same.
If it’s to help the women of the third world, you can’t pull back.
Drivers with recurrent alcoholism will have to install the "alcolock"
The Ministry of Internal Affairs requires drivers with three administrative penalties for excessive level of alcohol in the blood, install in their car the system that prevents the driving of the vehicle in the state of drunkenness or if it does not blow in the appropriate device.
The measure was announced last June and is already included in the annual report of the General Prosecutor’s Office, according to which it will be a one-year pilot project.
The purpose of this project is the reintegration of the driver, since he will have to attend a rehabilitation course on the road.
In addition to the General Prosecutor’s Office for Road Safety, the General Directorate of Traffic (DGT) and the Foundation Institute of Technology for Automotive Safety (FITSA) will participate in this initiative.
According to statistics, between 30% and 75% of drivers who have been more than once for drunk driving then return to driving.
Alcolock would avoid this, because it is a system connected to the vehicle that measures the rate of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from getting started if the driver does not blow, or when a higher alcohol concentration than permitted is detected.
The cost is more than 1,000 euros and would be borne by the penalty.
In this regard, a study conducted in the United States in 2007 showed that vehicles equipped with such devices reduce offenses committed during the first year of introduction by up to 65%.
And in Spain it is estimated that it could save the lives of 115 people a year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to curb such behaviors before they become criminal offences.
And to facilitate its development, since the legal reform can be carried out by ordinary means, and, undoubtedly, the reform necessary for the criminal procedure would require an organic law.
The device, however, is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial solution, although it has already been introduced experimentally in some industrial and public vehicles.
Just tomorrow, the Congress of Deputies will vote on a PSOE initiative that proposes to install this system in school buses, as has already been done in France.
In Mexico, and without “peep-toes”
With British punctuality, at 17.40, according to the schedule, the Spanish plane in which the princes of Asturias traveled landed in the presidential hangar at the Benito Juárez airport in Mexico City.
The sun was sinking but the rays still forced him to use his hand as a mirror to see the real couple descend from the plane.
At the foot of the ladder, the Spanish ambassador and the other authorities.
A few hours earlier I had asked a taxi driver, on the road, if he knew that the Spanish princes were about to visit the city to formalize an official trip.
- Ah, very well, so you won't be able to go to the airport to load people at that time ... You're from here or ...
“No, no sir, you’re Spanish, but you’ve lived here for a couple of years.
Oh, very well...
The Mexican press, on the other hand, knows very well who the princes of Asturias are and the importance of travel.
Many are waiting in the airport hangar crushed by the red carpet and the military cord composed of 27 naval soldiers offering the honorary greeting.
The prince appears smiling, dressed in marine blue, and she, the princess, cheeks to the wind, very sober, does not use her usual "peep-toes," they her that Mexico City threatened bad weather.
They give photographers a smile and a brief stop before passing through the room where the official team is waiting for them.
At the door of the hotel where they stay, one of the four largest in the city, they are awaited by a spirited Mexican television reporter.
The best prize offered by Fashion
There is probably no more suitable place in the world to present a fashion award than Paris and there is probably no more exquisite and bont vivan designer than Valentino.
Mango has just presented the second edition of the El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards, to promote the international promotion of new talent in the fashion field.
It offers a prize of 300,000 euros.
Yesterday, Sandrina Fasoli, the Belgian winner of the first edition, was looking at her drawings in the Mango showcase at Boulevard Haussmann No. 54 in Paris and almost crying out of emotion.
In addition, it is the company’s second largest store in Europe and has just opened with 1,335 square meters of extension.
The first is in London.
The many events, coupled with the desire to delight the designer Valentino who presided over the jury of the contest, began with a luxury dinner at the Opéra Garnier in Paris.
With the proximity of Chagal’s most exquisite tiles, the presidential gala table prepared by Mango, was even more spectacular.
Born, with a broken heart and making necessarily virtue, due to the recent death of her brother, she wore a House dress and some ELAH accessories to take the breath away and to her son’s arm Luis – a boy almost two meters tall – accompanied Valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner.
Andik, the owner and lord of Mango, made the honors of the house and of the knight as he ended, along with Baron Rotchil, without a jacket, because they both had handed it over to two ladies.
Monica Cruz, who ran the store in pants and shirt – drawn by her hand – turned for dinner, wearing a very sensual long black dress and was excited during the night walk accompanied by Goya Toledo inside the opera, when they showed us the hall for ballet essays and she, recalling other times, grabbed a bar and sketched a "great plie".
Inés Sastre did not stop for a walk in the palace premises, but had first shown us the photos of her son on the cell phone.
The next day we rejoiced at the presence of Olivier Martinez – another boy who moves on a motorcycle – and John Travolta, who had arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris, with his linen, his towels and having made sure in advance that there were no odors in his room.
Under the starry sky of Paris.
Oh there, there is life.
1001, the anti-stress number
There are not 1,000 but 1,000 and one way to forget the chaotic and hectic everyday life.
And as if that wasn’t enough, they’re all gathered in a book that will bring relaxation to the bookstores on September 30.
The alarm clock is almost a punishment when it whispers every morning at 7am, but it’s even worse to imagine being involved in the frenetic rhythm dictated by modern life.
The office is called tension and the computer back pain.
Stress is the evil of the 21st century.
However, there are no one or two methods to combat daily exhaustion and the fatigue of getting rid of the world of work.
No, this number is no more and no less than 1001.
Beyond yoga positions, classical massage or “spa” treatments, Susannah Marriott collects in the pages of her book, a whole “menu” of options tailored to each’s taste and time.
The anti-stress work is titled “1001 Ways to Relax” and its calm will reach bookstores thanks to the publisher Pearson Alhambra and DK.
If someone thinks it’s not possible to gain calm in areas like work or personal relationships, this “manual” disproves that belief.
In addition, it suggests alternative solutions, such as being in contact with nature, or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If adrenaline doesn’t already flow into your veins to regain balance in your body and stress has become a problem, it’s time to sit on the couch, turn off your mind and focus on reading.
Speaking in Sleep
Some children talk at night.
I’m not referring to those who wake up very upset to tell us something that happened to them the day before, but to those children who talk while they are asleep.
The first time it happens, at most you get a scare, but it doesn’t really matter.
This is a benign sleep disturbance called somnilochia.
It occurs with a certain frequency, especially in children and adolescents.
Certainly, most of you have been told that you had spoken in your sleep.
This phenomenon can occur very sporadically (once in a lifetime, for example, associated with an episode of high fever) or with a greater regularity (every day, once a week, once a month ...), the next day the child no longer remembers anything.
There is no single reason that can explain this phenomenon.
Sometimes they are episodes linked to other sleep disorders such as nightmares, night fears, night enuresis, or sleeping, but it is not necessarily so.
As mentioned above, it can be associated with stages of very high fever, stressful situations or over-excitation.
However, this is still a little studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears is also extremely variable.
It can happen that the person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice, with loose words, almost in a whisper, or that the opposite happens (crying, screaming, long speeches ...).
In cases where the event is intense, it would be advisable to observe the child and eventually consult a specialist to check if there is any issue that is generating an abnormal state of anxiety as a outflow to the situation.
We said that this is a benign alteration so there is no treatment unless it is associated with other sleep disorders that can be treated (for example, if coupled with insomnia or stressful situation).
What can be done, however, is to consider a number of very simple preventive measures such as:
Try not to exaggerate the baby before he goes to bed.
Offer quiet games and avoid TV shows or series that arouse fear or suggest violence.
With very nervous children for whom it is tired to relax, you can use relaxation techniques to help them gain some inner calm.
This will allow the child to sleep more quietly.
Once the somniloquis appear try to stay calm.
Remember that they are harmless to the baby and that the next day he will not remember anything about what happened.
Useful advice
Do not wake him.
It is useless, because he is not aware of what is happening, and you would interrupt his sleep.
Although he’s talking, he’s sleeping and so he’s resting.
Remember that if it appears very anxious and the episodes have a certain frequency it is best to consult a doctor or check where such a great anxiety in the child comes from.
If you understand what he says (which is not the most common situation), don’t fall into the temptation to question him for information.
You will get nothing, because he is asleep and therefore unconscious to organize his thought.
In addition, you are able to hear what he says but not to see what he is dreaming to say, so you need to pay much attention to the interpretation of the information and the conclusions it may lead to.
Never tell your child that you might ask him questions during the night to know his secrets.
Not even a joke.
This kind of thing causes great anxiety.
In short, don’t worry, it’s nothing serious, it’s an episode that only lasts a few minutes.
Illhaeusern finally
The Illhaeusern finally found their way home after a long unsuccessful period.
Without playing a formidable game, the Yellow-black created the most networking opportunities, turning one into the game’s victory.
The pace was not very sustained during this meeting in which the attackers expressed themselves to fatigue.
After a first attempt by the host team captain Kauffmann who hit the seventh with a long-range shot, the Illhaeusern began to get the best and one after the other provoked the defense of the Dannemarie, Fonderflick from the far, then Hirn high, Romain at the top and again Diebold.
In the first half of the year, the company will be able to provide a full-fledged service to the customers of the company.
The beginning of the second half was decisive with two initial occasions signed Riahi and Temporale for the Dannemarie, and immediately after Marais' first net for the well-positioned Illhaeusern, he recaptured a ball rejected on a first attempt by Diebold (53').
But the gunman of the Illhaeusern will not be able to taste his happiness for a long time and will be expelled a dozen minutes later leaving his teammates in numerical inferiority.
If you are not aware of this, you will be able to find out what you are looking for and what you are looking for, and what you are looking for.
Sarkozy meets angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will stop in Britain.
In the face of the demonstration of fishermen who on Monday brutally blocked access to several Breton and Normandy ports, the President of the Republic decided to go to the port of Guilvinec, in the department of Finistère, on Tuesday morning, to enchant its representatives.
The latter promised to welcome him "with a constructive spirit" and hope that "he will present himself with concrete proposals".
This presidential visit takes place in conjunction with the general assembly of the "crisis committee", created by the Breton fishermen in order to take measures to cope with the rising price of diesel, which reached its record with an average of more than 1.14 euros per liter.
David Martinon, a spokesman for the Elysée, said the president would “discuss with them possible solutions to help companies regain competitiveness and ensure seamen’s working conditions and wages.”
Fishermen are waiting for Nicolas Sarkozy.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out “shallow operations” in Morbihan and Calvados, causing 10 km of traffic jams.
The port of Quiberon was also blocked, but connections to Belle-île were not interrupted.
On the Quiberon Peninsula, a road block was implemented.
On Monday, sailors already demonstrated their determination by burning tires and pallets in front of fuel warehouses in the ports of Brest and Lorient as they took foot on demonstrations in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement extended to the ports of the Atlantic coast and the Mancha, such as Sables d'Olonne, in the Vendée, where the fishing vessels remained at the moor, or to Havre, where about twenty boats prevented the movement of commercial vessels.
Fishermen from La Turballe et del Croisic, near the Atlantic Loire, broke the blockade of the well-known Total refinery in Donges.
In Boulogne-sur-Mer they decided to wait for the meeting that will be held on Wednesday at the ministry to decide on possible actions.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" will decide on Tuesday on the future actions of the movement and the possible participation in the meeting scheduled at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by officials of the National Fisheries Committee, which has not supported the movement.
“The strike will continue” as “fishermen will not give in” and “do not intend to move to Paris,” announced, for example, Liliane Cariou, chairman of the Lorient Fisheries Committee.
Professional fishermen, who do not pay diesel taxes, currently pay around 50 cents per litre, but estimate that a boat’s yield limit will only be reached with a diesel less than 0.30 euros per litre.
Paul Newman the Magnificent
Butch Cassidy has died of cancer at the age of 83 in his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes greeted film legend and committed actor Paul Newman, who passed away at the age of 83.
Embraer keeps its 2008 delivery forecast
The aircraft manufacturer has received 215 deliveries this year, despite the threats of recession on the global economy.
Embraer, the world’s fourth company in the industry,ins its forecast for delivery in 2008 with the delivery of 215 aircraft, confirmed its president Fredrico Fleury Curado.
During the first half, it delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian company relies heavily on the Chinese market, especially for aircraft of the range between 30 and 120 seats.
So far, Embraer has delivered 41 aircraft to Chinese customers in eight years.
AIG will sell more than 15% of its operations
The insurance company American International Group, resumed by U.S. monetary authorities, would give up more than 15% of its assets in order to repay the $85 billion loan, according to the Sunday issue of the Financial Times.
AIG is ready to consider the sale of much of its business, as well as the sale of life insurance branches to the international market and the United States, the newspaper said on the basis of more than authoritative sources.
The board of directors of the AIG met on Sunday night to consider possible deliveries, according to the FT.
There was no confirmation from the AIG.
The assets AIG intends to sell include the airline leasing subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in Transatlantic Holdings as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, the FT added.
No final decision has been made regarding these deliveries, the FT continues.
AIG must quickly find liquidity in order to repay the $85 billion loan granted by the Federal Reserve, at the cost of seeing U.S. authorities seize 80% of its capital.
Paris: History of Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange accused of a historic collapse on Monday, after the House of Representatives voted against Paulson’s plan to save financial institutions: the Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented drop, approaching 800 points, and the Nasdaq lost 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Media (DJIA) ended at 10.365.45, down 777.68 points.
In terms of points, the worst loss in its history (684.81 points) greater than that of September 17, 2001, the day of the reopening of the stock exchanges following the terrorist attacks of September 11.
The Nasdaq, the index of major technology securities, lost 199,61 points closing at 1.983,73 and the expanded Standard & Poor's 500 index lost 8.81% (or 106,85 points) closing at 1.106,55, according to the final closing figures.
Demoralized at the beginning of the session, Wall Street has collapsed after the unexpected rejection of the bank rescue plan, intended to restore stability to the markets.
With 228 votes against and 205 in favour, representatives rejected funding requested by Treasury Minister Henry Paulson.
Two out of three Republicans rejected the plan.
“It’s a negative signal sent to the market that Congress is unable to adopt a plan,” said Lindsey Piegza of FTN Financial.
“All this indicates how much the market counted on the project,” he added, fearing that in a few days it could already be “too late” to adopt one.
“If the project was actually dying (...) then the witness would be quickly passed to the Fed – the Federal Reserve – and other central banks to resolve the crisis, which would further limit credit conditions,” said Brian Bethune, head of finance and economics at Global Insight.
“Every day that passes leads to the collapse of a financial institution” in the United States, Piegza said.
Following Friday’s Washington Mutual bankruptcy, authorities arranged the purchase of Wachovia’s banking assets by rival Citygroup.
In Europe, the crisis has accelerated sharply, calling for emergency intervention in favor of the banks of the UK, the Benelux, Iceland and Germany, a sign that the markets are "not just facing an American crisis, but a global crisis," added the analyst at FTN Financial.
The bond market has risen sharply.
The yield of 10-year Treasury Bonds declined to 3,632%, compared to 3,827% on Friday evening, while that with a 30-year expiration is to 4,161%, compared to 4,357% on the day before.
Obama's first television duel
After the first Friday debate between the two White House candidates, here’s a second to know who, between John McCain and Barack Obama, was the winner.
Not surprisingly, the headquarters of the Republican and Democratic campaigns proclaimed their respective victory in the television duel, followed by a third of American families.
Political scientist David Gergen believes that John McCain’s performance, though well-deserved, has not been brilliant enough to allow him to curb the drop in polls five weeks after the presidential election.
The Gallup Institute, whose poll released on Saturday gave Obama a five-point advantage (49% versus 44% for McCain), shows that the Democrat had the best.
An instant poll conducted by CbsNews on a sample of indecisive voters found that 39% of them believe Obama is the winner, while 25% point to McCain.
A great performance from his listmate Joe Biden, expected during the first and only debate with rival Sarah Palin, is expected to confirm Obama's advantage on Thursday.
Underestimating it would be a mistake.
He has a good intuition," Bill Clinton warned this weekend.
Seventy-year-old McCain has never stopped promoting his undeniable foreign policy experience, highlighting the opponent's "naivety" with regard to the topics addressed during the first face-to-face meeting.
“Senator Obama doesn’t seem to understand that...” he has often stated on multiple occasions.
“I don’t think Sen. Obama has the experience and skills to become president,” he said.
This has been a continuous target for the Republican television campaign.
Obama, for his part, stressed that his election would represent a new future.
Without extending, it proved concise and accurate.
He promoted his willingness to make the right decisions and his intention to restore the image of the United States on the world stage.
“McCain never understood, unlike Obama,” he said in a Democratic spot this weekend, blaming the Republican for not taking the necessary measures to cope with the impact of the financial crisis on the American people.
During the ninety minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you, Obama denounced yesterday, in front of 20,000 people gathered in North Carolina, under a blowing rain, for an election meeting.
He did not even pronounce the words "middle class" or "workers".The financial crisis goes in favor of Obama, considered by Americans as the most suitable person to save the economy on the edge of the precipice.
“The next week could represent a decisive turning point,” said influential Democratic Senator Charles Schumer.
Democratic representative Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama’s insight in economic matters to what Clinton demonstrated during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current collapse “is the final verdict after eight years of bad economic policy adopted by George Bush and backed by Senator McCain.”
Reaffirming his intention to reduce taxes for 95% of Americans despite Wall Street shocks, the Illinois senator also mentioned among his priorities the achievement of an energy independence of the country through the promotion of renewable energies and the implementation of a health insurance system.
McCain, for his part, would build a fleet of 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
With caution, the two candidates dismissed the questions focused on the $700 billion ($470 billion) financial bailout plan adopted last night by Congress and extremely unpopular.
In Minsk, “Did you not notice that there were elections?”
Young people and opponents demonstrated on Sunday night in the main square of the Belarusian capital to challenge the results of the legislative elections in advance.
Some hundreds of Belarusians gathered on Sunday after the closure of polling stations in Minsk's central square to protest the fraudulent character of the legislative elections.
While the results were still awaited, many young people had come to protest against the power of President Alexander Lukashenko: "the dictator, resign."
Some confess that they have not even voted: “For what? they will do what they want, with my vote,” says one boy.
They do not believe that that regime that has made a good figure in front of foreign observers with the aim of resuming dialogue with the European Union is ready to undertake a democratic turnaround.
The sanctions, including the visa ban for 40 Belarusian executives and the freezing of assets, could be lifted if these elections were considered legitimate by observers.
But it did not, according to the opposition.
“We were removed from the election committees and our observers were not allowed to participate in the voting process,” Yuri Potemkine, a spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a heterogeneous alliance of twelve parties, complained.
“It’s a change of facade,” said Alexandre Milinkievitch, a former opposition candidate for the 2006 presidential election and leader of the pro-European movement, “because what matters is who counts the cards and in this case the executive.
If opposition members enter parliament, it is because they have been appointed, not elected.
But their entry into parliament can involve a television space, regional meetings and bills.”
The opposition therefore has the duty to enter the political game because "it needs to start a dialogue with the European Union.
Because if our economy, which is heavily indebted to Russia, goes into crisis, and we do not carry out any reforms, we risk becoming a Russian protectorate.
We want to be independent.”
The opposition is concerned that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe that followed the election process will recognize the validity of the vote.
It stresses that the participation rates seem too high, and that the generalization of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has given rise to all kinds of manipulation.
“Have you not noticed that there were elections? asks Social Democratic leader Alexandre Kozouline, one of the last two political prisoners released this year in August.
There was no one in the polling stations.
And there will be a maximum of five opposition deputies in parliament, the most convenient to power."
The silence of the night falls on the Square of October.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Electoral Commission delight in their success.
Blood is Safe Again
Héma-Québec celebrated its 10th anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Decary, had every reason to rejoice, as Héma-Québec has become one of the safest and most effective blood suppliers in the world.
And most importantly, it has regained public confidence, seriously shaken by the infected blood scandal in the years between 1980 and 1990.
As we know, national blood reserves managed by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Service were infected with acquired immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C in the 1980s.
In the face of such a tragedy and the protests of the population, the Government of Canada conducted in February 1994 a public investigation, directed by Judge Horace Krever, aimed at shed light on the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to spread recommendations to prevent a reoccurrence of a similar disaster.
While Judge Krever was delaying to draw up a report, some provinces set up a committee to design a new blood management system in Canada.
In Québec, this mandate was executed by the Gélineau Committee.
Following the Gélineau et Krever reports, two suppliers were created in Canada: Héma-Québec to supply Québec and the Société canadienne du sang (Canadian Blood Society) for all the other provinces and two territories.
In 1998, when Héma-Québec started its business, only 38% of people said they still had confidence in the Québec donation system, Dr. Décary recalls.
The situation was mortificating.
Thanks to continued efforts to improve the safety of blood sampling and field research over the following years, we have regained public confidence,” she explains before stating proudly that at the beginning of 2008, about 94% of Québec’s population now had confidence in Héma-Québec.
Dr. Décary, however, is convinced that “confidence is something extremely fragile.”
Since its creation on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
At the time, there were numerous cases in Europe of the human variant of the mad cow, a new manifestation of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, says the one who has been in the presidency since 1998, the year of its foundation.
"And we didn't know absolutely whether that disease could be transmitted through infected blood.
It was therefore based on one of the main recommendations of the Krever and Gélinau reports, according to which when you have doubts and could get a serious illness, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease that manifests with a degeneration of the brain that inevitably leads to death, take exclusion measures.
In April 1999, blood was rejected from those who had spent more than a month in the UK since 1980.
Now, for a few years, it has been shown that without a doubt this disease is transmitted through infected blood.
This episode has shown us that it makes sense to apply the precautionary principle.”
In 1999, a much more efficient technique for the detection of HIV appeared on the market: the nucleic acid tests (TAN) that allow to recognize directly in the blood of donors the presence of the virus and not that of antibodies against it, on which the tests used until then were based.
The TANs have allowed to reduce the window period, that is, from the moment the person contracted the disease to the one in which the first viruses can be detected in the blood thanks to our techniques, explains the specialist.
This period could be reduced to less than one week.
The risk of ignoring the presence of infected donors and not being able to identify them has thus been greatly reduced.
These improvements have significantly reduced the risk of contracting AIDS with a blood transfusion.
Today, one in 12 million people are at risk of receiving HIV-infected blood.
“In other words, this means that 12 million blood samples will need to be distributed before someone gets infected with the HIV virus.
Since Héma-Québec distributes between 400,000 and 500,000 blood samples each year, it will take more than 24 years before a transmitted HIV case is detected.
I believe that today one can feel safe in receiving or prescribing a blood transfusion to recover health, says the head of management of Héma-Québec.
“Our challenge for the next decade is to maintain the safety of our products.
You never know which pathogen will emerge in the system.
Not later than a year ago, the Chikungunya virus appeared on the island of Réunion, which, like the West Nile virus, is transmitted in the blood by an insect.
It is necessary to be constantly vigilant,” continues Dr. Décary before emphasizing that in addition to having safe resources, Héma-Québec must also provide sufficient resources.
“The needs are increasing as the population ages.
As cancer treatments are more aggressive, patients often need a supply of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing population also has consequences for the number of donors that on average make up only 3% of Quebec’s accepted donors.”
All healthy people who have reached the age of 18 and meet the eligibility criteria can however donate blood every 56 days, or six times a year.
On average, 14% of people who offer as donors are not accepted, because they are affected by AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they have traveled to a country where the latter is widespread, they will be rejected for a period of one year.
“With this 3% we manage to maintain an inventory capable of meeting the needs of hospitals.
Cases of shortage are very rare.
But members of this group of donors need to be renewed as they get older and can no longer make donations.
It is now difficult to convince people to donate blood, but most importantly to hold them back and to encourage them to become regular donors.
Nowadays life is so busy that you can hardly have an hour to donate blood,” says Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec not only distributes blood samples, but also human tissues, including bone transplants, heart valves, eye balloons, and skin that is used almost exclusively for severe burns.
These tissues are analyzed, processed and frozen before being deposited at the Héma-Québec that runs the only public umbilical cord blood bank in Québec.
In the umbilical cord, which was once considered a biomedical waste, abundant blood rich in stem cells that can be used to cure serious diseases, such as leukemia.
“We celebrated, a few weeks ago, the placement in the bank of our thousandth sample of cord blood and we plan to collect more than a thousand each year.
We should start proposing them for transplants at the beginning of next year,” says Dr. Décary, who describes this practice as very popular.
“Many mothers are disappointed that they cannot have access to it,” as Héma-Québec does not have the means to offer this complex and expensive program in all the hospitals in Québec.
Football - The Impact in the Semifinal
The Impact Montréal qualified for the semi-finals of the Serie A eliminations, winning 3-1 against the Seattle Sounders yesterday, during a second decisive quarter-final game at Stadio Saputo.
This is the first time that we have been able to get to know what we have to do.
After a first time without goals on both sides, David Testo and Rocco Placentino scored the next sets for Montreal.
For the Sounders, Roger Levesque was ready to mark Matt Jordan.
Remember that in the first match on Friday, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex, in Tukwila, on the outskirts of Seattle.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps of Vancouver in the semi-final.
Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thundler overcame a first 3-1 in the return match by winning 4-3, but the Whitecaps will still participate in the semi-final.
The Impact will face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but further details will be confirmed in the day.
In short - Kovalev's Decisive Network
The Canadian and his axes are ready to start the season again.
The trio formed by Alex Kovalev, Tomas Plekanec and Andrei Kostitsyn animated the offensive stage of play by winning 3-2 against the Panthers, Florida, last night at the Bell Center.
Kostitsyn, the star of the first match, scored a goal, made two passes, and collected a pass to victory, in the fourth of the Habs’ preparatory games.
Decisive for the victory was the only network signed Kovalev.
“I’m not ready yet,” the Russians warned.
I need another game to feel comfortable.”
“He tried to crash in the first half,” said Guy Carbonneau.
I think he appreciated the outcome of the game.
There was a great applause.”
Charest points to the north
The prime minister does not rule out the possibility of elections before the end of the year.
After concluding the general council of the Liberal Party, Jean Charest went yesterday to Jean-Talon, Québec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), tries to be elected in the partial elections today.
“Elarging the boundaries of our last great northern border”: this is Jean Charest’s long-term ambition, presented yesterday in Levis, with instruments with a strong visual impact, at the general council of the Liberal Party of Quebec.
Behind him, during his speech, the projection of a sort of "imaging mill".
On three maxi screens, they confused spectacular negatives of hydroelectric dams, mining crops, images of Quebec seen with "Google Maps", maps, etc.
A lot like in a full election campaign.
During the press conference, by the way, the prime minister refused to rule out the opening of autumn elections, although he noted that he was very busy.
The "Northern Plan" is the fourth point of a "project" that the prime minister claims to have for Quebec, that of a "new economic space", which includes a first agreement with France on labor, a second agreement between Canada and Europe and other agreements with Ontario.
Often named in the prime minister’s most recent speeches, the opening of the North – the northern territory to the 49th parallel – had never been the subject of a presentation.
The prime minister, however, only explained why the North would be "a jewel with immense potential", but did not comment on timelines or investment quotas, as well as not explained what will be the precise priorities in the implementation of future projects.
At the most, he has merely pointed out what he thinks deserves a priority position: hydroelectricity, forests, but above all the mining sector, which following the growth of emerging countries and the reconstruction of public infrastructure has experienced several improvements.
According to the list drawn up by Charest, the North contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds."
That “territory twice as large as France” is here, it is Quebec.
Not only is he here, but he is inherent in us,” he insisted, as if he wanted to appeal to a national founder myth.
The foundations of Quebec are rooted in its relationship with the North, he stressed: the gold fever in Abitibi, the national engineering, the Bay of James.
“It’s up to us, it’s our future,” he added, after a theatrical break to contemplate the huge picture behind him.
The north, 70 percent of Quebec’s territory, includes a portion of the Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the prime minister said during a press conference.
This is a position traditionallyined by all governments.
There is a border line on which no agreement has been in place for a long time, and when the opportunity comes, I will reiterate that position on behalf of the government," he said.
In addition, "considering climate change, we need to re-evaluate the North," he said, speaking of the northwest passage, which will be open for the whole year due to the melting of the ice.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister considers that occupying the territory is a duty.”
What about the inhabitants of the place, the First Nations and the Inuit?
The prime minister said the Quebec government would be very careful about this and that the project would meet their interests, especially those of young people.
Two former ministers from different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (former MP of the PQ d’Ungava), have already launched the consultation of about thirty communities.
An interministerial committee chaired by Benoît Pelletier and in which Julie Boulet (Transport and Natural Resources) holds an important position has begun work.
The prime minister does not rule out a major meeting, "not necessarily a summit," but a time when "common visions will be provided."
The development of the North would otherwise adhere to the principles of sustainable development.
The Northern Plan will be “coordinated, orderly and respectful of the environment,” he said.
Jean Charest described this “project” as a continuum with that of the liberal prime ministers who preceded it.
“Like the liberals who preceded us, we know how to stand out in turning challenges into new opportunities for growth and development.”
This was, by the way, one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began Friday with a great cocktail in honor of the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage’s arrival at the head of the party.
One of the resolutions adopted proposes to rename the Beauharnois plant to Diga Adélard-Godbout.
“From Godbout, the creator of Hydro-Québec, to Lesage who nationalized hydroelectricity, to Bourassa, the creator of James Bay, our party has always been able to shape the future,” said Jean Charest.
During the press conference, he resorted to another reference, conservative this time, the "Roads to the North" program by John Diefenbaker, Prime Minister from 1957 to 1963.
Addressing the project related to Eastmain1a-Ruper's hydroelectric dam, Charest said its commissioning was scheduled for 2012.
"All this remains between us, but I feel that we will do it," he confessed to his militants, provoking applause.
In fact, the prime minister, who in April said there would be no elections in 2008 and probably not even in 2009, did not rule out the possibility of starting a poll in autumn, which could happen in accordance with the law.
He emphasizes that he is very engaged, in a federal council mission in China and at the Quebec-New York summit.
The general council of the weekend provided the liberal leader with a platform for nationalist resolutions, in particular of the "constitutional aspirations" that passed smoothly like oil: the PLQ mainly demands the recognition of the "specificity of Quebec" in the Constitution.
He also hopes that Quebec will appoint members of the Canadian Broadcasting and Telecommunications Council and that the latter will have a veto on decisions taken in Quebec.
As for the opposition, the draft of the Northern Plan was welcomed skeptically.
The PQ leader, Pauline Marois, sprinkled the Northern Quebec Development Policy launched by the Landry government in 2001.
According to her, the liberal government, which came to power in 2003, would not respect its application.
If he did, "we would have made progress today," Marois commented alongside Jean-Talon candidate Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ stated that it supports the adoption of the Northern Plan by the government.
"What we hope is that all this will not be perceived simply as a show," said leader Sébastien Proulx, Mario Dumont's replacement, returning from his vacation today.
Title: A Disgraceful Country
It was Vic Toews, the former Harper Cabinet Justice Minister, who allowed himself to declare, last summer, that Louise Arbor was a “shame” for Canada.
To dishonor in this way a woman who has fought unceasingly for justice and who deserves all our admiration says a lot about both the prime minister’s surroundings and Stephen Harper himself.
Here we are facing a government that is the only of all the Western countries involved that has not repatriated a citizen detained in the Guantanamo concentration camp.
A government that doesn’t take into account the fact that Omar Khadr was just a teenager at the time of the accusations.
The only government that, despite signing the Geneva Convention, denies its promise and drops a child-soldat in inhumane conditions.
The only one who relies on a parody of justice to establish the guilt of the accused.
We remind, for information, that UNICEF, Amnesty International and the Canadian Bar Association, in particular, are calling for Omar Khadraffin’s return so that he can be subjected to a regular trial in Canada.
It is the same government that closes its eyes to torture: it does not care that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed, forever, after so many years of oppression.
We don’t realize it yet, but we’re witnessing an insidious erosion of our rights, freedom and “democracy,” a word that Harper doesn’t stop pronouncing and sounds so nonsensical on his lips.
Here we have come to the moment when there is no more morality: one can abuse, torture, arbitrarily imprison a Canadian citizen at the discretion of a leader of government so far a minority (see what will happen after October 14 ...).
Many voters believe that a party that preaches virtue, respect for law and order represents salvation: they do not see that this government has given up what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
Here is the shame, Mr Toews, in giving up all this, and nowhere else.
The Orwell Discourse of Barrick Gold
In the September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from M. Patrick J. Garver, vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
Pursuing an Orwellian logic, the latter claims that the world’s largest gold company has filed a six-million-dollar defamation lawsuit against three authors and a small publishing house shattered with the intention of initiating a “transparent public debate.”
If it is true that judges are independent and impartial, it is not the truth that they judge, especially in the case of a defamation lawsuit, but the law.
Not surprisingly, this substantial difference is completely hidden by Garver.
Because for Barrick Gold, the best way to conduct a public debate would be to ruin anyone who dares to hold a position contrary to his.
Regardless of the outcome of the trial, the writers and publisher of the book Canada Black will have to spend a substantial sum of money in order to organize their defence and fight, with decisively unarmed weapons, against an army of lawyers financed by the virtually unfunded pockets of the mining company.
By the way, in these unarmed arms struggles, the tactic is often to ruin the defendant in order to impose a consensual regulation that outrages the opposition as well as frighten anyone who dares to rule again on the matter.
If Barrick Gold had really wanted a public debate, it would have been in front of the public that he should have presented his view of the facts.
Contrary to what happens in many countries where Barrick Gold works, in Canada the debates usually take place through the exchange of opinions and not on a scroll.
It would then have been enough for the society to open its books, its documents, and set up a real debate, through newspapers, media, publications and the funding of teams of independent researchers who could shed light on the issue.
But Barrick Gold doesn’t seem to have too much confidence in the public and badly rejects petitions and letters in support of Black Canada authors.
Per Garver could explain how he can call for a "public debate" when his contempt for that same audience is obvious?
In the vice president’s world, it seems that this word only refers to the scentfully paid lawyers and not the whole of Canadians; here’s a rather narrow view of the concept.
In a democratic system, even denigrants have the right to speak.
What Barrack Gold does not understand – or does not want to understand – is that the public that supports the writers and publishers of Canada Black does so primarily because it rejects the brutal means adopted by the mining company.
This public is ready to listen to Barrick and to judge, but on the basis of civilian exchanges of opinions, and not in the light of what many perceive as a kind of bullying (seeking the "public debate", Barrick Gold has just given the authors of Canada Black an ultimatum urging them to suspend the use of that word...)
Beyond Garver’s surreal discourse, Barrack Gold’s complaint is a direct attack on the freedom of university research and the pursuit of truth, indispensable in any democratic society.
It denies the right to citation of authentic sources and to debate on facts and interpretations, which constitute the very basis of intellectual work.
If in a country like Canada it is impossible to study and discuss issues that are uncomfortable to the richest companies in the world, who can do so?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could do so by following scientific standards like the Black Canada authors do.
He has the right to reply.
For a long time, the university environment, of which we are part, has been able to handle debates and disagreements and resolve conflicts.
The excessive measures of Barrick Gold clearly show that, contrary to its claims, it does not seek a transparent debate at all.
This is at the expense of the academic world, as is the public debate in Canada, and it is time for governments to take measures to limit abusive lawsuits.
Operation – Saving Wall Street – Dialogue between Republicans and Democrats
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, representatives of the Republican and Democratic ranks, finally reached an agreement on the largest bailout plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
The new version of the $700 billion plan, which aims to put a stop to the financial crisis that has plagued Wall Street for months, has yet to be ratified by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for checks on its effective implementation by elected leaders, new mechanisms to guarantee the refund of public money, new provisions to contain the number of homes seized for non-payment, as well as a right to inspect salaries paid to managers of protected companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican Senator Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight, after a two-day marathon of negotiations.
“We’ve made great progress towards an effective market deal,” Bush administration spokesman Henry Paulson said.
“Every decision was made in such a way as to safeguard the American economy and people from the current Wall Street crisis,” he said.
“This is the crucial point: if we hadn’t acted in this way, invaluable distress and disturbance would have been poured out on the daily lives of Americans,” said Republican Judd Gregg.
The conclusion of the negotiations was marked by concerns about the impact of another bankruptcy on investors.
The deadline agreed corresponded to the opening of the markets this morning.
United later to the negotiation, the two U.S. presidential candidates were quite in favour of the agreement, but did not avoid expressing their dissatisfaction with the adoption of extreme solutions.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has added a number of provisions to the agreement, in particular the one that will allow owners to keep their homes and the one inherent in salaries for executives of state-backed companies.
“When you ask taxpayers to take extraordinary measures because of the irresponsibility of others, there is nothing to rejoice about.
But these measures are necessary," he said on the US television screen.
Interviewed on another channel to know if he would vote for the plan, his Republican opponent, John McCain, replied: "I would like to analyze the details, but I hope it does."
"According to what I've read, it's something that we all have to digest and that will allow us to move forward."
The option of non-intervention is simply unacceptable,” he said.
The $700 billion plan aims to buy back with taxpayers’ money the dubious, risky and unsold assets of U.S. financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis due to the burst of a real estate bubble that has led first to the collapse of mortgages, then extended to other more widespread forms of credit securities (PCAAs) and resulted in the freezing of liquidity and banking and financial institutions.
It was a group of Republicans in office that sent the first draft of an agreement to the air last week.
They seem to have come out of that blind street since Democrats accepted that the “toxic” assets of some troubled companies are only being protected by the government, rather than purchased.
In order to meet everyone, a provision was added to Congress that if the government had to face losses over the next five years due to such a program, it could impose new taxes in order to maintain its balance.
The new plan includes a first payment of $250 billion to which another $100 billion may be added if the president considers it necessary.
The payment of 350 billion should be ratified by a further congressional vote.
In exchange for its aid, Washington will get shares in the protected companies that will pay dividends in the event of profit and that it will be able to revend when the waters have calmed down.
As set out in the plan, the federal government will have the opportunity to delay seizure procedures related to real estate loans and to set limits on remuneration and start-up allowances paid to executives of the companies involved.
Starting today, the architects of the plan would like to submit it to the House of Representatives vote, and the Senate vote on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it is not yet certain that their plan will be given a free way.
In fact, yesterday there were several votes against the bill, both in the Republican and Democratic sides.
“Obviously, Washington doesn’t hear you,” said Republican Scott Garrett, a member of the House’s finance committee.
“We have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
Not to take advantage of taxpayers.
Leader of a small group in Congress nicknamed “the caucus of skeptics,” Democratic representative Brad Sherman presents the situation differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
“Four hundred prominent professors of economics, including three Nobel Prize winners, have written to us to say: we ask Congress not to draw hasty conclusions and carefully examine the way to go,” he said.
At the same time, Europe was once again witnessing the global nature of the crisis.
Following an emergency meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the banking group Fortis for €11.2 billion ($16.3 billion).
The intervention of the governments of Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg became necessary when the French bank BNS Paribas announced that it would give up the purchase of its competitor, in full bankruptcy after the loss of €2 billion ($2.9 billion) due to the crisis of risky real estate loans in the United States.
Fortis has 85,000 employees and is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and the 10 largest insurance companies.
“It’s not the lost money,” Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos said.
In exchange, influence and voting rights are gained in banking matters.
It is something that savers and families appreciate now that the times are uncertain.”
During this period, at the other end of the Channel, the British government appears to be on the verge of nationalizing another bank in danger of the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government would take over all of the loans currently ongoing at the bank Bradford and Bringley, including more than 41 billion ($75.5 billion) of real estate loans.
The Spanish bank Santander has announced that it will be in charge of buying the bank’s branches and customer accounts.
Since the beginning of the economic crisis, Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, to undergo a process of nationalization by the British government.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of an Icon Engaged
Beauty with blue eyes was for a long time his ax in the sleeve, for others his weakness.
He was free from the narcissistic mirror, the American actor with the sick smile?
Yes and no.
His discretion, sensitivity and obvious talent would have driven him out of that circle of powerful dedicated to true sacred monsters.
What a constancy!
Paul Newman, who died on Friday at the age of 83, in his ranch in Connecticut, following a lung cancer, remains one of the last icons of American cinema of the past years.
It is not only a monumental of Brando, to whom he resembled and of whom he was for a long time a kind of rival on the screen, more cautious in his play, more fragile, but also a spokesman for freedom and the development of dramatic beliefs.
From mixed couples magical children are often born.
He was born in Ohio in 1925 to a German Jewish father and a Hungarian mother.
From these European roots will be born one of the glorious faces of the American Dream.
A humble ego, the last mark of quality.
Because he recognized a whole country invaded by the safe made man, the war fighter of the Pacific, proud of fighting, who in the early 1950s studied dramatic art at Yale, he later attended the Actor Studio in New York, before triumphing in theatre, television and soon in the cinema.
The same civil rights activist was also the car driver who ranked second at the 24 Hours of Mans in 1979, as well as sex symbol, although part of a model couple since 1958 with actress Joanne Woodward.
With him go the shadow zones of a star reserved, discrete, engaged, allergic to the scandals of the show business, whose mystery will never be able to fully unravel.
An honest man, in the noblest sense of the word.
This weekend the disappearance of Paul Newman has been a dive to the heart for filmmakers, as his great characters populate the black screen of memories.
More than half a century of American cinema in full transformation is repeated through its interpretations.
They confuse in memory the charming cowboy of Butch Cassidy (1969) and that boy unable to desire the fiery wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in The Cat on the Roof that Burns adapted by Tennessee Williams in 1958.
More recently, we recall him in the role of the sensitive Mr. Bridge (1990), troubled by a marriage that did not keep what was promised.
So many other Paul Newman have gone to history.
The boxer Rocky Graziano, criminal, tormented, violent, unforgettable in Someone Loves Me, by Robert Wise, a role intended for James Dean and resumed after his death, which officially launched Newman in 1956.
That cute villain in the excellent Stangata won an Oscar for best film in 1973.
A bitter and vengeful billiard player in The Spaccon, a magnificent film by Robert Rossen (1961), The Color of Money by Martin Scorsese, which earned him in 1987 the only Oscar in 9 nominations.
Thro the years, it was his.
Yet again him.
Epochs succeed through its path.
Young people know him especially for the cult film Slap Shot- Dry Shot by George Roy Hill (1977), in the role of Reggie Dunlop, coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team.
In 1994, he appeared in Mr. Hula Hoop by the Coen brothers.
The circle was closed with a last role as a patron of the Irish mafia in Era My Father, in 2003.
Unlike the most prestigious film legends who soon abandoned the craft, Newman will stay in the halls for a long time, denouncing Hollywood in all its fashions, parties and concessions.
Bertrand Tavernier, a French filmmaker, called it, ironically, “a living challenge to underplaying,” judging his performance as exaggerated.
The profession has not always been a game for the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles seemed to fall like manna from the sky.
However, he often preferred the role of the marginalised to that of the young actor: neurotic characters, careless or desperate alcoholics, of whom he expressed disengagement and rebellion with his perfect traits.
As a director, Newman revealed unknown nuances of his true, puddy sensitivity.
The first time Jennifer, 1968 (based on the novel of Canadian Margaret Laurence), with her wife Joanne Woodward as the protagonist, drew a subtle female portrait of melancholy.
He, who lost his son Scott to an overdose, dedicated him in 1984 the film Harry and Son, a discreet and sad film.
Among the countless tribute rained yesterday on Newman, his great friend and old gunmate Robert Redford (they had played together in La Stangata and Butch Cassidy) stated with infinite sadness, “His presence has made my life and this country better.”
Generosity and love for life, two great characteristics of the deceased actor.
Beyond a career as a legend, a great activist for civil rights, ecology, independent cinema, a contestant of the Hollywood drift thwarted.
We will have stunned her face standing out on bottles of vinegar, sauces, biscuits and other foods, judging her a choice of bad taste, although born as a gag.
However, the proceeds from those sales were destined to his Foundation for Difficult Children.
Newman, instead of adhering to his myth, chose to commit himself to the end.
He left to his five daughters a letter saying, "Always and until the end, your father has been incredibly grateful to his good star.
Being there was a privilege.”
And we were equally privileged to follow the path of such a clear and generous American artist.
A model citizen, then, and much more.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & Soci facturing factory?
Soon, on 8 October, the hearing of the criminal proceedings against János Zuschlag and associates will be discussed.
The politician and his associates are charged with repeated commercial fraud committed within a criminal association that has caused considerable damage, and other crimes, including falsification of documents.
According to the Prosecutor’s Office, the money obtained from competitions was used by them for private purposes, and they often certified the performance of the activities through fake invoices.
The state and municipal money, a total of 65 million florins, ended in part in the box office of the organization Fiatal Baloldal, in part in the pockets of some people.
According to the method, disclosed by the investigating authorities, they withdrew the money obtained from tenders on the basis of bills for non-existent transactions and the associations never complied with their obligations.
According to the prosecution, most of the bills were fake.
In order to do so, the bill blocks were purchased at the Józsefváros market, while the circular stamps were manufactured in Kiskunhalas.
And to decide on behalf of which companies to issue the invoices, it was established, among other things, during the trip through the hills above the Balaton where János Zuschlag had sent István Lados.
According to the latter’s confession, he had to choose between pensions and restaurants.
He requested an invoice for consumptions, on the model of which the invoices were prepared to be submitted to the competition calls, among others, to those of the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the Municipality of Budapest.
Most of these are the work of István Lados and András Őri who, according to our information, mainly drafted the reports necessary to obtain funding.
One of the choices of Lados' "study trip" was a brewery.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and partners in 2003, the restaurant provided meals to a group of 90 people of the Biztos Pont Egyesület Association.
So many people, however, according to the restaurant owner, would not all enter the room together.
Similarly, the invoice issued in the summer of 2002 to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later referred to as Együtt in Harmadik Évezredért, was full of formal and content errors.
A guesthouse in Badacsonytomaj has only three rooms, more than 10 people could not stay there, however the bill included 130 guests.
But the fanciful bill compilers exaggerated when they Pigal Kft., which also deals with catering, whose accounting — according to the information released to the judicial authorities — did not even include the documents on behalf of the companies Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
Győző Farkas, the company’s manager, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor’s office and the bills were shown to him, he immediately understood that the documents were fake.
“On the stamp, our company’s name and VAT item were in the wrong place.”
He added: in addition to the formal reasons did not even the fact that according to the invoice were housed a hundred people, when in total they have eleven rooms and there are not so many beds.
The restaurant has been out of service for a long time, and the restaurant is no longer in operation.
The hard-working bill compilers did not worry to find out that the Budapest travel agency of their choice only organizes trips abroad, so they foolishly indicated on the invoice with cash travel to Hungary, which was not in accordance with the company’s practice of issuing invoices.
In addition, as demonstrated during the investigation, VAT was also included in the invoice, while travel activities to countries outside the European Union are exempt from VAT.
Among other things, the amount of VAT was also wrong on the four documents issued by Hotel Révfülöp Kft. in favour of the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, in fact on the services offered by the company must be applied VAT at 15% and not at 25% as indicated on the invoices, in addition the hotel employees issued only printed invoices, while the manufactured invoice was written by hand.
In addition to this, the "emitents" ruined other invoices, in the case of a company they indicated as the activity carried out the transportation of goods on the road, as is apparent from the proceedings of the Prosecutor's Office, activity that was not carried out by the company originally founded for investment advice.
In addition, for formal defects - due to non-compliant invoice format, false stamp - it was found that the invoices issued in favour of Együtt to Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, of XXI.
The same was the case for Ravenna Bt. or the Kunfehértó Sports Field, whose representatives denied having issued the invoices in question.
The counterfeiters did not pay attention even to the fact that the HIB Kft. of Nyíregyháza was in liquidation when (2001) a group of Fiatal Városért Egyesület dined there, which is why the liquidation curator of the company, according to our information, denied that he had issued that invoice.
They consciously issued invoices.
Another group of invoice issuers consisted of those who knew they had to issue fictitious invoices.
Esély Budapestért Alapítvány issued an invoice at the request of Fiatal Baloldal – Ifjú Szocialisták in favour of the Együtt Foundation in Harmadik Évezredért of 4 million florins.
Ludovic Györfi, one of the accused, according to the indictment, persuaded the director of Collab Kft. to issue fictitious invoices.
He also collaborated with Zuschlag and associates with the currently in liquidation Biogate Kft, which in 2003 issued invoices worth approximately 5 million florins to the Jobb Jövőért Alapítvány, the Atlasz Egyesület and the Vörösfenyő Egyesület, behind which there was no real economic activity.
No movement of money because the prepared bills were then overturned, but the associations forgot to include this aspect in their documents.
The following group of firms issuing invoices include those that are connected with the accused.
For example, Ivan Kubatov, authorized at the address of the CEO of Delta Trió Kft, headquartered in Budapest but not found there, who deals with fuel and motor vehicle trade.
The company issued various invoices in October, November and December 2005 related to the sale of computer equipment, worth about 18 million florins.
According to the data of the investigation, Cash Investment Kft. of Kiskunhalas under liquidation since 14 September 2005 purchased these invoices.
The CEO of this company was a Romanian to whom Ivan Kubatov would have handed over the documents concerning the company between 2002 and 2005.
As far as we know, during the investigation, Kubatov admitted that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to the companies Atlasz, Hoppá and Együtt at Harmadik Évezredért Alapítvány, and that the amount was collected from him.
At the express request of Ivan Kubatov, Romanian millers founded the companies Fa-Bani Jos Faipari Kft. and Jos-Investment Bt.
However, none of the companies were operative, because according to the accused they had not received work.
However, the companies returned to him because at the request of the co-accused lawyer Zsolt Szente, editor of the company’s founding documents, in the name of the companies, invoices were issued to the associations linked to Zuschlag: Atlasz and Y-Generáció.
On behalf of Cash Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade Kubatov issued 15 invoices for a total value of 14.2 million florins.
The prosecution believes that Kubatov has stolen 10% of the amounts indicated on the invoices, as well as VAT.
The man also used the Szi-Beri Bt. to issue fictitious invoices, manufactured for the Biztos Pont competition.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség at Modern Magyarországért in January 2006 submitted a tender for the Socialist Party’s public utility organization, Táncsics Mihály Alapítvány (TMA).
They also won 500,000 florins per capita but the money was not used for the purposes indicated in the call.
To prevent this from happening, they submitted to TMA five fictitious invoices received from Works Team Kft.
These bills were found during the search of Árpád Kemecsei’s office at the Ministry of Education.
At the hearing, a part of the accused, as they have already done at the prosecutor's office, will probably report on the development of the invoices.
However, the most interesting thing could be if the accused number one, János Zuschlag, decided to lift the veil on everything.
His confession so far has not been very detailed and although he has promised several times to talk about everything in an extensive way, he has not yet done it.
It is necessary to see if it is in his interest, it may also happen that the socialists have made agreements with Zusi, who - in exchange for a compensation of 50 million florins, much of the damage - would be willing to do the expiatory goat.
Zuschlag could have offended himself as his demands to ease his conditions in prison, i.e. to grant house arrest, have not yet been met.
While the perpetrators of non-reparable commercial crimes and causing much greater damage can freely walk or at least wait at home for the end of the proceedings against them, which is not granted to him.
The psychology of overbidding: why spend more money?
At auctions, buyers tend to spend more, to overvalu the goods.
Neurologists and research economists at the University of New York have managed to uncover the neuro-economic foundations of this well-known and seemingly irrational behavior.
According to their study published in the journal Science, men do not want to stay behind in a competition such as an eBay auction, so they are willing to pay even a higher price.
The research sought to trace the nerve pattern of this "match" at the level of the nervous system through experimental auctions.
One group of volunteers played the lottery, the other group of players participated in a auction while using the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) method they examined the active areas of the brain of the people participating in the experiment.
In both games participants could win money, but in the auction game, where the substantial element is to bet more than the other, the stripped body under the cerebral cortex enters into intensive function when you lose the game.
This brain area, in addition to other functions, plays a role in the "self-gratification" mechanism of the nervous system.
Therefore, according to the researchers, the rise in price is explained by scanning the fierce reaction of the striated body.
To support their theory, the research group’s economists conducted a financial investigation.
In this survey, three groups bid against a partner under different conditions.
They to the control group the actual value of the product in question and they made their bet.
In addition to this, they promised another group that in case of winning they would receive another $15 prize.
The third group would receive $15 before the auction, but the members of the group would lose the money if they lost the auction.
The difference between the two groups was that for one of them the win was emphasized, while for the other the loss.
Testing the hypothesis of neurologists, members of the group that played "against loss" were willing to make higher bets than the control group or "win".
"These findings are not deductible from any of the previously existing economic theories.
In fact, these so far explained the phenomena seen at auctions with the joy of winning and avoiding risk.
Only the methods of creating the neurological image have helped solve the contradiction between the two theories, so we have come to a third explanation," said Andrew Schotter, a professor of economics at the University of New York.
Hepatitis: When to go to the doctor?
Nearly half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C, while chronic liver disease is among the leading causes of death in Hungary.
In Hungary, the number of hepatitis patients amounts to hundreds of thousands, of which only 7000 are treated: the reason is that many sick people do not know they are infected.
The definition of hepatitis is the collective name of contagious liver diseases caused by various viruses.
There are many similarities between the symptoms, typical are hepatitis and iritis, but their pathogens and the diseases caused differ from each other.
Hepatitis viruses spread in two main forms depending on the pathogen: hepatitis A and E through the food channel (e.g. water and infected food), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses with blood and organic fluids (sperm, vaginal discharge, saliva).
For those who travel it is useful to get vaccinated against the virus A and B, against the virus C there is no vaccine.
Symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after eating infected foods, accompanied by general malaise, weakness, abdominal pain and nausea.
After yellowish spots form on the skin and white of the eyes, the stool becomes clear and the urine dark, healing occurs within two to three weeks.
One million people die every year worldwide from hepatitis B, the most serious variant of the disease, which causes liver cancer and liver cirrhosis.
The main reason is, according to estimates, that only one in ten people receive medication.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if it is not treated it can cause liver cirrhosis and liver tumors.
Most infected people do not know that they have contracted the disease because pathogens subtilly destroy liver cells, in many cases the first symptoms appear after 20-30 years.
Therefore, prevention and regular medical examinations are very important.
This disease is much more common than average in three groups: those who had a blood transfusion before 1991, drug addicts and tattooers.
In the world today, the number of people infected with the chronic hepatitis C virus amounts to 200 million.
Since even a routine laboratory examination reveals the disease, it is worth referring to your family doctor when you notice any symptoms of unknown origin.
Recognized in time the disease is curable, the virus can be eliminated from the body, so the infectious power ceases and the formation of tumors can be prevented.
The World Hepatitis Day is celebrated on September 30th, and was first held worldwide in 2004 by associations of patients.
The aim is to draw attention to chronic viral hepatitis, the causes of its development and the early recognition of the disease.
Who believes in God feels less pain?
According to the results of a recent survey, religious faith works as a kind of analgesic that has made the death of Catholic martyrs more tolerable.
Scientists at the University of Oxford conducted an interesting experiment, examining how belief in God affects the feeling of pain, the British Telegraph.
As part of the bizarre investigation, 12 Catholic believers and as many atheists were electro-shocked, while all observed a painting depicting the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, Catholic believers were able to repel much of the pain.
Thanks to the exploration technique of the human brain, it was discovered that Catholics were able to activate the part of the brain responsible for pain control.
The test is the first of a series of researches in which, in addition to academics, scientists, philosophers and theologians of the University also participate.
The test went exactly like this: an instrument that emits discharges and passes the electro shock was connected to the left hand of the subject of the experiment.
The researchers asked participants to focus on two paintings, the Virgin Mary painted in the 17th century by Sassoferrato and the Lady with the hermit of Leonardo da Vinci painted in the 15th century.
The authors of the examination hoped that the image of the Virgin Mary would originate a sort of religious state among believers, while Leonardo's painting was chosen because it did not differ too much from the other and they thought it had a reassuring effect.
The subjects in the experiment spent half an hour in front of the MRI scanner and during this time they received 20 electro-shocks in four consecutive series, while watching either the religious-themed painting or the other.
Catholics that the vision of the Virgin Mary made them feel “safe,” as if “somebody was taking care” of them, and “they reassured themselves and were pervaded by peace.”
Looking at the religious-themed image, they accounted for 12% less pain than when they had Leonardo's work in front of them.
The psychologist Miguel Farias, who himself took part in the test, believes that a similar result can be achieved with any image with a strong effect even for atheists, but it is necessary to find the appropriate image.
"We must look for an image towards which they feed very positive feelings, such as a mother or a father," said the psychologist.
The Anglican bishop Tom Wright was pleased with the results of the research.
"The practice of faith should change, and in many cases it manages to change our personality." - Wright added.
After the excellent results remains only the question of whether the painting of a Madonna of Leonardo or another painter of similar caliber is presented to the believers, what effect could it have on pain control?
Would the vision of a quality Virgin Mary bring better results?
You are what you say about yourself.
On the day of their tenth birthday, Google can claim to be in people’s pockets as much as in the sky above their heads; it knows where they spent their holidays, which outpatient they attend and what they care about.
However, according to Eric Schmidt, one of the CEOs of the company, this is not enough yet.
As for the skeptics who make a comparison with the Orwellian nightmare, they don’t really see the substance of the web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google’s primary purpose is to collect as much personal data as possible from its users and this is necessary to stick to the original goal of Google’s founders that was: “we put all the information in the world in one system!”
According to the director of Google interviewed the company, after 10 years of revolutionary work, it is still at the beginning of being able to handle all the information.
Asked what would happen in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to answer questions like “What am I doing tomorrow?” or “What would be the right job for me?” but software doesn’t answer seemingly simple questions because they don’t know enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that during their internet searches the exact searches are recorded, from which IP address they are searched and on which page the interested parties stop after the search.
Through the Personalized Search started two years ago, users can store their browsing history, they can relate to what they have searched and clicked, these will then in the long run generate much better tailored results; on this same logic is based Recommendations with which the system offers us products and services based on our previously stated and recorded preferences.
What if my data is used against me, if they look at what I’m dealing with? – they ask users concerned about Google’s data monopoly.
In most cases, the counter-reactions of internet users are provoked by the fear of the size of the potential power represented by the company, and not by the sense of guilt, the fear of punishment, the desire for freedom, or even the rebellion to power.
One fact is confirmed, however, and that all the expressions sought are not only recorded but in justified cases can also be provided to third parties, in such legal cases nothing defends the personal rights of Internet users.
The most striking example of this in recent times was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, in which Google forwarded to the Brazilian government the information that made it possible to identify pedophiles from the Orkut community pageined by Google.
Internet users concerned about personal rights, on the other hand, soup of relief in May when the company - in agreement with the e-law protection association EFF - successfully proved the truth in court against the FBI: even after that it can not be forced Google with any point of the constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(At the same time, the federal government successfully ripped almost 50,000 web addresses and a thousand search phrases obtained in reference to the confirmation of the Child Protection Act passed years earlier, but still failed to get individual user search lists and the entire list of web pages and keywords dating back two months.)
The judgment of Google is therefore rather contradictory: those who fear to provide their personal data spy on Google because they believe that it will affect their intimate sphere and privacy by starting to use its services and rise with the rebellion due to the multinationals that stand out for the conservative image.
Meanwhile, the American geek culture and the proliferation of enthusiasts, activists and computer users in numerous countries see in them the future generation of big companies, the "cool corporation", unlike their rival, Microsoft liquidated as the world conqueror because of Windows, although they both fight for the same goal.
This can happen because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not ask its users for an identification code, does not ask for money for its services, the source code is always kept up to date and the program package is much more accessible, youthful and cool than the official practice of the software giant.
But it can also happen because geeks see exactly the problematic relationship between personal rights and the internet, which implies just one of the most frequently repeated keywords in recent years, the web 2.0.
The web 2.0 speaks of collaboration, of intentionally leaving traces behind us and exploiting the communication channels at our disposal and while the size of these changes for each individual, the substance is the same: showing ourselves.
A young average can create profiles on multiple community pages, from Facebook to Xanga, can link them with other services such as Twitter or last.fm that lists his musical tastes, all of these can place them in systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, can also write blogs on which automatically appear his latest photo galleries stored on Flickr or on Picasa.
In the meantime, we read about numerous exemplary cases from which it is clear that the girl, seeing the series of photos taken in the morning from the common tour of friends, comes to know easily with whom she spent the night her perverse boyfriend or a company can dismiss her employee because she wrote a sincere opinion on the company summit: one thing is certain, the concept of privacy has now been completely reconsidered.
Those who live an online life make sure to show themselves and so we can formulate the fundamental thesis that is hidden behind the behavior of young people.
Anyone who wants to hide something or just want to avoid the monopoly of Google can do so (starting with, for example, Scroogle using the Google search system but at the same time not voluntarily leaving traces).
There are not a few people who do not register to community pages intentionally for not being found, Google’s online applications, from text processing to image management and news collection, can be replaced with alternative versions not linked to huge server parks and that do not make up our best profile to date.
The public is not even waiting so much in secret for the moment when Google will pull out the sticks.
At present, with its $156 billion worth, the company is worth more than IBM (140 billion dollars), Intel (124 billion dollars) or Coca Cola (110 billion dollars), AdWords/AdSense advertising spaces threaten advertising agencies' revenue, while services introduced in record time cause major discomfort not only to Microsoft but also to numerous software development companies.
However, critical observers find some alarming points: the corporate summit, for example, completely rejected the protest of employees after doubling the right of the corporate asylum, considered it too expensive to repeatedly catering to the daily pleasure of employees, but all this diminishes in the face of the fact that in 2006 Google slammed the head to the Chinese government and under their agreement the company will filter all the results that offend the good taste and interests of the Chinese regime.
One internal rule of the company seems to be not to advertise a new service in advance but only when it will be usable, but one thing is certain, that the predictable problems of the coming months and years will sweep the world to a point: while some believe that the project of scanning and storing Google books and magazines will assume such proportions that the company will soon be in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, others are afraid of the Health system, in fact in this we can create a health profile with our reports, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can offer good material to the next generation of science fiction writers, the Scroogled story of the famous Cory Doctorow describes the future with Orwellian accents, in which a man with Google data can be approached in alarming ways.
Two minors helped the double killer of Ózd to disappear traces
Police have questioned two minors in connection with the double murder of Ózd, who are well-foundedly suspected of helping to dispel the traces of the crime, a spokesman for the Borsod police station said on Tuesday.
The young people have acknowledged the crime they are accused of, are currently accused of favoring.
The two minors, two girls according to MTI information, are defending themselves freely.
Favorization is punishable with up to 5 years in prison.
The suspect of the double murder of Ózd, a 23-year-old local man, was placed in custody on Sunday.
He is suspected of pluriomord committed for profit.
The investigation found that the 23-year-old had a large debt with a 53-year-old man.
The suspect did not want to pay off the debt, so last Wednesday he tricked his creditor into a construction site in Ózd where he and his 9-year-old daughter were killed.
According to information from the MTI, the young man was preparing to commit the crime, one sign is the fact that he committed the murder with a hidden weapon on the spot.
Police are investigating the weapon and the circumstances of its use with the involvement of an expert.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has offered €200 million, approximately SEK 5 billion, for the purchase of 100% of the stock list of the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, president of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Poles despite the Czechs having previously ruled out the Warsaw Stock Exchange as a possible buyer of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason for the exclusion is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are in the hands of the Polish state, which intends to sell more than 60% of its bonds within a few months.
The Czech financial newspaper E15 that the Polish bid represents the highest figure to date for the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to the Czech press, the Vienna Stock Exchange, the Transatlantic Stock Exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and the German Stock Exchange have so far submitted an offer.
Petr Koblic, director of the Prague Stock Exchange, said last week that of all concerned, the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst owner and did not rule out that this could lead to the closure of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at 5-10 billion crowns.
According to the agreement of the shareholders, almost 90% of the securities would be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is Patria Finance with a share of almost 25%, followed by Banca Česká Spořitelna with 14.7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a.r.l. with 13.5%
The economic crisis from the perspective of European newspapers
Major European newspapers in their comments on Tuesday devoted to the international economic crisis already speak of "a second September 11".
The global financial disaster happened thanks to the American president – accuses The Republic – who was unable to compact his party behind a rushed law, whose purpose is to remedy a desperate situation.
Instead of a second Pearl Harbor, as billionaire superfinancer Warren Buffett said, it would be more accurate to talk about a second September 11th.
Even a portion of the Madrid press sees in Washington the expiatory goat.
According to El Mundo, the lack of American political leadership has thrown the world economy on the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is increasing and the whole world will suffer from it.
Bush’s plan was not perfect, but as a result of the Congressional vote there is the danger that Washington will not offer a political means to manage the crisis.
The world economy is suspended in the air, precisely when the greatest transformation in the history of capitalism is taking place.
It is no longer possible to ignore the threat, reports the Tages-Anzeiger in Geneva.
Some states today can still offer a lifeblood to bankrupt financial institutions and with taxpayer money can save them from bankruptcy.
But if more and more banks collapse like in a domino effect then neither the financial means nor new improvised solutions will be enough.
In the long run, it is necessary for EU member states to overcome their national egoism and concentrate control on disintegrated financial markets.
Only on Monday weakened financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros, the Viennese newspaper Der Standard recalls, according to which anxieties that even European taxpayers, similar to those of the United States, will have to put their portfolios to remedy the crisis appear more and more real.
The EU has so far not worried much about the crisis that has swept through the old continent like a tsunami.
The “saviors” shouldn’t dismiss the 100 billion euros immediately, however it would be better if they determined in which case it is appropriate to touch the taxpayer’s money to prevent greater damage.
The smart car imitates the flight of the crab
What could be the best method to develop anti-collision technologies other than mimicking the obstacle sensors found in nature?
For example the bees.
In the stunning project presented at CEATEC in Japan, cranes gave Nissan engineers the initial strategic clue on how to build the next generation of collision-proof systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has built the biomimetic robot BR23C, a robotic mini-car with the properties of bees, with the ultimate goal of creating a system that can scan all collisions.
Flying bees form their own oval personal space that really resembles our protective shield - explained at the exhibition Kazuhiro Doi, director of the PR technologies and research and development sector.
Important is the role of the bee's vision, capable of a 300-degree view in each direction.
The engineers used the telemetry laser idea to copy the function of bee vision.
The BR23C detects obstacles up to two meters away within a 180-degree radius, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor that immediately turns it into a command to avoid collision.
In a fraction of a second the robot perceives the obstacle and then, imitating the movements of the bee, immediately changes direction by turning the wheels of the measure necessary to avoid the accident.
This maneuver of avoidance, in a way different from the current system, takes place in a very instinctive way.
“If it were not so, the robot car would not be able to react quickly to avoid collisions,” says Toshiyuki Andoh, director of the Mobility Lab and the robot car project.
It must react instinctively and immediately because this technology corresponds to the damaging, inner layer of the protective shield, within which the collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process must reflect what a bee does to avoid the other bees.
This process must take place in a blink of eye.
But unlike bees, the deviation cannot go up or down or diagonally, it can only be two-dimensional and in the direction of wheel steering.
Thus, instead of the infinite possibilities available to bees to scan other bees, the robot, as available possibilities, can rotate on itself, accelerate and slow down.
The BR23C is powered by lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and have a high energy density, which means that they last longer than lithium-ion batteries.
According to Andoh, the instantaneity of the smart reaction is important, not the processing of data or even less the ability to store it.
This robot must process some input in seconds and react.
There is no need to store them and react with intuitive logic based on previous maneuver data, so it only uses a memory of a few dozen Kb.
There is no need for a gigabyte or megabyte memory.
This is the first step towards developing an immediate collision-preventing technology that Nissan predicts will be installed on standard vehicles within 10 years.
Additional application possibility can be represented by the unification with the GPS satellite navigation system that by avoiding obstacles present on the road leads to the destination.
They also found the name of the child very expensive.
The written version of the $700 billion economic bailout bill for the purchase of disproportionate loans was drafted, to be applied in several parts.
In the first step, half of the amount is spent.
In the new agreement, which lasted until midnight on Saturday, Congress leaders agreed on a $700 billion bailout plan after days of debate, Reuters.
“We have taken serious steps forward,” said Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic chairwoman of the U.S. House of Representatives, saying it remains only to put the deal on paper.
Both presidential candidates, Barack Obama and John McCain, supported the compromise plan.
The Minister of the Treasury Henry Paulson, speaking of the outcome of the compromise, said: The program will work and be effective, but there is still much to do.
The written version of the plan was made public before the opening of Asian markets at 8 a.m. Washington time (at 2 a.m. Monday night Central European time), but it did not bring much growth to the stock markets.
On Monday, the House of Representatives will vote first on the 2008 economic stabilization bill concerning the program, after which it will go to the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke to Pelosi on Saturday night and then welcomed the news in the White House.
We are pleased with the progress achieved tonight and highly appreciate the efforts of both parties to stabilize our financial markets and defend the economy," White House spokesman Tony Fratto said.
The program, however, differs from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which predicted that the $700 billion would all be spent on buying bonds with disproportionate credits behind.
Now, as a first step, you can spend up to half of the sum of $700 billion, $250 billion immediately after the Congress vote on Monday, with these the Treasury Ministry will buy bonds with disproportionate credits behind, the fate of the remaining $100 billion will be decided by the president.
A special panel will oversee the program, which also includes the President of the Federal Reserve.
The spending of the other half of the 700 billion depends on a new Congressional decree.
Under the law, the Treasury Ministry can apply a combined tactic: it can simultaneously buy loans, mortgages and bonds with mortgages and other types of "poisoned" loans.
The purchase can take place through auctions and directly - they announced competent ministry.
The legal rule makes it possible for the companies concerned to participate in an insurance program where the Treasury Ministry guarantees the means of concern, for which the companies will pay a price appropriate to the likely damage.
Henrz Paulson said: The law provides the means necessary for $700 billion to come to the urgent needs of the U.S. monetary system, whether it is to buy the wrong funds, or to insure them, or to avoid the risk of the collapse of a major financial institution.
We will take all necessary steps to make ourselves ready to introduce the newly signed law.
Instead, the executives of the banks in crisis and waiting for state aid think that the government will limit their exit, defined by overseas slang simply as gold parachutes.
Payment limitations will only take place in some cases, in addition, limitations depend on how the Treasury Ministry will offer the aid.
In essence, the limitation means that if the ministry buys as part of an auction, it will impose a surcharge on the gold parachute, if they do not retire the deceased bank director.
At the time of the direct purchase of disproportionate loans, the government will intervene aggressively to ensure that the directors’ money is not exaggerated.
To this it should be added that the existing gold parachute contracts will not change, the limitation is only valid for new ones to encourage participation in the program.
This is the first case in U.S. history of the entry into force of a legal limitation concerning the remuneration of chief executives, said Democrat Barney Frank, chairman of the House of Representatives’ Committee on Financial Services.
In addition to this, the state has the right to appropriate a share of the banks participating in the program, reducing the risk of taxpayers, since in the end they can also earn it if the economy, and with it the bank saved, get back up.
The bill requires the president to submit a proposal to Congress over the next five years on how to reimburse taxpayers for the expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were those on both sides who expressed their doubts about the project.
This is not what American citizens have asked us, not to defend taxpayer dollars," said California Republican MP Darrell Issa.
His Ohio Democratic colleague Mary Kaptur believes the measures were taken by those who are responsible for the collapse of Wall Street.
Industry prices continue to rise
Domestic industrial sales prices in August 2008 increased by 0.1% compared to the previous month, by 12.9% compared to August 2007 - reports the Central Institute of Statistics of Hungary.

The domestic industrial sales prices compared to the previous month increased only 0.1%.
The domestic sales prices of the manufacturing sector also increased to a minimum of 0.1% compared to July.
The biggest price increases in August 2008 occurred in the leather and shoe processing sector (2,8%), especially bags and belts with 4.6% and shoe production with 2.5% monthly increase.
The high level of the price of plastic and chemical raw materials has caused a significant monthly increase (1,6%) in the product and chemical sector.
Prices fell in the oil processing sector (1,4%), in the production of electrical tools and machinery (0,9%) and to a minimal extent in the wood processing sector (0,1%).
The prices of paper production, publishing and printing activities remained unchanged.
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry there was an increase in prices between 0.2 and 0.9%.
In the electricity, gas, steam and water supply sectors prices increased by 0.3% in domestic industrial sales in August, primarily as a result of the dominant effect of gas price increases carried out by the authorities since July 1.
Compared in 12 months, considering the domestic sales of the manufacturing sectors, the biggest increases were in the processing of petroleum products (32.4%).
In the manufacturing sector of metal products the price increase was 13.2%, of 11% in the production of food, beverages and tobacco representing a determining weight.
Prices fell in the textile sector (2.5%) and in the manufacturing of tools and electrical machinery (0.3%).
In other sectors of the manufacturing industry, the rate of price growth ranged from 0.6% to 9.1%.

In the sectors that produce consumer goods prices increased by 0.3%, in the energy and after-use sector prices remained unchanged compared to the previous month.
In August 2008, compared to the same month of last year, the biggest price increase was observed in the energy and subsequent use sectors (16.8%).
In the sectors that produce consumer goods the increase was 6.8%, for investment goods a 1.4% decrease was measured.
Industrial export sales prices calculated in florins increased in August by 1.1% compared to the previous month, compared to 12 months decreased by 3.9%.
The Hungarian florin in a month weakened against the euro by 1.7%, against the dollar of 7.1%, compared with August 2007 strengthened by 7.5% against the euro and 15.9% against the dollar.
Going to the United States without a visa?
Kinga Göncz sees the possibility that around January 12 the U.S.-Hungary visa-free agreement may come into force - the foreign minister talked about this in Chicago with local Hungarian representatives.
According to his opinion "now everything depends on the fact overseas seat is built in time the electronic system of entry and control".
He noted that in the new system there will no longer be entry permits, however, before departure tourists will have to register.
The Hungarian Foreign Ministry will hold talks in Washington today.
He will meet with Foreign Minister Condoleeza Rice, to whom he will hand over the Medal of the Order of the Republic of Hungary with the Star and will engage in talks with foreign policy advisors of Democratic candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and John McCain also support bank rescue.
Barack Obama and John McCain, the presidential candidates of the two major U.S. parties, guaranteed their support for the government’s $700 billion plan to rescue banks on Sunday, but some politicians are demanding the Treasury Secretary’s resignation.
Representatives of Congress and the administration, after days of marathon negotiations, announced on Sunday night that they had reached a principled agreement on the bank rescue plan.
The Wall Street crisis and the freezing financial package of the frozen credit market have become the central issue of the presidential campaign.
Obama and McCain want to show themselves better than their rivals in bringing the country out of the economic crisis.
According to the most recent polls with the emphasis on economic issues, Obama has again recovered some advantage, while McCain’s advantage, obtained after the Republican convention with the nomination of Sarah Palin as vice president, has disappeared.
In a speech in Detroit, Obama expressed hope that Congress will quickly pass the $700 billion bill.
He stressed that the proposal contains those steps of consumer protection that were also supported by him.
"Now we must act responsibly (...), the danger threatens your work, your savings, all industrial sectors, complete economic stability" - he said in front of a crowd of 35,000 people.
He did not let go of describing McCain’s economic ideas as outdated.
In an interview with ABC, McCain explained that “everyone will find it difficult to put down this situation (...) but not doing anything is not a way to go.”
The Republican senator that the proposal includes the creation of a supervisory committee of the finance minister and the limitation of the good output of top managers, things that he insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no merit role in the agreements, but was in daily contact with the minister.
President Nancy Pelosi said on Sunday that the House of Representatives will likely vote on the bill on Monday.
Press Release of the German Language World
The right pole is intact, only within the pole the voters have become more self-aware - thus Der Spiegel analyses the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria.
Haider's party is ready to rule Austria to prevent the red-black coalition.
by Der Spiegel (Spiegel)
Franz Walter, in the online edition of the left-wing German magazine, in the article The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Parents analyses the causes of the dramatic defeat of the CSU.
According to the well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad couple Beckstein-Huber took office.
Christian-Socialists have modernized Bavaria for decades, and now these modern citizens are moving away from them.
The change of times is at the same time a problem of all Christian democracy, as is Angela Merker’s.
The defeat was not a big surprise for the CSU, but Sunday ended a process that exactly ten years ago was feasible: the undisputed hegemony of a party-state ended.
10 years ago, in 1998, the CSU was down to 47.7%, for the first time since the 1950s.
This was repeated three years ago in the 2005 Bundestag elections, even during the so-called Stoiber period.
The reason for this is the consequential modernization in the region, which devours the parents.
But secularization, the results of education, the settlement of East and North Germans in the developed Bavarian region could not remain without consequences on voter loyalty to the CSU.
Modernization goes hand in hand with increasing opportunities and its political consequences are evident.
The right pole is intact, only inside the pole the voters have become more self-aware, critical, stubborn.
It is also surprising that in recent weeks the classic bourgeois groups have moved away from the CSU: freelancers, craftsmen, graduates and graduates.
The support for the CSU fell below 40 percent.
by Die Presse (diepresse.com)
The Viennese conservative newspaper "Who with whom?" in the article "Party presidents are stuck in coalition issues" deals with the confusing internal political situation created following the elections in Austria.
The SPÖ intends to negotiate with ÖVP.
The ÖVP prohibits SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BZÖ is open to negotiations in all directions, the Greens still do not want to discuss coalition.
The elections have been made, now it all revolves around the coalition; in the discussion broadcast on public television the party leaders have just seen the cards.
Werner Faymann, president of the SPÖ, has confirmed that he wants to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The SPÖ wants to show that cooperation between the two parties is possible, in some regions and in the social partnership already exists.
Faymann left the question open whether he can imagine a coalition with Wilhelm Molterer, the current president of the ÖVP, as deputy chancellor.
As he stated, the Schüssel-Molterer course was in any case rejected.
Repetition in this direction is not considered.
Molterer reacted cautiously to the red offers.
As he said, the collaboration will not succeed if Faymann tries to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party chooses the opposition or enters the coalition is still an open thing in the party, issues should be discussed in any case within the ÖVP.
Jörg Haider leader of the BZÖ repeated that he was open in all directions.
“To prevent the red-black coalition, we are ready to take responsibility for governing,” Haider said.
Járóka: The vicious circle of poverty and segregation must be broken
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, organized this year by France, holding the chairmanship of the European Union, began today in Paris.
Lívia Járóka, Fidesz member of the European People’s Party, in her message to the plenary as the congress’s main rapporteur, drew attention to school segregation because it is the most serious legal violation affecting Roma children and the most serious obstacle to their claim.
Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Employment and Social Affairs, on behalf of the French Presidency, and Vladimír Špidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, opened the conference at the highest level.
The conference was attended by governments, European social partners and representatives of major European civil society and equal opportunity rights organizations.
Járóka, according to the press office of the Fidesz PE parliamentary group, reminded, in addition to discrimination in hiring, that Roma are being driven out of the labour market primarily because of their low schooling.
“Most young Roma do not have a middle-level degree, and as a result of low-quality elementary education only an illusory number of them can a higher degree.”
Járóka also emphasized, as a fundamental human right, the key role of education in upholding human rights.
Investing in the education of Roma children can mean strengthening the economies of the EU member states.
It is necessary to raise awareness of these links in the wider range between Roma and non-Roma.
In fact, the sooner a Roma starts school, the more likely it is to become a productive member of the labour market; through taxes paid on income and consumption, it contributes to the national budget.
“The right of European citizenship for Roma must guarantee their right to quality education and the elimination of low-level and segregated schools,” said Lívia Járóka.
According to the MEP, the union of purpose and action of the European Union is necessary to accelerate the processes of school segregation and for this reason it is of fundamental importance to properly comply with existing and planned anti-discrimination directives.
“The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, we must give Roma children the opportunities given by the democratic space so that they can contribute fully as citizens to the future of Europe,” Járóka said.
In the sign of the "European Year of Equal Opportunities" to be guaranteed for all, the aim of the European Summit for Equal Opportunities organized every year since the meeting in Berlin last year is to ensure a single forum to promote the objectives of anti-discrimination and equal opportunities set at national and European levels.
CSU: mercy for a transition period
At the end of October, the fate of the Huber-Beckstein couple will be decided.
Although the bad election defeat has not yet fallen the heads, the discussion of personal issues has been postponed at the summits of the Bavarian CSU for the moment.
Party president Erwin Huber and regional governor Günther Beckstein still remain in place, the question is how long the mercy lasts.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic loss of 17% of the votes, will be decided by the party's extraordinary congress in the last weekend of October.
The two highly criticized politicians have in any case made known that they are not attacked with all their forces in the chair.
They so tried to soften the angry members of the parliamentary group and the base that a day after the "Bavarian tsunami" claimed the personal consequences for the loss of the absolute majority.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber at the height of his career, the Christian-Social Union gained 60.7%, but now after the coup against Stoiber they have fallen to 43.4%.
For 46 years, the CSU has been the "absolute monarch" in Bavaria, which accounts for 18% of German GDP.
However, the conservatives in the southern region of fundamental importance for the Hungarian economy will always count, in the future they will be forced in any way to coalition.
As a first sign of reorganization within the party, Vice President and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, considered a possible heir to Huber, gets a seat in the narrow exploration group that will start negotiations with the FDP liberals and right-wing Voters for a possible government coalition in Munich.
For a strange joke of fate in the list of the Free Electors enters the legislature that Gabriele Pauli whose attitude against Stoiber had been exploited as a coup opportunity by the couple Huber-Beckstein and then treated without concern the woman with great ambitions.
CSU leaders are now concentrating all their forces to somehow stabilize Beckstein.
In the meantime, Stoiber will also play an active role, who has so far been in the shadow.The former regional governor and former CSU president has called September 28 the bitterest day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber issued a few statements to the CSU, according to which they would deserve more support from the brother party.
Other CSU politicians have interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
Merkel will not be able to be chancellor after the Bundestag elections set for September 2009 unless the CSU, which played a decisive role in the 2005 national victory, is restored with joint forces.
According to Merkel, who does not hide the disappointment for the fiasco, the loss of ground by the CSU will not negatively impact the great coalition in Berlin.
What is relative: it will not be easy to manage the wounded CSU, but the crisis of the Social Democrats still lasts.
The SPD reached its lowest score since 1946 in Bavaria with 18.6%.
Lukashenko opposition: 110 to 0
Not even a representative of the opposition entered the Belarusian parliament after Sunday's elections.
According to Russian observers, this is a sign of prosperity and stability in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), but it is explained by the mistakes committed in the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which has sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the elections.
Although the legislation of 110 people in a country of 10 million inhabitants has been out of opposition for more than a decade, before yesterday’s elections the opposition gathered under the name United Democratic Forces (ODS) seriously hoped that Lukashenko, with the presidential term renewed for the fourth time following the constitutional amendment to the 2006 elections held under the circumstances discussed, would “concess” some seats in the Parliament to representatives of the opposition.
The ODS has thus given up on a previously evaluated boycott.
Behind the expectations of the opposition was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia, which sought a loan to reduce the import of increasingly expensive Russian natural gas and agreed to give the Russians the Beltransgaz gas pipelines that pass through the country, intended to improve relations with the EU where Lukashenko and other high-ranking politicians cannot enter for the Belarusian political situation considered antidemocratic.
He referred to a distinction that the OSCE, when evaluating the election campaign, emphasized positive movements rather than shortcomings, such as the ban on a third of opposition candidates.
The rapid OSCE report on Monday, however, also criticized the campaign, during which opposition candidates practically could not appear in the press, and in particular that the opposition could not be present at the counting of the votes.
Despite this, according to the opposition, there is a noticeable improvement in the political climate: political prisoners have been released, Minsk is also willing to a small confrontation with Moscow continuing to deny the recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia by Georgia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms on paper a federal state, considers the two countries independent for a month.
We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun - said Aleksandr Milinkevich to our newspaper.
According to the opposition presidential candidate in the 2006 elections, it is desirable that it remains despite the fact that "the power was afraid of bringing even one opponent into a weightless Parliament."
The opposition does not intend to protest the results, but rather tries to bring the message to the voters that economic reforms are necessary.
Of course we have a lot of problems, we have to print the opposition newspapers in Russia, for distribution the local authorities raise difficulties, but even so I see that more and more people support change, even among the elderly - said Milinkevich, referring to the fact that even the officially most aided layer, that of the retirees, considers appropriate Lukashenko's regime, which considers its main result the creation of social security.
Due to the country's indebtedness and the rise of the economic deficit is only a matter of time the breakdown of social security "reminiscent of the sepulchre silence" - says Milinkevich.
In contrast to the opposition politician, Russian observers considered the election democratic.
Sergei Lebedev, president of the Commonwealth of Independent States, told the Russian news agency RIA Novosti: "Men believe not in words but in deeds," so the lack of opposition is nothing more than a test of maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: “From now on, breakfast before work”
It has never happened in the history of Palazzo Chigi that there were rotating doors for the entrance and exit of employees.
But from today, he takes off this new measure against the furbets, against those who thumb and then goes to drink a coffee at the bar during working hours.
The new measure was presented today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidency of the Council, Mauro Masi.
"The rotating doors - says Brunetta - are a tool to work better, with more productivity, more presence and more services," the minister said.
“This is a new season of responsibility and transparency.
This is reformism,” Brunetta continues.
With Palazzo Chigi the installation is completed in all the palaces of the Presidency of the Council.
For Masi, “the choice of rotating doors is also important from a symbolic point of view.”
There was no resistance from the employees, the secretary-general assures: “It was a process shared by the workers and there was the collaboration of all.”
In short, no more breakfast in working hours; no more coffee and cornette.
Brunette’s words, which suggest, smiling, “a beautiful cappuccino at 7 a.m. is a holy hand.”
During a meeting at the Higher School of Public Administration
In addition, the ministry said that “in three months the absences due to illness of public employees have decreased by 50%, that is, 60,000 more people at work in a year.”
It is necessary to make public administration more efficient.
The Italian government said in a statement: “Their wage dynamics in the last 8-10 years have been twice as high as in the private sector and well above the inflation rate.”
Meanwhile, thousands of public employees have united to challenge the rules of the Brunetta decree by adhering to the appeal supported by the Codacons.
“While the Minister of Public Service today releases numbers about the smallest absence from work due to illness – writes the consumer association – the people of ‘working fannullons’ are constantly growing.
In fact, there are thousands in Italy of correct and productive public administration employees who have united to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree.”
In particular, the Tar will be disputed the exclusion of additional economic treatments for dependent disability due to service; the extension of the hours of availability of the sick worker, within which the control visits are carried out, and other aspects contained in the new provisions desired by the minister.
Workplace accidents, Napolitano: “Prevention crucial”
Every day, 2,500 work accidents occur in Italy, 3 people die and 27 remain permanently disabled.
For 2007, Inail’s data confirms that white deaths were about 1,200.
These figures testify to the severity of a phenomenon that remains one of the leading causes of death and causes almost twice as many deaths as murders.
To draw the attention of institutions, social forces and media on this dramatic issue, today the Anmil celebrates in all provinces of Italy the 58th National Day for the Victims of Occupational Accidents, institutionalized on the second Sunday of October.
"The worrying data spread by the Anmil and the same tragic chronicles of these days confirm how crucial the issue of prevention at work is," said the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano, in the message sent to the President of the Anmil, National Association of Mutilated and Disabled Workers, Pietro Mercandelli.
The head of state expresses his “living appreciation for the constant associative commitment to prevention in the workplace, the protection of injured workers, the assistance of the families of victims and the awareness of the public.”
“It has arisen, of course, an indignant ‘just enough’, sincerely shared, in the face of tragedies that, by their size, arouse the clamor of the media and the involvement of the public opinion but the everyday reality proposes us dramatic cases, even repetitive in their dynamics.”
It is not hidden by Napolitano that "there is undoubtedly also a problem of resources: it is crucial to invest in training and information.
Particular importance is given to the numerous initiatives promoted in the school field for a more direct awareness by young people who are faced with the world of work.
It is necessary to keep the attention to the phenomenon alive, not to dive into the alarm about its social gravity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
For his part, House President Gianfranco Fini stressed “how the phenomenon of white deaths constitutes an absolute social emergency, which offends the conscience of each of us and imposes on all institutions a decisive commitment aimed at urgently ending it.”
“Data on workplace accidents appear to signal a slight positive trend, but this does not remove the fact that the number of white deaths is still impressive,” said Anmil president Pietro Mercandelli.
In fact, we’t want this “downward trend” to result in less attention, because it’s precisely when the attention slows down that the tragedy explodes.
“We believe that at the general level there is still too little done to counter the phenomenon of accidents and the contrast can be exercised through multiple actions.
It is necessary, in our opinion - Mercandelli stressed - more controls and inspections, but also a stronger intervention on the training of workers, and this starting from the world of the school."
"A further effort is needed," he added, "in terms of communication and public awareness.
But above all, it requires a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers in the face of a social emergency phenomenon.”
Mercandelli then denounced "the progressive deterioration of the levels of compensatory protection for victims of labor" and the "assistance derivative towards which the system is pushing in recent years".
"The goal is therefore to return the worker the insurance guarantee - he added - so that the fate of those who are injured should not depend on spontaneity or indulgence from time to time arranged by the legislator."
MP3 Players Accused, Puting Hearing at Risk
Listening to high-volume music for an extended period of time using portable music devices such as Mp3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
This is what the European Commission reports, citing the opinion of the EU Scientific Committee on Emerging and Newly Identified Health Risks (Csrseri) published today.
“This scientific opinion shows that 5-10% of those who, for a period of at least 5 years, listen to music with portable music devices weekly for more than an hour a day while holding the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing capacity.”
"I am concerned that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable music devices and cell phones at high noise levels can unconsciously damage their hearing irreparably," says Meglena Kuneva.
“The scientific findings show a clear risk and we need to react quickly.
What matters most is that we need to raise consumer awareness and make this information public.
We must also review existing control systems, in the light of this scientific opinion, to ensure that they are fully effective and keep up with new technology.”
Brussels had asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine the problem, given the widespread use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to their noise.
Scientists confirm that there is reason for concern and the European Commission will now, together with Member States and stakeholders, consider what measures could be taken to better protect children and adolescents from exposure to noise from portable music devices and related equipment.
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable music equipment to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that can result from excessive exposure to such noise sources.
This damage can be greatly limited by using solutions such as reducing the levels and duration of noise exposure.
In its opinion, the EU Scientific Committee notes that users of portable music equipment listening to music in high volume (over 89 decibels) for only 5 hours a week exceeds the currently applicable maximum noise limits at work.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for longer periods are at risk of a permanent loss of hearing ability after a period of 5 years.
This would affect 5-10% of users of such devices and their number can be quantified between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Roma, Alemanno launches Commission for the future of the capital
Today it starts, in March it closes, in June the sums will be withdrawn.
This is the calendar set by the Campidoglio for the work of the "Commission for the future of Rome Capital", which has settled this morning in its new headquarters behind the Terme di Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and the other 49 members of the Commission will draw up the guidelines for Rome.
When the roads are closed in March, the city council and the municipal council will evaluate analyses and projects, so that they can present in June the Strategic Plan for Rome with the "official bullino" of Campidoglio and its mayor Gianni Alemanno.
"The Commission is absolutely independent and all the political, social and cultural ideas are represented - Alemanno emphasizes - It will have to provide proposals for an idea of development of Rome that the political decision-makers, which remain the Junta and the Municipal Council, will then be able to use.
There is no overlap of roles but only the will to have a place to work out a great project for Rome.
In March it will finish its work and then dissolve, because this experience must have a precise timeframe.
In June – announces the mayor – we will present the strategic plan using the work done by the Commission for the future of Roma Capitale.”
To those who accuse the Commission of uselessness, since its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: "It all depends on the work that the Commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals.
If the quality will be there, as in France with the Attali Commission and as I am sure in Rome, its contribution will be crucial.
Too often politics crushes on the management of the daily and on the emergencies that happen from time to time.
We, on the contrary, want to look longer and further, in a deeper perspective, working seriously on the development of Rome and its future.”
In addition, the mayor of Rome wants to point out that "this Commission is neither a useless entity nor a chariot: it is absolutely free, it will not cost a euro to Romanian citizens and will serve to reason and to involve the best intelligences that the Capital expresses."
For Alemanno, in fact, "it is necessary to have a strategic reference design, neither closed nor immobile, to allow our city to make an authentic leap of level, which it absolutely needs, thinking with a unitary spirit for its future."
A future that, the mayor of Rome, "will not be limited to the current municipal boundaries only but will look far beyond" not only in the perspective of the future metropolitan city and its legal status of Capital but also "in consideration of the role that Rome can and must play as the Capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president
He wrote a well-known American politician who keeps us going for independent: “Barack Obama will be the second anti-American president.
The first was Jimmy Carter, who with his decisions decimated the U.S. economy and had relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam.
The attacks on Obama are increasing as the election date approaches.
A Miami lady wrote on a web: “This person is full of ambition.
Obama has a big toast face: he believes he will win the highest post in a nation that has had two governors and five black senators in total!”
In fact, they are attacks that do not say much; they are attacks clearly of a racial nature and do not answer the question of the voters: will he be a good president?
There are people who speak with the heart, but not with the brain.
A Mississippi newspaper in the southern United States wrote an editorial: Once in the cabin to vote, we know well who the American patriot will vote for.
It comes out one side of the American mentality held covered up to the last.
“Say what you want, then we’ll think where to put the crochet, whether it’s Obama or McCain.”
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we will leave America.
Things never said before now, which appears almost the success of the black candidate.
However, despite all these arguments, the winning weapon for Democrats is George Bush.
They asked 1,500 people: what were the mistakes Bush made during his tenure? 89% answered: Iraq.
Change to America.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and was sent home to be kicked in the seat.
In Iraq there are 4,500 soldiers who lost their lives and the Americans were not forced to pack their bags.
Still, Iraq for the majority was Bush’s weak spot.
Whoever will take the place of George W will have a huge task to do.
In the United States, the economic downturn is also felt on journalists: in newspapers it is time for cuts.
Fifty-hundred American journalists were questioned by the PEW Research Center about the state of their profession and mind control with regard to the future.
Today, journalists are almost all pessimistic about their future.
However, newsmen have not openly stated that they feel less concerned about credibility.
They don’t feel as isolated as they once were.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
The 2008 crisis for these journalists is a crisis of a destroyed economic model.
In addition, the cuts made in the newsroom, in the room where the editors work to put together the newspapers, is a big problem.
It is a problem that needs to be solved, according to the journalists interviewed, if you do not want traditional journalism as the general public thinks to be substantially narrowed.
A clear but complex pessimism pervades the American journalist today.
Six out of ten newspapermen and senior executives are convinced that the national journalism is on the wrong track.
In the local field the executive group is 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It is not difficult for journalists to see where the web goes.
The major publishers are opening up a crossroads to the internet, for many seen as the “killer” of printed paper.
The “economic pressure” that journalists feel has risen to 79%.
The 500 journalists interviewed admitted that they are embracing technology in the hope that it “does something good” for their journalism.
The biggest gap in American journalism today is between those who run newsrooms – that is, the directors – and the reporters who work for them.
56% of executives at the national level are confident that their reporters share their values, while at the local level the percentage drops to 23%.
For some, this has to do with “employment safety.”
Executives who think they will lose their jobs within 3 years are at 47% nationally.
For staff reporters it is 30%.
The "safe work" at the staff level (our editors, ndr) in America is always on the agenda.
Only 13% of journalists work on a contract.
In a huge nation like the United States, with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, television and the internet, employers often offer what they want and so it becomes a matter of “take it or leave it,” take or leave.
Directors almost always get high salaries, while the editor can earn as much as $10,000 a month, in addition to retirement and insurance payments.
For holidays, then, the reasoning becomes complicated: tot days after the first year, tot after the third to reach 15 total days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, for their admission, often “sick” during the year.
It is all a matter of climate.
UNIPOL: Tribunal of Rome, Danilo Coppola remains in court
The president of the second criminal section of the court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the petition of the real estate owner Danilo Coppola who had asked to be able to move from his town, Grottaferrata, to a home in the city of Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy as part of the counter-trade investigation relating to the Unipol-Bnl climb.
In the course of the trial he was charged with, last week, he was released from the domiciliaries converted into a residence obligation in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, had asked that the real estate owner could take the route from the town of province to a home in the capital.
However, according to the court, these moves (to which the PM opposed) would allow him to influence his society and access the evidence that accuses him.
Elites in Danger
The phenomenon had already manifested itself a few days ago with the House of Representatives vote against the $700 billion bailout plan launched by the White House: a significant part of Americans was, and is, more interested in punishing Wall Street than saving the economy.
The New York Times of yesterday confirmed that the ongoing crisis is splitting the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, moderate, favorable to federal institutions and the business community, and its new soul, instead, conservative, hostile to "washington" and the world of finance, strong especially in the Central and Southern States.
The soul, for instance, which became prepotently alive with the vow of which I said in the beginning.
This, however, is only one example of the changes, of the great changes, which the ongoing economic earthquake foretells or already shows: not only in the United States but throughout the West and not even here alone.
Both in the United States and in Europe, the crisis seems to accelerate long-incubated phenomena that solidify in the new climate and finally come to light.
The first of these phenomena is the re-actualization, the extraordinary rise, of the double category State-Sovereignty in relation to a sort of re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis, in fact, is a crisis of banking-financial institutions which have, yes, close ties with the outside world, but which first and foremost see the budgets of people and families living in a single country, in a single state, involved in a very large extent.
What immediately creates a political problem for those who rule it: that is, how to respond to the difficulties and protests of those people and those families who, by the way, are also an electorate.
In short, the crisis appears to be globally economic, but politically it is almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems essentially out of play or has little to say: the striking proof is given by the European Union that divides as usual between different interests and between different state strategies fails to decide any common political line.
And so it is from the government of each individual state that everyone expects interventions, plans of rescue and relief, new rules, and above all funding: since when you get to the narrow are only the states who own the economic resources, the mass of financial resources able to try to put things back in the sixth.
And they also possess the necessary means and the legitimacy to use them: two resources of incommensurable value, in certain circumstances, of which probably no market or international organization will ever be able to dispose in a similar extent.
This new emphasis that the crisis places on the status-national element is in perfect harmony with the increasing importance that the most recent developments in the economy tend to attribute to a factor very closely linked to that element: territoriality.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we were convinced that we had now entered the realm of the network, of the increasingly sophisticated technology, of the intangible, while we were convinced that the globalized finance was now destined to dominate the world, we suddenly realized that our future will instead have to deal with those very little intangible things that are water, harvests, oil.
All things that, look a little, can be transported from one place to another of the earth but are still connected in an absolute way to a confined space, to a territory.
So the one who finds himself to be a sovereign has many more cards than the one who is not, the one who is unlucky to live in a place without harvest, without oil and without water.
I come to the second novelty, which presupposes a fracture.
Whoever says Territory, State, Government, inevitably says Politics, and therefore Leadership.
In this regard, the economic crisis seems to produce two convergent phenomena.
On the one hand, the awareness of the objective need for authoritative leadership, the demand for someone who knows how to take over the situation.
On the other hand, a wave of discredit for existing leadership, economic species, revealed so inadequate and full of shadow zones.
And at the same time something even deeper and in a sense disturbing: a discredit, an insufficiency, an image of inadequacy, a sense of distance, which tends to involve the entire ruling class in an increasing number of Western countries.
That is to say, it seems that in vast sectors of the population, the belief that before their actions are the same ideas as the social elites so far in rise, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the overall sense of the term, has made their own time and is increasingly foreign to the opinions of the majorities.
The demand for leadership, in short, subterraneanly nourishes a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the ruling classes and traditional political structures, which manifests itself in the sudden "revolts" of the elections or in the sudden upsurges of the collective moods of recent and most recent times, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavaria to the collapse of Labour consensus in Britain, to the rebellion of American congressmen against Bush (and even the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
There is the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programs, but also their rites, their newspapers, their accredited intellectuals, their formats would say somebody, make it increasingly difficult to understand, and therefore to represent, what is not from today taking shape in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is revitalizing, increasing, potentially agitating to excess.
In the face of all this, speaking of a “mass rebellion” on the agenda would be frankly exaggerated.
Keeping your eyes open is not for nothing.
The supercloth to walk on the walls
Defeat the laws of gravity with a super glue and in the future walk on the walls like Spiderman.
It is the target of several American research centers and now a team of four institutes has gone very close to it.
With a sticker of only 2.5 square centimeters, the researchers managed to stick a body of 100 kilograms onto a vertical wall.
The American journal Science published the findings of some researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material invented by the team of scientists is an evolution of existing ones that use a particular structure of carbon, called carbon nanotubes.
“The principle of glue can be imagined as a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti,” explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The scientists were inspired by the legs of the geeks, covered with microscopic hairs that manage to ensure a perfect adhesion to the animal.
Tests conducted on different materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times more potent than the legs of these reptiles and at the same time "is easily removed from the wall," explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Dayton.
“This material could be useful as a transitory sticker,” adds Liming Dai.
Maybe to walk on the walls just like Spiderman? Maybe yes, but researchers think of a much less fascinating use such as the connection between electronic devices, because carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and electric current.
Other applications could involve aerospace engineering.
No superheroes at the moment.
The ALTRA RESEARCH – The University of Berkeley, California, is also working on a new sticker.
In an article in the journal of the American Chemical Society, California scientists presented a patch made of microfiber-like hair that cleanses itself from dust while moving onto a surface to always maintain a perfect grip.
Medicines: Never with fruit juices
Beware of grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
These drinks, consumed especially in the summer because they are sedative and rich in vitamins, if taken simultaneously with some life-saving drugs alter their absorption by amplifying or decreasing their effectiveness depending on the cases with even serious health consequences.
To reiterate the risks of both packaged and fresh fruit juices associated with the intake of certain medicines, David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario in London, who from the 236th national meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia is launching a new alarm: a glass of grapefruit, orange and apple juice is enough to reduce the absorption of some life-saving drugs, cancelling their beneficial effects and putting the health of patients at risk.
The grapefruit juice had already ended up under accusation because it was considered responsible for increasing to levels considered toxic the effects of some antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines and neurological.
The same Italian Agency of the drug had given news in a newsletter two years ago warning doctors and patients not to underestimate the danger arising from this mix and to pay attention to what you drink in case you take drugs such as Diazepam or Metadone.
Not only butterflies - According to experts, orange juice and apple juice also contain substances that inhibit drugs.
Along the list of active ingredients inhibited by grapefruit and other juices.
From here comes the appeal of Michele Carruba, director of the department of pharmacology at the State University of Milan: “These findings are generally immediately to the various international and national drug agencies, which eventually proceed to change the informative notes of the drugs.
So always read the leaflets of the medicines you take and if there is something that is not clear to us, do not make us impress but ask for clarifications from the doctor or pharmacist," he said.
Nobel Prize in Economics to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to the American Paul Krugman for his studies of trade models and the localization of economic activities.
Krugman, 55, is a Neokeynesian who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known New York Times editor.
Krugman is one of the major critics of the Bush administration’s economic and foreign policy choices.
A few months after the September 2001 attacks, in the days of Enron’s bankruptcy, Krugman had predicted in an editorial published in the New York Times that the second event would be more decisive than the first, in terms of consequences on U.S. history.
A prediction that sparked not a few controversies and that for years was faced with the economist, but which now proved to be accurate.
“I am surprised and also a little shocked at the speed with which the memory of scandals like the collapse of Enron or Worldcom have disappeared from the public’s attention,” Krugman said at the end of 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, the executive committee of the European Central Bank, Krugman is a “very valuable economist”, but also a “very aggressive, especially critical disclosure style against the excessive liberalism of the Bush administration.”
Open Office is the third edition of the anti-Microsoft package.
It is the day of the release of OpenOffice.org 3.0, the open source personal productivity suite that aims to reach more and more users, from home to office, from professionals to public administration, as a free alternative to the most famous Microsoft Office.
After almost a year of work by volunteer developers, behind whom SUN Microsystem oversees, the new Open Office is shown to the general public with several new features: the welcome screen and the revised and less spartan interface are added, other more substantial such as native compatibility for the Apple Mac OS X operating system and support for the new format ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest version of the ISO standard.
Attention also to the interoperability with the Office 2007 suite, Open Office is able to open documents with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Interesting some specific features of some forms such as the one that allows you to reduce the size of PowerPoint presentations, useful for example to send them by email, or the ability to import PDF files into the graphics processing form, while retaining the original appearance of the page.
Also on this front you can create "hybrid PDF" documents, which accumulate the typical graphics of the format of Adobe with the elements of a spreadsheet or a text processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received several improvements within the applications: in the spreadsheet you can intervene multiple hands between different users, avoiding conflicts on changes, in the text processor, each collaborator is assigned a color in the comments for better recognizability in the review phase.
Some companies are also working to bring some OpenOffice features to the web (on the cloud, on the cloud), and in the coming weeks they are expected to release the final result.
The English version can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and has been added to the English version that was on mirrors since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, as usual the suite is also available for the Linux operating system.
On request, the installation CD can also be sent home or at work.
And if the theme of gratuity can be a trailer for the spread in the homes, it is precisely in the business area that the Open Office suite tries the big bet, already being able to count on several projects implemented in the public administration and schools.
And there are even realities that offer an ideal training, consulting and assistance service for small and medium-sized, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main modules: Writer, for the paid video writing of Word; Calc, is the spreadsheet that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for Powerpoint emulo presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the most famous Access is the program that allows you to work on databases; Draw, is finally the graphic module.
The goal for 2008 is to reach 5 million downloads, and considering that so far we are almost 3 million and 600 thousand, with the release of the new version it is likely that you can even exceed the expected figure.
Kohl is the fourth case of doping.
A new case of positivity at the last Tour de France: it is the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third classified and winner of the best climbing shirt.
This is by the website of the newspaper L’Equipe.
The 26 year old Kohl is the fourth positive runner at the Cera, the Epo of the third generation, after the Italians Riccardo Riccò and Leonardo Piepoli and the German Stefan Schumacher, also from the Gerolsteiner.
The analysis on Kohl’s blood samples is one of those carried out in recent weeks by laboratories in Lausanne and Chatenay-Malabry.
If the counter-analyses confirm the positivity at Cera, the Austrian will lose the third place on the Tour and will face two years of canonical disqualification.
To confirm the news of Kohl's positivity to the third generation Epoch is the head of the French anti-doping agency, Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he notified the positivity to the Austrian authorities.
The 26-year-old Austrian was placed on the final podium behind the Spanish Carlos Sastre and the American Cadel Evans, also winning the best climbing shirt.
The New York Times: Is Italy racist?
Italy “from a country of immigrants has only recently become a privileged destination for immigrants” welcomed with reluctance.
This is what is being asked in a long article by the New York Times that has devoted a long article to the debate on racism in Italy starting from the case of the young Abdul William Guibre from Burkina Faso killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the Nyt calls the “northern paradox”: the northern regions are at the same time those where there is “more integration and more work” but also “the country’s highest anti-immigrant sentiment and the highest support for the League of the North”.
To confirm the growing tension between Italians and immigrants, Nyt also cited the episodes of intolerance in Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampino and Castel Volturno.
and not only.
The new legislation wanted by the League that tightened the brakes on immigration and facilitated the expulsion of illegals is also cited as a paradigm of climate change in Italy.
“Giorgio Napolitano, meeting with Benedict XVI at the Quirinale, asked that the State and the Church work together to defeat racism.”
Students victims of car rental up to 900 euros per room
The university rental market is not in crisis.
According to the latest survey by Sunia, the union of tenants, taking a single room can cost a student up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"The phenomenon has now taken very serious character to the point of excluding entire groups of young people from the right to study for the very high overall costs that families of origin should bear - explains the head of the study office of Sunia, Laura Mariani - in these cities the strong demand from students has so distorted the market that triggered a generalized increase process even for residents."
In most cases, rental offers then contain a number of violations: free-type contracts, unregistered, no limit of fee, related sub-leases.
For the Sunia, extraordinary interventions are needed that, through the revision of the taxation, can calm prices.
Looking at the details of the survey, we see that in Milan, for a bed in the area of Brianza, it takes about 450 euros; for a single room it ranges from a minimum of 650 (zone Bande Nere) to an average value of 800 (zone Lambiate, Udine and Fiera) to a maximum of 900 (zone Vittoria).
In Florence, a bed cost an average of 350/400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students concentrate in areas close to the University, it takes 250/280 euros for a double bed, from 370 to 500 for a single bed.
In Rome, in areas close to central universities (San Lorenzo, Piazza Bologna), about 600 euros are asked for a single room, 450 for a double bed.
It is not only slightly lower (550 euros for a single room) in areas close to the other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
You save only if you move to the outskirts: 300 euros for a bed and 450 one in Prenestina, Centocelle and similar areas.
In Naples, for a bedroom you need 300/450 euros, for a room you spend from 400 to 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei areas.
In Bari for a bedroom you need 250/350 euros, at least 350 for a single bed.
In smaller cities prices are lower in absolute terms, but they have a greater weight in the city economy.
In the cities where the phenomenon of leases to non-Community students is more common, such as in Perugia, an additional anomaly is recorded: the increase of about 25/30% of the fee required for foreign students compared to that applied to Italians.
Goodbye old cinema Paradise, the cities delete the historic halls
Historic cinemas are closing in favor of the Multiplex.
“A city without cinemas is a blind city, it is like a face without eyes.”
The image offered by the director Giuseppe Tornatore effectively photographs what is happening in the major Italian urban centers but also in the cities of the province.
The process of marginalization of cinemas, with the birth in the outskirts of the large multisales and the subsequent death by conjunction of the monosales in the central areas of the cities, is one of those events that seem inevitable and uncontestable to us but also has all the characteristics of a real cultural crime.
"It is as if a friend, a acquaintance with whom we shared a piece of street and many emotions were missing," notes the director of Nuovo cinema Paradiso, the film that twenty years ago won Tornatore the Oscar and the Grand Prix of the Cannes jury, and which told the poetry of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way to live the cinema lost forever.
The figures provided by the ANEC, the main association of businessmen, speak clearly: in the last five years they have closed the main 316 cinemas of the traditional type, and paying the biggest shock are mainly the halls in the main cities: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by the closures is Emilia-Romagna with 82 monosale cinemas lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And to demonstrate that the first responsible for their disappearance is the advent of the multiplex, these are the three Italian regions that have recorded the most new multisale cinemas: 195 more screens in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 both in Tuscany and in Emilia-Romagna.
"The Italian exercise has developed irrationally," observes Paolo Protti, president of the ANEC, "it is useful that new structures are built but the survival of those already existing should be guaranteed, because when a city hall closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to the multiplex.
To not mention the lack of funding for the fund in favour of the farmers: the previous debt of the state is about 10 million euros.
It is shameful, from an ethical and moral point of view, that the Government does not respect existing laws.
It would cost between €16 million and €18 million a year to support the sector.”
Interesting is the case of Bologna, the first Italian city that, concerned about the closures, decided to rush to the shelter with the signing of a protocol between Comune and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy, to protect and promote the monosala cinemas both in the historic centre and in the outskirts.
The rules include tax relief measures for operators and benefits for the public in terms of mobility: viewers will be able to enter the traffic-restricted area and will have special rates for stops and in some parking lots.
“It’s an initiative that I like,” says Giuseppe Tornatore, “and I hope other cities will follow the example of Bologna by putting in place other measures.
It is certain, however, that in order to counter the crackdown of multiplex traditional rooms must also improve the quality of sound and image, because the audience today is more demanding.
The defense of traditional cinema is a theme that has always been important to me: the closure of the Supercinema di Bagheria, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to do "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I have lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk in front of the Rialto or Quirinale de Via Nazionale now closed, where I have lived so many shared emotions, not to see the posters filled with dust I turn to the other side.
This is the most important part of the world’s economy.
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to align the municipality's choices with the interests of the Piromalli shell."
In addition, it is important to note that the use of the product is not limited to the quality of the product, as well as the quality of the product.
In the hands also Gioacchino Piromalli, the elderly mediator between the clan and public administrations, and his nephew lawyer, the same name of the boss, already convicted for association for mafia-style crimes, sentenced to compensation 10 million euros.
"In detriment of any legal and moral norm, as well as common sense," the prosecutors wrote, the two local administrations had expressed their willingness to pay advice to lawyer Piromalli.
“It would have been so permitted to the shell – the judges write – to officially enter within the municipalities facilitating the already huge possibilities of control and direction of the public administration.”
The president of the regional junta of Calabria, Agazio Loiero, does not hide that "collusions between local authorities and organized misery are numerous" in his region: "There are areas where the mafia intensity is stronger than in others, where the collusion is almost inevitable.
But there are so many local politicians who resist the pressure of the 'ndrangheta, heroes who keep themselves clean.'
This is the first time that we have been able to do this, and the first time that we have been able to do this, we have been able to do this.
From the end of last April, the municipal council of Gioia Tauro was dissolved but already in 1991, and always due to alleged conditioning between organized crime and local administration, local politicians had been lifted from the task of administering the municipality.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, mayor of the UDC at the time of the dissolution, had been elected to head a center-right coalition, after the ballot in May 2006.
He cried out to the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the municipal council.
He called on the then Deputy Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti, accusing him of having architected the whole for a political issue, but the judges, in the arrest warrant signed this morning, explain that the Piromalli shell had even come to ask for the change of the A3 project.
In addition to this, it is important to keep in mind that this is the most important part of your life, and that it is the most important part of your life, and that it is the most important part of your life.
When the energy arises from the waves now the big ones descend into the field.
It is an extinct landfill, which occupies more than 70% of the planet’s surface, and is now being discovered by the world’s major energy companies.
Waves, currents, tides are the new renewable sources on which they have put their eyes, and now they are trying to put their hands, giants like the Chevron.
The possibility of extracting energy from sea movements has been studied for a hundred years now and in the 1970s, in conjunction with the first oil crisis, the research intensified.
When oil prices dropped, around 1980, the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside, but now environmental instances and the new rise in oil give momentum to the industry.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London estimated in 2007 that 15 percent of the world’s electricity demand could be covered by ocean wave exploration plants.
That would be twice the amount currently produced by nuclear power plants.
In addition, there will be floods and tide.
Colossus at the attack.
The first company to bet on marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 signed an agreement to build a plant in northern Portugal.
When the agreement was announced it seemed to be a revolutionary step.
Two years away, more and more companies are betting on marine energy and among these companies have always voted for traditional energy.
“Chevron is studying ocean energy technologies,” a spokesman for a company affiliated with the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, “and is considering the possibility of cooperating with us.”
The cooperation in question concerns obtaining a permit from the U.S. Energy Commission, necessary to launch a marine energy exploitation project in Alaska.
It is a sign of no shortage, especially considering that it is in Alaska that the U.S. continues to extract oil and recently President Bush has launched a plan for further drilling.
In addition to Chevron, there are Verdant Power Inc. in New York and Ocean Power in New Jersey on the road of energy coming from the sea, and the sums invested so far, although unknown in details, indicate, according to observers, rising interest.
Technology to be developed.
Experts speak of a technology still in the dawn, also because marine energy does not escape all doubts about the environmental impact.
For now, plants such as the Portuguese or some in Scotland are small in size and do not seem to create major problems to the ecosystem.
To produce energy on a large scale, however, technologies with a greater environmental impact must be used.
And the choices are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a boe system connected to each other.
The push of the waves, which causes the boe to move up and down, is converted into hydraulic pressure by pistons and cylinders inside the floaters.
The pressure causes a turbine to spin, which in turn fuels a generator.
Electricity is sent to the shore through submarine cables.
For now, there are four such plants under construction, waiting only for federal approval, and part of the energy could be used for a military installation.
The Verdant Power, on the other hand, already produces power for a shopping center and a parking lot using six submarine turbines in New York’s East River.
The movement of water when there are tides causes the turbine pales to rotate, creating a rotating movement that fuels a generator.
Verdant said it has a long list of customers waiting for the necessary permissions to take advantage of the energy.
After the waves, the tide.
A particular interest, they say to the Institute for Electricity Research, deserves at this time the potential of tides.
Although this is an intermittent phenomenon, tide is more predictable than wind, sun or waves and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is precisely on tidal energy that states such as New York, Maine and Alaska, along with others overlooking the coast, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and forecast investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
