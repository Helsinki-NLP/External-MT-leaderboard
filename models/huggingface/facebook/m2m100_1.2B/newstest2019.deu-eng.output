Nevertheless, the nine “Beautiful Munich” candidates deliver on the shooting with People photographer Tuan and challenge wind, mud and rain like real professionals.
The romantic shooting is in the video:
DFB chief Grindel sees no basis for Özil’s comeback
Berlin DFB President Reinhard Grindel currently sees no basis for Mesut Özil’s return to the national team.
"This is a question that, of course, depends on the fact that one comes into conversation, that one also talks with him about why he apparently felt the one or the other as it is outlined in his statement," Grindel said in the football podcast "Phrase Cutter" to the "Bild-Zeitung.
Despite the months-long debate over Özil’s photos with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the resignation of the 92-time national player Özil.
“I would have been happy if Mesut Özil had continued to play for Germany.
I also assumed until a certain point that it would be so," Grindel said.
The 29-year-old had announced his resignation from the DFB team in July and also justified it with the fact that Grindel did not defend him against racist hostility during the World Cup.
The DFB chief repeated his criticism of Özil that he was not ready for a conversation with Bundestrainer Joachim Löw and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He didn’t want to build pressure, but he knows it from football so that when “you leave a team or change a club, you talk about it with your coach and I’m sorry that this conversation hasn’t happened so far.”
Linz: garden hut in Schrebergartensiedlung burned
At 14.13 a.m., the professional fire department of Linz was alerted to a fire in the Angererhofweg.
Because a high-voltage line runs directly over the Schrebergarten settlement, there was danger in delay.
The firefighters came out and found the hut in full fire when they arrived.
The roof had to be removed practically entirely and fire was cleared to the extent strictly necessary.
According to the owner of the burning garden cottage, he infected a battery for the store at noon.
This could be the cause of the fire.
According to the fire department, the fire was in the area of the greatest fire intensity.
The damage caused by the fire has yet to be determined, as is the cause of the fire.
It is likely to be considerable, however, because the owner had a lot of collector pieces in his garden hut.
Angry mother defends: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on open street
What caused Lindsay Lohan to do this strange thing?
She wanted to kidnap the children of a alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, "Herbie: Fully Loaded") has itself streamed live how she apparently wants to kidnap a family in Moscow.
This is by the US portal "TMZ" and published a partial clip of the stream.
“Kissed to Happiness” with Lindsay Lohan
The clip shows Lohan coming out of a car and going to a possibly homeless family, who wants to have them taken out as a refugee family from Syria.
As the family runs away from the actress, Lohan pursues the parents and their children.
They accuse adults of trafficking in children.
She does not provide any evidence for this in the clip.
"The whole world is seeing this right now," Lohan is heard in the video as she continues to follow the family along the street.
Apparently she is trying to separate the children from their parents.
At some point, however, it seems to be enough for the obviously angry mother.
It looks like she turns around and Lohan misses an earpiece.
In tears, the actress says how shocked she is - and she holds her cheek.
What moved Lohan to this action is currently completely unclear.
Landing on Ryugu: This task has "mascot" on the asteroid
The Hayabusa-2 spacecraft was launched in Japan in December 2014.
It is supposed to get so close to the asteroid Ryugu that it can absorb material from its surface and bring it to Earth.
The lander "Mascot" will stay on Ryugu.
Foreign ticker: death toll in Sulawesi rises to more than 400
After the severe 7.5-magnitude earthquake and subsequent tsunami on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, at least 420 people have died.
The number of victims could rise even further.
The rescue teams have not yet entered the devastated and cut off areas from the outside world.
Elon Musk resigns as CEO of Tesla
In the beginning was a tweet.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk caused unrest in the stock markets in early August when he announced a withdrawal of the electric car maker.
The U.S. Stock Exchange regulator sued him for fraud, but now both have agreed.
Tesla and Musk have to pay, and the Tesla chief executive resigns from the supervisory board, but he can remain chairman of the board.
Congress of the British Conservatives
Strong Guard - Party Congress of the Tories
Birmingham becomes the stage of a power struggle.
The party's congress is scheduled to cover foreign policy, trade and development policy, but the four-day conference will be overshadowed by the dispute between Prime Minister Theresa May and the Brexit hardliners, at the forefront of former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson.
Referendum on a new name
Foreign Ministers of Macedonia (right) and Greece have agreed
Macedonia is a country in the Balkans, but Macedonia is also a province in northern Greece.
Skopje and Athens have been arguing over the name doubling for years.
Now you have agreed.
The state of Macedonia will be called North Macedonia in the future and the people will vote on it this Sunday - will it go well?
Protests in Brazil against Bolsonaro.
“Ele Nao” means Jair Bolsonaro.
A week before the presidential election in Brazil, the mood in the country is divided.
Thousands took to the streets in several cities to protest against the right-wing populist Jair Bolsonaro.
The “Trump of Brazil” presents himself as an anti-system candidate and is thus at the forefront of the polls.
His strongest competitor is Fernando Haddad of the Left Workers Party.
Audi: “Dieselgate” process takes longer than planned
“The diesel task force still exists,” said Peter Mertens, chief development officer, to the industry newspaper “Automobilwoche”.
Audi chief executive Rupert Stadler announced in December 2017 that the task force would soon be dissolved.
“In the first quarter of 2018, all engine/transmission combinations are expected to be tested,” he said at the time.
Mertens said: “At the beginning of July, we reached an important step-by-step goal in addressing the diesel crisis.
We have completed the internal technical analysis of our VTDI engines.
The task force was formed in September 2015 following the discovery of the diesel scandal at Audi-mother Volkswagen.
Mertens stressed that the car manufacturer has made "great organizational changes" so that such a scandal never happens again.
VW’s supervisory board postponed a decision on Stadler’s future on Friday and plans to continue discussions on Tuesday.
The investigative authorities accuse the head of Audi of having authorized the sale of diesel cars with incorrect exhaust values after the emissions fraud became known.
He knew about the manipulation or deliberately ignored it.
At present, Bram Schot, Sales Director, leads the company as Commissionary Chief Executive Officer.
Due to the transition to the new WLTP emissions and consumption testing standard, there are production breaks in Audi, Schot told "Heilbronner Stimme".
Basically, he sees a decreasing demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, which are produced in Neckarsulm.
“The segment itself is difficult,” he said.
We are focusing on electric mobility.
For the e-tron, the first Audi electric car, 15,000 reservations have already been made.
Grindel seeks re-election - Lahm to join DFB presidency
Mainz (dpa) - Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup Out and the Özil affair, Reinhard Grindel will again run for office as DFB president next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," Grindel said as a guest in the early Sunday morning at ZDF's "Current Sport Studio."
You have to try again and again to re-elect, I will.
Then we need to see if there is support.
The head of the association, according to his own words, would find it "strange" if after the award for the 2024 World Cup he did not have "the desire to cooperate on the future project".
Grindel has been the head of the association since April 2016 as the successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who was overthrown over the summer fairy tale affair.
In the autumn of 2016, he was elected for a first full three-year term.
The next vote will be held at the DFB Bundestag on September 27, 2019.
Philipp Lahm, the future chief organizer of the European Championship, is expected to participate in the DFB presidium.
“I would be pleased if my colleagues in the board agreed that he will continue to advise in this role in the board in the future and then, of course, will be warmly invited to provide his experience in sports matters,” Grindel said.
To speculate whether Lahm could become his successor as DFB chief, he did not want to participate.
As a consequence of the affair over the photos of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed the desire that a national player without a migration background should become the DFB’s integration ambassador in the future.
Currently, this office is held by the native Brazilians Cacau and Celia Sasic, the latter has family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background is clearly involved in society and football and says, 'the topic is important, we have to take care of it,' that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our clubs on the spot where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Weight Loss with Semi-Smart Weight
I have had a new toy for 4 weeks.
A scale that measures not only my weight, but also the body fat percentage.
Muscle and bone mass can also show them.
The body mass index is also calculated by the thing, but it is more for the sausage.
I didn’t know if he replaced fat with muscle.
Basketball Bundesliga: clear start-up success for Berlin and Oldenburg
ALBA Berlin has entered the new season of the Basketball Bundesliga with a clear victory.
Against Science City Jena, the Deputy Champion won easily with 112:55 (52:31) and offered a convincing match over 40 minutes.
Rokas Giedraitis was the top scorer of the dominant Berliners with 20 points.
The national player Johannes Thiemann (18 counters) also showed an appealing performance in front of 9113 spectators at his debut in compulsory play.
Former champion Brose Bamberg won the obligatory game debut of coach Ainars Bagatskis with 84:80 (39:37) at s.Oliver Würzburg.
Augustine Rubit was the best cast among the guests with 24 points.
Wurzburg professional Gabriel Olaseni came on 14 counters.
Last year's playoff semi-finalist MHP Riesen Ludwigsburg defeated the Fraport Skyliners from Frankfurt with 83:76 (41:34).
New national player Karim Jallow was the safest shooter with 24 points with the team of coach John Patrick.
EWE Baskets Oldenburg started the new season with a clear success.
At Basketball Löwen Braunschweig there was a clear 100:64 (48:30) and the first two points.
New player Will Cummings surpassed the Oldenburgers with 25 counters.
The Braunschweigers, with whom NBA star Dennis Schröder has owned the majority since the beginning of the season, disappointed after a good first quarter.
A 26:1 run of the baskets quickly provided clear proportions.
Erdogan opens mosque in Cologne
Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib Mosque in Cologne on Saturday.
Erdogan had previously met with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier during his three-day state visit.
Criticism of Germany
In his opening speech, Erdoğan called on the German government to extradite Gülen supporters living in Germany and to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens, no matter where they live.
We will not allow supporters of the PKK or the Gülen movement to shake our citizens and harm the German-Turkish friendship,” he said.
For the opening of the Ditib Mosque, the central city of Cologne was partially closed.
Thousands of police officers were involved, including snipers.
The Islamic Association Ditib is criticized for being regarded as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
"Global Citizen Festival": Music Against Poverty: Stars, screams and horror seconds
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B have called for greater commitment to fighting poverty and disease at a joint concert in New York’s Central Park.
"Engage wherever you can," Mendes said at the festival on Sunday night in front of some 60,000 spectators.
Thank you for coming here, it’s a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a red outfit with a gold microphone.
I’m nervous, I sweat, but it’s okay, because I’m here and ready to change the world.
Actors such as Hugh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, as well as representatives of governments, the United Nations and humanitarian organizations, also appeared on stage during the multi-hour show.
In the meantime, however, there was a second of horror when many spectators considered the sound of a falling metal lock as shots, got scared and tried to escape.
Panic broke out, people were confused.
Seven spectators were slightly injured, organizer Hugh Evans said.
But then the New York police and musician Chris Martin calmed the people off the stage.
“No one is trying to hurt anyone,” Martin said.
You are all safe.
Tickets for the “Global Citizen Festival” concert were available free of charge on the Internet as every year.
Those who wanted to get one had to read and disseminate on the Internet texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and diseases.
For the numerous musicians and actors, there was jubilation and applause from the audience - applause for Republican Senator Jeff Flake.
He, along with his Democratic counterpart Chris Coons, called for greater equality between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake had spoken in the U.S. Senate Justice Committee for the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh as Supreme Court judge, thus hitting many women in the head.
At least three women have filed allegations of abuse, including attempted rape against Kavanaugh, which he denies.
Flake called for an FBI investigation into the allegations after two women who had allegedly experienced sexual assault faced him in an elevator on the way to a committee meeting.
"You can also come together with me in an elevator at any time," Flake told the crowd at the concert in New York.
Freedom of the press: Federal government defends the expulsion of the journalist
Government spokesman Steffen Seibert defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the office of Chancellor, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had worn a T-shirt with the Turkish and German inscription "Freedom for Journalists" and had gone into the first row.
The t-shirt was not the problem, Seibert told the picture on Sunday.
It was a disruption to the press conference.
The action of the journalist has caused a lot of unrest, which is unacceptable.
He prompted security guards to bring the man out.
Seibert said it was not allowed to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences at the Federal Chancellor’s Office.
This applies regardless of whether it is a legitimate concern or not.
The rules are the rules.
Many journalists are in prison in Turkey.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage or support or membership in banned parties or the Fethullah Gulen movement.
The Turkish leadership blames the movement for the failed coup attempt on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists are facing several decades in prison.
Even foreign journalists are not safe from the Turkish authorities: only in early September was Austrian journalist Max Zirngast arrested.
Recently, the cases of the imprisoned journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel had caused alarm.
Although they were released and were able to return to Germany, trials against them are still ongoing in Turkey.
Florian David Fitz with Ina Müller
So fresh and good-looking his fans usually know him: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look at it twice: Yes, this is really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor was in Hamburg - and experienced a wild night!
The talk show "Inas Nacht" produced by the NDR is known for humid joyful conversations at the barracks of the Hamburg port "Schellfischposten".
Moderator Ina Müller stumbles with her guests on some beer, some wine or even higher-percentage drinks to lure the mood and tongues.
Not a few celebrities also take courage for the mandatory singing inserts.
On Friday, another episode of the popular talk show was recorded.
This time there: actor Florian David Fitz known from films such as "Men's Hearts", "Terror - Your Judgment" or "The Most Enchanted Day".
The trip to the high north did not go well.
On Saturday he posted a selfie - his face is completely crushed on it, the eyes only two small slits left.
The bed selfie depicts a completely exhausted Florian David Fitz.
But he is not sick, he only has a powerful cat.
Addressing his fans, he posted some – probably not very serious – findings that he has now gained: “Rule one: never go to Inas night.
Rule Two: Never drink the black sau.
and injection.
And the round of egg liqueur, which Ina throws at half three, also leaves away.
Alcohol consumption is actually written in the face of the 43-year-old.
His fans immediately posted a few tips to combat the aftermath.
They ranged from instant bouillon, fish bread or – probably the most effective – headache pills.
Others simply seeing the usually attractive movie star.
How Ina Müller survived the nightly sauvage is not yet known.
But since she has been moderating the TV fun at the box office since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much more experienced.
A beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa is struggling with vandalism and outrage
The entrance to the 36 km long railway in the Red Cappeland in Treysa is difficult to find and confusing.
Recipes for grassroots vandalism are being sought, but solutions hardly appear.
Scraps, cigarette caps, garbage and rubbish, demolished garbage cans and now dismantled signs - this is how the entry with a seating group to the bike path on the Haaße hill in Treysa has been presented for a long time.
For the display object Rainradweg in Redkapchenland a more than disgraceful view.
The topic has been concerned by members of the ADFC local group Schwalmstadt but also others for a long time, according to the city's cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The issue has already been addressed in the Railway Council.
There is no solution so far.
The proposals ranged from the relocation of the seating group to the regular emptying of the waste containers and the cleaning of the areas at the entry point.
"I think the latter would be the order of the hour - regardless of possible further activities," says Desüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) reports that the issue has also been introduced to the local council.
It’s not just the garbage that drives cyclists and residents around – the sitting group is a regular meeting place to celebrate on weekends.
Not only is it often noisy, but the layers are also destroyed: posts are torn from the ground, garbage glues are demolished, signs are torn, seating furniture is defiled.
Volunteers would have already cleaned up more often, says ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
But the actions are only the proverbial drop on the hot stone.
They are upset that the resting place on the cycling path in Treysa is a meeting point for sauflagging.
“Thro the cycling path, the focus is clearly here on Haaße-Hügel,” confirms the cycling officer, who is now also taking care of the new cycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
“If they suffer the same fate, it will be very expensive.”
Another idea is a video surveillance on the hill: "Per this puts the threshold to engage in common property much higher.
However, this would require a police station to arrive soon.
Basically, Desert Hagen wants to develop the Haaße Hill.
It needs to be made more attractive.
With the frequency of the cycling route so far, one can be very satisfied.
Tourism marketing is still expanding.
Our cycling path is of very high quality compared to other in Germany,” said the ADFC members.
A highly critical danger point, ADFC member Susanne Klippert assesses the situation in the Ascheröder Straße in Treysa.
There is no trail on the Haaße hill.
In the event of heavy traffic, it can happen that cyclists have to wait in the middle of the road between both sides of the traffic flow,” she explains.
This is not a problem for sports drivers, but for the elderly and especially for children.
Music contest at the Cultural Railway Station: the "Kö von Hiltrup" and the lake
The first call to the music contest was a success, creative and in collaboration.
"D a song for Hiltrup" is the call of the district offensive Hiltrup, in the "music contest for large and small, young and experienced musicians".
A contest “with eyewinkles in the sympathetic Hiltruper family”, as Karl Franke formulated.
In fact, it was soon a family gathering at coffee and cake by the volunteers of the Cultural Railway.
Seven formations performed, from the one-man band to the large ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with guitar, Rolf Ihmig, a long-lived Albachtener in Hiltrup, the Nine of the "Hiltruper Star Colors", three members and three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling and the Zwarties.
This contest, said district mayor Joachim Schmidt, was a novelty.
We have not seen this in other cities.
What were the texts linked to?
Among the places, the Hiltruper Lake and the Market Avenue were frequently mentioned.
Rolf Ihmig crowned the alley in his beat-like song to "Kö von Hiltrup".
The railway station was also appreciated.
Again and again it was about experiencing each other in these places, especially with Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke animated the short renovations with short interviews with the performers or references to their creations.
Humberg learned that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also taught guitar.
From sound technician Stefan Schemmelmann, Franke that he recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a large event of BASF with Barclay James Harvest on the program.
Alvin Jasic has posted on YouTube.
“It’s not about winning,” Franke said.
In fact, all participants received a gift from the Hiltruper gastronomy.
However, there was something special for the favorites of the jury - so that others can listen to their songs too.
An entire CD can be recorded by Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: Ihmig with his Hiltrup batter, which Franke impressed with his musicality, and the "Lummerland-Rudel": "a very beautiful performance" with ten children and two educators on guitar and Cajon, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the kids came back to the final again – and sounded “very good” even without electronic support, as Franke said.
The jury was guided by the aspects of originality, reference to the Hiltrup, intrusiveness of the melody and recognizability.
The jury consisted of Gisbert Keller of the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß of the KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers of the Economic Association, as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive had launched the event on the occasion of its ten-year anniversary.
She described the event as a complete success.
Everyone was "very satisfied" and "the atmosphere was good" at the soon-to-be very full cultural railway station.
The word game: "Decrypto" in the game test
The players form two teams facing each other.
For each page there is a viewing screen, containing four cards with keywords that you can only decipher – the old trick with the red slide – once you have inserted them in.
In this way, it is guaranteed that the other side can read nothing even by accident.
On the cards, for example, read from left to right: "Renaissance.
The second window.
Third cube.
The Fourth Party.”
These are the terms that must be encrypted from now on.
It is not the terms that should be guessed, but the codes.
Alternately, one player per team is the encryptor.
He gets a code card which may be marked "3.4.2".
Guess in "Decrypto" are not the terms behind the secret film, but their encryption codes.
His task in this case is to describe - in this order and in this example - the terms "wrap", "fest" and "window" - in such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team is not possible; for that wins the game if he manages to crack the code twice.
So the encryptor notes and reads out loudly: “Turn” for the cubes, “Lose” as opposed to Fest; here, of course, something like “Party” would also be possible and “Prague” because he has been careful at school and knows the window crash there.
Round by round, team by team.
You do not know the terms of the opposite side, but they can be better matched with every clue the encryptor gives there.
As mysterious as possible, but not too distorted, the descriptions should therefore be, otherwise you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most critical thing about “Decrypto” is, unfortunately, the rule book.
The players will probably have to study it long and thoroughly before they can finally play.
The explanatory video at decrypto.info on the web makes it easier.
However, those who have started out will be fascinated by how much emotion there is in this invisible game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre primus "Codenames", which also plays an agent theme on a game with fewer words, but is much better to play in small groups.
And whoever is only about guessing and not about winning points, can easily find a version for two.
Kulmbach: Man shows Hitler's greeting to police and harasses guests in the pub
A 48-year-old man employed the Kulmbach police inspectorate twice as much in the night from Saturday to Sunday.
He first greeted Hitler in the Upper City of a police force passing by, then later he also appeared in the Upper City of a pub as he harassed other guests.
After he was clearly alcoholized and did not comply with the police order, he had to spend the night in the prison cell at the Kulmbach police inspection.
In a sober state, he must also be held criminally liable for the use of identification marks of unconstitutional organizations.
Pressig was the home of the Schubloks
The railway plant in Pressig has been the hub of the Frankenwald for decades.
In 1991, a piece of railway history ended.
"When the buffers knocked on the buffers, you heard it in a very pressy," recalls Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the station.
It did not raise anyone.
The brakes stopped and the wagons crashed.
It was a pure railway.
Statements that are symbolic for Dinkels homeland.
Nowhere in the Frankenwald has a place been so characterized by the railway.
Here was the starting point of the Steilrampen mountain track to the north, which after a rise of about 220 meters has its cornerstone in Steinbach am Wald.
In order to cope with this, in the past, trains and shublocks were needed, which had their homeland in Pressig.
In 1901, the Bavarian Landtag approved the construction of a railway operating workshop with 21 locomotives, a trainee workshop, a railway and a railway masterpiece.
"The heartpiece was the turntable, which after a reconstruction in 1899 had a diameter of 18 meters," says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a rail historic and 47 years of professional railroad trainer.
From the Railway Operations Plant (BW) Pressig, which was subordinated to Bamberg in 1968, locks were also operated for the secondary routes Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Northern Hemisphere.
On 15 July 1950, the "Volksblatt" about a staff of 160 men; 13 steam and eight Elloks were stationed in Pressig at the time.
The electrification of the route in 1939 already minimized the need for trains and boxes.
Since 1977, they were used only for freight trains.
Until 1991, at least 10,000 weights were ranked per month.
Parts of the plant were dismantled in 1982, the rest in 1991.
Heidrich: "It is unfortunate that a better use of the site, including in terms of freight transport, has not been considered."
Even on Pentecost in 1989, the railway directorate of Nuremberg celebrated a pompous railway station festival in Pressig on the anniversary of "50 years of electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld".
“There were 10,000 enthusiastic spectators here,” Georg Dinkel remembers.
Shortly after that.
On 1 June 1991, the last 30 men were withdrawn, the Rangierbahnhof Pressig was history.
“The Rangers and Hemmschuhleger did the most difficult work in train traffic,” Dinkel recalls.
Any mistake would have had fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen railway station has led to the reversal of the hierarchy of the two places and many more historical and current images are available here in the infrankenPlus article.
Kerber wins at China Open
Beijing (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund reached the second round at the Beijing tennis tournament as before Julia Görges.
Kerber won the China Open 6:2, 6:2 against the French Kristina Mladenovic.
The next opponent of the world rankings third is either Julia Putinzeva from Kazakhstan or the Spanish Carla Suárez Navarro.
Siegemund led 6:3, 4:2 against Darja Kassatkina, when the number 13 Russian gave up.
This is the case with Anett Kontaveit from Estonia.
As part of the series "Art and Enjoyment", a special exhibition was opened in Mittelehrenbach this weekend.
With great relief registered organizers and visitors watched the ideal weather when in the open area of the estate Dahlmann- Schmidt, Mittelehrenbach, the Special Vernissage "Windspiel-Performance" was opened.
It takes place under the roof of the tourism association "Rund um Walberla" as part of the series "Art and Pleasure".
It opened its doors in the 15th year.
A large audience showed the fascination of the exhibition.
21 copies of 20 artists can now be visited in Mittelehrenbach.
Ernst Jürgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists at the opening of the Vernissage.
He has been there since the first hour.
Like Volker Hahn, who made himself a name as the main organizer and artist alike.
Somewhat surprisingly, Hahn announced his resignation a few days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neubauer he put his job in proven, young hands with good future prospects.
Both have already actively participated in the selection of the artists and contributed to flyers.
Also this year, on the occasion of Kunst & Genuss, there is again a 70 cent special lettermark designed by them, available at every art station.
There, too, this year’s poster “Betzn austanzen”, designed by Volker Hahn, can be purchased for eight euros.
Hahn was pleased with the high acclaim of the special exhibition.
For the musical framing, Max Marcus Stadler of Nuremberg was won.
Walking through the generous garden, the visitor quickly realizes that the title "Windspiel-Performance" formally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it playfully.
They are works of art made of metal or ceramics, often endowed with colorful accents.
Already at the entrance of the estate awaits the visitor on the right side of the "happiness tree" by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It is a tree trunk, colorfully lit up, playfully equipped with 20 windshields, 24 horse iron and 24 aluminum tubes as a sound piece.
With the sun flashing through the bushwork in the background, the object appears fairy-tale and invites to rest.
From Eckental comes Barbara Waschneck, who preferably devotes herself in three-dimensional letters to the event 15 years K&G.
There are many parts in motion in the wind.
In the middle of the road, Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhibited her work "The Wind the Heavenly Child".
And at the end of the area, Volker Hahn shows his colorful imagination form of clay, cement and stainless steel.
The theme "Windspiel-Performance" to walk through the diverse art exhibition.
The special exhibition can be visited until 31 December 2018.
50 years of MGV 68 Albachten: singers celebrate their 50th birthday
1968 - this was the time of protest and student movement.
At that time, the Alberts also made their disappointment.
At least five of them.
They did not want to agree everywhere that after the dissolution of the church choir "Cäcilia" there should be no more singing life in the district.
It has now become a legend: on a bench in the tin bush they lifted the MGV 68 Albachten from the baptism.
That was 50 years ago.
The anniversary was celebrated in the "House of Encounter".
“It will be full today,” said Chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he should be right.
There were 150 guests, a real success for the Albachten singers.
On the occasion of their anniversary, they had revived the foundation celebration.
It was a tradition for years, and then there was a break.
On the occasion of the 50th anniversary, the traditional celebration was held again.
An elegant ball it was made to festive clothes had been requested before.
The guests were not sitting in rows as usual in the "House of Meeting", but comfortably at tables.
In the meantime, there was movement: DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put on the controller and asked for the dance floor.
It is an honor that the singers of MGV 68 Albachten have made their own voices sound.
There were happy songs for the occasion.
Almost as stated, “Such a day, as beautiful as today.”
Suitable for the exquisite grape juice that many had before them, there was the "Rüdesheimer Wine".
In reference to another cool drink, "Humulus lupulus" sounded, which is the Latin term for "hoping".
Again sovereign was the choir leadership of Richard Homann, who is one of the five who were in the tin bush at the time.
"It's just fun to sing under his leadership," Holstiege said, "he has such an easy way, it's a masterpiece he does."
The women's choir "Hohes C" was also a guest, whose repertoire includes mainly evergreens from the 20s to the 60s.

Volleyball: 3rd League Women: USC II wins high-end derby against BW Aasee
The ascender marched.
Three games, three wins - the USC Münster reserve under the auspices of Axel Büring is doing really well in League three.
No trace of shame or fracking, the independent do their thing.
And that at 3:0 (25:15, 25:23, 26:24) against city competitor BW Aasee quite well.
"It wasn't clear, but we've already left an impression," says the quite satisfied coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker immediately acknowledged: "This is a defeat with which we can live very well.
We are not dissatisfied, on the contrary.
In the evening, at a subsequent birthday party by Ronja de Boer, the mood was good, the game dropped.
Yes, the result is actually an optical deception.
In the third set, the guests had a set ball.
"If they bring him to the goal, such a game can kick off," Büring knows from years of experience.
Eventually, the USC, with its routine forces, made everything clear and brought the full output to the goal.
“We all know who is on the other side in such a derby.
It doesn’t break my knee.
I have seen very good volleyball phases," Annacker did not hate with the 0:3 - and immediately went on to the agenda.
Where the journey for the Independents is going seems to be unpredictable after just three days of play.
“It’s just too early for that,” says Axel Büring.
Only in one he feels confirmed: "The 3rd league has an incredibly good level.
With regional league volleyball this is not almost comparable."In the fourth league they do not want to turn their eyes down anyway.
If the vest is not polluted in the coming weeks, you have to look up.
A first balance can only be drawn after ten or eleven games.
On Saturday we headed to Emlichheim.
Aasee will appear in Essen on October 14.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller never felt good enough for her husband
On the "Dreamship" Heide Keller became the star.
Now she speaks openly about the series may have had a complicity in her marriage out with Hans von Borsody.
Her role as Chief Hostess Beatrice of Ledebur on the "Dream Ship" made Heide Keller (76) famous, but on January 1, 2018 she left the ship forever.
The series that made her the star could be co-responsible for her failed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013) with whom she was married for ten years.
“That could also have been a reason.
Because I grew up with this work, traveled around the world alone with a suitcase and many colleagues I admired noticed me on an equal footing," Keller told Bild am Sonntag.
At first, she was always "the wife of Hans von Borsody", but that changed with the "dream ship".
For now, the journalists only called Heide Keller.
“Whether he liked it so much, I don’t know.”
She thinks it is possible that her then-husband might have been quite jealous, but "like many men, Hans was afraid of talking about problems and feelings."
Keller has always tried to be the only one right for Hans von Borsody and he didn’t want to know my fears, my weaknesses.
This means in good German: I’ve changed my mind,” she continued.
She always felt like “I’m not good enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman I was never really, even though I sometimes seemed frightened and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to be forever.”
After a previously failed marriage with Thomas Härtner, Keller said yes again, "although I was afraid that it could go wrong a second time."
The day before the public wedding, I sat crying in the closet and wanted to cancel everything.
Borsody’s marriage also failed.
Why did it never work with men?
Because I wanted too much.
Keller presented love at the time, "as in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision is not everyday.
I approached love too naively.”
The Nightfalter, who regularly explores the nightlife of the city at the NZZ resort Zurich, has dared to attend the ZFF opening party this time.
Our fold is not a moth, but a little shy.
And the bright glow in which a green carpet is immersed on the Sechseläutenplatz, blinds it over charge.
But it is still a film festival, as more or less celebrities want to sun in the headlights.
So, this late Thursday evening, he rolls over the square to relax for a brief time in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet facility sponsored by a large sanitary company, which is celebrating its premiere at the festival: the needs facility on the grounds of a new pavilion makes a lot of effort to stream a luxurious atmosphere.
This evening, however, it stinks to the sky in the gentlemen’s oasis for some reason.
So get out here, on the other side of the street: Invited guests, who have entertained at the highest level in the cinema next to the opening film "Green Book", celebrate the beginning of the festival with a party in the three-story storehouse as every year.
Its name fits perfectly to this film festival: It is well known that the works shown come from all over the globe.
What do you need to think of in an article about this festival, so as not to fall into sluggish advertising for its 190 partner companies.
The fold binds a band around the sensors, which has infested him with a good fairy, and two bullish doorkeepers actually whip him in generously.
Inside, the charged press, they dance long after midnight to live music or be pretended by DJ rhythms, to which they scream to each other, and rinse down exquisite hoops with Cüpli.
In the delicacies store in the basement, oysters wait for slimmering mouths, next to the unparalleled crude shrimp Culatello di Zibello is freshly cut, a chocolate fountain is sprinkled.
And the hammer is: All the sales shelves full of exclusive products have not been cleared for the occasion.
This has been the case for years, so it seems to work without great losses.
You have to love this country for it.
The fold examines the sign on the rolling staircase: "Wear a long dress, please be careful on the rolling staircase."
If it were two separate instructions, it was lost in the dress code.
But it is more of a conditional construction, and it has already saved lives.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the poultry chops a cocktail prepared with espresso called "Golden Eye", suitable for the festival award.
The price for the best drink does not necessarily get this mix, with which a capsule manufacturer presents itself.
And George Clooney, who has been advertising the brand for years, is not here that night either.
But there, between local prominence, cassette table and kitchen items, passes a face that seems familiar to the observer: Peter Farrelly, the director of the opening film.
The protagonist is not far away.
And indeed: Immediately Viggo Mortensen, at about sixty, almost like a chorknabe, walks through the crowd.
He is not struck, he is not struck, he is mostly struck.
It is precisely for this restraint, often misunderstood as clogging, that international stars love this film festival.
Maradona celebrates victory in Mexico with Cumbia dances
Coach and former football star Diego Maradona is delighted with the victory of his team.
Argentine football legend Diego Maradona appears to have settled well in his new home Mexico.
After a 2:0 win of his club Dorados de Sinaloa, the 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the cabin to Cumbia rhythms, as can be seen in a video already released on Saturday.
In the 15-second clip of a team member, Maradona dances in the yellow shirt, fired by the players.
The Mexican team defeated the Leones Negros on Saturday by 2-0.
After the game, Maradona shouted in a TV camera, "Always with my boys, always."
The 57-year-old has been training the Mexican club since early September.
Handball: Bundesliga 1: ASV sending after last-minute plete "destroyed on the ground"
Swen Bieletzki, coach of the handball league to send ASV, could hardly imagine it: "Such a bitter defeat". His defenders were "destroyed on the ground" after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) - bankruptcy - the fourth in the fourth game - on Saturday evening at LIT Germania 2.
They had not played badly - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - over long stages, the broadcasters.
Only the initial phase "we have completely fallen asleep," the ASV trainer was upset.
The homeowners quickly led with 8: 1, even the early break that Bieletzki had taken did not start out.
"But then suddenly a crash went through the team," Bieletzki summed up the second quarter.
During the break, the gap was only two goals.
Especially the best of the show, Marius Hintze, hit in the phase one by one.
After the change, it became even better from a visitor’s point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst matched at 15:15, after which the staff switch led almost consistently.
Four minutes before the siren, the advance was still seemingly reassuring three hits (29:26).
And then ?
The impartials are involved.
Bieletzki usually avoids trying to blame others.
But: The 120-second sentence, which Steffen Mühlhoff received, "was a joke."
LIT laughed well and hit four more times until the end - while the decimated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The boys fought great, they also stood well against seven men in the back and repeatedly threw them to the empty goal.
You can only buy little for the compliments.
“Now a damn victory has to come,” said the restless Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), Kretschmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).

Elon Musk, founder of the electric car maker Tesla, has escaped his threatening resignation as head of the billionaire company.
He and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an out-of-court litigation over misleading Twitter messages in which Musk could have lost permission to run listed companies.
As part of the comparison, Musk and Tesla will pay $20 million each, and Musk will give up the position of Chairman for three years, a position comparable to the head of the German Supervisory Board.
The executive may oppose it.
In the comparison, which has yet to be confirmed by a court, neither Musk nor Tesla admitted misconduct.
The SEC had sued the world-renowned manager before the U.S. Federal Court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads the space company SpaceX, is the public face of the losing electric car pioneer, which is now valued on the stock exchange at more than $50 billion.
Musk is not guilty.
Musk explained that he did nothing wrong and was sad and disappointed by the lawsuit.
He has always acted in the sense of truth, transparency and investors.
On August 7, Musk wrote to his more than 22 million Twitter followers that he might take the company from the stock exchange and pay $420 per share, the financing is secured.
Tesla was valued at $72 billion.
Musk said Tesla should stay on the stock market.
According to the agreement, Tesla will now have to find an external Chairman, hire two independent board members and also set up a committee to oversee Musk’s communications.

Polls: 46% do not want Merkel as Chancellor by 2021
Following the quarrels of the last few weeks, the GroKo has received several survey debris.
The SPD falls behind the AfD in a poll - Angela Merkel is seen critically.
Berlin - The AfD surpassed the SPD in the Emnid Sunday trend for the image on Sunday nationwide for the first time.
In the weekly poll of the opinion research institute, the AfD increases by one counter to 17 percent, the SPD drops one point compared to the previous week and ends up at 16 percent.
The CDU and CSU also lose a counter and only reach 27 percent.
This is the lowest value so far for the Union in the Sunday trend.
The Greens reached 15 percent, the Left 11 percent and the FDP 10 percent.
If the Bundestag elections were held on Sunday, the government parties SPD, CDU and CSU would get only 43 percent of the votes.
Thus, the large coalition has currently lost the majority in all major research institutes – with the exception of Allensbach – on the Sunday question.
The governing parties consistently obtain 43 to 45 percent of the votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 Bundestag elections, they collected 53.4 percent.
With the other parties, the bandwidth is also large: the AfD, the second strongest party in several polls, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens reached votes of 12.5 to 17 percent.
The left is on average 10 percent, the FDP at 9 percent.
For statistical reasons, such polls have an uncertainty of up and down from 2 to 3 percent, depending on voting percentage.
But support for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) in the population has also dropped significantly since the 2017 Bundestag elections.
Currently, only 48 percent of citizens think that Merkel is the right person in the chancellor's office, according to the Emnid poll commissioned by the BamS.
According to the poll, only one in two (50 percent) would like the big coalition to hold the next regular Bundestag election in three years, 41 percent are in favour of a new election.
Another poll published on Saturday also showed significant popularity losses for Merkel.
The Germans are also divided on whether Merkel should run for the CDU presidency again in December.
According to Emnid, 47 percent are in favour and 44 percent are against.
Among EU supporters, 64 percent would like a candidacy, 35 percent would not.
Aushang at Aldi: price reduced to love happiness
Is Aldi going to Tinder 2.0?
Whoever says that there are no more romantic dating stories in the times of Tinder - should talk about turkey meat at Aldi.
In times of digital "fast food dating" by Tinder and Co., the supermarket, as a place to meet for the great love, radiates almost an anachronistic romance.
Yes, right, a conversation about reduced puppy meat, boxershort shoppings at the wheel table, or your favorite pudding is, in doubt, still a better story for the later grandchildren than a mere swipe to the right.
The Tinder app has a reputation for being less a contact, but rather a sluggish exchange.
We dared the test: how do women react, you don't talk long about the hot meal right in the first message?
Here is the surprising result.
It has real Hollywood love story potential when love happiness is preceded by an out-of-the-eye lost and-found plot.
If the guy then still reports to his offer via the e-mail address bio-putenfleisch@gmx.de, then it sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and consorts - Romantic Comedy at it's best.
So it is the author of this ad at an Aldi branch unknown to us to wish that she will also find her dream man, with whom she briefly talked about the “30 percent reduced organic chicken meat.”
For her belief in the magic of analogous acquaintance, she definitely deserved her happy end at Hollywood.
Billerbeck: 500 covers for a life without paralysis

In Germany, polio is considered eradicated, but there are still three countries in the world where the disease occurs.
The cause of poliomyelitis, the polioviruses, can only be curbed by vaccination, as stated in a press release.
Football: Reus and Zorc call for peace for idols
Leverkusen (dpa) - BVB Sports Director Michael Zorc and Captain Marco Reus have called for an end to the public discussion about form and fitness of Mario Götze.
“We should stop thinking about Mario.
This does not do the boy well.
And that doesn’t do us good,” Reus, a friend of Götze, said after the 4:2 victory in Leverkusen on TV station Sky.
Zorc had already emphasized before the game.
For him personally, this is not an easy situation.
Eberl: No hurry to negotiate with Hecking
Mönchengladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl of the Bundesliga football team Borussia Mönchengladbach sees no rush with a possible contract extension with coach Dieter Hecking.

There is no fixed date when we will do this.
"But there will surely be a moment when we will sit down and talk," Eberl told Sky TV on Sunday night.
Football: District League: Researchers VfL Wolbeck's appearance against SC Altenrheine makes courage
There were moments in this still young season when Alois Fetsch went to court with his hard.
Wortkarg he gave up, the coach of the football district league VfL Wolbeck, first retired (internal) to point out the lack of performance readiness on the green.
All of history.
In the meantime, it is running around the fireplace again.
Taufrischer Beleg ist das 1:1 on Sunday against the SC Altenrheine, in the last game season only sloppy passed on the rise.
I am very pleased with the performance.
“We made the spaces tight and put pressure on the ball.
That could be seen," Fetsch praised his boys and looked up each one after the match to simply say "thank you" for so much defense against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to make a system change after 26 minutes.
After the injury of Nico Frerich (muscle problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - it went from the 4-4-2 almost seamlessly into a 4-2-3-1, in which Niklas Thewes waited for balls in the front.
Wolbeck had significantly more game shares in the first half.
and chances .
But Frerichs before his out (17), the replaced Luca Rehberg (26), and Jan Schroer (38) missed the lead.
It would almost have been rumored when, in the 41st minute, the SCA just twice in the person of Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer came up dangerously in front of the Wolbecker box - Tormann Damian Hallas proved to be the master of his field.
After the break, the VfL took full control.
Thewes from 18 meters failed hardly.
Schroer also arrived late after 58 minutes at a Thewes re-enter.
With the interchange of Miles Geske, Fetsch left again missed a fresh cell cure.
When Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer defeated Robin Westhues in the 70th minute, there was an indirect free kick for the placeholders 18 meters in front of the guest house.
The stunned man himself came in and demonstrated his danger at standards.
Westhues' thing with the right kick hit the bottom left from the shooter's point of view - 1:0 (71.).
20 minutes, which should be long.
And then that: VfL captain Florian Quabeck in the 80th minute flew the leather in the penalty area unhappy to the hand.
Arbitrator Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed to the point.
Jannis Schneider did not miss the gift (79).
Worried minutes Wolbeck had to survive in the final phase, before Geske in the 87th minute of twelve meters yet had the victory hit on the push.
Maybe it would have been too much of the good.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75. Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26.L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66. Geske) - Thewes

At the time of the landing, an accident occurred on the airfield.
The four passengers were slightly injured.
A tragedy occurred at the airport in Kottingbrunn on Sunday.
During the landing of a helicopter there was turbulence, as the police confirmed to oe24.
The helicopter was caught by a windstorm, crashed to the ground and fell on the side.
Police, rescue and firefighters were immediately called.
With a large supply, the emergency forces arrived at the scene of the accident.
The ÖAMTC notary helicopter was also called for caution.
Passengers are easily injured
Fortunately, everything turned out to be largely harmless.
There is only one material damage.

Allbright Foundation Report: Women remain a rarity in corporate boards
As of September 1, only 8% of the board members were women, according to the report “Die Macht der Monokultur”, which will be officially presented this Monday by the Allbright Foundation and was available in advance to the German Press Agency.
"The companies will have to act differently, otherwise the international competitors will pass them," said Wiebke Ankersen, CEO of the foundation.
In the United States, Britain or Sweden, purely male leadership teams – with a few exceptions – have long been unthinkable.
In comparison, the German competitors are less diverse, innovative and forward-looking.
It is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the proportion of women among German stock exchange companies is also due solely to positive momentum in the medium-sized index (MDax) companies.
According to Allbright, only 6.8 percent of the board members are women.
Last year, however, the value was still 3.8 percent.
Among the 30 Dax companies – pioneers in recent years – the proportion of women has stagnated.
There were 26 women in the board of directors.
“I’m sure that the Dax companies will recruit more consistently again next year – in their own interests,” said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement have signaled that they will continue to take no commitment to increasing the share of "zero percent" so far.
A different picture appears in the supervisory boards: on September 1, the proportion of women was 30.5 percent - 45 women more and 68 men less than a year ago.
"If the same number of women were recruited annually for the board of directors, by 2023 a 40% share would have been reached," the report said.
Luxury carrots: Which manufacturer earns the most per car?
Ferrari is best.
The Italians earn 280,000 euros for each Ferrari sold and make 69,000 euros in operating profit.
Big cars, big profits: this slogan still applies today – in most cases.
Who makes the most profit per car.
Ferrari, Maserati, Bentley: How much do luxury manufacturers pay per car they sell?
This question was addressed by "Autopapst" and economics professor Ferdinand Dudenhöffer.
His study shows that the differences are massive.
In the first half of the year, Ferrari made an operating profit of 69,000 euros for every car sold - Jaguar Land Rover, on the other hand, comes to only around 800 euros, Tesla and Bentley even put strongly on every car.
Mercedes, BMW and Audi are well in the race with prices on average from €33,000 to €38,000 per car and about €3,000 earnings before interest and taxes EBIT.

The 62-year-old taxi driver and the driver of the emergency car were severely injured locked in their vehicles and had to be released by rescue forces.
The 29-year-old, who was also seriously injured, was able to save herself, but the pedestrian could no longer help her.
Another emergency doctor tried this, but without success.
The three seriously injured were taken to hospitals.
Police are working closely with the Bonn prosecutor’s office to find out who is responsible for the accident.
Manchester United loses again, Mourinho is uncomfortable
After the shameful out of the League Cup, Manchester United is now losing in the seventh round of the Premier League.
Against West Ham United, ManU is subject to 1:3.
Symbolic was the scene in the 74th minute in which the recovered Marko Arnautovic shot the 3:1 for West Ham; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford allegedly led the Red Devils back into play.
As they suspected an offside at Mark Nobel's pass, all of Manchester's defenders stood still, leaving Arnautovic all the time of the world to pass the ball on the helpless David de Gea.
This was the negative peak of a previously long-distance inadequate performance.
The situation is very different at Manchester City City.
The Citizens trained by Mourinho’s big rival Pep Guardiola came to an unmatched 2–0 win against Brighton & Hove Albion.
After half an hour, Raheem Sterling broke the defensive bar for the home team for the first time.
Sergio Agüero, after a good hour and a double pass with the former goalkeeper, secured the sixth victory in the seventh game, and thus also the leap to the top of the table.
Liverpool no longer the leader
Three days after the 1:2 defeat in the Ligacup, Xherdan Shaqiri fought Liverpool in the Premier League a 1:1 against Chelsea.
The Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man with the Londoners.
The 27-year-old’s goal in the 25th minute remained the only goal of the game until the final stage.
Shaqiri, who came to the field in the 66th minute for Mohamed Salah, missed the equalization after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge played better in the 89th minute.
After the Reds started the week with a flawless balance sheet, Chelsea was not to be defeated for the second time.
First, the Londoners eliminated the team of Jürgen Klopp in the Cup, due to the draw in the league, the Blues Liverpool now also fell from the top of the table.
Like City, the two London city clubs Tottenham (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Watford) also celebrated 2–0 victories.
However, the fans of the Gunners, where Granit Xhaka played through, had to endure a success report against the surprise team from Hertfordshire County until the 81st minute.
Nine minutes before the end, Watford defender Craig Cathcart unhappyly kicked an injection of Alex Iwobi into his own goal, only two minutes later Mesut Özil made the decision with his third season encounter.
Arsenal surpassed Watford thanks to the fifth victory in a row and is now immediately behind the big rival Tottenham on the fifth place.
The Wolves remained unbeaten in the 2:0 against Southampton in the league for the fifth time in a row and took the 8th place.
VW's core brand is missing: Paris Motor Show in the sign of the diesel debate
The Paris Motor Show takes place every two years in turn with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Officially no topic and yet ubiquitous: the diesel scandal and the struggle for driving bans and rearmaments should not let the German car companies even at the industry meeting in Paris.
At the 2018 Motor Show, they will be showcasing their novels in the French capital together with competitors from all over the world from next week.
Diesel does not play a major role anymore.
The possible exchange and post-equipment offers for diesel owners in Germany, which will still be negotiated with the government in Berlin until then, however, is likely to be an important topic, at least behind the shiny scenes of the trade fair stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: the Volkswagen Group is with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but not with the core brand VW itself.
Audi and Mercedes-Benz are there, including their first pure electric models: the e-tron from Ingolstädter is due to come on the market at the end of the year, the EQC of Stuttgart 2019.
Both were officially presented.
The BMW iNext will not be launched until 2021.
The focus in Paris is the new 3er.
More than 250 exhibitors will be represented this year from 4 to 14 October.
In addition to car companies, motorcycle manufacturers as well as numerous mobility services and software providers are present in their own halls.
The trade fair, which celebrates its 120th anniversary this year, takes place every two years alternately with the IAA in Frankfurt.
In 2016, there were over a million visitors.
The earthquake and subsequent tsunami killed at least 380 people on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.
Dozens are still missing.
There are also more than 500 injured.
The island was hit by two earthquakes on Friday.
The first earthquake was of magnitude 5.9, the second was of magnitude 7.4.
Communications and traffic connections have been damaged, and huge material damage has been caused.
After the earthquakes, the tsunami broke out over the west coast of Sulawesi.
In the coastal town of Palu, hundreds had gathered on the beach for a party.
It is feared that the number of victims will continue to rise.
So far, the figures come only from Palu.
Many other communities are also affected, along the west coast of Sulawesis.
Approximately 150 bicyclists celebrate worship in Werdohl
Motorcycle pastor Frank Schröder (right) from Herne celebrated on Sunday with a team of helpers the final service for the motorcyclists in the Peace Church in Eveking.
Werdohl - The square in front of the Peace Church in Eveking belonged to motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the final service for the bikers was on the program.
Frank Schröder is the motor-pastor within the Evangelical Church of Westphalia and thus responsible for the pastoral affairs of the PS-strong two-wheelers.
Between April and September, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) is held at Haus Nordhelle on the last Sunday of a month.
The end of the season is traditionally celebrated in the Church of Peace in Eveking.
There were about 150 bikers gathered on Sunday to perform anything other than ordinary worship.
At 10 o’clock, the bolids were set in front of the church’s entrance gate.
At first, the biker breakfast was on the program and it was allowed to be strengthened with coffee and cake or even with a spicy currywurst.
In addition to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group from Gummersbach, also participated.
The sermon was delivered during the biker service by Father Dirk Grzegorek.
The musical subpainting was carried out by singer-songwriter Valerie Lill.
"Al the bikers prefer the blues rock, Valerie Lill suggests rather poetic-peaceful sounds," said pastor Frank Schröder.
This was a novelty in the history of motorcycle service.
Fughtorfer Heimatverein celebrates big celebration: after the apple comes the milk
Even on the day of the action, Borisch was active.
She served her hungry guests with freshly prepared apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg was also very interested.
He had his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated to his astonishing spectators step by step the process from ripe apple to apple juice.
Then and when Hartmann-Niemerg left the field to the children and let them fill the apples in the big tritter.
With a little muscle strength, the apples became a fine crushed mass.
Many of the children could not even imagine how it would become a delicious drink.
However, this important step of work was also seen on this late Friday afternoon.
Packed in shapes and wrapped in networks, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces layer by layer over each other.
Thanks to some technical support, the final step of work was not so difficult anymore.
The fresh-pressed juice gradually went into a large vessel.
However, the refugee farmer had already filled specialties with him.
So he opened his "treasure box" and presented the older visitors with the latest feather whites.
The demand for the good drop "Made in Füchtorf" was correspondingly large.
In a cozy atmosphere, the parents spoke, while the children not only could follow the process of apple pressing, but also discovered the built hipp castle for themselves.
Also active members of the Fugtorfer comradeship of former soldiers engaged in the celebration and invited at some stations for boring games.
Next year will also be a day of action.
Then, however, Gregor Krützkamp emphasized, the home in the heart of Spargeldorf will not be the place of the event.
Instead, a farm will be visited.
This is also obvious because of the theme: after all, it will go around the milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover with fourth season playoff: "Beschissene Situation"
After the fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed professionals of Hannover 96 around him and gave them courage.
However, there was not much positive before in the 1:4 (0:2) of the last table at Eintracht Frankfurt.
"It's a shameful situation, but you have to get out there as a team," said 96-football professional Pirmin Schwegler, pushing after: "This is, of course, disappointing, because you always take a lot."
The Lower Saxons, for whom only Florent Muslija (86) joined, are at the bottom with two counters and are a drop-down candidate in their current constitution.
Led by the outstanding Ante Rebic, Frankfurt, on the other hand, celebrated the first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45+1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59) and Luka Jovic (89) scored the goals in front of 46,300 spectators for the DFB trophy winner, who advanced to the middle of the table with seven points after the successful general test for the Europa League game against Lazio Rome.
Croatia's vice-world champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive operation of the Hessen at his debut and was never able to get in touch with Hannover's defense.
After the World Cup, the long-held striker showed with his pace and persistence why he is so valuable for unity.
Along with Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, borrowed from FC Liverpool, was the first time in the initial formation of the Frankfurt, which started swinging.
A ball of Lucas Torró (17), figured onto the tournament, brought danger for the first time.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped in a promising position at the last moment by the 96 defense around the Brazilian Felipe, who replaced short-term Kevin Wimmer (back).
The leadership for the masters fell almost inevitably and entirely deserved.
Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the penalty area after a rejected corner, Haller extended by head to the goal, where Ndicka only needed to hold the foot.
It was the first Bundesliga hit for the defense player who came from the French second-league player AJ Auxerre in the summer.
Frankfurter continued ahead of the break.
This time Haller matched his striking partner Rebic, who skillfully thought out and did not give 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser a chance.
In the half-time, Hannover-Coach Breitenreiter responded to the weak idea of his eleven and brought two new offensive forces to Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt.
The Lower Saxons now played a bit more courageously forward, but fierce ideas remained out until shortly before the end, when the final hit was finally achieved.
The Hesians were much more efficient.
After a short hour, Rebic launched a solo and then crossed over to De Guzmán, who only had to push the ball into the empty goal.
The rest was only a scandal for the Frankfurter against overwhelmed guests, Jovic also hit a minute before the end.
The Morlaix Square becomes a party mile
Despite the cool temperatures, there was a good mood at the Oktoberfest in the city centre.
Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter made it before millions of people at the opening of the 185.
Munich won two hits last week.
Geisingen Christians celebrate Holy Cross
Geisinger Catholics celebrate the Feast of the Holy Cross on September 14 or on the following Sunday.
The feast service takes place in the city church, then there is a procession to the Holy Cross church with the final blessing.
The Holy Cross Church is home to the shot Christ, who is from the Thirty Years' War and is said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
From the wound flowed blood.
From this, a great pilgrimage to the shot Christ developed, which then led to the construction of the Holy Cross Church.
This is not completed until today, only the altar room stands, the missing long house is indicated by the trees.
In his sermon, Priest Adolf Buhl reminds us that the cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
The service was poorly attended despite its importance for the Geisinger parish.
After the service, the procession to the Holy Cross Church took place and with the final blessing the ecclesiastical part of the Cross Festival ended.
For many years, the Catholic church choir then invites the Catholic parish home to the secular part of the feast.
The members of the choir provided the visitors with hearty food as well as a large selection of cakes and weather-adapted farmhofeis.
In the afternoon, the parish community offered guided tours around the town church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed visitors on behalf of the parish community about the damage to the façade, roof, sandstone works and windows as well as the upcoming construction measures, which will continue until next year.
After the armor has been in place for some time, the damage could be identified more accurately and the individual tenders could be prepared more specifically.
It is certain that the renovation will be more expensive than planned, because the damages already existing a few years ago have become larger, but there have also been more observed, which was only possible through the inauguration of the building.
The socket cleaning work has been completed, natural stone work is expected to begin before the winter and we hope to complete more than half of these work this year.
New residence in the Neu-Ulmer Münsterblickstraße
Life aid Donau-Iller opens a new residence for people with disabilities in the Münsterblickstraße.
That in the Münsterblickstraße now "a very special house" is handed over to its purpose - all the present agreed at the inauguration date.
Finally, the twelve wheelchair drivers who have lived in the Donau-Iller residential residence for some time now depend on the special architecture of the new building.
Wider hallways, hallways and doors, larger spaces and barrier-free accesses for all areas have been taken into account by architect Rudolf Bader in his concept.
The first planning began about eight years ago, when the former U.S. Army officer building was put on the test stand for the residents with Handycap: "The house had come into the years and no longer modern in the equipment," Bader explained looking back.
In 2016, the burgers arrived to demolish the house.
The new building should be designed as friendly and bright as possible so that the residents can feel comfortable in it, according to the architect.
Life Aid Donau-Iller opens new residential housing
Approximately 4.6 million euros were invested in life aid in the new building.
The free state paid 2.4 million euros, the district of Schwaben 450,000 euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction works remained within the planned framework - both in time and financially.
He was also thanked by the Managing Director of Life Aid, Jürgen Heinz.
The gap between a barrier-free and at the same time more fire-proof construction has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and craftsmen had built a home with the many specifications that would allow the inhabitants to experience the freedom to move even without foreign help.
Similarly, the head of the social administration of the district of Schwaben, Gertrud Kreutmayer, said: "The house is oriented to the special needs of its inhabitants, who need resources to be mobile."
The housing and functionality were well combined, Kreutmayer said.
And further: "The plot in this position is a real fortune, because it is no longer possible to acquire it in the current situation."
In total, the new residential home in Münsterblickstraße on almost 1,500 square meters offers space for 30 people with disabilities, which are divided into three residential groups.
Life Aid CEO Heinz is proud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are employed on a tariff basis.
Germany: Schwesig complains about differences between East and West
Before the Day of Unity, SPD Deputy Chairman Manuela Schwesig appealed to all fellow citizens not to deal with the disadvantage of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt after almost 30 years of use.
We must not be satisfied with these differences,” the prime minister of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern told the newspaper "Tagesspiegel am Sonntag".
The goal must remain to create equal living conditions throughout the country.
It is unacceptable that East Germans worked on average longer than the people in West Germany, but received 15 percent less wage.
"I can't explain this to anyone almost 30 years after German unity," Schwesig said.
North Korea: Will this cleansing dog end the Korean conflict?
The one-year-old Pungsan dog is to smooth the waves between the two Koreas.
In an effort to relax relations with Seoul, Pyongyang has given South Korean President Moon Jae In two North Korean Pungsan hunters as a gift.
As Moon’s office on Sunday, the two roughly a year old dogs reached their recipient on Thursday.
They crossed the border town of Panmunjom along with three kilograms of dog food to make it easier for the animals to "habituate".
The dogs with the thick white fur, sharp ears and brown eyes are considered loyal and intelligent.
It is a national cultural heritage of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.
The gift of friendship was announced by the North at the third summit this year between Moon and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang in mid-September.
The two countries also agreed to jointly participate in international sports competitions such as the 2020 Olympic Games and jointly apply for the hosting of the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the course of the mutual approximation, Kim also agreed to close the Tongchang Ri test facility for missile propulsion.
Austria's moving history in the mirror of 99 documents
What is Austria?
On the occasion of the 100th anniversary of the Republic, which has been celebrated in this memorial year for almost ten months now, numerous new books have appeared, which answer this question mostly by looking back on the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, historian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, explains it quite differently in the magnificent "Bilderbuch" Austria, which will be published on October 1.
New Year, New Opportunity for the Government
Back to the subject matter – this is the unofficial motto for the work week of the Great Coalition that begins today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech, in which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and also from the CSU have not lately mantra-like called for the "return to work".
This may have led some craftsmen, doctors, treasurers and otherwise working citizens in this country to the legitimate question, what is actually the difference between work and material work, but be it.
If the federal government is now ready to devote itself again to its mission – to rule – it should not be discouraged by conceptual debates.
Whether Union and SPD can actually do something together after the provocations and shame of the last few weeks will probably show on Monday.
In the evening, the leaders of the government parties will meet for the coalition committee.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to convene this round regularly to de-escalate conflicts early; a lesson from all the dispute.
In the first place, however, with the diesel upgrades and the law on the immigration of skilled workers, conflicting issues are again on the agenda.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants to let the car companies with exchange premiums glimpse away, SPD and CDU see the manufacturers in the duty to technical repair older diesel.
While the diesel crisis has marked an approximation over the weekend, the Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned law on specialist immigration.
The SPD calls for a residence prospect for rejected asylum seekers who are working or studying.
The EU is strongly opposed to the “transition” from the asylum system to the labour market.
So there will be a dispute between the coalition partners again – and how should it be different?
Not equals and equals have joined together in GroKo, but three partners with very different social images and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without a dispute, a society with such a variety of, sometimes conflicting, interests will not advance.
But in order to be constructive, the dispute must not be replaced again for party tactical reasons with the question of being or not being.
This is politics, not theatre.
The Union and the SPD should argue, but always look at the reality of people’s lives.
What is useful and useful for many?
With this guiding question, both the diesel and the lane change issue can be clarified pragmatically – and thus confidence can be regained.
This is what the people’s parties must fight for.
Pilz checks working hours at Hartinger
Minister in Visions
Does the Minister of Labour violate the applicable law?
Daniela Holzinger wants to look at this more closely.
"Really day and night" their lawmakers had been working on the social security reform, a overwhelming social minister during the presentation of the same two weeks ago.
Daniela Holzinger is surprised by the statement of Beate Hartinger-Klein (FPÖ) – she now brings the matter to Parliament via a request.
She assumes that "the minister only wanted to express her enthusiasm for the efforts of her team and in no way wanted to announce violations of the applicable law of service in front of running cameras."
Nevertheless, she now has questions in order to "release any suspicion" of Hartinger.
Police run into a street in search of female bodies
For a long time the police did not want to comment on this.
Now there is a confirmation.
Since early Saturday morning, the state road between Naila and Bad Steben has been excavated.
The route is closed in the area of Marxgrün until Monday.
It was assumed that the investigators had previously used an archaeological dog.
Specially trained for the smell of old human bones, the dog, together with his guide, was able to limit the relevant spot to a few meters in multiple operations.
In addition, together with scientists from the Technical University of Munich and the Supreme Bavarian Monument Protection Authority, a ground anomaly was discovered in the area of the said road.
For more than a year, the Prosecutor’s Office and the Criminal Police have been investigating the case.
Again and again, a cycling path was blocked and examined with sonar devices at Marxgrün, because investigators suspect that Heike's body might have been blocked here during the new construction of the state road 30 years ago.
Coloring powder and eggs: riots in Barcelona ahead of Catalonia's anniversary
On Monday, the controversial independence referendum in Catalonia will be held for the first time.
But before that there is a riot.
The separatists have not forgotten the police operation of autumn 2017.
Barcelona - Just before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on October 1, 2017, clashes between separatists and police broke out in the centre of Barcelona.
Catalan security forces were attacked by independence advocates, among others, with dye powder as they wanted to prevent them from approaching a demonstration of the national police and the civil guard.
Around 3,000 officials from the police units Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil wanted to hold a rally to pay tribute to their colleagues who served in the polling stations last year during the referendum classified as illegal.
In an attempt to prevent citizens from voting, there was also violence.
The Catalan police had formed a chain to separate the demonstrations of the separatists and the central government security forces, Spanish media.
Some of the some 6,000 separatists then tried to break the police chain by force, and the officials, among other things, threw bags and eggs.
Six people have been arrested and 24 others have been slightly injured, authorities said.
The independence referendum will be held for the first time on Monday.
Following the vote and a subsequent decision to separate the wealthy region from Spain, the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under forced administration in autumn 2017.
The then regional president, Carles Puigdemont, fled to Belgium.
Other politicians also moved abroad.
Several ministers of the then regional government and other activists of the separatist movement, on the other hand, are still in submarine detention.
In December, new elections were held in the region.
After the new Catalan government took office in May, the coercive administration was terminated.
But also the new regional president Quim Torra insists on the “right to self-determination” of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westphalia: gathered disagreement: FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen break up torelessly
The red-and-white is still on the spot.
At FC Gütersloh, it was only enough to score 0:0.
The final light and the third final were unveiled in front of 438 spectators at the Heidewald Stadium as a gathered disappointment.
The first half was controllable by the entertainment factor.
Those who preferred a beer or a breadworm could do so without worry.
There was no risk of missing a goal chance, because there was virtually no one.
First shot in half an hour.
For the first (harmless) goal of the whole game, Güterslohs scored Nick Flock in the 28th minute.
The best - and in principle also the only real - opportunity had the Ahlens, when Cihan Yilmaz FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling after 32 minutes with a shot from the penalty limit forced to a parade.
The hosts were harmless.
The most effective action was an early change.
Striker Lars Schröder had to be replaced due to injury, for him came Sinan Aygün.
After the change, both teams decided to do something against the growing boredom.
In the 48th minute, Sebastian Mützel targeted from 18 meters just above the case and after an hour, the goods lochs also appeared offensively for the first time.
After a ballet conquest by Matthäus Wieckowicz, it went fine.
The swiftly presented counter over Sinan Aygün was "coronated" by Nick Flock (62) with a but lazy shot in the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
They also played with a headball from Wieckowicz (66), following a cornerball from former Allen Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coach Angelo Daut responded, first bringing Marko Onucka for Martin Fuhsy (60) and a little later Enes Güney for Sebastian Hützel (70).
It worked – nothing.
More than optical superiority, thanks to their own initiative, the Ahlens did not.
It was only in the 91st minute that Cihan Yilmaz had the last chance, but it also brought nothing.
Angelo Daut then tried to bring out the positive: "I like that we played to zero."
"We were not as dangerous this time as against Holzwickede and that despite our opponent had no desire to play here," said RW Ahlens's interim coach.
Offensively, it was all a bit offensive against a team that just wanted to defend.
In any case, I didn’t feel like we could get an opponent,” Daut said.
To his suffering, however, as a spectator, you did not have the feeling that his team could shoot a goal.
The idea was too weak for that.
Reckenfelder Harntdankmarkt: Luckily there are enough creams
Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfelder Table Publishing Office are pleased with this, for whom these donations are intended.
The volunteers assure: “These donations will remain in Reckenfeld.”
At the opening, the sky appeared brightly blue, but the space was still a little empty, but that should change over the course of the day.
“It’s so sociable here, that’s why we’re here today,” one visitor said.
The organizer of the festival, Franz Josef Holthaus, welcomed the guests in the Kiepenkerl outfit as usual with an ordinary touch of humor.
For the Brockmann couple, which should actually be weighed against food, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer soon jumped in.
Verena (daughter of Ferdi Kreimer) has become ill.
There are enough creams.
And the “substitute” did not allow itself to entertain the increasing number of visitors musically.
This happened so well that a few folk songs were sung at a later hour.
“It’s great,” rejoiced Marcel Kreimer.
Mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date this time in his schedule.
He is pleased with the many activists with their stands, including mostly associations.
"There really shouldn't be anything like a table at all," he thanked for the action of the male choir.
Andreas Hajek praised the commitment of all those involved at the stands and also included the other festivals held in September and the “Clean up” campaign.
Our garden town gives itself a colorful pattern - here is something.
Then the Maikranz was taken off by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire department and taken to the winter quarter.
In many stages, work was done for the physical well-being.
From sweet to hearty was everything to have.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has only lived in Reckenfeld for a year, became creative on his decoupage saw.
Furniture works, beer covers with rack fields and a lot more he had in offer.
A specialty was offered to beekeepers by three fields: "Rakenfelder Honig", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
The latter has a specialty.
Honey cake in glass, of course with honey from my own production.
The little Elsa had to go over and over again, so the cake tasted so good.
It is the sociality that then allowed the visitors to stay long until the evening hours, even without a stage program that does not exist at the autumn festival.
Lubrications with local political embassy: no successful advertising for skate plant
In Lengerich, unknown people have promoted the construction of a skate plant in a way that may not be beneficial.
There are corresponding lubrications in several places, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration at the request of the WN.
At least one case has been indicted to the police for material damage.
In large letters, the three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" were placed on the signs of the Gempt Hall and the Old Town Hall, among others.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that already after the trade fair on September 19, a corresponding inscription was discovered on the advertising sign on the staircase to the Gempt Bistro.
Since the short message at the time was apparently left "only" with an Edding, it was easily removed.
"A few days later it was there again, but this time it was sprayed up," Rottmann said.
He believes that the corresponding advertising sign must be replaced.
A special note is given to this case by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are also mentioned on the board.
If the skate plant is built, its realization should also be enabled by sponsors.
Promises already exist, explains Jörg Hesselmann of the city department of school, sport and culture, without naming.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the empty table.
For years, local politics and administration have been dealing with the topic of skate plants.
After the old was demolished at the LWL clinic, after some time, the search for an alternative location began.
A majority voted in favour of the fire station.
However, this idea was not implemented - too many factors seemed to speak against building at this point.
At the end of June there was a turnaround.
The members of the main and financial committee now unanimously voted for the area of the Gutenberg school.
Jürgen Kohne says that the administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
The last word is for the city council.
It assumes a decision this year, so that it could be built in 2019 with a positive vote.
Flight control is getting worse.
After the European air traffic chaos in the summer, German airlines see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
"This year we had wind, in 2019 we will have strong wind and then the storm comes," Matthias Maas, the head of the aviation control union, told the German news agency before the aviation summit in Hamburg on October 5.
One important reason for the numerous delays and flight cancellations is the long-known staff shortage at European air surveillance agencies, for which there is no quick solution.
"The airlines and airports can rapid improvements for the coming year, but the training of new lots will take four to five years," the trade union said.
In Europe, the market for ready-to-train lotions is empty.
In the center of Karlsruhe alone, about a hundred people were missing to monitor the upper German airspace.
Maas again criticized the fact that various aviation trade unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives of the Federation, the states, air control, airlines and airports will meet in Hanseatic City on Friday to address the causes of the delays.
"If you want to talk about additional work compression and overtime, it will not go without us," explained the head of the GdF, which has many members at the German air surveillance.
Maas once again blamed the European Commission for the Lotsen miseries.
The traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 have been far too low.
The resulting cost estimates and staff savings at the national air surveillance agencies are now fully affecting the operational business.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU) to advocate in Brussels for regulations that do not "shorten the air further" to the air controls.
Currently, the EU standards are to be approved by 2024 and further tightening is expected.
The EU is constantly under lobbying pressure from the airlines.
“Ryanair CEO Michael O’Leary and his colleagues are now harvesting exactly what they have planted in recent years,” Maas said.
He hopes that the high costs of delays have prompted airlines to rethink.
The GdF will only contribute to the improvement of the situation if the German Air Force (DFS) offers a "coherent training and future pact", Maas said.
The previously announced admission of 120 lotus students per year over the next five years is just enough to offset the age-related departure.
The necessary staffing is not yet ensured.
Thyssenkrupp’s Supervisory Board votes for group change
The members of the Thyssenkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favour of the plans to restructure the Group.
Following the will of Guido Kerkhoff, interim chief executive of Thyssenkrupp, who was appointed chairman of the board of directors at the meeting on Sunday, the rising group will be split into two independent companies.
Both companies are headquartered in Essen and listed on the stock exchange.
There will be no additional staff cuts beyond the already known administrative cuts.
After two resignations, the control body has only eight heads on the capital side.

Barcelona: Violence at demonstrations by police and Catalan independence advocates.
During two simultaneous demonstrations of Spanish police and Catalan independence advocates in Barcelona, there have been violent clashes with numerous wounded.
According to the city administration, about 3,000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as well as about 6,000 pro-independence protesters.
The Catalan police have attempted to keep the two protests apart.
However, according to the operative forces, independence advocates repeatedly attempted to break the security blockade.
They attacked the officers with colour and shots.
According to reports, there have also been clashes between the participants of the various protests.
According to rescue services, 24 people were injured.
Police said there were six arrests.
Increased salaries and respect for colleagues
With their demonstration, the police wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who exactly a year ago protested against the referendum on independence in Catalonia, which was banned by the Spanish central government.
They also demanded better salaries.
Officials of the Spanish police and the Guardia Civil feel it is unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers earn much more than they do.
The protesters felt it a provocation that the Spanish police were demonstrating in Barcelona.
“Why did they come here to protest?” asked the 55-year-old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez to AFP.
Just to provoke and celebrate the fact that they stunned us a year ago.
A 31-year-old police officer from the Balearic Islands, who only wanted to indicate his name with Daniel, denied the accusation.
"Of course, we want to support our comrades, who last year only did their duty: defend the law," he said.
But the demonstration is there to enforce our rights and we do it in Barcelona because that is a big European city and there is more echo here.
But he and his colleagues “were not here to provoke,” the police officer assured.
Access to personal data of British ministers

Football: Juve coach praises after top game: Ronaldo's best game
The Portuguese star striker "played the best game this evening alongside the half-hour of Valencia," praised Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri after the record champion's 3:1 (1:1) victory over the SSC Napoli.
For the coach, the expensive star purchased even without his own goal was the decisive man in the important game against the pursuit.
“Ronaldo had a lot of fun and he’s doing it well,” Allegri said.
Even though we started with tactical mistakes, Ronaldo was very good at our first goal – and from that moment on we have grown.
Thanks to Ronaldo’s three goal patterns, Juve turned the game after the early retardation by the hit of Dries Mertens (10th minute), hanging off the worst chaser so far.
The goalkeeper picked up by Real Madrid first placed the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided the lead with a double pack (26/49).
And Ronaldo also made the preparation for the goal of defense chief Leonardo Bonucci (76) after a corner by headball, who just had to postpone just before the goal line.
“He gives a lot of suggestions,” praised the coach.
But Allegri, of course, also wants to see goals from the attacker, who is the record goalkeeper in both the Champions League and the Portuguese national team.
“We need to get even better at serving him,” the coach said.
Juve's best goalkeeper is currently Mandzukic with four goals - Ronaldo has three on account.
With the purchase of Ronaldo for more than 100 million euros, Juventus’ superiority seems to become even more overwhelming.
Seven victories in seven games is the flawless series in Serie A. With 21 points, the champion of the past seven years has already six points ahead of Naples.
The second table, which was trained by former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chance against Turin.
But at the latest after the place referral of the already warned Mario Rui (58), the top game was decided.
The Portuguese had to step out of the pitch against Paulo Dybala with yellow-red.
“We played well against a good Napoli,” said the Torino coach.
Emre Can could also feel it.
The German national player has taken over at Juve.
The professional who came from FC Liverpool played in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champions League match against Valencia, which Allegri meant with the "half hour": Ronaldo had flown off the pitch at the 2:0 win of the Turiners and is blocked for the home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West Changes His Name
With a bizarre performance, rapper Kanye West attracted attention at the U.S. television show "Saturday Night Live" this weekend.
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water suit caused cheeks and question marks among the spectators.
In addition, the 41-year-old announced a name change in time for the release of his new album.
From now on, you can only call him “Ye,” so the musician.
"The creature that was formerly known as Kanye West," he tweeted in reference to the late singer Prince, when he changed his artist's name.
The pseudonym is not new.
The album was released under this name.
In an interview with the KRRL radio station, the artist explained that "Ye" has a religious meaning for him.
“I think ‘Ye’ is the most widely used word in the Bible and there it means ‘you’,” the rapper said.
Football League A1 Munster: Finally!
Created by !
Hoetmars coach Averhage made no hint of his disappointment.
It was a weak game for us today.
The opponent was simply more agile, we almost never put him in trouble."
If you score two goals in 90 minutes, you can rarely make a positive game.
Football League A1: SC Hoetmar is subject to SG Sendenhorst with 0:2 (0:1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG also had only two options in the first passage, but the first one used Maik Krause from a sharp angle to lead early (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have raised, but after a great preparation from Krause, he delivered standing free.
The hosts only had a double chance when Moritz Höne first failed to goalkeeper Jos Schuhmacher and in the aftermath Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorster Keeper.
After the break, the guests became even more dominant and had a number of good chances.
But Uphus (49), Julian Turl (61) and Heinz Linnemann (69) all forgave.
A handmeter - Louis Kortenjann had saved with his hand on the goal line and saw red for it - Niklas Eilmann also could not use for the guests (75.).
It was only when Nils Berheide struck the ball over the line that the game was decided (81).
"We had previously criticized each other harshly, but today it was different than in recent weeks," said Florian Kraus.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnemann, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77. Berheide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90.
Goals: 0:1 Krause (7.), 0:2 Berheide (81.)
Red card: Kortenjann (75/Hoetmar)
Football: Circle League A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh is subject to Concordia with 3:4
“I don’t know what to say about it,” he cried after words.
"We have no access to them at all." with which he supposedly meant the wingrobe with Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also all the other green-whites who fell with collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A dirty victory," he said still, twinkled frighteningly and withdrew from then His players, on the other hand, were relieved to note that they had withdrawn from the affair with three points.
Noteworthy, after a duel of two teams, one of which, namely Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, fights for class retention.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back on the 90 minutes behind him.
“It was by far our best season performance,” he said.
"The way we got back after the 0:2 game, the way we played against one of the top teams in the league, it was really phenomenal."
The worse is that you have to go home with empty hands.
Top goalkeeper Lars Zymner led the hosts with his 12th season encounter (24).
He needed exactly two ball contacts in this game for this goal.
The 2:0 he placed on the left side patternworthy for Fabian Fröhning (39).
We knew it, but such a player cannot be taken out entirely.
"It was crazy what he did," Lewandowski recognized the quality of the opponent jealously.
Shortly before the side change, his own eleven managed to balance the balance: McGill's freestamp from the left sailed between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe through into the long gateway (45).
After the side change, it was again McGill who scored the equalization (59).
Then it went here and there.
It was a crazy, action-filled game.
Nübel shocked Albachten once again (64) and just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann ran out (69).
Despite the overwhelming number, Albersloh failed to counter the last Concordia hit (80) again.
We now have to concentrate on Wednesday.
“The game against Schapdetten, that’s what we have to win now,” Lewandowski said.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kröger (87 Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - Hövelmann, Bonse (87 Bareksai).
Goals: 1:0 Zymner (24.), 2:0 Fröhning (39.), 2:1 McGill (45.), 2:2 McGill (59.), 3:2 Nübel (64.), 3:3 P. Horstmann (69.), 4:3 Jülkenbeck (80.).

Football: TSV Strasbourg wins point against Primus
There was no winner in the Landesliga-duel between the TSV Straßberg and the FV Biberach.
The leader had actually arrived for three points, but the team of coach Oliver Pfaff was very good and in the end the game ended 0:0.
President of Dynamo Dresden resigns
The entire Board of Directors of Dynamo Dresden has resigned.
Several media outlets in the evening cited a joint letter from the Council of Saxons.
Initially, there was no confirmation from the association.
The reason for the withdrawal is internal power struggles with the former Bundesliga.
Erdogan in Germany: Politics instead of Pomp
Glad he is gone again.
There are few state guests whose departure in Germany provides such a great relief as that of Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
For three days, the Turkish president was a guest in Berlin and Cologne, and many thought he shouldn’t have been invited at all.
Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Celebrity guests and new offers
The Evangelical Academy of Tutzing will hold approximately 80 meetings until the middle of next year.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has signaled that he wants to pick up the tolerance prize in person in Tutzing.
For Christian Wulff, the term of office was too short: as Federal President he was not in Tutzing’s Evangelical Academy.
But before and after, Wulff was a guest there.
Udo Hahn, the director of the Academy, proudly said: "All Federal presidents and Chancellors were already with us."The fact that celebrities appear at the Academy at the Tutzing Castle was also a topic in the presentation of the annual program.
At the end of October, songwriter Konstantin Wecker will participate in a conference on spiritual experience in a philosophical perspective, and on September 29th, writer Frido Mann will participate in a conference on his grandfather Thomas Mann.
Meanwhile, French President Emmanuel Macron has also promised that he will receive the “Tolerance Prize” awarded to him by the Academy personally in Tutzing, which in another category also receives television host Dunja Hayali (we).
The approximately 80 meetings until mid-2019.
“Pension is not safe!” is written in a conference title.
“SOS at the borders of Europe” – this is how the Academy describes the “riskant and deadly route across the Mediterranean”.
And to a conference on Syria: “Barbary without limits.”
Weapons deals, destruction, torture, death – the war mockes any human idea.”
From structural racism in society to the gap between rich and poor to the radical change of work through digitalization, the spectrum ranges.
Hahn, director of the Academy, said: “A free democracy needs places where civil society can come together to look for solutions, or at least for partial solutions.”
Meeting for 200.
On Karl Marx’s birthday, some expect more visitors to criticise the direction of capitalism, others expect a tendency “from the left to the middle”.
What about neutrality?
“We are 100% a daughter of the Evangelical Landskirche,” said study leader Dr. Ulrike Haerendel, “so we are not 100% neutral.”
Music Barret: Gender understanding with heart - Wolbeck - Westphalian news
"Suitable for both adults and men" was the musical cabaret with Tina Teubner on Friday evening in the Christuskirche Hall in Wolbeck.
As a cabaret test, Teubner developed gender understanding, not only with humor and warmth of heart for the (feeling) woman and the (feeling) man and whatever else may be, but also with music.
She used the mini guitar and also mastered her violin.
On the wing was Ben Süverkrüp.
He is, on the one hand, the male sparring partner, who sometimes comes to words even to the end of the sentence, on the other hand, a true pianist: So congenially harmoniously accompanied Süverkrüp Teubner that some may have desired a solo.
That too, with Beethoven and Chopin, but differently, namely, as it fit into the red thread of the evening.
Then Teubner had brought into play a paradox: the satisfaction of a man comes when he has a partner, but this does not open the door.
A closed door without a partner, on the other hand, is of no use.
The piano solo now demonstrates the same: What would have arisen from Mozart’s composition if “the Nannerl” had unexpectedly opened the door?
So Süverkrüp slides through improvisations, from Bach's "O head full of blood and wounds" to the "Song of Death", and from Mozart's G-Moll symphony to a playful dance.
There was great applause and “bravo” from the full hall.
Flowers were handed over by Karlheinz Kleintje, treasurer of the association, the Chansonette.
However, Chairman Heidemarie Markenbeck did not accept any additional thanks.
She had the idea of giving the duo a performance in Stuttgart and Frankfurt as well as a performance in Wolbeck.

Handball: Ahlener SG retains the white vest against TV Wattenscheid
The Ahlenerinnen had problems especially with third-league player Carolin Stallmann, who alone scored ten goals.
"In fact, I was very happy with the defense, only one player has made too many goals.
We didn’t get them in hand,” said ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
But he was more angry about the many missed opportunities.
The concentration in the finish left his team missing this time.
The ASG therefore ran almost to the end of a lag behind, at the break with 11:12 and later still with 15:18 (45.) behind.
Only by the end was the wider bank of the hosts made decisively noticeable.
In addition, Aydogdu placed Merle Klement on the left side, which then made "extremely clever the crucial goals" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exner, Klement (5), Colbatzky (5/3), Drewes (1), Schlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitzek, Ruschhaupt (4), S. Fitzek.
Volleyball: 3rd League Women: Top performance of BSV Ostbevern in the top game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball players of the BSV Ostbevern have once again established themselves in the top group of the 3rd League West.
In the second league defeat VC Allbau Essen, the blue-whites won with 3:1.
“It was a huge step forward for a cool season.
It makes Lenz play in the top third of the league.
This is what we have now worked out," coach Dominik Münch rejoiced after a impeccable performance of his team at the crashed table leader.
The first pass was dominated by the guests.
Over 4:1, 16:10 and 22:12 he went to the vice-master of the previous year at 25:15.
Food has accepted in the second round, but has not entered the game.
We occupied them well.
Our opponent has hit with high risk, but also produced several tickets.
In the second sentence, the BSV led with 12:8. "Essen has shifted the assumption to three rows.
We could not withstand the pressure.
“Eat has gotten squeezed, and we let ourselves get squeezed a bit,” Münch continued.
At 18:17 for the first time the volley ballerinas from the Ruhr area had the nose ahead.
Although Ostbevern defended four balls at 19:24, the fifth attempt found its goal.
"The game was now a class better," the exercise manager was at the rising level.
Maike Rüdingloh and eventually Wiebke Silge contributed significantly to the BSV’s turn of the sheet from 14:16 to 25:21.
Munch: “We played consistently and calmly.”
Over 7:3 and 15:13 the Blue-White passed four with 25:22 on their side.
Vera Horstmann was voted the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier had also captured a wonderful day.
BSV women: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea and Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Silge, Horstmann, Roer.
Turkish community: mosque opening as a missed opportunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne was inaugurated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
“The opening of a mosque in Cologne has left a hole in the German-Turkish relationship that can only be hardly reversed,” said the chairman of the TGD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the editorial network Germany.
Both the Turkish and German sides had missed the opportunity for a joint, reconciling appearance.
“Rather than side by side with top German politicians to emphasize Muslims’ belonging to Germany, Erdogan has used the appointment for his own purposes,” Sofuoglu said.
The widespread exclusion of the German public “has reinforced many reservations”.
Home > Offer has already been established
After the long summer break, it is finally time for crowdfunding.
On 18 October (Tuesday) at 19.30 a.m. the Nottuln home club is already hosting its fifth Nottulner folk meeting in the fireplace of the Alten Amtmannei.
Almost exactly a year ago, we held a popular gathering for the first time.
In the meantime, this event has become an integral part of the musical event calendar in Nottuln,” says Hanns Moormann, Chairman of the Nottulner Heimatverein.
I would not have imagined that our people’s gathering would establish itself in Nottuln so quickly.
Whether stormy Friederike in January or heatwave in July, the fireplace of the office was always full.
“The program at the next folk gathering is, as always, a colorful blend of German folk, wander- and seamen songs, folk songs, evergreens and old beats,” says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who invites friends of musicians to Nottuln.
For the first Folktreff "birthday" Klaus Spellmeyer has promised with his accordion.
For many years he was a member of "Gaitling", a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt, which played music with plattdeutsche lyrics.
Now he’s traveling with an Irish folk band.
The creators of the folklore gathering are happy to remember the last event in the summer, when Christoph Schulz from the folklore gathering Emsdetten with his international version of the song "Frosche in der Nacht" excited the listeners and sent home with an earworm.
"We expect many joyful guests to once again spend a sociable and humorous evening," the hometown club said in the invitation.
Anyone who plays an instrument and wants to actively participate is invited to participate.
Since the desired seats are always fast occupied, it is recommended to be there early enough.
The folktreff begins at 19.30, but entry is already at 19.00.
China approves planned merger of Linde and Praxair
For legal reasons, all open questions must be resolved by October 24.
FrankfurtLinde and Praxair are taking another step towards becoming the world’s largest industrial gas group.
The Chinese competition authority has approved the planned merger, Linde said on Sunday.
Thus, the billions-heavy merger still faces the approvals in South Korea and - as the biggest obstacle - in the United States.
Recently, there were improved chances of approval, according to an insider, because Linde promised to sell additional shares of the company.
For legal reasons, all open issues must be resolved by 24 October in order for the merger to succeed.
From pure crops to ecology
With a gala in the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle, the 125th anniversary of the Association for Gardening and Landscape was celebrated.
On 29 September 1893, with a fruit show at the Kulmbacher Vereinshaus, the final founding impulses for the Kulmbacher Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landspflege were set, and exactly 125 years later he celebrated a great anniversary on Saturday night in the Kulmbacher Stadthalle.
Of course, the name was still different at the time: as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" he was lifted from the baptism by Mayor Wilhelm Flessa in 1893.
The purpose of the fruit-growing association also differed from today's work - it was actually purely about fruit-growing, about flowers and gardening nobody thought at the time.
"At that time, in the age of Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite skin of the elites," said district nurses Günter Dippold in his feast lecture.
Fruit trees should seam long roads, so-called industrial gardens were set up at schools.
The fruit production is still the responsibility of the 55 gardening associations in the Kulmbach district, which comprise 7,000 members.
However, the spectrum is far from exhausted.
Near-nature gardening, biological plant protection, village decoration and nutrition play an equally important role as the transmission of knowledge, healthy nutrition and youth work.
How versatile the tasks of a gardening association are, the members of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" showed entertainingly on stage.
"Youth work is urgently needed, especially in the digital age," said the chairman of the district Günter Reif, and also OB Henry Schramm emphasized the importance of experiences in nature for life.
Collecting chestnuts was a huge thing for us children, I doubt that you can collect a lot of joy with smartphone & co.
Schramm promised to plant two trees together with Landrat Klaus Peter Söllner for the anniversary.
"Where they should be, the district association decides," added Landrat Söllner, highlighting the special importance of gardening associations for the villages.
The circle association stands for ecology, the beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
That this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the district, district manager and expert advisor Friedhelm Haun also left no doubt.
He guided the many visitors with a photo lecture through the long history of the circular association and, among other things, the need for self-sufficiency after the war.
Previously, everything came out of the garden, for the winter it was watered.
In the late 1950s, however, the utility garden transformed into an ornamental and residential garden.
"Nature has existed, it was already there before us and we must orient ourselves to it," pledged the specialist for fruit and nuts.
Therefore, there is an incentive for gardening associations not to leave behind, so that our homeland remains beautiful and worth living.
This also includes welcoming the new citizens to our clubs, added the President of the Bavarian National Federation, Wolfram Vaitl.
"We must stop the flagrant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren," concluded Günter Reif of the successful feast, which was solemnly framed by the tower blowers of the music club Thurnau.

Priority to NAFTA talks: Canadian Foreign Minister holds UN speech
Mexico's government wants clarity on NAFTA: it is putting an ultimatum to both trading partners for an agreement.
The Canadian Foreign Minister has now given the trade agreement an absolute priority – and has postponed her speech before the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure in the struggle for a renewal of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Mexico, Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her speech at the UN General Debate in New York.
Instead of speaking on Saturday, she will speak before the United Nations General Assembly on Monday, her spokesman Adam Austen said.
In the meantime, it focuses on renegotiating NAFTA.
Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Friday that the negotiators of Canada and the United States had 48 hours to agree if Canada actually wants to join the trade agreement already reached between his country and the United States.
In August, the United States and Mexico agreed to revise the regional free trade agreement NAFTA.
U.S. President Donald Trump has suggested that Canada could be excluded from NAFTA in the future.
Negotiations on a new issue have been ongoing for over a year.
They are to be concluded by Sunday evening (local time), and the Trump administration wants to submit the agreement to the U.S. Senate before October 1.
In the event of a failure of the negotiations, Mexico’s appointed President Andres Manuel López Obrador announced on Friday that he would seek a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against Bolsonaro's presidential candidate
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injured in a knife attack, has left the hospital.
The former right-wing militant wanted to fly to Rio de Janeiro, where he lives, according to a report by the daily newspaper "O Globo".
After his dismissal, it is still unclear whether the 63-year-old will perform in public in the South American country the last week before the presidential election.
The politician was attacked on the street during an election campaign in southern Brazil in early September.
Meanwhile, thousands of people in several Brazilian cities took to the streets to protest against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não" (in German: "Der nicht") mainly women's associations had called for protests against the former military.
Even on social networks, the associations made racist and women-despising statements against Bolsonaro.
In the economic metropolis of São Paulo, several thousand protesters were expected.
In the capital, Brasilia, the protests were mixed with a rally by the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Labour Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He replaced former President Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to 12 years in prison for corruption and was therefore not allowed to run.
The presidential election in Brazil is on October 7.
As the former mayor of the million-town São Paulo, Haddad was far behind the far-right candidate Bolsonaro in polls so far.
The "Trump of Brazil" has been involved in politics for a long time, but recently presents himself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach an absolute majority in the first round of the elections, a vote will be held on 28 October.
Observers assume that Bolsonaro will not be successful out of this — no matter who he is against.
Bolsonaro is known for his acts against homosexuals and blacks and for his glorification of the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He is constantly shocked by verbal distractions.
Another time he said Lula’s left-wing Labour Party supporters should be shot.
Europe regains Ryder Cup title
Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines - Just an hour from Disneyland, European golfers have written another Ryder Cup fairy tale in front of the gates of Paris.

After a long illness, Danish rock legend dies
Danish rock icon Kim Larsen has died.
The singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 after a long illness, his producer Jörn Jeppesen said on Larsens website.
Larsen was surrounded by his wife and six children.
The musician had been on treatment for prostate cancer since the beginning of the year.
Larsen became famous with the band Gasolin' which was extremely successful in Scandinavia in the 1970s.
Her songs were influenced by international music figures such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
After the breakup of the band in 1978, Larsen became a successful solo artist.
He sold about three million records in Denmark.
His 1983 album "Midt om natten" is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
Danish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen praised Larsen in a statement on Sunday as a "street boy" who was "against everything but in all hearts".
The head of government also recalled that the monarchy opponent Larsen appeared in 2010 on the 70th birthday of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark.
Rocknight in the shoe factory: noise at pressurized air hammer level
"Here we stand, take the bone saws and light a concert evening with the power of a tiger."The band names of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" alone suggest such a translation of the rock live music experience on Saturday night in the hall of the citizen center shoe factory: hardrock purely by three friendship bands.
After the sound check and shortly before the concert begins, the musicians even take time for a group photo.
There is no trace of lamp fever.
After that, the rock protagonists from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all in association with the booking agency "Mosquito" from Oelde - with their bands loudly impress the around 120 visitors of the "Mint Mosquito" rock night.
Even the quartet "Tiger Bonesaw" with frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika knows how to convince at the start of the concert evening with the latest, unknown pieces from his own pen and the soon-to-be-released CD.
In front of the stage, the band dances to the sound and pressure interaction of the performance.
Although "addition" calls are not to be ignored, "Tiger Bonesaw" then left the trio "Here We Stand" the stage.
That hard rock is not just hard rock, guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich am Bass and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate with their alternative sounds, sometimes reminiscent of classic rock of the 1970s.
Following the "High Energy Rock" of the "Tigers", "Here We Stand" also uses a synthesizer in addition to the guitar coat.
Not only is the longing, quite troublesome "Take Me Home" stunning through the shift of melodic passages to the guitar-style rock reefs of the multi-layered songs.
The Quartet "The Ignition" from Tönnishäuschen has, however, achieved a special degree of popularity since its founding in 2005.
Full of agility, the band will present their hard rock on Saturday.
That “The Ignition” has a special stage experience with its appearances in front of a very large audience – recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 China tour – is obvious and unbeatable.
Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann, in interaction with the band, also puts his own accents on the only covered song of the evening, "Word Up" by Cameo from the 80s.
To the feeling even higher-controlled sound than before, guitarist Norbert Brinkmann in the meantime delivers a crowded solo, running through the audience.
A certain volume is of course part of such a hard rock concert: at the "Mint Mosquito" rock night, according to the information of the mixed board team, the three-time concert of "Here We Stand", "Tiger Bonesaw" and "The Ignition" is at about 98 decibels.
This is, for example, at the press air hammer level, but is thus still significantly below the controls of the "Wacken-Fesitvals", to which "The Ignition" points out on their website.
Astounding 120 decibels in thunderstorm sound as usual at the annual metal show in the north of the republic, however, the Ahlene audience does not need this rock night.
After almost four hours, the three bands of the tougher, rockier style have long convinced with their sovereign, virtuous play and their own compositions.
"Here we stand, we took the bone saw and lighted a concert evening with the power of a tiger," can all three groups, of course in the translated sense, say at the end.
And above all, enjoy the big applause of the visitors.

The crash site is only close to a tent in the airport area.
There has been an Oktoberfest since this weekend.

From the parking lot there is a Park & Ride offer at major events in the Messe Essen or the Gruga Hall in Essen.
Trump tells Kim: “And then we fell in love”
The fact that North Korea’s U.S. president, Kim Jong Un, is well-being despite the nuclear crisis is no secret.
But now Trump has made a true declaration of love to his colleague.
It also has to do with Kim’s “Wonderful Letters.”
At the delicate age of 72, the married US president has revealed himself to a new flame.
The tragic thing is that it is a distant relationship.
On Saturday, Donald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.
In front of supporters in the U.S. state of West Virginia, Trump almost found tender words for the half-old germ of the ruling dynasty from Pyongyang, although it turns out to be a rather tough piece in the struggle for North Korea’s nuclear disarmament.
“I was tough, he too, and between us it went back and forth,” Trump said.
And then we fell in love.
Okay ?
No really .
And not only the conversations with Kim had melted his heart.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they were great letters.
Their personal connection has also been politically fruitful: Trump referred to Kim’s announcement of stopping all nuclear and missile tests, although critics have so far seen little more than lip confessions.
That the affection for the infamous "Rocket Man" - so Trump's nickname for Kim - is probably not everyone's memory, the US president seemed to be quite aware.
In any case, he took the expected criticism of it immediately in advance when he performed in a large gym in the city of Wheeling: "Donald Trump says they have fallen in love."
How terrible, how terrible is it?
This is so unpresidential.
Trump said, pointing his finger to the crowd: “I’ve always told you it’s so easy to be a president.”
But then there would not be 10,000 people out there pushing into this crash-filled arena, but we would only have 200 people out there.
Oktoberfest attracts many guests to Baesweiler
Visited by the best of Baesweiler, atmospheric and, on top of that, filled with sun: Very varied and with a good shot of Oktoberfest flair, Baesweiler’s downtown was cleaned out on Sunday.
For the first time, the Oktoberfest took place not only in the tent at the fire tower, but was extended to the city by the trade association on Sunday.
Refugees rescued from Libyan prison thanks to video
Nigerian refugees used a cell phone video to point out their catastrophic conditions in Libya and thus enable their rescue.
The group had shot the recording in their cell in the coastal town of Sawija in July under threat of life and spread it online.
“They refuse to send us back,” one man said in the video message.
We suffer here, we die here.
The recording was sent to the site "France 24 Observers", whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees were eventually flown to Nigeria in late August.
“Without the video, we’t have been able to return to Nigeria,” Efe Onyeka, who recorded the video, told AFP.
The 25-year-old was arrested in Libya while trying to reach Europe over the Mediterranean.
With the video, he threatened his life.
One of his colleagues was beaten to death by the guards, Onyeka said.
In general, the conditions of detention were catastrophic: “They beat us all with pipes and sticks.”
They gave us nothing to eat, we had to drink from the latrin.
IOM organizes the voluntary return of refugees stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have been sent back to their homeland this year through the program, IOM spokesman in the West African country, Jorge Galindo said.
The case of the now rescued Nigerians is not exceptional given the poor conditions of detention in Libya.
However, he has not heard of a phone call by video so far.
International organizations have long criticized the situation in the Libyan refugee camps as inhuman.
The North African state, largely controlled by militias, is the main transit country for migrants on their way from Africa to Europe.
When a teacher went to the local public school on Sunday afternoon to prepare her class for Monday, she surprised a thief.
At 16:50, the teacher entered the building through the main entrance.
In the entrance of the 1st floor she saw a man who immediately fled.
First through a door, then through the roof terrace and from there through a ladder to the ground floor or the front floor.
The teacher informed the police who started the investigation.
Whether things or money were stolen is not yet known.
Offender description: about 16 years old, black, very short hair, slightly darker appearance, dark pants, dark T-shirt.
Please contact the police inspectorate Obernberg am Inn, phone number 059 133 4244.
German man caught in his car for days
A 75-year-old man has had to stand in his car for several days and nights in a forest area in Central France after he had stuck the car away from all the forest paths and a tree blocked the car door.
Rescue workers accidentally discovered the car on Saturday afternoon near a pasture and are rescuing the person who has been missing since Tuesday evening, police said on Sunday.
The 75-year-old from Pleinfeld wasly in good health despite the cold nights and the long time without care.
He said he was looking forward to his home.
The retiree had been missing by his family after he had not returned from a ride with his off-road car across the local lawns and fields on Tuesday.
Despite intense searches, the man’s presence remained unclear for days.
Laschet calls for rule of law in Turkey
Cologne-NRW Prime Minister Armin Laschet (CDU) in a conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, according to his own information, reminded the rule of law in Turkey.
The relations between the two countries are currently “overshadowed,” Laschet said on Saturday after a meeting with Erdogan at the Cologne airport.
This is especially true of the waves of arrests, press and religious freedom.
He made it clear to Erdogan that if relations are to normalize in the future, if economic relations are to be deepened, that the rule of law is a very important prerequisite for this.
Laschet also addressed the cases of Germans who are in prison in Turkey.
He expressed the expectation that freedom of expression should be respected.
Erdogan once again stressed the independence of the Turkish judiciary.
The conversation between Laschet and Erdogan was briefly moved to an air readiness building of the Federal Ministry of Defense at the Cologne airport.
It was originally intended to take place at the castle of Wahn – but the castle owners had rejected it out of political convictions against Erdogan.
Erdogan went on to visit the opening of the Ditib Mosque in Cologne.
Laschet had cancelled a joint performance at the building.
But he said, “The Muslims who go to this mosque are also citizens of our country.”
And we are also their contact, not the Turkish president.
Lack of confidence in the US: North Korea calls for disarmament
While U.S. President Trump is not tired of emphasizing the successes of the negotiations on North Korea’s denuclearization, the East Asian regime is more sober.
Foreign Minister Ri is calling for a response from Washington.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho has accused the U.S. government at the UN general debate of blocking the negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula with its continuing sanctions.
“The recent downturn comes because the U.S. is building on coercive measures that are deadly for trust building,” Ri said in New York.
Disarmament is unthinkable for North Korea under these circumstances.
"Without any confidence in the United States, there will be no confidence in our national security, and under such circumstances there is no way that we can disarm ourselves first," he said.
That sanctions could “kneel” North Korea is “a dream of people who don’t know us.”
To build confidence, however, his country stopped its nuclear and missile tests and destroyed a nuclear test facility, Ri stressed.
However, there have been no "appropriate reactions" from the US side, the minister criticized.
Because of North Korea’s nuclear and missile program, the UN Security Council has decided on sanctions against the internationally isolated country three times last year.
U.S. President Donald Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have urged in recent days at the United Nations to strictly observe the punitive measures.
At the same time, the U.S. government is working on approximation.
In June, Trump met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for the first time.
After the first summit in Singapore, the US president is aiming for a second summit with Kim.
Pompeo is scheduled to return to Pyongyang in October for talks on the end of North Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serves: New kitchen with donations from the community
That they were actually in a youth gathering, the many visitors of the house of the open door HoT got nothing about: white blankets and floral jewelry on the tables and a large buffet awaited the guests after the harvest thanksgiving service.
The HoT youths were enchanted by the buffet with delicacies from different countries in the new cuisine.
The institution was funded by donations from the community, for which the youth wanted to thank with the food.
The start with the new facility was not easy, as Henriette Westbuer, the head of the HoT, recalls.
We had filled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break and were well prepared for the big day.
But then, on the first day after the summer break, the bad surprise came: a power outage had put the huge, two-piece refrigerator out of service, the food was corrupted and had to be disposed of.
"Now we had to start again: we got a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and young people wanted to do it alone," Westbuer said.
And so they all picked up.
The result was visible and the guests were delighted.
"Better chefs can't do it," one visitor praised impressed, while Hokkaido curry soup was served or guests were allowed to serve quiche, cheese or cake.
"It is really great what the children and young people have put on their feet," emphasized Pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen surprised with card tricks and other pieces of art.
Jürgen Sator leaves the board of state of NRW
Out of frustration over criticism from his own ranks, the head of the Essener Tafel, Jörg Sartor, has resigned from his position in the Landesverband.
Sartor had become famous nationwide because the Essener Tafel had introduced a reception stop for foreigners.
He resigned as deputy head of the NRW tables in July, Sartor told "Welt am Sonntag".
Too many have fallen in my back.
Wolfgang Weilerswist, the head of the NRW Table Association, expressed to the DPA his understanding for the decision of his long-time deputy.
Sartor was heavily criticized.
“I can understand his move – there have been people who didn’t know exactly why the Essener Tafel did this.”
Sartor, however, is still active for the Essener Tafel - "six days a week, there is nothing changing," says Weilerswist.
Sartor again criticized colleagues from other tables in the "World on Sunday".
One should not follow the approach, “without us, people in the city are starving.”
It is the responsibility of the state to ensure that people do not starve.
At a table congress in Berlin on Friday, the Essener did not participate.
“There’s too much sweet shit told me,” he said.
There are all those social fuzzies who also criticized me at the time.

Borussia Mönchengladbach still has to wait for a victory in Wolfsburg.
At 2:2 the Fools play a lead twice.
Schalke defeated Mainz in the first victory of the season (1:0).

Thanks to an extraordinary comeback, Borussia Dortmund greeted again from the top of the Bundesliga.

The first victory came from VfB Stuttgart.
Against Werder Bremen, who was defeated before the break because of a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic, the Stuttgarters had to crack in the meantime.
Borna Sosa and the reckless goalkeeper Ron-Robert Zieler fabricated a curious throw-in goalkeeper that helped the guests to balance in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes later, Gonzalo Castro led the VfB to the first victory.
In Wolfsburg, Michael Lang did not experience a completely successful, but also not a failed debut for Borussia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbacher, who joined the Swiss quartet Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang, took the lead twice, played 2:2 in the end and have been waiting since 2003 for an outside victory in the VW City.
For Wolfsburg's 1:1 match, Renato Steffen was responsible with his second Bundesligator.
In the flat shot from 20 meters of the Aargauers, Yann Sommer was powerless, as was the second counter hit after an hour.

Nuremberg decided the duel against Düsseldorf 3:0 sovereignly for itself.
After half an hour, Hanno Behrens brought the home team on course by means of foulpenalty.
Macedonia votes on new national names
Approximately 1.8 million Macedonians are voting to change the name of their country to North Macedonia.
With a yes, the almost three decades-long conflict with neighboring Greece could be resolved.
Athens had insisted on a name change because of its northern province of the same name and blocked any approximation of Macedonia to the West.
Therefore, voters also decide on future Western integration.
The United States had announced that the country could quickly become a NATO member in the event of a positive outcome of the referendum.
Syrians in submarine detention.
A refugee attacked three women.
A Syrian man brutally stabbed three retirees and injured them in part.
The 41-year-old asylum-seeker had ran into the evacuation zone in Alsergrund on Friday at around 22 a.m.

They suffered hematomas, bruising and brain shocks.

He was taken to the hospital and continuously monitored during the treatment.
SPD politician: Johannes Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Almost exactly a year after the marriage for all came into force, SPD politician Johannes Kahrs married his long-time friend Christoph Rohde.
The two sides gathered in Hamburg on Saturday.
A registered life partnership was not in question for them, Kahrs had previously told the "Bild" newspaper.
“If we get married, then right.” he has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs is a budget policy spokesman for the SPD Bundestag group and one of the spokesmen of the Seeheim Circle, the conservative SPD wing.
In the Bundestag debate on the opening of same-sex marriage on June 30, 2017, Kahrs spoke with an outcry.
He accused German Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stolen" himself on the subject.
"This was your Schabowski moment," he said in reference to the accidental announcement of the opening of the German border by Günter Schabowski.
Since October 1, 2017, same-sex couples can get married just like heterosexual couples.
Previously, they had been able to register their partnership since 2001, but there was no equality with marriage, such as the right of adoption.
Garden Day: 400 meters of hail cut
There was a lot of work ahead of the members of the Citizen’s Association Kinderhaus and the Society for Leprakunde.
Because about 400 meters of hail around the gardens of the inhabitants of the Pfründnerhaus should be cut.
Supported by the residents, there were about twelve supporters.
“We are doing this to reduce costs,” said Citizens’ Association Chairman Walter Schröer.
There has also been so much accumulation.
Because of the hot summer, we are late this time, but fortunately it is now just a form cut.
In the spring, the heck has already been shaved.
Breakfast after work has a long tradition.
“Everyone should stay with their forces,” said Walter Schröer.
World Championship in Rio: Hannes Aigner wins gold at the Kanuslalom World Cup
Augsburger Hannes Aigner won the gold medal at the end of the World Canoe slalom championship in Rio de Janeiro.
The 29-year-old made a perfect run on the Olympic track on Sunday.
Two years ago, he missed Olympic bronze by three hundred seconds.
I was well prepared, I had enough rides here on the site, and today everything went well,” said the Olympic third from London in 2012.
In the goal, he threw his paddle away from joy and stretched both arms victoriously to the height - knowing that it would be enough for at least one medal.
He had the start number four.
However, the six remaining starters failed to overtake his fabulous time of 89.69 seconds.
Second was Czech Jiri Prskavec ahead of Russian Pawel Eigel.
The Gauting police inspection the first attempted break-in into a single-family house this autumn.
Fortunately, the perpetrators failed.
The days are getting shorter – that’s what thieves want to take advantage of.

That it remained in the attempt at the single-family house on Königswieser Straße is due to the alarm system.
It started when the perpetrators took their hands on Friday, just before 8 p.m.
The thieves knew the inhabitants were not at home.
The alarm system, however, apparently surprised them so much that they escaped without prey.

Bankruptcy at Hertha: taken by reality: Bayern demands against Ajax
The predicate is unbeatable: the defeat in Berlin the FC Bayern "does not let fall."
The next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach now determine the first interim for the term of Niko Kovac.
The first small performance deal under new coach Niko Kovac is not expected to rise to a larger autumn low for the Munich.
“A week ago we felt we were invincible.
Now, the reality has caught us a bit,” Thomas Müller said after the deserved 0:2 defeat at Hertha BSC and called for a response for the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Those who know us know that we are really upset and that is why we are going to go toward gas on Tuesday.
For the first time in more than a year outside no own goal shot, as at the same time of the pre-season two compulsory games in a series without a win, the lead in the Bundesliga football for the time being lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Although the overall situation is not as dramatic as at the final stage of the failed Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, the record champion must be warned.
FC Augsburg at 1:1 with its run-intensive man-to-man tactics and the Berliners through their playful needle bites over the outside have delivered just two blueprints within three days, as the latter seemingly overpowerful Bavaria is to crack.
“Those who know FC Bayern know that we will not let it go and we will do everything we can to make it successful again,” Kovac said.
Otherwise, however, he treated his losers in his hometown surprisingly gently and pushed his first defeat as a Munich coach only on the again poor handling of chances.
A victory against Amsterdam and against Borussia Mönchengladbach on Saturday would still make the first interim stage of his term positive before the country break - otherwise the tone is likely to sharpen.
So Kovac did not take any extraordinary measures before the second King's class appearance this season after the 2:0 at Benfica Lisbon.
After the free day on Sunday, as planned, the short preparation for the second preliminary game against Ajax begins, which at the start AEK Athens had also sovereignly defeated with 3:0.
"Now it has caught us in two games, but we will also make our goals again," said national team captain Manuel Neuer.
As already after the losing cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt in the same place, especially Joshua Kimmich spoke clearly.
The lawyer appeared in the role of a warner.
"I don't think that this is all bad luck, we have to work on it again, because we don't make the many opportunities and make the mistakes behind," the 23-year-old emphasized shortly before leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the seventh game day of the previous season, Bayern was already five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken the lead with a point of advance again.
And so Kimmich assessed with a glance at least positively that now the public debate about the supposedly invincible Bavaria has come to an end.
“Yes, that’s good,” said the national player.
It is good for the league.
DFB boss in the shooting line: Özil-Causa: Erdogan's sharp attack on Grindel
With severe accusations, Turkish President Erdogan condemns the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany.
DFB President Grindel sees mistakes, but defends the link.
Now a new post is to be created.
On different stages, Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought for the supremacy of interpretation in the continuing dispute theme Mesut Özil.
After the Turkish president at the opening of the great Ditib Mosque in Cologne vehemently criticized the handling of the former world champion in Germany, the DFB chief defended the bond line.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindel, personally attacked by Özil, announced the consequences of the cause at the Mainzer ZDF "Sportstudio".
"Therefore, in the future - because we also have many players with a migration background in the U-Teams - we must draw very precise conclusions that such a thing does not happen again," said the 57-year-old and wants to win a national player without a migration background as another integration commissioner.
At the same time, Grindel once again stated that Erdogan is not in favor of the values of football and DFB.
He has accused Özil and Ilkay Gündogan of racism.
Our Mesut Özil born and raised in Germany and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this society because they were photographed with me in England," Erdogan said in a statement.
Honestly, as their president, I couldn’t digest the fact that our two young men, who have climbed up to the German national team, were marginalized.
Grindel referred to Gündogan's statement that, unlike Özil, he felt "reasonably treated by the DFB" after the World Cup affair, which began with photos of the two with Erdogan.
At the same time, he announced that he would like to play in the future.
That someone says: If I win, I’m a German; if I lose, I’m a migrant – that’s not possible.
“I am very sorry that he has such an impression,” Grindel said.
We should have defended Mesut more, I always said.
However, he does not see a basis for Özil’s return to the national team.
As a result, an additional integration officer will now be appointed alongside the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who have family roots in Cameroon.
"If someone without a migration background is clearly involved in society and football and says, 'The issue is important, we have to take care of it,' that would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our clubs on the ground where integration needs to work," Grindel said.
Despite criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run again for the office as DFB president next year.
"I do my job and try to do it as well as I can," Grindel said.
Man Makes Three Accidents in Three Hours
Coburg/Rödental - According to police, the 75-year-old caused the accidents on Friday between 10 a.m. and 13 p.m.
At first, the 75-year-old driver was addressed by a lady on the red lamp in the area of Lauterer Höhe.
She told the retiree that he was driving against her car.
However, there was no personal exchange because the 75-year-old could not find the lady on the parking lot.
A short time later, the police received a telephone message about a driver who had left the road and drove against a guide post.
In response, the man did not want the police in the area and then ran away.
Then the red car went home.
However, the retiree has moved in his place of residence, where he has lived for decades, and crashed a construction vehicle when turning.
The police were able to find him and stop him.
His car suffered significant damage.
The 75-year-old made a confusing impression and could not remember much.
The damage is approximately 1300 euros.
Moorbrand in Meppen: Nearly 1,000 troops are still in service.
About four weeks after the outbreak of the Moorbrand on a Bundeswehr site in Emsland, 980 operational forces are still engaged in the eradication work.
This was by the Bundeswehr on Sunday.
As the situation continues to develop steadily, according to one spokesman, 70 volunteers have recently been withdrawn.
A further reduction in the number of operating forces is planned.
On Sunday night, a fire was discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the disaster incident, which was declared well a week earlier on September 21, had been canceled because of fears that the flames could endanger adjacent forests and settlements due to wind and spark flight.
On Thursday it was then said that a fire attack on neighboring communities no longer threatened.
At the time, more than 1,500 operatives were on the ground trying to get the fire under control.
The Air Force continues to support the work at the Bundeswehrtestgelände near Meppen with a transport helicopter.
There are also reconnaissance flights with Bundeswehr drones.
For October 2 and 5, according to the Bundeswehr are also planned again reconnaissance flights with "Tornados".
The fire was triggered by test missiles fired by Airbus technicians.
The smoke flag of the Moorbrand had temporarily stretched up to a hundred kilometers far across the northwest of Germany to Bremen.
On Monday, the Bundeswehr will set up a contact point to receive damage reports.
The first claims for damages had already been announced by hotel owners and holiday home owners.

Macedonia to hold referendum on new state names
In Macedonia, the long-awaited referendum on a new name for this small Balkan country has begun.
Approximately 1.8 million voters are expected to decide whether their country will be called North Macedonia in the future.
This is due to its northern province of the same name, neighboring Greece.
For almost three decades, Athens had blocked any approach of Skopje to the EU and NATO.
If the citizens vote yes, they will also give the start to the Western integration of their country.

Switzerland launches electronic register for organ donors
The registration is intended to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can still be taken only with express consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
Switzerland will launch an electronic register for organ donors on Monday.
This is to facilitate organ donation and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
People who wish to give their organs in the event of death can register there.
Your wishes can then be retrieved from Swisstransplant if necessary.
The new procedure does not change the fact that organs can still be taken – as in Germany – only with express consent, Swisstransplant emphasizes.
It is estimated that 15 percent of Swiss people have a donor card, says Franz Immer, director of the Swisstransplant Foundation.
But only in five percent of cases a card is found at the crucial moment with potential donors.
In more than 60 percent of conversations, relatives do not know the deceased’s wishes.
“They then have to make a decision on behalf of the deceased, which is often very burdensome,” says Immer.
A similar registration system exists in the UK.
In Germany, there are considerations to store information about possible organ donation on the health insurance card, as said by the spokeswoman of the Federal Center for Health Education, Marita Völker-Albert.
"A register where people can register their wishes - for or against organ donation - does not exist," she says.
German Health Minister Jens Spahn has called for a new regulation on organ donation.
According to his proposal, everyone would be considered organ donor, unless he or his relatives object.
The Catholic Church, among other things, rejects this.
14-Year-Old Student Becomes World Champion
The 14-year-old student Tomohiro Iseda from Japan is the world champion in head counting.
He played in Wolfsburg over the weekend against 39 teams.
This was stated by Martina Flamme-Jasper of the Phaeno Science Museum, the venue of the competition, on Sunday.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany took third place.
The youngest participant was a 12-year-old Japanese student, the oldest was a 74-year-old retired Frenchman, according to chief arbitrator Ralf Laue.
The computer science professor from Zwickau (Saxony) organizes the competition every two years.
For example, previous tasks were 14.130 214 x 17.981.822 or 57.809.355 + 28 x 16.448.333.
Since spectators were not allowed, there was a show on Saturday afternoon where participants played against guests from the audience using pocket calculators.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he holds a ball with his head in the air while counting.
He is one of seven in the competition.
In total, 82 candidates from more than 20 countries tried to qualify for the competition.
He was in Bielefeld two years ago as a 14-year-old.
With terms such as superbrain, genius or wonder child, Laue can do little.
“Head counts can be trained,” he said.
Many of the participants exercised several hours a day.
In India and Singapore, there are even computing competitions in stadiums.
The disciplines include, for example, square roots drawing from six-digit numbers.
In versatility computing, candidates are given surprise tasks for which they need to quickly find a solution strategy.
The Germans have a good chance, the judge said.
Otherwise, Asians are often in the advantage, because in early childhood, headache is learned more intensively and with other, effective methods.
Invasive appeal: Video with naked Serena Williams: It's about breast cancer early detection
Tennis ass Serena Williams shows her sensitive and sensitive side.
The 37-year-old wants to point out breast cancer with this video and make herself strong for early detection.
It is about life and death, but also about courage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings up without the song "I Touch Myself" from the group "The Divinyls" - only her hands cover their most intimate places.
The singer Chrissy Amphlett has died.
The emotional video is part of the “I Touch Myself” project, which focuses on early detection of breast cancer that can save lives.
Serena Williams died almost a year ago.
When her daughter Alexis Olympia was born, there were complications.
An emergency operation was initiated to save the baby’s life.
At a subsequent CT, blood clots were detected in Serena’s lungs.

Government wants to ban more extremist symbols
The German government plans to significantly extend the ban on the use of extremist symbols.
Next week, the Turkish-Blue Coalition will send a corresponding bill to the so-called "Symbole Law" for review.
The aim is to significantly increase the number of terrorist or similar groups covered by the ban.
Polar cold air brings snow to the mountains in the west
Ms. Holle will shake her beds for the first time in the West next week: Polar cold air reaches Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of the Central Institute of Meteorology and Geodynamics (ZAMG), the snow drop limit at the beginning of the week drops to 1,500 to 1,200 meters - in narrow valleys it can snow down to about 1,000 meters in strong intensity, it said.
From the Bregenzerwald to the Hohen Tauern, between 20 and 40 centimeters of snow can be expected above 2,000 meters.
Therefore, on higher pass roads (Arlbergpass, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brennerpass, Gerlospass, Felbertauern, Großglockner Hochalpenstraße) the road conditions become wintery.
Farmers May Start Annual Knick Care on Monday
Farmers in Schleswig-Holstein are allowed to start the annual knick care on Monday.
The “green walls” that are unique in Germany have shaped the landscape of the forestless Bundesland for about 200 years.
The up to five meters wide tree-and-growth hills are "forest replacement" and for many animals and plants the last retreat areas.
Knicks connect as corridors scattered habitats, through which the exchange of organisms can still work, as said the managing director of the Nature Conservation Union Germany (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski.
Knicks are living fences
The Knicks were installed on the basis of an order of the Danish King Christian VI in 1766, who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The “living fences” were not only field boundaries and livestock fences, they also supplied farmers with firewood and bars for their craft houses.
From that time also comes its name "Knick": Through "Umknicken" of the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, around 45,000 kilometers of hailways stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a wood-rich, variedly structured landscape.
According to the NABU, they are now used by approximately 7,000 animal species as a substitute habitat.
In one kilometer of knick can live up to 1800 different species and breed up to 30 pairs of birds.
However, its ecologically important function can only be fulfilled if it is properly cared for in the winter.
Otherwise, it will shrink into a light series of trees, which in addition to biodiversity also loses the wind protection effect, Ludwichowski said.
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, knick care can only be operated outside the breeding season from October to March.
After the tsunami in Sulawesi, Indonesians talk about the situation on the ground
The local Radika Pinto describes in an interview with the editorial network Germany (RND) the situation on the island of Sulawesi after the earthquakes and the tsunami:
Were you there during the tsunami?
No, I was in Jakarta on the island of Java at the time.
When the earthquakes were, my wife called me, she was in Palu.
When I learned about the tsunami, I immediately set out to return to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday morning because I had to drive for more than 20 hours after a flight because the Palu airport was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island now?
The national government has reopened the airport so that aid goods can also be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the coast, all completely destroyed.
Our World Vision office was also destroyed, but we temporarily set up something where we also housed other people.
Where are the people living in Sulawesi now?
Many have rushed to surrounding hills where they are still standing out for fear of another tsunami and earthquake, and where they have no access to water and food.
Some are standing in front of their houses, there are still earthquakes.
Because many grocery stores and gas stations are completely closed, people are stealing some food and gasoline.
The public service is completely shut down, the national government is helping out.
A prison has also been destroyed, the prisoners are partially running around freely and finding them is difficult.
There are still many bodies around, many people have not yet been found and are missing.
How is the communication and information provision on the island?
At the moment we have cell phone reception, but before this did not work and we only got information on the radio.
Many people are still looking for their children, neighbors and other people they do not know if they live and where they are staying because people were not home during the earthquakes, but were traveling, for example, at work.
The tsunami warning system did not work properly.
Do you have information about it?
We don't know the reasons for this, but when the warning came, many thought "Okay, no tsunami" - and then it came.
In other regions not affected by the tsunami, there was the misinformation that a tsunami is hitting the region and they have rushed to the surrounding mountains.
Is an island like Sulawesi, located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, not prepared for earthquakes?
However, there are earthquakes every day, but this was the worst.
We usually know how to respond to earthquakes and also train evacuations.
But the entire infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake has affected a lot of people.
Muscle injuries against Werder: VfB must give up on Aogo and Donis for a long time

Biathlete Julian Eberhard wins World Cup medal
Fourth place at Olympia was long in the stomach of Biathlet Julian Eberhard.
In the coming winter, the Saalfeldener wants to pick up the missing precious metal at the World Cup in Östersund.
The last shot cost the 31-year-old in the Olympic Sprint of Pyeongchang the medal close to grip.
Seven-tenths of a second was missing on bronze.
“I deliberately gave myself time to process that,” Eberhard says at the opening of the MyGym fitness studio in his hometown of Saalfelden.
A medal was the goal, I was in top shape, but it just didn’t want to be.
The Pinzgauer is all the more motivated to recover the missing precious metal in the new season: "The goal can only be to come back to a major event with the constitution, to win something.
Sometimes you also have to hit.
The World Cup loop in Östersund (SWE) is Eberhard: "I have already closed the track to the heart," he remembers with pleasure his fourth World Cup place in the single race last year.
Immediately after the Olympics, he celebrated the only single victory for Austria in the last World Cup winter in the Kontiolahti (FIN) mass start competition.
He finished second in Oslo (NOR).
Brett Kavanaugh: FBI investigation in a turbocharged pace
The time is extremely short and the number of scheduled interviews is very limited.
With an FBI investigation at a turbocharged pace, the Republicans in the U.S. Senate want to secure a thin majority for the controversial judge candidate Brett Kavanaugh, accused of coercion.
President Donald Trump has given investigators a deadline until Friday to clarify the more than 30 years-old alleged incidents.
The most recent turn in the drama of Kavanaugh’s calling accompanied by a cultural struggle had been triggered on Friday.
After an eight-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and first prosecutor Christine Blasey Ford, during which the lawyer sparked angry tirades against the opposition Democrats, the Senate Justice Committee should pave the way for the final confirmation of the former conservative judge at the U.S. Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed secure when suddenly Senator Jeff Flake declared, contrary to his original announcement, that he would agree, but demanded an FBI investigation.
After shocking scenes, his party friends agreed.
President Trump, who described Thursday’s severe talks as “shaking,” initially abstained from further attacks on the women and spoke on the contrary of “happiness in misfortune.”
In this way, final doubts could be cleared, he said.
Later, Trump attacked the Democrats at an election rally because they rejected Kavanaugh: “They are trying to block and destroy.”
Trump orders FBI investigation into Kavanaugh case
The White House has also limited the powers of the investigators.
Two women’s accusations will be investigated, but no more, a government official told the Wall Street Journal: “They’re not going on an excursion.”
According to the New York Times, only four witnesses were heard.
The mobile radar device installed in a "civil vehicle" of the municipality of Ried for monitoring the speed limit is stationed on the garden street from Monday, October 1.
There is also the Federal School Centre.
The municipality also operates several fixed installed radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after victory against Mainz: Feeling the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 won their first season victory against Mainz.
The relief on Schalke is great after the first victory of the season.
However, against Mainz, the time factor also played a role.
Gelsenkirchen - It is now well known that Christian Heidel is a huge pessimist in football.
This was not the case in the match against Mainz 5.
“I saw every ball in it.
And there were a lot of corners and a lot of balls in our penalty area," said the sporting board of Schalke 04 - and breathed up.
In the end, the King's Blue managed to bring the short 1:0 against the Rhine Hesse over time and thus the first victory of the season under the roof.
In fact, it could have happened differently.
After the leadership by Alessandro Schöpf 11 to the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco had given certainty Tedesco: "In general, the first half was good, both playful and from the pressing."
Do not create a headball monster.
"The last ten minutes felt like two hours for me," he said, "if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bench, I can understand that."
The boys were afraid to give it out of their hands and therefore continued to retreat.
Man and mouse against Mainz.
To save the first three counters of the season.
"We all fell a huge stone from the heart," Schöpf said, who had no insignificant part in it with his headball hit: "I am actually the worst headball player in the team."
In the end, only victory counts.
The relief was felt throughout the arena, including at Tedesco.
"We wanted to start with pressure in the initial phase and make a fireworks out of it," said Schalke's head coach.
The victory was important.
We can finally wait a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team and the fans.
We played intelligently, calmly and courageously, so we have to tackle matches over 90 minutes.
Probably the biggest disadvantage of the afternoon: King Blue missed it to worry more about clearer conditions.
The possibilities were finally there, for example, through the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the latte twice 59./72. or Amine Harit 62.
“Then it would not have been a trembling victory,” Tedesco said, “you’ve already felt the fear a little bit.”
So I am glad we won.
He was not the only Schalker.
Fischbachau: Smoke column in the Leitzachtal 2 km visible
The smoke was not overlooked.
From a distance of about two kilometers, a wanderer observed a fire in the Leitzachttal on Sunday at 13.30 a.m.
Now the police are investigating.
Fischbachau - The cause was soon discovered by police and firefighters: an unknown man had set fire to garbage on a two-square-meter area on the Gschwendner Berg.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: a discussion on an equal footing
In front of them is the author, Professor Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani.
He has repeatedly followed the invitation of Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
“I have made it my task for many years to bring interesting people to Greves,” explains the founder and chairman of the “Reckenfelder Treff” – the association that cooperates with the alliance “Kulturpolitik” in organizing the evening.
El-Mafaalani enters the reading very loosely, describes the writing process of the book, speaks about how difficult it was to explain the subject in a understandable way.
With a lot of gestures, solid numbers and the one or the other joke, he brings the audience closer to one of the most conflicting themes: migration and integration.
Why are there increasing conflicts despite successful integration?
The Syrian author uses himself to answer the question of a metaphor.
At one table is the German society, at the catcent table the migrants of the first generation.
Their children are growing up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany, they have always sat at the big table and now want to participate.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, the decisive question is not whether one is politically right-wing or left-wing, but “Am I for or against an open society?”
At first more behavior, then more and more the round of discussion runs.
There is a need for speech.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspective, two teachers tell how they see successful or unsuccessful integration in students.
El-Mafaalani is present, not on stage, a symbol for the discussion: it is on an eye level.
The sociology professor does not press his opinion, emphasizes that he is talking about the average, not about individual fates.
He is pleased that there is interest in the subject, because "only when we understand what the problem is, we can find solutions," says El-Mafaalani.
During the subsequent signature hour, he also held an open ear for the questions of the guests and was also intensely discussed in the foyer, with prepared Kurdish specialties.

Construction in Landsham: 100 applications for 20 plots
The demand is apparently huge: over 100 people have applied for the purchase of one of the land in Landsham-Süd.
The municipality of Pliening has sold the first land in the newly built area of Landsham-Süd on the free market.
This is stated by Mayor Roland Frick.
In addition, the application phase for those 20 properties that the municipality offers at more favorable conditions or prices has been completed – similar to the previous local model.
More than 100 applications have been received, according to Frick.
"The documents are currently being reviewed" in terms of application criteria, completeness and accuracy.
According to the mayor of Plieninger, the goal is to have prepared the candidate ranking for the 20 properties by the end of the year and to submit them to the municipal council.

The construction is now almost completed, the roads and roads are expected to be asphalted soon.
One single plot and two of the multi-family houses belong to a private person, the rest to the municipality of Pliening.
It sells the majority on the free market, 20 units in the social-compatible model.
According to Frick, the two multi-family houses of the municipality are to be built as affordable housing.
With a total of 16 free-state-funded, income-oriented apartments.
Space for 200 people

This is how Schalke Naldo's "great sport" also succeeds on the bench
For the third time in a row not in the start-up: Nevertheless, Naldo thanked Schalke coach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Aparecido Rodrigues, for the third time in a row, was sitting not in the Schalker start-up, but on the exchange bench, the understanding among many people would have been great if the two-foot Brazilian had spoken so correctly the frustration of the soul.
But when the Schalker players after the 1:0 victory over the FSV Mainz 05 gathered in the middle circle as usual and chief coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his professionals, the 36-year-old, whom everyone call Naldo for ease, came in and said, "We have to thank you, coach!"
"It was very emotional, it was a great sport," Tedesco later said about the reaction of his vice captain, who did not have any resentment despite his reserve existence.
Probably Naldo, who was celebrated as the best schalker last season, knows that he hasn’t actually gotten on the finish line with his coach – but gets a break for good reason.
A reason called “charge control.”
It was not easy to tell him.
"It wasn't easy to tell him that, I'm telling you that honestly," Tedesco told the moment he told Naldo that he wasn't in the start-up.
He is an important player, he is an important person.
But it’s always about the thing, it’s about the club,” Tedesco explained.
Naldo played 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is important that everybody can get through at the moment.
And that we keep all in the boat," Tedesco explained the rotation, which recently caught Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian responded with the wisdom of his advanced age: by also proving himself on the bench as an exemplary team player.
The atmosphere in Austria’s industry continued its downturn in August compared to the eurozone.
The Purchase Manager Index (PMI) was at a 37-month low with 46.7 points.
In Europe, Austria still has the third best mood behind Ireland and the Netherlands, the Markit Institute on Monday in its survey among 3,000 companies.
Unlike in Austria, although the PMI of the euro area rose by 1.1 to 45.1 points, the index is still below the mark of 50 counters for the 13th month in a row, which suggests growth.
Only Ireland’s industry broke this threshold in August with 50.9 points.
The final were the Greeks (42.1 points).
In Germany, France and Spain, the mood barometer declined, but more slowly than in the previous months.
In Spain, the index reached its highest level since March with 44,0 points.
"The slightly weakened valley ride could mean that the worst has passed," said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, in the third quarter, the industry remains the number one growth brake.
A rapid return to the growth zone is not in sight: export orders in the euro area have fallen as strongly as they have not been since November 2011.
For the seventh month in a row, the companies cut jobs.
Industrial production in China fell in August stronger than initially thought.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points last month to 47.6 points.
Experts had initially expected 47.8 points.
The Purchasing Managers Index is based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industrial companies.
Among other things, developments in sales, employment, warehouses and prices are collected.
Tuchel's PSG team wins in eighth league game
29 September 2018 at 19:45
Nice coach Thomas Tuchel rushes from victory to victory with Paris Saint-Germain in the French Football Championship.
At OGC Nice, the title defender won thanks to two goals by Superstar Neymar with 3:0 (1:0) and was thus also successful in the eighth league game.
The last time Olympique Lyon played in France was 82 years ago.
Brazilian Neymar led PSG after 22 minutes and made the finish in the post-match period.
The interim score was scored by Christopher Nkunku (46).
Paris also managed the general test for the groundbreaking second Champions League group game against Red Star Belgrade on Wednesday.
For the start of the King's class, Tuchel's team had to accept the only compulsory game defeat this season at 2:3 in Liverpool so far.
