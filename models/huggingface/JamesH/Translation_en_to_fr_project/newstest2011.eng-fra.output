What will they do?
New CSSD Councilors will most likely have to overcome language barriers to understand their old colleagues from ODS in Prague Council and municipal council.
A typical social democrat member of the new Council was tested in terms of the well-known slang that originated in the town hall during the last few years, when Prague was ruled by the current coalition partners.
Coded vocabulary that was established by Prague political elite in the previous era of the mayor Pavel Bem, describes some of the most famous persons, events and events in the city.
The new council members do not understand the well-known concepts.
At least they say so.
Who is Voldemort?"
"I really do not know."
"I am rather a novice in Prague politics," answered Lukas Kaucky, the Councilor for culture.
And though he is a political veteran, Councilor Karel Brezina responded similarly.
For example, the term "golf hole."
"It is the only one of the presented words that I use at least occasionally."
Otherwise, I generally do not recognise the slang.
The glossary, published by Aktuálně.cz last June just before the ODS Election Congress, selected six examples, mainly well known in connection with the Prague City Hall.
The Socialists explained the concepts of "Voldemort," the "greatest golf hole in Prague," "bull neck," "capital threat" and "to plate with metal."
The fourth Council member agreed with the quiz, but later he stopped answering the phone.
The fifth Councilor, Peter Dolínek, refused the test straight away.
I do not pay attention to such things at all and I am not going to evaluate the way Civic Democrats talk.
"I am very concerned about how we will match our programs," he said.
As we have mentioned, Councilor Lukas Kaucky reportedly would not recognise in the above heading that it is about an influential entrepreneur and friend of ex-Mayor Bem, Roman Janousek.
"Voldemort" is no meaning to Kaucky and the only term he correctly guessed is "the best golf hole in Prague."
It is Blanka tunnel, says Kaucky, and immediately adds: "I know it from the newspapers."
"I'll have to get myself a language course," he quips.
Blanka tunnel was then correctly detected by not only the matador Karel Brezina but also the Environment Councillor Lukas Plachy.
The Social Democrats then also know who is actually Voldemort and Lukas Plachy is familiar with this character - he also knows the right meaning of the phrase "to go to a candy bar."
The meaning of that is going to a company in Prague, which is the office of Janousek's companies.
Similar to Brezina he notes that he acquired the knowledge from the newspapers rather than using such a vocabulary himself.
According to testers, there is no such groovy slang glossary in Social Democrats Party.
"I even consult my colleagues, but it seems to be that we do not have anything like that.
The party usually address one another with names, sometimes we use abbreviations and name garbles.
When I was in school I was called Birch, but I do not know if my colleagues call me so.
AKTUALIZATION tested the nickname and it works.
The Councilor Weinert is a very friendly old man for party members, and Councilor Poche, who was a suspect in the fraud in party sponsorship, was nicknamed "Igráček" by some colleagues.
Nicknames are also the only thing accepted by the Social Democrats in internal party speech.
According to a report from the Prague chairman, Hulda is not a favourite, but a nickname has been seen for that Prague chairman.
"Dr of Black-jack Law" supposedly recalls that Peter Hulínský got his Diploma of JUDr at the Police Academy in Bratislava.
The government wants to limit the torture of "witches" in a brochure.
Women declared as witches in Burkina Faso usually have several common characteristics.
The most common causes of death are older generation, cannot work for health reasons, are unmarried and have no children.
The one who "becomes" a witch is sent into isolation to prevent the spread of threats to the village.
"Such a fate occurs only rarely.
Healthy young women are sent away because they help work and bear children.
Local government now has taken a serious stance on social measures.
It has published an information booklet, which should help limit the witch-hunt.
It is a snag.
More than 70 percent of adults in Burkina Faso cannot read, according to The Standard daily.
Witchcraft claims are also common in other African countries.
In Ghana, which borders with Burkina Faso, a seventy-two Amma Hemmah died last week after three women and two men tortured her, doused in kerosene and set alight.
The case was reported by BBC.
The perpetrators claim that it was a fortunate coincidence.
According to their version the oil used for ritual anointing ignited and killed the woman.
It allegedly exploded after the group wanted to "expel the evil spirit" from the woman.
Isolation of "witches" is widely supported by people regardless of their education level.
The Daily Standard quoted a businessman of forty two from Burkina Faso: "Devourers of human souls have always posed a danger," he said.
While in Burkina Faso the government is trying to moderate the witch hunt, the Gambia President himself participated in the hunt last year.
"Gambian President Jámí after his aunt's death started a large witch-hunt for witches allegedly involved in her death and trying to use black magic to kill the president."
They invited shamans from neighbouring Guinea to help him and they accompanied by police, soldiers and private security guards forced randomly selected men and women from Gambian villages to the president's ranch in Kanilai.
The arrested people took a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic effects, which also causes intestinal and kidney problems.
Two prisoners died.
After international pressure nearly thousand of inmates were released.
Bakala's tenant: Heating in the stove, agreed to the rent increase
The old man walked out of the door of the client center of RPG Flats Company, owned by the 'coal baron' Zdenek Bakala, the largest privately owned rental apartment owner in Czech Republic.
Under his arm he carried a folder with new lease contracts to three flats: his, his daughters and his son.
All three's rent has already risen due to deregulation.
Next year the son will be paid CZK 4100 for second class 2 +1 apartment instead of current CZK 3500 per month.
The man points his finger on his son's new contract, which he is authorised to sign by proxy.
"But I signed it," he says half angrily, half resignedly.
BytyOKD.cz Civic Association, which identified the new tenancy conditions as "unfair and immoral" advises tenants not to sign the new contract and wait until 7 December for guidance on how to counter them.
The man remains skeptic.
One says this, another that, he laughs.
Ostrava has become a great laboratory of deregulation.
After New Year the vast majority of non-market rented buildings in Czech Republic will be subject to deregulation.
Anyway, Aktuálněcz decided to visit the laboratory itself.
Havířov's RPG waiting room is one of four in the Ostrava region and is already full at nine a.m. on Tuesda.
Looking right at the door, there is a security guard from a security agency with a call device nearby.
Special button "Rent 2011" shines on the touch screen.
One tap and the machine issues a number.
You cannot even read "157" and your figure swirles on the large screen below the ceiling of the waiting room.
It is your turn in half a second.
The old couple comes to ask about the lease after a few moments, and there is no rush for new leases in the waiting room.
Most people came to solve the same problems as usual - request for repairs, insurance events etc.
Letters with new leases have been sent to mailboxes of most of the tenants of the 44 thousand dwelling RPG portfolio in Ostrava region since mid November.
RPG Byty proposes to increase rent by 15 to 38 percent in these letters.
Special desk for new leases was opened on 18 November in the client centre.
The clerks at the desk laugh, when the client introduces himself as a journalist.
Deregulation and Bakala's former mining flats are local hot topic.
Before the election it was quite loudly adopted by Parliament Vice President and a native of Ostrava Lubomir Zaoralek of the Social Democrats, and now it fills local newspapers.
"I have been asking them for this new floor for twenty years."
The man mentioned in the introduction says, "They have not even changed a f..king plate in the bathroom," says the man mentioned in the introduction.
It is mostly retired people who only come to see if they can get a discount on rent if they sign on time, as they promise to fulfil their promises in their special offer.
Half off February rent will also be paid to the other tenants who have signed the new contract by 15 December.
Havířov's "deregulatory desk" is certainly not overloaded with questions.
"Out of yesterday's 360 clients about twenty to fifty came to inquire about leases in 2011," says the counterclerk.
RPG on their bulletin board and Web site proposed individual contracts where needed.
However, if the parties fail to agree on the lease, an independent tribunal will have to establish the rent.
This is not a threat, but the only legitimate and completely legal procedure.
"Nobody will sue them here," said one of the RPG Flats clerks and the man on the street outside the client center partly agrees.
Because I have CZK 13,000 pension and five thousand left for the meals I cannot afford bringing it to court.
The clerk but then does not doubt after all.
"We will see."
Because Mr Zaoralek advises them not to sign, so some people are waiting.
The regulation of rents ends in most Czech Republic with the New Year 2011 and according to RPG Byty the increase of rents is an economic necessity.
The current rent is still below the amount needed for simple maintenance of housing stock, according to Pavel Klimes, Director of RPG portfolio of residential apartments, and reminded that neglect of the housing stock complaints from angry tenants is the main reason for the increase in rents according to house owners.
While in five years between 2005 and 2010 RPG could invest four billion from the rents into the apartment, in four years between 2011 and 2014 it should be 5.2 billion.
Large screen hanging from the ceiling opposite the padded seats of Havířov's waiting room keeps repeating some information highlighted in red.
"The increase in rents in 2011 by 15% and less concerns 31,200 flats, it is more than 90% of RPG apartments."
"And it will always be a maximum of CZK 7.50 per square meter and month," appears on the screen.
Only for 400 apartments of the RPG portfolio the rent will rise by 38 percent.
In these cases the increase will be from an extremely low CZK 19.66 per square meter to an increase of CZK 19.66 per square meter.
In 2600 apartments will the rent remain the same next year.
RPG Byty promise that rent deregulation will not be sudden, it will be spread over four to eight years.
It adds another commitment: all the money from rent increases (see chart) will be invested in the flats, especially in heat savings - new windows and insulation.
Priority will be given to people who sign the agreement to increase rents.
Offices need a kindergarten, architects have understood.
Avriopoint Office Building in Brno is the new headquarters of Arch.Design Company.
Nobody would expect that it contains a small kindergarten with everything necessary - with coloured walls, imaginative furniture, a bunch of toys and even a mini golf course on the outdoor terrace.
Since October last year children of Arch.Design employees can attend.
Architectural design company, Arch.Design, whose studios produced many important buildings in Brno, have included the space for their corporate kindergarten in the first drawings of the Avriopoint building.
It employs nearly 90 people - mainly baby-boom-aged and they want their women designers and architects to quickly return to work.
The possibility of part-time contracts is also available for Arch.Design employees.
Female construction engineers and architects have thus the opportunity to mix their demanding jobs with child care.
Tinz kindergarten was created by Arch. Design employees themselves and with support from management they were able to obtain a grant from the European Union and the Labour and Social Affairs Ministry.
Corporate tiny kindergarten is funded by the European Social Fund through the Operational Program Human Resources and Employment and the Czech state budget.
The grant funding (subsidy of 2.8 million) was able to purchase equipment and for two years provide qualified personnel and operation.
After the depletion of financial aid (2 years) the Arch.Design Company must operate the kindergarten for 3 years at its own cost.
Preparation of the project lasted one year and the Economy Rating Company helped with the application for grant.
The care is provided by qualified staff, children are taken care of by nurse and kindergarten teacher all day, but most children are over 3 years old.
This is a "Mini-kindergarten" and only 5 children may be present at the same time, though more can attend in the course of the day.
The operation of the kindergarten is flexible to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same right to use the nursery, regardless of their position in the company hierarchy.
Although this is an individual education and care, the program content in the mini-kindergarten is similar to the framework program of preschool education.
Children are not only playing here, they are also provided with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to schooling and English is also taught here.
The class is not only equipped with toys, inspiring games, but also with a computer that children can use.
The presence of children directly in the company promotes a friendly and positive environment.
Parents can always check their child and prevent stress situations related to delayed pick up from nurseries located far from their parents' work place.
Parents then use their working time much more effectively.
It is unexpected that a loyal employee -employer relationship is produced there naturally.
Arch.Design became one of Czech companies that offer significant benefit when recruiting new employees, they are friendly to family and through this program they have enhanced personnel marketing.
The House of bones still fascinates after 100 years. Look at the interiors by Gaudi
The roof looks like a prehistoric lizard's spine, the staircase reminds of a dinosaur backbone and balconies are open fish mouths.
This is the house of Casa Batlló in Barcelona by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí.
The locals started calling it the Bone House for its organic shapes.
Organic shapes, wild colors, unusual use of stone, broken tiles and mosaics, a huge facade with scales and soft curves, all of which are typically of the Gaudí Art Nouveau.
The house opens with dreamy lines, soft colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals.
The detailed look reveals geometry, rhythm, and well-considered order.
At night, the whole house appears even more dramatic, it is lit to enhance the gloss paint impression.
Winding and twisting shapes are equally as common indoors.
Wood follows the window frames in the wave, along with handrails, door trim and watch.
Batlló House, located in the Eixample district on a busy shopping street Passeig de Gracia No 43, was rebuilt from the original house in 1877 by the architect Emilio Sal Cortes.
Reconstruction took two years and the house was completed in 1906.
The investor, a wealthy industrialist Josep Batlló, initially insisted on the demolition of the old building and building a new one, but soon he adopted Gaudi's idea of an unusual and cheaper redevelopment of the house.
The apartment building Casa Batllo was never designed by Antoni Gaudí alone.
Architect Josep Maria Jujol cooperated with him.
It was his developer board that created the decorations for the representative apartment of the property owner, as well as the use of mosaic on the facade.
Other authors and artists worked on the facade.
Joint work on draft plans for Casa Batlló building started a successful cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi.
Jujol was involved in the construction of Gaudi's building Casa Mila and Park Guell, which contains other Gaudi works.
The locals started calling it the "House of Bones" for its organic shapes.
Others began to call it a "yawning house" for its specific mechanism of opening windows.
It is also reported that on the top of the building there is a representation of the sword of St. George, the patron of Catalonia.
Other sculptural elements of the building also contain hidden religious motives.
Gaudi designed a central heating system in the house, unique for his time, with ventilation and typical chimneys.
Their forty five degree slope may seem bizarre.
When creating Gaudi totally ignored building regulations of the time and could not allow them to tie him.
The start of construction he received a building permit from the city, but the details of the planned reconstruction were so limited that two years later the City Council asked for redress.
Councilors often noticed that the building could interfere with its pillars into the public sidewalk.
The correction never occurred, but rather the opposite: only fifteen days after the request from the city, Josep Batlló applied for (and successfully received) the permission to lease the top two floors of the building.
The owner himself moved to lower floors.
The gallery was on the second floor and on the third floor there was a bedroom and a private section of the apartment.
The ground floor was leased to a jewelry company.
The whole six-storey building is intersected by a staircase, which ends only at the roof terrace.
The key elements of the reconstruction were the elimination of all right angles and straight lines and replacing them with curved walls.
Gaudí also worked with the modern concept of space interconnection.
The social part is completely connected by opening the saloon door and a large group can comfortably communicate without leaving the privacy for intimate conversations.
The house won due to Gaudi's rebuilding a new facade and also the unusual roof and two extra floors.
Also, Gaudi’s play with light is remarkable, along with blue and white glazed tiles used to line the inner courtyard and skylights.
The play of two colors ensures maximum light on all floors of the house.
It was enough to gamble on the principle that white reflects light more than dark colors, which absorb the sun's rays on the contrary.
Casa Batlló House, which was included in UNESCO World Heritage Fund in 2005, is open to all.
The most spacious and most luxurious apartment has been opened to the public on the first floor.
The owners decided to move this up in 2002 to celebrate the one hundred fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the famous author.
They kept providing the excursions since they discovered that this is a very profitable business, and they extended the tours by the common and attic spaces, including a roof terrace.
The admission to the sight is quite low, costing 16.50 euros, while students, seniors and travel passport holders receive a ten percent discount.
The amount greatly exceeds the price of admission to other Gaudi's buildings in the city.
If you want to experience the true atmosphere of the house with dragon towers, you must quickly make friends with any of the apartment house's residents and visit them at home.
How to choose the mattress and the flat bed base: Women have different requirements from men.
No luxurious bed frame, but the quality of the lying area, that is the mattress and slightly slatted bed base gives a good bed.
They must be matched in harmony to suit a specific user.
The selection decisions are influenced by many things such as weight, height, age, health, and gender of the owner.
Also the type of interior, into which the mattress and slatted base are purchased is important.
A typical example?
Examples for summer houses which are not heated regularly, latex mattresses are not suitable because they warm up rather slowly.
In addition, they tend to have significantly higher weight than a standard polyurethane foam mattress.
It is also necessary to turn them regularly.
If they do not have enough venting channels in their core, and still lie on hard board, they retain moisture: Even mold could occur under the mattresses.
The choice is also influenced by habits.
The more time spent abroad, where they often use very thick mattresses with softening layer, will find it difficult to feel good on a thin one with hard surface.
"I probably asked all hockey players returning from the NHL that they were sleepless.
Their weakened shoulders, heels and hips needed to be softened with a layer of lazy foam.
They are recommended even for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder, so they assume 'information' from the joints and skin in an unhealthy way.
Because she wanted lazy foam mattresses for many hockey players, but also other customers years ago.
"Now it is okay, suitable mattresses can be found at Tempur, Italian Magniflex, but also Czech Tropico."
You need not be an NHL guy to appreciate the lazy foam.
This "miracle" works in a simple way.
Optimizes its rigidity and shape by absorbing or adapting to your body warm.
You feel no pressure and will not keep changing your bed position all night as if you were after a tough game.
You will just sleep better.
Lazy foam also works well as a protection against pressure sore.
When choosing the size of your mattress, add one foot length to your height, which is about 21-34 cm.
Height of about 180 cm will require a bed of 210-220 cm.
The minimum width for one should be 90cm in double bed, i.e. 180 cm total.
In separate beds, for example for single people, the recommended length is 120 to 140 cm.
For both normal comfort and a possible visitor.
Another rule for bed width is simple: when you are lying on your back, you should keep your hands slightly bent at the elbow, advises Ing. Helena Prokopová, head of the Guild of Upholsterers and Decoratives, who has addressed the issue of healthy sleep and ergonomics of furniture for many years and teaches it to colleges.
For everyone needs their own mattress and a flat base in a double bed, be careful to match the thickness of mattresses when purchasing them.
Otherwise you will have to fit into slatted bases into different heights, which may not be possible with every frame of the bed.
foam mattress should be at least 14 cm, while the frame types with a spring framework should be at least 15 cm, including at least three centimeters for shaping and softening layer.
Helena Prokopova advises.
Every mattress requires a specific type of slatted base.
Upholstered beds, where the mattress and the foundation are like conjoined Siamese twins, should not be used in bedrooms.
It is hard to air the mattresses; you cannot wash the fabric either.
The mattress will appear like a large (and clogged) sieve.
The reason why experts reject advertising slogans of life of the mattress up to 25 years or even lifetime warranty.
All has its pros and cons.
The practical advice from vendors is as follows: Do not give up hygiene for 120 and 140 cm mattresses and their removable and washable cover, but add a mattress protector, which can be easily removed and washed.
Although today mattress covers are now commonly manufactured with a zip around the perimeter, so after opening you get two parts (vital for washing and size of washing machine) handling the large ones when removing them may remind you of a lightweight fight with a heavier one in the ring.
If you have a fixed plate in the bed instead of a flat base?
Never!
If so, only in a bed for one-night visitors.
The board should be equipped (if not already) with ventilation holes and use the mattress with a minimum height of 15 cm with springs in the bags (German Taschenfederkern) and a softening layer.
Polyurethane mattresses should not be on such a basis.
While latex or sandwich mattresses are usually suitable, latex or sandwich mattresses will be suitable (maybe latex and coconut), but it always pays to get the slatted bases with a larger number of blades, 28 or more, where there are double blades in the lumbar area and their stiffness can be regulated.
mattresses with spring frames should not lie on adjustable slats as they do not respond to positioning.
In addition to adjusting the stiffness of the slats you can also enjoy the so-called shoulder cradle.
This is a special mounting of blades, which allow you to push, or even tilt the plate so that the arm of the sleeper would easily "fit into the mattress."
For men whose shoulders are "all over their back" this is certainly an important thing.
However, mattress manufacturers respect it when in "men" mattresses they started to use the softening zone right in the shoulder area.
They also remember women - those who indulge in the softer surface of the hip area.
Aileron or lamellar gratings with the so-called multi-torsion suspension are designed for the most demanding customers.
The pressure is spread into several points and the tension reduces.
When you use wrong pillow with correct mattress and slatted base (large and "stuffed") most of the "pluses" will disappear.
The basic rule is simple: The cushion should support the head and touch the shoulders with its corners so that the shoulder muscles can relax.
A suitable size of 50 x 60 cmis recommended, preferred for example in Scandinavia.
When lying on the side, the pillow should be able to deal (along with the shoulder cradle of the slatted bed or softened zone in the mattress) with shoulder height.
Modern mattresses have something in common with original grass-filled mattresses.
Their manufacturers are increasingly using natural materials or maybe admixtures.
There is simply an organic trend even in mattresses.
Raw materials from oil, out of which polyurethane foam is made, are replaced with natural oils such as soy and castor-oil plant.
It is just soy that all well-known manufacturers use now.
Organic in mattresses means that the core is made of pure natural material.
Natural products are also used in the production of mattress covers, one of which was aloe vera.
Then you can indulge in microcapsules that release fresh scent of lavender or forest.
There is even a division between men and women.
While men are cooled by herbal extract of birch, so that the cover absorbs heat and cool the body, women are on the contrary "warmed" by the cover.
The red pepper extract increases blood flow, so the weaker sex feels warmer.
Today's favorites?
Cold foam (with larger pores with damaged cell structure) is more breathable than regular polyurethane and has better elasticity.
Combination of different stiffnesses of cold foams and "lazy" foam result in multi-zone mattresses that know exactly where the head should be, as well as shoulder and feet.
You will pay seven thousand crowns and above for a good quality mattress.
Health parameters tend to have lower VAT as they are considered medical equipment.
Gumotex was the first to use this advantage in Czech Republic.
It is not easy to save on the mattress and the slightly slatted base.
Occasionally you can use special offers from manufacturers or retailers, offering two mattresses for one price.
Examples of Magniflex brand offer their Duofreeze mattress with the memory foam Memory sewn into the cover for 11 990 crowns.
However, you can get the second one for free.
The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with open cell structure and high density was started by Tempur material in a "cosmic" pace.
It was originally developed as material for NASA because the astronauts were exposed to enormous overextertion during the start.
Tempur softens when warm, but strengthens in cold.
It is then perfectly adapted to human body and spreads its pressure optimally.
It is therefore ideal to prevent pressure ulcer development but also to enhance comfort while sleeping.
Viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses, but also for medical products, such as special feet pillow, which protects the legs and the blood system.
Domestic producers use the foam Twinsaver or Eucatherm C and such.
People monitoring devices are increasingly needed by parents who want to watch their children.
Fear for their own child is a major reason for using GPS.
The system originally created to search for cars also monitors people and thus should help in cases such as the disappearance of nine-year-old Annie Janatková.
The facility is currently of size of a matchbox, but it may soon be as large as a watch.
Many people have been scared by the case of missing Annie and thus began to search for better ways to protect their children.
Even at the cost of disruption to their privacy.
They are not spying, but a way to reduce the likelihood of a tragedy occurring, said Petr Pilin of Macro Weil, one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment on the Czech market.
"I admit that under certain circumstances it may lead to misuse of such equipment if they are placed in a bag of someone who does not know it, but we have not seen such cases yet."
"Most customers actually buy it for security reasons," he added.
According to him, children should always know what the purpose of the box is and how it is used in an emergency.
Child psychologist Dana Bočková says if a child does not want to wear something like that, it will just get rid of it.
"Even young children show great creativity how to lose some things on purpose if they do not want to be under control."
Parents' expectations were fueled by cell phones before, but they can be switched off as well with this device.
According to her it is questionable whether such a device would really help.
"As for the upcoming kidnapping, the perpetrator always ensures that the child should not have any electronics that may reveal his position."
It's now.
When tracking devices get more common, they will look for them, because their sales will be supported by mass advertising.
In such cases, criminals are always one step ahead of police, says the psychologist.
The nurse does not believe that similar devices may help in sudden attack by a pedophile.
According to Robert Cech of RC Monitoring Company, providing tracking services for both cars and people, even when the tracking device is attacked and immediately destroyed, it can help.
"The device can be set to send regular position report after a certain period of time."
If it becomes damaged, we will have at least the last position of the person.
The more expensive devices have inbuilt and tiltmeters, so even if one falls and remains motionless, the device immediately sends a warning with location.
According to him similar service may be provided by smart mobile phones with navigation, where it is sufficient to download a special software.
The problem of current surveillance units lies in the fact that it is either a device similar to matchbox pendants or smaller mobile phones.
There is always the risk of loss.
According to Pilin from Macro Weil Company a device that looks like a conventional digital watch is now being tested.
This will be the biggest advantage that the aggressor may not even recognise the tracking device at all.
They may recognise it after some time and it may give the police extra time.
While the tracking devices develop into bracelets or pendants, they still use the same technology used for monitoring vehicles.
It is a combination of location detection via GPS (used in regular car navigation) and the functions of a mobile phone, which reports the current position of the vehicle.
The army has enough igniter cord to wind the Czech Republic, but they will only last two years.
Czech army has acquired 445 kilometers of cords, which activate explosives.
The Ministry of Defence has already delivered 224 km of cords into the warehouses.
The army thus has reserves for 225 years.
The problem is that the life of the lines is two to four years.
The Army acquired the detonating cords from STV Group, Inc for CZK 40 million.
The General Staff provided the reason for buying such a large quantity of igniter cords to MF Dnes, explaining that soldiers use 60 km of igniter cords in training.
Estimates of army bomb disposal experts that the MF Dnes approached suggest that it would be a very intense pyrotechnic training that would be undertaken by all the generals every year, along with the army officers, secretaries and cleaners.
Defense Minister Alexandr Vondra and army commander Vlastimil Pick included.
Only then could the annual consumption of sixty kilometers of igniter cords be justified.
This period is a period of 25,000 explosions.
If that were true, the army reserves would be enough for more than ten years.
However, if the basic training of any new professional requires only two meters of the igniter cord, then the army has ensured by the purchase of the necessary stock for the above 225 years.
Rapid Deployment Brigade soldiers personally complained to the minister of the Ministry of Defense that they have almost no ammunition for small arms and so shooting is restricted due to shortage of money.
Not mentioning the lack of underwear.
"I cannot understand either, that they buy so many igniter cords from us repeatedly."
It is their decision, and they certainly know what they will use them for.
Army is a good customer, whose demands we try to meet as retailers.
Defense Minister Jan Pejsek explains the purchase of hundreds of kilometers of cords by creating a reserve of such "munitions" for ten years at least.
Jan Děcký of STV Group says only four years of cord life and police or army deminers even only two years.
When stored under perfect conditions, it can be even four, according to one soldier who is not a soldier.
After expiration date any ammunition must be carefully tested for reliability to ensure it does not threaten the life of soldiers.
This test is not free and it costs more money.
Other argument of the Ministry is the quantity discount on 445 km of the ignition cords.
The cost of this supply is about six percent less than last year's supply of two hundred forty four kilometers, says the speaker of the Defence Ministry.
Another example: The annual consumption of lines of police deminers who destroy weapons from World War II and the one left after the Soviet army has not exceeded 1500 meters for several years.
A police orders only such amount of ammunition that would be used before its expiration.
It paid back for the safety of deminers and the flexibility to acquire more modern and thus more reliable lines.
The Defence Ministry has already serious problems with the liquidation of tens of thousand tons of ammunition from the Warsaw Pact, when the two hundred thousand Czechoslovak army prepared to set off for the Rhine.
The Czech one, according to the pyrotechnics approached by MF Dnes, will face the same problem in a few years: They will have to dispose of hundreds of kilometers of old igniter cords that are currently "cheaply" purchased.
This day I use the contacts I gain through the competition.
Winning the award in the Year’s Entrepreneur of the Year helped Lukas Pytloun sell his hotel franchise.
The winner of last year's Entrepreneur of the Year was a young entrepreneur Lukas Pytloun from Liberec.
The success story of his life is much like one from a movie.
Lukáš Pytlon likes traveling.
And abroad he realized that Liberec lacks quality accommodation at a reasonable price.
Savings from foreign part-time jobs and a bank loan he purchased a ruined house with five apartments.
It was a great courage considering that he was still a student of the second year at university.
The ratio between quality and price of accommodation of time in our country made me try something.
The first renovated apartment he rented to foreign workers.
All profits were invested into the house, which gradually remodeled into a boarding house with 54 beds.
Since then, he gradually opened four guest houses in Liberec in seven years of his business, along with two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of 300 beds in all categories of accommodation.
The most comfortable one was Pytloun four-star design hotel.
This year another one was open, equally good.
'We have signed a contract with a hotel in Ostrov u Tise, where we sold our franchise concept and others interested in Pytloun hotel franchise are applying.
The sale of the license to operate the hotel was very much influenced by winning the Entrepreneur of the Year competition.
The victory brought more reputation and popularity in Liberec and its surroundings.
'People recognised me in the street, often added to congratulate me and I must say it felt good'.
The challenge is strongly encouraged to all who are eager to try something.
It is not necessary to win, any visibility is good.
The singer says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances, which would not be possible otherwise.
"With some I have met through competition, I started a regular business."
In his opinion, the glory of the success falls on each employee.
There are about seventy of them.
"I see them show greater loyalty and pride that they are involved in something that has gained universal recognition."
It is much more than my personal success, as it is the result of good work of all of us together.
"Only my name is being thrown into the front line," says Lukáš Pytloun today.
I wish my successor quieter year than we had in Farmet.
The victory euforia was quickly replaced by the effects of the crisis.
With self-discipline of the winner Farmet has already overcome difficult times.
The first place in last year's Vodafone competition Company of the Year was in the Slav House collected by the owner of Farmet Company, Karl Žďárský.
The jury then appreciated the efforts by which a small tool workshop in Czech Skalice turned into a business with hundreds of million turnovers.
The award encouraged not only me but all my colleagues and increased our confidence for battles with the competition.
In the early history of the Farmet company there was a desire to do something useful.
Then, when the state offered the father of Charles Žďárský to rent a small workshop to compensate for the communists-confiscated property, he took no time to settle, rejected a career in the company where he was working and with a few friends he founded the company producing plastic tubs.
After that they started specializing in vegetable oil presses.
After eight years they became the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe.
Greater awareness among general public was gained after the success in the competition through the media.
However, not only our customers have started to recognise the brand Farmet much better, but also foreign partners have started to appreciate that they work with a company that has achieved great success in its home country.
The year however was not only full of euforia of victories in FARMET.
awards were based on firm economic performance until 2008 and only partly from 2009.
And just 2009 was the most difficult year for engineering goods.
While the crisis was at its peak, people still do not have a huge impact, but companies had stopped their investment projects and started restricting new machinery and technology.
The situation obviously did not spare us.
”Sales fell by 40 percent, we had to restrict production and even discharge employees,” explains Karl Žďárský.
A viable company must be able to take even such unpopular measures.
However, they managed and retained the profit, even though lower than before the crisis.
However, what FARMET would not compromise is research and development.
Through grants we have built a research and training centre, we have improved our presentation at international fairs, and have won major awards in local exhibitions.
The crisis seems to be behind them.
Revenues are growing again and so is the number of new employees.
Karel Žďárský says.
Survey to remove absurd regulations
Absurdity Poll is part of the business competition for fourth time.
Some ridiculous regulations have already been removed.
Infamous winner of next year's Absurdities Poll was the absurd obligation to bring documents that are available for official use to the authorities.
It was chosen by more than three of almost four thousand votes.
Examples include Social Security Administration required a paper incorporation certificate, but the officer can obtain one by two clicks of a mouse.
Thanks to poll, this will change.
The Czech Social Security Administration will not require the membership certificate from for controls of contributors, according to spokesman Jana Buráňová of CSSA.
The aim of the Absurdity Poll is to crack down on all rules and regulations that companies and businesses in Czech Republic must meet, and remove those that are lack of sense.
This is the fourth time this year it has been part of the business competition, held by Hospodářské noviny and is increasingly popular among the public.
If about three thousand voters participated in the vote last year, there were nearly four thousand voters earlier this year.
However, there are still many legal obligations, which only serve to delay the business.
Examples are the number of papers required for tax returns, which are the top places in the world, according to Karel Havlicek of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Crafts in CR.
Efficient business has recently become a stated objective of all governments.
The situation has not really improved in Czech Republic.
The World Bank reported on business conditions in Czech Republic was 74th position, which is eight points lower than last year.
The Absurdities Poll was first launched in 2006 and takes place every year under the same scenario.
Anyone may propose administrative and bureaucratic nonsense every year from April to September, when the competition is closed.
In order to sign for the competition, the website HYPERLINK "http://www.firmaroku.cz/absurdita" is used.
The absurdity that gets most votes wins.
In this survey more than a hundred, 105 to be precise, meaningless rules and regulations were filed.
Recommendations were received from entrepreneurs, but also professional associations and journalists.
The finalists of the contest were for example the requirement that trucks for highways maintenance trucks must pay road tolls, or that businesses with twenty employees, two offices and two toilets had their painted every two years.
The list of this year's seven proposals is posted on the website of the contest.
The announcement of the competition, which always occurs in early November on Wenceslas Square in Prague is part of the hapenning, regularly attended by political and social figures.
This year, the final event was hosted by Eva Svobodova, Director of the Association of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises and Crafts in CR and Petr Kuzel, President of the Chamber of Commerce in CR.
Prosperity cannot be achieved when the state is driving business on its own foot, so my goal is to remove at least three dozen paragraphs, which today only unnecessarily complicate the business, and I aim to remove at least three dozen paragraphs that today only unnecessarily complicate the business.
Effective efforts to abolish meaningless regulations have a very positive load.
In 2007 most people were against the obligation of a business to report its intention to participate in the exhibition or fair with their stand three days ahead to the trade office at the place where its permanent establishment is located.
This has been removed by an amendment to the Trade Act.
The second most voted obligation in 2007, reporting a business trip of foreign staff lasting up to 30 days to the Labour Office, was removed by the so-called Green Card Act.
And last but not least.
Absurdity of 2009 was the obligation of physiotherapists to have a large mirror, refrigerator and two stepping scales in the office.
It was mitigated by the Health Minister this year - the obligation to have a refrigerator has been removed.
New category recognises socially responsible companies
Environment, humanitarian and sports projects are considered.
New in the fifth year of HN Daily competition is the category called the Responsible Company in 2010.
The mission of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair business practices.
Vodafone is the promoter and guarantor of the competition, as well in the case of the rebel competition.
In the first year of this special category of the main Vodafone competition Company of 2010, companies with a long-term goal of success in business have signed for the competition.
Every story is very inspiring and would be enough for a separate article.
Although the nature of their activities may vary considerably, the common denominator of their efforts may be support and thoughtfulness.
In one case, it relates to people with disabilities and elsewhere to personal problems or health of their employees.
The fourteen finalists in CR include a Prague-based software company Et Netera, which supports the creation of informal sports teams of staff, which then participate in several tournaments in different sports.
Another example of a responsible company from Pardubice region is the company Isolit-Bravo, which has been a major contributor to the disabled children’s fund for seventeen years.
The old mill of Podebrady then takes care of disabled employees, who are more than 70 percent of the staff, and was awarded with the title of Responsible Company in Central Bohemia Region and took the third place in the Vodafone competition.
In Olomouc region the award was received by MiRyz Soft accounting firm, which introduced flexible working hours in addition to the reduced average 35 hours per week but did not reduce its salary proportionately.
The title was also awarded to the company because they prefer to buy from Czech manufacturers, promote civic activities in the neighborhood and protect the environment.
Recycling is a priority for our business and administration to have the least impact on the environment, explains the Executive Miluse Ryznarová.
Competent IT Company Enlogit in Ústí region always takes care of its employees, and for each laptop they purchased ergonomic chairs and keyboards, support their work from home and use catering services from a local sheltered workshop.
Additionally, we support People in Need Foundation, which helps the local Roma community, says company representative Ondrej Suchy.
Also, a mentionable activity is the activity of the Karlovy Vary region Práce a čištění Company, which contributes its employees with bonuses to their pension schemes.
”We provide allowances for meals, transport and recreation,” says Josef Strapáč from Bruntál Czasch construction company, the winner in the Moravia-Silesian Region.
Responsible Company of the Year category was automatically enrolled all regional finalists of Vodafone Company of the Year competition, who answered the questionnaire attached to the application and sent it to organizers until 15 August.
Incorrectly filled or incomplete answers to the questionnaire were then excluded from the evaluation by the organizers.
"If the representatives of competing companies failed to answer the questions, they cannot attend the Responsible Company of the Year Competition but are not disqualified from the main Vodafone competition Company of the Year.
”Single sign for this competition is not possible because it is a subcategory of the main competition Company of the year,” explains Karel Goldman of Bison & Rose.
Police arrested at the Land Fund in Plzen during the tendering procedure.
In recent years anti-corruption police have arrested at the building of the Land Fund in Pilsen.
Handcuffs were given to a local media and real estate dealer, Luboš G.
The alleged manipulation of the current tender for restitution claims could have resulted in the award of the land to a particular candidate.
The suspect was supposed to pay half a million to Luboš G.
The police have only confirmed that they are going to prosecute one person for the crime of fraudulent manipulation of public procurement and public tenders.
The 46-year-old entrepreneur was released by police after 24 hours.
The low official information is limited to speculation.
The spokesman of the Land Fund Lubomír Černá replied to a question by Pravo that police have actually arrested at a detached work place in Plzen, during the public tendering procedure.
"It was a client, not our employee," she added.
The public tender, according to Cerna, is called “Invitation to tender for the transfer of land rights under the Lands Act” and occurs when more qualified candidates are interested in the land offered.
This person in the call offers a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the announced value of the land.
The order of the acquirer is set and the land is then transferred to the person who offered the highest claims.
Probably he had information, who replied to the call, and since he is also a beneficiary, he suggested to another candidate not to participate.
The candidate probably received financial compensation.
The reason for his detention is that he was detained with such a large sum of money.
Lubos G had superior contacts to LF in past.
The case of former LF head Vaclav Sankot was investigated for transferring lands in the substitutional land restitution, on which a decision on the location of a building has been issued.
It was then that Mr Lubos G. acquired land for public road construction from the fund, particularly at the point where the driveway was to be constructed to the industrial zone Borska pole.
Later, he very conveniently exchanged them with the city for a house in the historic town centre, which was much higher value.
Town hall had to accept it then, because otherwise it would block the construction by blocking the land.
Households will pay extra hundreds for housing a month.
Housing will have to pay more since January, not only for all types of energy, but also for water and sewerage, heating and heating supplies, and rents will rise in some areas.
Parents will have to pull out hundreds more from purse from January.
The price of electricity will be raise by 4.6 percent; gas will be about 2 percent more expensive, in some towns you will have to pay extra for water by up to tenth, and central heating will be more expensive.
Electrical cost increase will cost householders in the flats hundreds of crowns a year more than now.
The prices of power were reduced by all major suppliers at the same time, and a significant increase in support for renewable energy production, especially photovoltaics, is a major reason for this.
Although gas will only be slightly more expensive, it will occur when most people are heating their homes and thus have the highest consumption.
Annually they must also take extra costs in account.
While electricity and gas will be more expensive across the country, central heating price will vary from place to place.
Price increase is mainly planned in large municipalities.
Examples are Pardubice and Hradec Kralove will now pay about CZK 50 per month extra, families in Liberec will pay extra CZK 1,000 a year.
Residents of Prague may have more costly water and sewer than in Prague if the city increases the rent of the infrastructure.
If the rent is not change, Prague residents will pay extra 6.8 percent.
Prague’s price will still be a relatively low national comparison.
In North Bohemia, where prices are already among the highest, the water rate should increase by about 7.4 percent.
Examples of rental apartments in 450 thousand rental apartments, where regulation ends in January, may significantly increase.
CPI Byty, which in Usti nad Labem owns about 2,500 apartments, plans to raise the rent from January by up to one hundred percent.
The company intends to bring to court those who will not accept the new rents.
Regulated rents paid by people in approximately 300 thousand apartments could increase by up to ten percent next year.
Czech children get drunk with Fernet and Rum. Beer is out of fashion, it works slowly.
Fernet, rum, vodka, exceptionally better brand of whiskey stolen from parents.
This is the drinks after which most often drunks not even under the age of fifteen end in doctors' care.
Children who are treated for drinking at the hospital repeatedly are not an exception.
This follows the experience of doctors who are faced with similar cases in the admission of patients to children department of hospitals.
"Beer or wine is completely unfashionable, as it takes a long time to get drunk.
Alcohol is the trend today, that is certain, said the head of children's ward in Horovice Hospital in central Bohemia, Ludek Pelican to Pravo.
If they can pull out a bottle of their father from the closet, it is usually the whiskey, but otherwise Fernet and vodka dominate.
Vodka has the advantage that it is served in juice and they may not smell so bad then.
This is confirmed by the speaker of the Motol University Faculty, Eva Jurinová.
"It is most often Fernet or Rum."
It is today a modern spirit, especially in primary schools.
In some cases it was plum brandy, which they have brought from home.
According to the head physician Pelikán, thirteen- or fourteen-year-old drinkers admitted to hospital are relatively common.
Before Hořovice, where he has been since this year, he worked in the pediatric department in Motol, where ambulances bring sick children from the surrounding area.
One girl was admitted to our hospital four times.
”She started her career at the age of twelve, when she was brought to us with a 3.5 per mille of alcohol in the blood, along with ecstasy,” the doctor describes a particularly serious case.
"She had been to a dance party and Vystaviste."
The mother did not find it strange that she had not seen her daughter for 48 hours, according to the chief physician.
It is the disinterest of parents or even their considerable tolerance to drinking problems of their children that is considered to be the major cause of children boozing.
It is however not an addiction in children according to experts.
"Under the term alcoholic we understand a multi-year chronic addiction to alcohol with all the related phenomena, which does not apply to children."
Alcohol use is more associated with poor family social background, according to the head of the department.
According to spokeswoman Jurinová about forty drunken children have been hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in Motol from mid November.
The statistics, however, only include those with severe intoxication who spent a hospital stay.
Child drunks, who are taken home after outpatient treatment by their parents or police, are not included.
Except when kids just sit around after school and drink a bottle of brandy, there are three seasonal fluctuations that one can rely on: Witch Feast, New Year and the end of the school year.
Both are either to wash down the sadness from bad school report or to celebrate the start of the holiday.
However, I experienced seven drunk children in the same hospital during the witch feast.
The drunk, who spends the night with medical supervision, is paradoxically in advantage compared to the home drunk, who suffers from unpleasant hangover the next day.
Early morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are prevented by irrigation with glucose and nutrients that the body is lacking.
They are doing better because they have the beautiful evening experience and a good wakeup when nothing hurts.
They are only confused about where they are, adding that he sometimes spoils the overall mood of the patients by a list of costs that they might incur.
Transport by ambulance and being hospitalized on an acute bed costs thousands of crowns.
Occasionally I used this as an educational measure, when I directly to those children calculated how much it costs to get drunk and that they could also spend summer working to cover this one party.
Insurance companies do not take regression procedures in which parents must cover the cost of treatment in children who are drinking.
Two L-159 aircraft are in foreign hands for the first time in Spain.
The two L-159 of a total of five pieces for which Czech Defense Minister has exchanged transport aircraft CASA C-295M, flew on Tuesday to Seville, where the manufacturer of CASA aircrafts - EADS, are based in Seville.
It is the first time that such aircrafts have been found in the hands of someone other than the Czech army.
The only flights they have been on are training and demonstration flights.
It is a two seat version of the L-159T1 aircraft, which has been operated by Czech army and was airworthy.
The remaining three are single-L-159.
The remaining bodies are still standing in Aero Vodochody and the broker - Omnipol - took them over last week.
It has not been released when the aircraft will physically leave Vodochody, according to Jan Pejsek of the Press Department of the Ministry of Defense.
"Single seat L-159 have been allocated for exchange from long-stored aircraft, and without any deposits and investment by the Ministry."
The two seat L-159T1 aircrafts were exchanged in the current condition and form, Pejsek told Pravo.
The army will not be left without a two-seat aircraft, as in May 2009 the ministry signed a contract with Aero Vodochody for the reconstruction of four redundant L-159 machines into two two-seat machines.
One new aircraft was taken by the army in July and the other will be taken over until the end of this year.
According to Pejsek EADS has committed to enforce the aircraft as equipment to some Alliance countries.
The contract clearly states that the purchaser of the L-159 is EADS and they will be used for training pilots from NATO countries.
How to implement this thing is therefore an issue for customers, he added.
Spanish army is not interested in L-159.
The exchange of five L-159 aircraft for one Casa aircraft and three more aircraft was approved by the government of Mirek Topolanek last year.
Ministry of Defence did not organize any tender for the purchase and addressed EADS directly.
The former leadership of the Ministry of Defense argued that the exchange would promote further exports of L-159 to abroad.
Czech Army has acquired 72 aircrafts from Aero and only use 24 of them.
Purchase of Casa aircrafts may have judicial consequences.
The European Commission has sued Czech Ministry of Defence at the European Court because the aircraft were selected on the basis of a European tender and not addressing only one manufacturer.
The Army has acquired three Casa aircrafts, the last one is expected to arrive in Prague, airport Kbely, within a fortnight.
Holding index finger longer than ring finger indicate a lower risk of cancer.
They have a longer index finger than the ring finger are at lower risk of prostate cancer.
It is a surprising conclusion of a study published on Wednesday in the British Journal of Cancer.
This may be related to the level of the male hormone testosterone.
These results show that the finger length may be a simple test for prostate cancer risk, especially for a man up to 60 years old.
The finger could then help determine which men should undergo prostate cancer tests, particularly in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden, she said.
In the period 1994-2009 she along with her colleagues monitored more than 1,500 patients with prostate cancer in Britain and parallel over three thousand healthy men.
More than half of the study participants had a shorter index finger on their right hand than their ring finger.
The same probability of prostate cancer occurred for them as for 19 percent of those whose fingertips were of equal length.
The risk for infection in men over the age of sixty declined by 33 percent, and for men over the age of sixty it was even an 87 percent decline.
The ratio of the length of those two finger - formed in the prenatal period - probably reflects different levels of sex hormones that the child is exposed to in the womb.
Less testosterone usually results in a longer finger.
Previous studies have shown that testosterone is the key factor in prostate cancer development.
The geneticist and former Czech President of the Academy of Sciences Professor Vaclav Paces told ČTK that he knows about the study but in his opinion the relationship between fingerlength and cancer is not "fully proven."
The Czech Republic is covered with snow, D1 and D5 are closed.
Czech Republic, like most Europe, woke up covered in snow on Thursday morning.
The roads and pavements are mostly covered with compacted snow, in many places road maintenance stuff driving all night.
Highway D5 between the 89th and 93th kilometer in direction of Rozvadov has been closed in the morning due to several accidents of trucks and passenger cars and D1 is also blocked in the direction from Brno to Prague.
News were reported by the Central Dispatcher of Automotoklub (UAMK).
At 91st kilometer truck crashed, at 93rd kilometer two trucks collided, the accident resulted in injury.
Also several cars ended up in the ditch.
Also problems are on the D1 highway at 185th kilometer in direction of Prague.
Two trucks have collided there.
Drivers should leave the highway after Brno at the 190th kilometer or go through Brno and drive back to the highway at the 182nd kilometer at Kývalka.
There are long car queues for several kilometers.
Also, there is an accident at the very arrival in Prague.
There is a layer of snow, several centimeters thick, in Prague, and the thermometer shows minus seven degrees Celsius.
There are queue of cars in Prosek, Štědžborská is also blocked.
The most reliable way of transport is the subway.
Trams are delayed between Charles Square and Namesti Miru.
At eight in the morning Prague emergency staff should meet again.
Also railways and airports must be facing the problems.
Czech Railways have had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snow.
There are problems with the rail line from Prague to Kralupy or from Prague to Beroun.
Passengers should check the current situation.
Ruzyne airport was closed from 11 pm Wednesday night to 5 a.m..
Most of the roads in southern Moravia are now passable, but only with care.
There are three unpaved side roads in Vyškov area, there is loads of snow in Brno area and snow chains are needed for travelling on some communications in the Blansko region.
The most affected sites included Vyskov area.
There are still closed roads: Rousínov - Slavkov, Bohdalice - Kučerov and Šaratice - Milešovice.
For their extension routers will be deployed.
It is unpredictable when they will be passable again.
Hodonin area is a sensitive area for travel in the White Carpathians.
On roads that are there to protect the environment only kept passable with inert fill, there is a 5-cm layer of snow, according to ČTK.
In Czech Republic two to ten centimeters of snow has fallen, mostly in northern Bohemia, often up to 18 centimeters.
In Moravia-Silesian Region about 15 centimeters of snow has occurred.
Czech Republic gradually declines.
American troops have a new "smart weapon"
The US Army has deployed a new "smart weapon" in Afghanistan, known only by a codename XM-25.
The generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the Taliban and "change the game" in their favor.
The new weapon is like a superaccurate small cannon.
Their projectile is directed by a laser to hit within a few meters.
Special ammunition caliber 25 mm, designed for this rifle and containing high explosive, actually act like little grenades.
The projectiles can be programmed to explode when hitting the target, but at any point of their ballistic path.
The weapons can be used against an enemy who is hiding behind barriers, behind walls or in trenches.
These are usually not protected from the above, and if hit by the rain of deadly steel shards, they may not fight any more.
The XM-25 rifle is a new first weapon for the infantry, which uses "smart" technology.
The soldier basically operates it as follows: they find a target, sends a laser beam to determine the distance and thus the precise explanation of the point, they adjust the elevation and squeeze the trigger.
"Let us say you have achieved 543 meters."
The trigger is activated, and the weapon releases a missile at a distance of 543 meters plus or minus one, two or three meters.
Relocations
The Fujitsu corporation is relocating its Bad Homburg office to Frankfurt.
In July next year, 400 employees will move from the current office building on Marienbad Square in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt's Astro Park.
The Japanese Fujitsu corporation is relocating its Bad Homburg office to Frankfurt.
The giant in computer and computer maintenance announced on Wednesday that 400 men and women are to move from the current office building on Maribad Square in Bad Homburg to Frankfurt's Astro Park in July next year.
The Fujitsu spokeswoman explained that in the medium term, further 100 Fujitsu employees currently spread across the region will join the Frankfurt office.
The rental offer was extremely attractive and the open-plan office in Astro Park was better suited to the way employees work, the spokeswoman added.
Fujitsu also only rented the office in Bad Homburg.
The manager of the move, Bernd Wagner, said, "in Frankfurt Niederrad we have found a central location with outstanding infrastructure."
The excellent airport connection was particularly important to a global company such as Fujitsu, he added.
Yesterday the coming relocation of an important company in the region was a cause for joy among the winners and disappointment among the losers.
Markus Frank (CDU), head of Frankfurt's economic affairs department, said the city had again attracted a global player,
which was a "fantastic recognition of the city."
The city would suit Fujitsu and that the move would be a significant boost for Niederrad.
Michael Korwisi (Greens), Mayor of Bad Homburg, expressed his regret at Fujitsu's decision.
The city was informed of the planned move by the management board well in advance.
"We offered the company our help as a matter of course," said Korwisi.
The amicable meetings, however, have no effect on the difficulties between the computer manufacturer and the landlord for the property on Marienbad Square.
Economic reasons finally tipped the balance.
Korwisi now wants to focus on preventing such a prominent location from remaining vacant for long term.
"I hope the building's owner and landlord will cooperate."
The previously used by Fujitsu on the town hall square and the neighbouring low-rise "Kleine Vertikale" were among the many buildings on Marienbad Square that were part of the controversial building project by the spa town.
The joint project between the city and a private project developer was designed to create a new entrance into the city between the train station and town hall, which attracted criticism on account of the massive scale of development over previously partly used parking areas, and the height of the building.
In 2001, three companies moved in: Feri, the investment management and rating company, Start Amadeus, the travel sales and marketing software manufacturer, and Fujitsu, the computer maker (still linked to Siemens at the time).
The buildings used by Fujitsu were acquired in 2006 by the Frankfurt-based DIC Group and the Morgan Stanley Real Estate Fund and sold to Spanish Falcon Real Estate Investments SA in Madrid one year later.
The Tokyo-based Fujitsu corporation sells itself as the third largest IT provider in the world.
It provides companies with computers, servers and other equipment and provides necessary servicing.
The office in Rhein-Main area is one of the largest in Germany, but Fujitsu has considerably more employees in Munich.
The Fujitsu subsidiary, Technology Solutions, is also moving from Bad Homburg to Frankfurt; two further subsidiaries, Fujitsu Services and a company named TDS, will also be based in Frankfurt.
7000 square metres have been rented in the Astro Park office building to accommodate them.
The twenty-year-old complex - its name inspired by the star-shaped ground plan - is home to the Central Association of the German Electrical and Electronics Industry (ZVEI) and other organisations.
Amazon blocks server - threats to Assange
Wikileaks is getting deeper and deeper waters.
The e-commerce company Amazon has banned the whistleblower from its servers.
Political pressure may be behind the move after the publication of hundreds of thousands of secret diplomatic dispatches.
The founding of Wikileaks, Assange, is believed to be in England.
The whistle blowing website, Wikileaks, is increasingly under fire in the United States.
Internet activists have lost access to their American server and are now looking for a home in Europe.
The prominent American Senator Joe Lieberman called on other countries and companies to boycott Wikileaks.
In the meantime, a newspaper report suggests Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is currently in Great Britain.
"Wikileaks forced off Amazon servers."
"Free speech in the land of the free," the whistle blowing activists said on Wednesday (local time) via the Twitter messaging service.
The Internet company Amazon had previously banned Wikileaks documents from its servers.
The internet activists used Amazon Web Service (AWS) to publish secret diplomatic dispatches in order to cope with the high number of people accessing the documents.
Wikileaks discussed the step on Twitter: "Great - we'll spend our money employing people in Europe instead."
If Amazon had issues with freedom of speech, "it should give up selling books."
CNN reported that Wikileaks was stopped from using its servers after senator Joe Lieberman started investigating, according to Lieberman's office.
The chairman of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs had threatened to boycott Amazon, reported the British newspaper The Guardian.
Senator Senator Senator Senator Senator Senator
Lieberman also called on other countries to cooperate in preventing Wikileaks from finding new servers.
"Wikileaks' illegal, outrageous and reckless acts have threatened our national security and threatened lives worldwide," the non-party Senator stated in a statement.
"No responsible company - whether American or foreign - should assist Wikileaks in its efforts to disseminate these stolen materials."
Wikileaks founder Assange is on the Interpol wanted list.
The Australian is currently in the UK, and Scotland Yard is aware of his exact location.
The internet activist has always described the Swedish investigations as a scheme orchestrated by his detractors.
In London, Wikileaks spokesman Kristinn Hrafnsson said that threats have been made.
There have even been calls to assassinate Julian Assange.
Hrafnsson added that Assange was afraid for his personal safety.
The Wikileaks founder will remain in hiding.
Hrafnsson was clearly reacting to statements from North America.
In America, the former Republican Governor of Arkansas, Mike Huckabee, had called for the people responsible for the Wikileaks revelations to be indicted and executed for treason.
In Canada, one of Prime Minister Stephen Harper's advisers suggested that Assange should be "killed" and that Obama could "use a drone."
In the meantime, exchanges have been made between the White House and Assange.
Robert Gibbs, the speaker of American President Barack Obama, said that it was "ridiculous and absurd" that Assange asked for the resignation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton if she is found to be responsible for recently revealed requests to diplomats to engage in espionage.
'I am not entirely sure why we care about the opinion of a guy with a website' said Gibbs.
Our foreign policy and interests of this country are far stronger than his one website.
The American government is currently conducting a comprehensive review of its database security.
Russell Travers, Director of Information Division at the National Anti-Terrorism Centre, has been appointed as a special representative, the White House announced.
Travers will be responsible for developing the "necessary structural reforms" that are now needed after the disclosure of diplomatic dispatches by Wikileaks.
The White House also wants to look at how the whole government exchange and protects information.
The American government also expressed concern for the safety of dissidents and activists who may be at risk by Wikileaks publication.
"We have done everything we can to contact them," said States Department Spokesman Philip Crowley.
"We are ready to protect them if that becomes necessary."
Ice Cream University
ice cream confectioners are trained for warm seasons at the "Gelato University" in Bologna.
The three-day foundation course for future "gelati" is the most important course, and welcomes visitors from all over the world.
What is all that ice cream actually come from?
From "gelatiere" and "gelataio."
The "gelatiere," known in English as the old fashioned "ice cream confectioner," produces the cream following the Italian art of ice cream making.
The "gelataio" gets the ice cream from the refrigerated counter with a spatula, smooths it into wafers and sells it.
You do not need to go to Anzola Emilia in the Bologna province to know that.
The "Gelato University" of the Italian company Carpigiani is a must.
The ice cream university was created by the manufacturer of ice cream makers in 2003 to ensure that all its makers meet Italian standards.
The three-day foundation course for future "gelati" is the most important course, and welcomes visitors from all over the world.
The course is also structured over several days covering chocolate ice cream, and internships in the company's own ice cream parlour.
Many dream of a new career to escape midlife crisis; others come to test their vacuous aspirations against the cold facts.
This time, there are 40 participants from 19 countries and every continent - from Brazil and Hungary to Saudi Arabia.
Jacky, art teacher from California, loves slow food and wants to offer a high quality European product in a country which is used to industrial ice cream.
Anke from Berlin is a management consultant and wants to do something on her own after years in a highly stressful job.
Two young Egyptian girls dream of opening an ice cream parlour in Cairo.
The Malta and Brazil ice cream makers want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and Canadian housewife Julia has come to visit because her children love Italian ice cream.
Maestro gelatiere Luciano Ferrari begins the course by describing the ideal characteristics of a perfect ice cream.
However, good taste is not only good, but silky softness and good texture are key.
While training, Luciano does not forget to mention the real icing on the cake for Italian gelato.
The first step of production seems to be easy.
Luciano pours the basic ingredients - milk, cream, powdered milk, sugar and stabilisers - into a large blender that heats the mixture to 85 degrees on an electronic programme and then immediately cools it to four degrees.
Then he turns a tap on the machine and out comes a pasteurised, basic white ice cream, the basis for all milk-based ice creams.
The lecturer is immediately overwhelmed by questions. Can you make ice cream using natural ingredients only without stabilisers?
How can you experiment freely?
Luciano warns against letting the spirit of the age lead you astray.
Anyone who talks about making ice cream "using natural ingredients only" has probably used stabilisers - in most cases a natural product such as guar gum from guar beans.
However, you can make ice cream without stabilisers, but you have to sell it within a day, otherwise it collapses and your customer ends up licking lumps of ice.
Some variations to the base are allowed.
It gets more excited with the flavours.
For ice cream flavouring, Maestro Luciano differentiates between the ingredients you buy in the fruit section and in the sweet section of the supermarket.
There are also powders and pastes.
All suppliers will try to get you to buy dozens of flavoured additives.
It is a good advice.
either with fruit sorbets using sugar and fresh fruits, or with fruit sorbets using sugar and fresh fruit.
either with a white ice cream base that can be turned into yellow cream by using eggs or can be mixed with cocoa powder to form the base of all kinds of seductive chocolate.
After the course the participants are allowed onto the ice cream maker.
Luciano lets them make four different types of vanilla, chocolate and hazelnut ice cream - with or without egg in the base and with more or less vanilla flavouring or other natural ingredients.
The experiment is repeated with a range of fruit sorbets.
More flavourings, more fruit puree - not necessarily an improvement in taste.
Hazelnut ice cream is not necessarily more nutty when it contains more hazelnuts.
The team that produces the most popular kiwi ice cream uses more fruit, less water and a little less stabiliser.
The taste of a gelato only stands out if the mixture is balanced, says Luciano.
Making ice cream is a matter of arithmetic. If sugary peach puree is used, the proportion of sugar in the base recipe must be reduced.
The extra portion of sugar is needed for lemon ice cream.
Luciano brings out a device that shows him the sugar content of the different fruits (vintners use it to measure the density of grape must use the Oechsle scale).
Tables make the calculations easier.
Making ice cream now requires less physical activity than it used to.
It is not only the machine that produces the base.
The device also beats the finished ice cream mixture to a creamy consistency while cooling it to negative temperatures.
However, despite all automation, minor accidents still occur.
The Brazilian Gustavo covers himself and his coursemates from head to toe with fruit purée as he loses control of the oversized hand-held blender.
In every course, Maestro Luciano says, "it is only a matter of time before something like this happens."
Inspectors in the twilight
There are reports that the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has been infiltrated by the genetically modified crop industry.
The Expert Centre for Biotechnology Assessment, which aims to be an independent institute for assessing the impact of biotechnology, has made the accusation.
Then says it is a conspiracy theory, but we have good documentary evidence.
Harry Kuiper, chair of EFSA's expert panel on risk assessment of genetically engineered plants and another EFSA expert are also believed to have worked with ILSI for years.
ILSI receives funding from corporations such as Monsanto, Nestle and Bayer.
Kuiper has had a central role in the EFSA test specifications for GM plants and therefore has clear conflict of interest, says Then.
In places, EFSA regulations are identical to position papers produced by ILSI and thus are written by the same industry that the authority should be controlling, says
This is the second time Testbiotech has criticised a conflict of interest.
The highly appointed EFSA manager recently moved to Swiss agribusiness company Syngenta without any restrictions or a transitional period, and is now on the other side of the line.
MDR Radio has recently uncovered personal links between the EU supervisory authority and the industry lobby, which has attracted the attention of the Environment Agency and EU Parliamentarians.
EFSA does not see any conflict of interest.
In a statement, EFSA said that all significant data were considered, including data from industry if such data were of high professional quality.
EFSA stated that it does not require that its panels avoid all contact with industry.
All EFSA members must disclose any such contact.
Kuiper says he will work for the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI) in USA.
The Institute describes itself as a neutral forum for experts from science, industry and politics to assess risks around biotechnology and other areas - without a lobbying mandate.
In this field, independent experts such as Then raise complaints that genetically modified plants are currently approved for animals without feeding trials and that the reaction of GM plants to environmental influences is not investigated.
Examples are fields, says Then.
Current practice is only to test isolated proteins, but not the whole GM plant, which is not reliable.
If you do not look for risks, how are you supposed to find them?
Angelika Hilbeck shares his opinion.
The scientist has been working in GM technology since 1994 and is currently working at ETH Zurich.
The industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit outspokenly critical scientists in Europe, as in USA, says Hilbeck.
There are few researchers left without ties to corporations, she believes.
Corporate and corporate studies are not normally published.
The industry is controlling safety research, says Hilbeck.
The stone trail
Uli Gsell has got some - totally around 400 kilos.
On Monday evening, he was standing in front of Stuttgart train station, his tuba on his back.
There was a demonstration.
It was snowing.
The story is familiar. In September, excavators arrived and began to break up a large section of the north wing.
However, Stuttgart was not the same. Thousands and thousands of people took up demonstrations against S21, the multi-billion Euro sinking of the train station.
By time work was suspended, a large proportion of the wing was rubble.
Broken into 6000 or 7000 pieces.
Crailsheim shell limestone, a crumbly coarse stone, was collected between 1914 and 1920.
43-year-old Gsell is a sculptor in Ostfildern.
Then he got hold of a few chunks.
This stone is a relic.
"They will not disappear."
The raves: "Cheap and poor stone, simple and earthy."
When he cut it out, it smelt of cigarette fumes.
The stone chunks still do not know what he will do with them.
Stones have enough time to grow.
As does Uli Gsell.
The Stuttgart stones lead to a forest in Tübingen and a former French munitions depot where Manuel Rongen has created his own world of stone.
The 44-year-old trades in old stone.
The demolition has been paid for.
Crime would be if they were ground into gravel or disappear into landfill.
The people insulted and threatened him when the newspapers reported in September that he had bought the north wing from the demolition contractor.
The opposition to Stuttgart 21 development project talks for days on end.
The demolition was explained to him as nothing he could do about it.
If it was going to happen, then the most sensible thing was that the stone was used again for other purposes.
In response, around 200 Stuttgart 21 players took a block away from them, each weighing an average 80 kilos and costing 6.50 to 14 Euros.
Some as a keepsake, but others in hopes of being able to return the blocks if the building is rebuilt.
Rongen had bought 500 tonnes - equivalent to 25 truck-loads.
About half is stored in the forest, but the rest has been sold long ago.
Gardeners, landscape gardeners and homeowners.
The workers came from all over the world and took away what they could carry in their boots and trailers.
Stuttgart scandal stones have long been transformed into walls, or boundaries for herb gardens.
"Actually, this stone is not special," says Rongen.
If it had no political significance.
The climbs into his off-roader and takes a tour of his 20 ha ranch.
The law graduate changed to biology, then he changed to computers, and finally became a stone merchant.
And a stone enthusiast.
The store holds 40,000 tonnes of stone.
The treasure is spread across Germany.
It is claimed to be the largest used stone dealer in the country.
He brake.
Artfully carved sandstones are lying in the snow.
"They used to be part of Dresden's Marienbrücke," he says.
The Yellow sandstone is yellow and warm, he says.
"My favourite stone."
The route then continues upwards through the forest.
The pillar is red sandstone, previously part of Karlsruhe train station.
And more.
"Beautiful travertine."
The blocks once belonged to the stands of Stuttgart's Neckar Stadium.
The snow is full of stones and stories - Stuttgart travertine from Stuttgart police headquarters, red granite from St. Blasius church, tuff from Heilbrunn hospital.
So much work, so much effort, so much sweat.
When Rongen thinks about how the stones used to be hand carved and moved with simply pulleys and oxcarts, he feels a great sense of reverence.
It would be a scandal to shred all this.
The man has not become rich, but he has found some precious stones.
The stone merchant currently employs 14 people and masons, sculptors, glass blower and horticulturist have also set up in the forest.
"We work hard, but it is satisfying," says the used stone dealer.
The fellow is going to Cologne soon.
There are also stones to be rescued there.
Talent War for graduates with potential
There is a rush on at the buffet.
16 students are making their way to salmon rolls, tomato soup and desert.
The Technical University of Braunschweig and Volkswagen have invited mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop.
They are going to talk shop on the future of the car with VW developers in a kind of idea contest - and, incidentally, learn more about Volkswagen.
Many companies are already engaged in hand-to-hand combat in the Genius Contest, and are reliing on university cooperation, like VW.
Their mission: to recruit the most talented graduates as early as possible in the lecture hall - before they enter the job market and are courted by any other person.
And because universities do not provide a breakdown of student performance, companies are looking for and seeking exceptional talent in hands-on projects.
The second day of the workshop at the Technical University of Braunschweig, the carmaker took the talent out to showcase the talent.
A young woman from human resources distributes ballpoint pens, gummy bears and folders with the VW logo.
The young aspirants learn about internships and student jobs, and explains the different routes into the company.
Nico Selle from the Technical University of Braunschweig is managing the project with VW.
The students get to meet industry and gain experience.
"VW can get students by taking close look at interesting candidates and thinking about which ones are their potential employees."
Such cooperation, however, is not unusual.
What is new is that students are being recruited so aggressively.
"The focus used to be on specialism-specific projects," says Selle.
The fight for the next batch of graduates is set to be much more serious.
In many sectors, companies can no longer identify their employees from the thousands of applications.
They really have to sell themselves to win over highly qualified graduates.
Graduates in engineering are particularly well placed for negotiation.
According to the Association of German Engineers (VDI), more than 40,000 engineering jobs were unfilled in October.
The shortage of engineers is going to get worse, according to VDI.
Roman Dykta is looking for talent for KPMG, the audit, tax and advisory services firm.
The organisers of the KPMG race are a massive recruitment event, a modern stealth hunting event where participants have to trace their route using GPS coordinates.
The company wants to send eight promising students straight to USA next year.
The participants will visit KPMG branches and get to know the company.
Who gets to go is decided in two advance selection rounds.
Only the cream of the various applicants will fly to USA.
In the midst of all the war cries about university graduates with potential, rifle shots from some companies are getting louder and louder, says Dykta.
With this race we want to stand out from the crowd.
"Just one trip was not enough for us."
For talent hunter Dykta, the sums add up.
"To date, we have stayed in contact with all participants of the similar campaign last year."
They are just about to graduate and expect to apply to us soon.
Beyond direct recruitment on campus, small and medium-sized businesses are particularly interested in recruiting at classic career fairs.
"We try to reach graduates at fairs."
Examples are Intersolar, a solar technology manufacturer.
The Bonn-based company employs around 1500 people in Germany.
Stübe is well aware of the problem of attracting young talent.
There are currently 35 vacancies on the company website.
It is really difficult to fill vacant posts.
It takes a lot of time and money, she says.
Other route is contact via university lecturers.
Solar World is working with several universities, including Freiberg University.
"The lecturers point out that students can do internships or write their dissertations with us."
Heavy advertising campaigns for solar specialists are not in the pipeline.
The company is trying to advertise its other advantages, including a relaxed working environment, flat hierarchies and straight communication.
The big corporation cannot often offer that, says human resources manager Stübe.
Money has not been key in the job market for a while.
Flexible working time, childcare and good promotion opportunities are also important factors.
Solarworld took the 55th place among the 100 best employers in Germany in a study by the Great Place to Work Institute.
The Institute publishes an annual league table of German employers.
It asks employees how happy they are with their work and job environment and looks at general working conditions.
Human resources manager Stübe hopes to score points with job seekers thanks to the company's place on the list.
Applicants are influenced by external assessments of any potential employer.
Wolf Reiner Krieger from the German Employer Branding Academy is an advisor for companies seeking to develop a good employer reputation as part of a long-term strategy.
The advice of his clients to be more authentic.
It actually means internal changes, says Kriegler.
The best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is through your own employees.
In industry jargon, Employer Branding among your own employees.
"Happy employees are the best ambassadors."
If you treat yourself well and identify with the company, they will find you new employees among their friends and acquaintances.
"It's like playing in a band," says Kriegler.
Obama stops new oil drilling
There will be no new drilling off the coast of the US Federal State of Florida in the Gulf of Mexico in the coming year.
The government in Washington has published a prohibition to that effect - thereby definitively scrapping earlier plans.
New drilling is also prohibited off the Atlantic coast for the immediate future.
Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar made the announcement on Wednesday.
The explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling platform in April was the trigger for the strict prohibition, which is to remain in force for at least five years.
Before the disaster that cost eleven workers their lives and led to the USA's biggest environmental disaster, President Obama, under pressure from the opposition and industry, had signaled his willingness to allow new drilling in the eastern area of the Gulf of Mexico.
Advocators hoped that this would reduce the USA's dependency on foreign oil.
Who will be responsible for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf is still unclear.
The UK energy company BP is the focus of criticism, and is faced with billions of dollars in claims.
The investigation board set up by President Obama is set to submit its findings at some point in December.
In October, Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar had revoked the prohibition on drilling imposed after the explosion.
In response, several oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects.
Obama and Salazar want to prevent any further catastrophe with tighter control and stricter safety regulations.
The responsible control authority, which remains in disrepute after numerous complaints of corruption, is being extensively reformed.
The President has announced that lucrative tax loopholes for oil and gas companies will be stopped.
The industry is warning publicly that the output in the Gulf will be significantly lower than in the past if regulation is more strict.
The government's plans are the most important barrier to the growth of the oil and gas industry, according to a recent industry survey by BDO - even before the prohibition on drilling was enforced on Wednesday.
The American Energy Alliance also complains about uncertainty in the industry.
The organisation believes that investment in new projects will be suspended indefinitely - at the cost of growth.
Ogoniland has broken down.
The water in the rivers is oil-brown and reeks like a petrol station.
People are living on theft, corruption and cooking illegal oil.
Celestine Akpobari sees the positive side.
"Don't worry, you'll see plenty of oil sludge to photograph today."
The 37-year-old Nigerian was trying to photograph a boy swimming up to his waist in the water - and the water streaks around him.
The brown bumps of crude oil under the surface are invisible.
When she was a teenager, she used to fill buckets with shrimp at the bank of the Bodo jetty river.
Now, the stagnant waters are completely dead.
Five years ago, massive quantities of crude oil flooded into the vast wetland.
Bodo fishermen now have to walk six hours to get to water inhabited by fish.
The journey through the mangrove swamps, crossed by river courses, the full extent of the devastation is plain to see.
Instead of clear water, the motorboat produces a brown swill, if you put your hand in the water it comes out coated in oil.
The roots of mangrove trees stick out from the ground like black liquorice sticks. The odd palm among the mangroves hangs its trunk despondently.
The birds ubiquitous in wetlands are nowhere to be seen. As the outboard motor falls, a devastating quiet spreads over the former paradise that now smells like a petrol station.
The environmental war is a permanent threat to health, says Celestine Akpobari, a harsh observer.
The comparison to war is appropriate.
The region of the Ogoni has been a battlefield for a long time. In the 60s, European explorers made their way to the region, and in the 80s the first wave of resistance was organised around the author Ken Saro-Wiwa, who later died.
While more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped every day from the delta region as a whole - which is three times the size of Switzerland - the oilfields in Ogoniland are still barren, a situation that is too unstable for the oil company.
Every few hundred metres, steel frames rise from water like bizarre sculptures. The head of the boreholes is often called "little Christmas trees."
This structure can be up to 50 years old and most of them are seriously corroded.
One borehole after the next falls apart, and a constant stream of crude oil flows into the water.
According to expert estimates, more than two billion litres of oil have flown into the delta's ecosystem in 50 years. Yearly, that is the same amount of oil that flooded into the sea off Alaska when the Exxon Valdez supertanker crashed 21 years ago - the most significant human environmental catastrophe in human history.
There is a dispute over who should be held responsible for the ongoing worst case scenario of ecological disaster.
The Shell company says sabotage and organised theft of oil are more than 90% of the contamination, environmentalists believe broken drill heads and leaking pipelines are the main cause.
In 2008, the US academic Richard Steiner accused Shell of significantly lower safety standards in Nigeria than in the rest of the world. The rate of defects in pipelines alone was "several times higher than elsewhere."
Human figures emerge from the mangrove swamps, that from distance look deserted, oil-covered garages.
Under one of the many barrels - some connected to pipes, others scattered on the ground - a flame appears.
Michael, group leader, explains that the crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours.
First, benzine is siphoned off to a collecting pan, then kerosene drips from the end of the tube and finally, diesel.
Michael and four assistants produce up to four 300-litre barrels of diesel a day.
The people of the delta use the chronic fuel shortage to their advantage in the largest crude oil state of sub-Saharan Africa.
Nigeria has only one refinery.
The illegal cooks can still undercut the absurd low diesel prices of 40 Euro cents per litre. They get their raw material for no reason.
The material is from "bunkerers" who tap the pipeline network all the way across Ogoniland.
However, only a small proportion of the raw material stored by bunkerers goes on to be refined illegally. Organised criminal networks with politicians and highly ranked officers fill tankers with a large share and flog it on the global market.
The activist believes the debate around whether the environmental catastrophe is caused by population activities or low production safety standards is purely academic.
If the oil companies were not viewed as interlopers and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the fishermen's livelihood, there would not be any sabotage, theft or illegal refineries.
According to Akpobari, the relationship between the Ogoni towards Shell has been destroyed to such a extent that only withdrawal by the company is an option.
Michael becomes edgy.
It's time you disappear, says the muscular oil man.
The soldiers may turn up at any time.
If the illegal oil refiners are caught by the army's task force, they will not be jailed, but will have to pay hefty bribes.
The soldiers, mainly originating from north of Nigeria, also want to profit from oil like all Nigerians.
This damn stuff has taken our country to rock bottom in every way.
Investigators discover dangerous defect in A380 engines
The A380 seems to have a major safety issue.
While examining a plane after an emergency landing, investigators have discovered a possible defect that could lead to "catastrophic engine failure."
The airline Qantas is now preparing to take the engine manufacturer to court.
The passengers of the Qantas Airbus that was forced to land at the beginning of November have had much more luck than anybody expected.
The alleged defect could have serious consequences. In a statement published on Thursday, the Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) revealed that the defect could potentially cause fatigue cracks and leaks in an oil hose connection.
This could lead to "catastrophic engine failure."
20 different A380 aircraft with Rolls-Royce engines may be affected.
Qantas Airbus that was forced to land in Singapore on 4 November was one of those aeroplanes.
The Australian airline is now taking legal action against the British turbine manufacturer.
It has submitted a claim to an Australian federal court in Sydney, which leaves open further legal procedures against the company.
The CEO of Qantas, Alan Joyce, said his airline would demand compensation for the incident.
The heat of the engine caused parts to break and damage the wings.
Rolls-Royce believes an oil fire caused the damage.
After the incident, up to 40 engines are now being replaced.
The Australian investigators announced that they will continue to conduct further safety tests on the jumbos equipped with the affected engines.
ATSB speaker Martin Dolan said that the safety recommendation was the result of close cooperation with Rolls-Royce.
The safety issue was considered sufficiently serious to all affected parties to be informed.
After the forced landing of Qantas plane, the airline grounded its A380 fleet for weeks.
Singapore Airlines temporarily kept about three of its eleven A380 on ground.
Lufthansa replaced the engine in one A380 as a precaution.
The double decker is the largest passenger plane in the world.
Countrywide snowfall causes traffic chaos
Germany all white. There has been overnight snowfall across most of the country.
There is chaos on many roads, and trains and flights have been cancelled.
At least three people have died in car accidents.
The winter freeze in Germany. In freezing temperatures, most of Germany was covered in snow on Wednesday night, causing traffic chaos in many areas.
In the north and east of the country, there is 15 centimeters of snow in some areas.
Traffic is severely restricted on many motorways and roads.
Snow ploughs were in constant operation on the A7 at Flensburg, unable to beat the constant snow drifts.
Strong winds were also recorded on the Baltic coast.
The Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) is expecting storm tides with water levels 1.2 metres above normal on the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein from morning onwards.
In Saxony, snow drifts on motorways and A-roads have been causing serious problems.
The weather service Meteomedia reported that Saxon Switzerland was placed on red alert - the highest alert level.
30 centimeters of fresh snow fell in some parts of the region and strong winds caused damage.
A number of trucks and cars were stranded during the night.
In Saxony-Anhalt, the police authorities also report serious disruption on the road.
Snow and wind caused crawling traffic and traffic jams on the A2.
In Thuringia, the A4 and A9 were affected by snowfall.
According to Deutsche Bahn, there are significant disruptions in Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt, Thuringia and north of Bavaria.
Snow on the tracks, fallen trees on the rail and overhead wires and malfunctioning points are the main problems.
In Saxony, long distance trains from Leipzig to Nuremberg had to be stopped.
The ICE train to Munich was forced to end its journey in Saalfeld, Thuringia.
The 165 passengers were provided with blankets, food and drink by fire and ambulance personnel.
Snow swept across the road.
Snow and wind caused many cancellations at major German airports.
In Munich, a spokeswoman for the flight information centre announced that some cancellations have been made.
In Frankfurt am Main, a spokeswoman for Fraport said that 40 flights have been already amended.
Snow ploughs have been permanently operational.
Only a small number of stranded passengers were at the airport, and there were only under 400 camp beds available to accommodate them, according to the spokeswoman.
Accidents had already occurred on many roads by Wednesday evening.
One lorry driver died in the evening in a collision with a train on a level crossing in Ostholstein.
The train driver suffered light injuries.
A similar accident occurred in Nuremberg on snow-covered roads. A truck was stranded on a level crossing when the vehicle got stuck in the snow.
The driver died.
Four passengers in the train were injured - the line from Bayreuth to Nuremberg was closed into the morning hours.
A 30-year-old woman also died after she fell on black ice in Aschaffenburg.
The good news is that the snow will continue to be loose and powdery, causing snow drifts even in light winds.
The wind is set to drop.
Only the Baltic Sea will suffer strong and stormy winds.
However, it will remain very cold - up to minus 15 degrees in some places.
Deutsche Bank seeking buyer for its twin towers
Deutsche Bank wants to sell its emblem. According to a news report, the bank is looking for buyers for the two office high-rises at its Frankfurt headquarters.
The property could fetch up to 500 million Euros.
Deutsche Bank has only recently renovated its headquarters. The twin towers in the Frankfurt banking quarter have been modernised as bankers return to their old workplaces.
The financial institution is now looking for a buyer for the two high-rises, which are now being renovated, according to a spokesman.
The spokesman did not indicate the reasons for the planned sale.
Currently we are constantly reviewing whether it is better to own property or to sell it and then rent it back.
The largest financial institution is going to leave its headquarters after only a short period of time.
The bank first acquired the two towers for 272 million Euros in mid-2007 from the investors of one of its own fund and continued to implement an extensive renovation programme.
The renovation costs around 200 million Euros.
A sale would earn the bank a lot of money.
The newspaper reports that the towers are being called the Green Towers.
The buildings will be sold to a fund owned by the bank or to an independent investor, according to the spokesman.
- Thousands mourn lost friends
More than 10,000 people in New Zealand have attended a memorial service for the miners declared dead after a series of explosions.
It has not yet been possible to recover the bodies, as the safety situation in the shaft where the accident occurred remains precarious.
Almost two weeks ago, a violent explosion occurred in the Pike River Mine near Greymouth, Scotland.
29 miners aged 17-62 were found dead below ground.
A probe was lowered into the shaft, but no signs of survivors were found.
The high concentration of poisonous gases and further explosions kept the shaft closed for safety reasons.
After the second violent detonation, the authorities and experts acted on the assumption that no chance any of the miners would survive.
It has not yet been possible to recover the bodies.
Family members and friends remembered the dead in a memorial service.
In bright sunshine, ten thousand people gathered in Greymouth on New Zealand's South Island.
Then they kept a two-minute silence.
29 tables were set up in honor of the buried miners, displaying helmets, lamps and their names.
Photos and personal items, including clothing and surfboards, were also on display.
The flag was flying half mast at all government buildings in the country.
New Zealand had hoped that the miners would return from the earth's depths to the surface, according to the Prime Minister of New Zealand John Key.
"But they never came home."
Lawrie Drew, father of trapped coal miner Zen Drew, said he could not explain his death until he saw his body.
The funeral service was held with the Prime Minister and members of the victims' families.
British and South African miners were also buried alive in the first explosion on 19 November.
Rescuers began by extinguishing a fire inside the coal mine on New Zealand's South Island.
Gary Knowles told journalists that work would begin to cool the high temperatures inside the mine as soon as the explosive gases had been displaced.
To hell, warriors!
There is a place for gore in art house cinema?
The film director Nicolas Winding Refn is exploring old genre boundaries with his warrior epic "Walhalla Rising."
What audience was the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn thinking of when he was shooting "Walhalla Rising"?
The captured Viking warrior with only one eye (Mads Mikkelsen) escapes his tormentors and knocks down his enemies with almost superhuman powers - which sounds ideal for young males on the search for gore and action, particularly as our hero has a preference for brutal killing methods and is not afraid to cut the entrails from the dead body of his enemies when he is in a bad mood.
The other hand, One-Eye, as he is actually called, does not say a word during the film, and even the other figures are only induced to say one or two sentences or to emit a few severe death cries.
Otherwise, the film is silent, swimming in the eeriely beautiful hills of Scotland that provide the scene for the Viking world around a thousand years ago.
More suited to adult cinema enthusiasts with interest in existentialism and very smooth tracking shots.
Great when a film has several target groups, but a shame if they are mutually exclusive.
Since his wild and stylised drug dealer trilogy "Pusher," Director Winding Refn has been seen as a Danish version of Quentin Tarantino, but steadily refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream by using more humor or to the art house by displaying less brutality.
Most art cinema enthusiasts would be deterred by the brain and entrails flying around.
If they have not already done so, action fans will die of boredom when One-Eye - for somewhat unexplainable reasons - sets off by ship to Jerusalem with a troop of violent Christian missionaries, ending in dead calms and fog before the crew arrives in what is clearly America - where the silence continues.
No wonder then that 'Walhalla Rising' has not found a cinema distributor in Germany and only appeared on DVD.
This is a shame, particularly because the cinematography is superb, but also because there is a stirring work of cinema behind the pretentious, at times bloody façade - and that work deserves some attention.
This film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot, but all about atmosphere - a feverish dream that has become a film.
For the viewer, there is no escape from that dream.
Refn does not allow the viewer a single moment of relaxation and slowly chokes the same view with his iron images and the gloomy trance-like soundtrack - and the incomprehensible hate that strikes at the viewer from the heart of the characters.
Only one small blond boy standing faithfully at One-Eye's side remains innocence - all other characters are driven by fear.
The most important character is the one-eyed hero who is driven by fear - whose motives are never explained, but who at some point becomes the warrior from hell for his enemies and temporary allies, and perhaps even the messenger of the devil.
He equals death, but maybe only for the already damned.
"Walhalla Rising" is an endemic film that people will hate and admire to their sorrow, vexation and amazement.
Experience.
Mysterious earthworks
The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in Syria.
The country is refusing to comment - but is allowing inspections.
The evening of 5th to 6th September 2007, at least four Israeli F-15 I fighter jets attacked a mysterious, cube-shaped building in Syria.
It is located on the banks of the Euphrates river; the next major city, 30 kilometres away, is Dair Alzour.
The name appears in IAEA documents when it mentions the reactor Syria allegedly built in the cube-shaped building hidden in a valley cut off from the country's electricity network - with aid from North Korea.
The reactor, which is commonly referred to as the nearest settlement El Kibar, could be used to produce plutonium - which could then be used to build atomic bombs.
The technology from fifties is very little used for any other purpose.
The CIA gave a video presentation with blurry satellite images.
Computer animation showed where the components of the reactor were believed to have been located before its destruction - the reactor is believed to be a smaller copy of the north Korean model from the atomic centre in Yongbyon.
The agency also produced photos of the building closely, and even its interior.
The reactor is believed to be almost ready for commissioning, but has not yet been supplied with fuel rod.
Today, more than three years after the bombardment, almost no more is known. In fact, questions seem to have increase with time.
The former US President George W. Bush recently revealed in his memoirs that, although the CIA knew before the attack that Syria was building a reactor in El Kibar, it had not found any signs of an active nuclear weapons programme in the country.
The European Intelligence officials are even more sceptical and believe the CIA presentation was "plausible."
They lack hard evidence, as does the IAEA.
When asked how confident he is that a reactor is operating this summer, a highly ranked UN diplomat replied that the IAEA had "enough material to pose questions."
The Syrians, either, rapidly removed the rubble of the supposedly "unused military building" and levelled the area.
In June 2008, an IAEA team led by head of Inspector Olli Heinonen discovered traces of man-made uranium in El Kibar.
In addition, the IAEA acquired commercially produced satellite images from a Member State from the period immediately before the attack - images that are more convincing than the CIA's images.
The images were not available on the market, as the unknown customer - possibly Israel - has acquired them exclusively.
The IAEA cannot independently verify their authenticity.
Syria has never had a secret atomic programme or to have constructed a reactor.
Syria claims the uranium was from Israeli weapons.
After analysing the particles, the IAEA rejected the claim as untrue.
Since then, Damascus has avoided discussion on this point - or on the satellite images.
Syria has also prevented inspectors from carrying a second inspection in El Kibar or accessing the rubble of the bombed building.
Israel is also maintaining a stony silence.
"We will not comment on this," said the former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, in office at the time of the attack, confirming the official position.
The investigation has been continued since June 2008 without conclusion and "increasingly developing into a serious credibility problem for the authority," according to a highly ranked Western diplomat at the IAEA headquarters in Vienna - ultimately, serious infringement of the non-proliferation treaty remains unresolved in the hands of the IAEA.
The IAEA clearly believes the key to moving forward in this process lies in three additional facilities that have been supposedly functionally connected to the alleged reactor - and contrast to the reactor still exist.
However, inspectors have not yet disclosed the nature of the facilities or what function they have or what makes them suspicious.
The bodies are referred to internally at the IAEA as Marj as-Sultan, Masyaf and Iskandariya, referring to neighbouring towns.
The independent Institute for Science and International Security in Washington (ISIS) has identified these locations and found a complex of buildings on satellite images at Masyaf, which is very likely to be one of the suspicious buildings.
It may be located in or immediately next to a military base - it is precisely for this reason that Syria is refusing the IAEA access to the three locations.
In Vienna, there is word that Syrians were afraid of some sort of fishing expedition and fear that the IAEA is being sent out by USA as a surveillance agent to spy out military facilities.
This fear was further enhanced by the fact that nuclear inspectors were tipped off about the facilities by US secret services.
The IAEA has documents, including satellite photos, which suggest that material has been transported between the three locations and the cube-shaped building on the Euphrates river.
The highly appointed Western diplomat in Vienna said that at least one of the facilities could be "related to fuel production."
However, no signs of sensitive activities such as enrichment or reprocessing of uranium, processes that are required to build atomic weapons.
This type of reactor is fuelled by uranium, but not enriched uranium.
However, a reasonable guess can be made as to where the uranium came from and where the plutonium from that uranium would be extracted for use in a bomb.
The remaining unclear is whether trace material has been stored at the three locations.
No one is aware of any information on where the rubble has ended, as if hundreds of truckloads of earth have simply fallen into thin air.
The salt mine of Al Tibni, located just several kilometres from El Kibar on the other side of the Euphrates, was unlikely to be a possible storage location for radioactive waste, according to the IAEA.
The former IAEA inspector Robert Kelley recently connected the mine and the reactor in an analysis of satellite images for the prestigious Jane's Intelligence Review.
However, images from orbit show that Syria undertook earthworks at the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the IAEA requested access.
It may be coincidence, but has done nothing to clear suspicion.
The IAEA has also been talking about a plan to protect Syria's military secrets - the costs alone shows the extent of the interest of the inspectors.
Damascus, however, also brushed off this proposal.
Although western diplomats in Vienna offered reassurance, by saying that since the reactor was destroyed the issue was low priority, the US ambassador Glyn Davies has been bringing special inspections to the table, which is one of the most powerful tools available to the Vienna-based atomic authority to conduct inspections.
Yukiya Amano, current Director General of the IAEA, has already spoken of an option that I am open to in the future but is still hesitant.
The option is high risk, on the one hand it requires a majority in the IAEA Governing Council, and a number of the 35 countries represented are not anything other than eager to escalate.
The other side of the story is, as one diplomat says, "what if they find nothing?"
Love in times of war
Angelina Jolie began working on her yet anonymous debut in summer, there has been trouble.
She wrote the script herself - a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a Serbian man.
No one really knows much more than that - but that alone is enough to cause unease.
The rumor remains that the woman - a Muslim - falls in love with her Serbian rapist during the Yugoslavian War.
Bosnian women’s organisations have immediately protested, in response to which several days of shooting in Sarajevo were moved to Hungary shortly.
Since then the film has been shot in Hungary and is in post-production, but there are still protests in Bosnia.
Bosnian newspaper - Jolie is an ambassador for the UN refugee agency UNHCR.
However, she cannot be called diplomatic - she offered to meet the women weeks ago in Hungary but they declined.
The meeting must be held in Bosnia, says Hasečić.
According to Hasečić, there were no love stories in rape camps, and Jolie's behaviour towards victims was enough to tell her about the script.
The UN refugee organisation has recommended dismissing Jolie as ambassador, reports the Guardian.
What kind of script has Jolie written?
The Bosnian Ministry of Culture that read her script issued a permit for shooting in Sarajevo after some to-ing and frowing - it is not clear why Jolie then went to Bosnia.
The young writer asserts that she has no political motives in her film, has read up on the Yugoslavian conflict assiduously and wants to show the tragic consequences of war and give voice to all sides involved.
In terms of content, she remained ambiguous.
The second, a different synopsis of the film is circulating on the Internet. The lovers have known each other before the outbreak of the war and meet again when she, a Bosnian Muslim, is kidnapped to a Serbian camp where she is working as a guard.
The story sounds very different from the "rape victim falls for torturer" scenario.
The fact that Jolie's film actually begins before the war is clear.
Jolie says the pressure on her is "unfair and based on false information."
The only hackers from Hollywood can give her peace by illegally posting the script on the web, as has been the fate of so many other scripts.
Please get out of here.
This evening, everything is finally going well for the Irish.
No trace of unhappiness.
The home team is dominating its guests from Sweden, Finland and USA too much for that.
The fans are dancing for joy against a soundtrack of blaring music and stamping feet.
The Bailey Pub in Cork, southern Ireland, is rocking because table tennis players are throwing ping pong balls into beer glasses over a three meter distance - and scoring.
Beer pong is the name of the bizarrous spectacle, and the winner gets 500 Euros prize and plane tickets to Las Vegas for the beer pong world championship in January.
Cian Tanner is a quiet type; this shrill drinking game and the reticent computer scientist do not really go together.
The 26-year-old is trying to amuse himself by playing, to distract from the burning question of what the future will bring.
The candidate is not scheduled to play in Las Vegas - he will be taking part in job interviews in New Zealand in January.
"I have a weird feeling doing it," he says.
It is so far from home and I still have no work there.
However, his girlfriend is waiting for him in Auckland - "she got her dream job as event manager in no time - maybe good sign."
In response to the poor home outlook, two of Tanner's three siblings are already taking their chances abroad.
The sister Yvonne, a social worker, is in Sydney and his brother Colin is working as an IT consultant in London.
Tanner's family is not an exception for island families.
100,000 Irish men and women will leave the country in the near future, experts from the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in Dublin.
By 2015, they estimate a total of 200,000 emigrants.
For a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants, that will be a significant loss.
If the predictions are correct, there will be a similar wave of migration to the emigration Ireland suffered in the 1980s.
After a decade of growth that brought great prosperity to Ireland, the hard times have returned.
The economic crisis is particularly a shock to young, well-educated Irish who have only seen things improving.
Job losses and social descent seemed absurd in boom years.
All were needed and money was abundant.
Since then, three out of every ten men and women under thirty are without work.
In the Irish Times, many letters from young emigrants complaining that "everything is going down the pan in Ireland."
The revolution should be against the politicians and bankers - but anyone who can leave simply leaves and our country is losing an entire generation.
"Can the last person please turn out the light?"
The future of law student Leanne Caufield, President of the Irish Union of Students, is a dismal one, because the government is busy window-dressing and no longer providing young people with prospects for the future.
The government is reducing the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs.
She sees her students making their way from one unpaid internship to another.
The most important concern is that she will have to emigrate in four years.
"The thought is sad and depressing."
On the other hand, men such as Stephen McLarnon try to give the situation a positive spin.
McLarnon organises the WorkingAbroadExpo, a fair providing all round service for work abroad.
Working abroad is a great chance to take your first steps on the careerladder.
There are photos of surfers in Australia and snowboarders in Canada on his website.
Working abroad is not galley duty, but a source of freedom and fun.
The past six months, Seán O'Donovan has known what it feels like to build something somewhere else.
As there was no more for the engineer in Ireland, he is now working with 15 Irish colleagues on building sites in Germany.
The team is currently working on a fashion boutique in Gelsenkirchen.
In January they will move on to Hanover or Berlin - to the next project.
In the meantime, O'Donovan visits his home country seldom, as he is taking on extra shifts to pay off the mortgage on his home.
The situation is really crazy, he says, as he walks through the door of his house for the first time in a long time.
"I am earning money in Germany for a house in Ireland that I barely see."
Then he laughs a little self-consciously and walks through the cold rooms.
The small house is in a classy neighbourhood with tended front gardens. Large, expensive cars are parked in the driveways.
The house was bought with his sister four years ago for 380,000 Euros - financed with a 100 percent mortgage.
The time was mad - easy money without too much questions, he says.
Is he concerned about anything going wrong with the mortgage?
Todd O'Donovan takes a long thought, pours some more tea and says: "I have no children to feed and I am young. Even if everything goes wrong, I can start again.
The civil engineer does not like the moaning that he hears so often.
No one has to die - out situation is no close to as dramatic as times this island has been through in past.
Working abroad for a while is not the worst thing that can happen - perhaps we only feel Irish by going abroad.
Then he laughs and recalls how his father went to England in the last great economic crisis.
Seven years later, he was back and life continued in Ireland, just like that.
Cian Tanner likes that idea.
Leave the future open and see what it is like living somewhere else.
The wife has already worked in London and why should things not go well for him and his girlfriend in New Zealand?
The most important thing that remains to be his priority is the party for his 27th birthday on Friday in Dublin.
The party could become a farewell party.
"Just not too much emotion," he says and drinks a large gush of beer.
"Farewell - that sounds alarming."
'Lets just call it a going away party, really relaxed with a few friends, a couple drinks and a little game.'
The democratic routine
Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as does private enterprise support.
Crime has become a bigger concern than unemployment.
And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region.
The latest Latinobarómetro poll taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist.
The poll has been taken regularly since 1995, and it monitors attitude changes across the region.
Two related things are featured in the results of this year’s poll, taken in September and early October.
The first is Latin America's mild sunny mood.
The second is the increasing stability of attitudes towards democracy and its core institutions.
Support for democracy has risen noticeably in several countries on the Pacific rim of South America (see table 1).
In Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% a year since 2002, democracy support has risen from low of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year.
It also rose in Mexico, where the economy has recovered after a big drop in output last year.
The remaining half of respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries, are believed in democrats, which drags down the regional average (see chart 2).
Some 44% of respondents in the region reported themselves satisfied with how their country's democracy works in practice, a similar figure as last year but a big increase on the 25% in 2001.
Some 34% of respondents believed in their country's Congress and 45% in their government, which is still a similar year in both cases but up sharply from 2003 (17% and 24% respectively).
A decade ago economic challenges in Latin America undermined support for democracy.
The stability of the crisis is probably because many Latin American countries suffered only a short recession and have enjoyed a strong recovery.
In addition, a stronger social safety net has helped protect the poor.
(The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty declined marginally in 2009 and has fallen again this year to 32%.)
The mood varies widely from country to country (see chart 4).
Brazilian economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is reflected in a widely shared sense of progress.
The cases are rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and violent crime has worsened.
The second time since the polls started, more respondents across Latin America as a whole cite crime, rather than unemployment (see chart 5).
Some 31% of those who have been in the past year have been in crime, but that is down from 38% last year and is the lowest figure since 1995.
More robust economic performance is reflected in rising support for private enterprise and the market economy: some 71% of respondents in the region believe private enterprise is essential for development (see chart 6).
The majority of respondents agree that the market economy is the only system that will make their country develop, up from 47% last year.
However, 62% of respondents in Venezuela hold that view (and 80% back private enterprise) even though the left-wing president, Hugo Chávez, is expropriating many private companies.
Brazil is the country with most leadership in the region, mentioned by 19% of respondents (up from 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged from last year) and Venezuela (9%, down from 11% last year).
United States is seen as the most influential country in Mexico and much of Central America, while Venezuela is seen as the most influential country in Ecuador, the Dominican Republic and Nicaragua.
Rubbish vote
Nobody expected Haiti's general election on November 28th to be perfect.
It was far worse than the outsiders who are trying to help the country.
It included stuffed ballot boxes and repeat voting, ballot slips scattered in gutters, trashed polling stations and intimidation.
Polling stations opened hours late.
Many Haitians, including lots displaced by January's earthquake, roamed around trying to vote.
Some eventually gave up.
A dozen presidential candidates, including several presumed frontrunners, called for the annulment of the election.
Demonstrations, some of them violent, flared across the country.
The United Nations' top official in Haiti, Edmond Mulet, declared it "a fairly good election in many ways."
Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community took a cautious look at the irregularities, serious as they were, and believed they would not have a significant impact on the process.
In other words, the show continues.
The electoral authority, which against the claims of being beholden to René Préval, the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate, Jude Célestin, is due to announce preliminary results on December 7th.
The expected run-off is scheduled for January.
All hope in the election is not lost.
The two main opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, have retreated from their initial call for the vote to be declared invalid.
The problem may arise if Mr Célestin, who has little or no discernible support among voters, is declared to have reached the run-off.
With a cholera epidemic rising, and more than 1m earthquake survivors still living in tents, there were fears that turnout would be low.
In the event, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented by disorganisation.
Some 250,000 identity cards, required for voting, remained undistributed shortly before the election.
Much is at risk.
Aid donors see the election of a legitimate and popular government as an essential step in Haiti's reconstruction.
They are clearly Haitians.
Tiptoeing to the centre
Since she suddenly died, Cristina Fernández, Argentina's president has benefited from a wave of public support that has taken her approval rating by 20 points to over 50%, its highest level since she was elected in 2007.
The opportunity to secure a second term in an election next year depends on the willingness of the aging mother to abandon the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and political partner, Néstor Kirchner.
And on that the signs are mixing.
Cristina Kirchner, who continued to handle economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president, was in the habit of drawing budgets that underestimate tax revenues, economic growth and inflation.
The first couple could spend the extra revenue at will.
On paper Ms Fernández's government lost its majority in Congress last year.
The opposition is divided, and it was further disintegrated by Mr Kirchner's death of a heart attack on October 27th.
Some dissident members of the current Peronist movement have joined Ms Fernández.
After chaos, a parliamentarian bit another in the face, and others accused the government of bribery, Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget.
"I am not going to argue," said the president.
The 2010 budget will now apply next year, allowing the president more room to spend at will.
The economy is heating wildly, and it is likely to grow by up to 9% this year.
The official inflation rate now stands at 11.1%, but private estimates - and trade-union wage demand - could close to 30%.
Since 2003, Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003, made growth and poverty reduction, rather than controlling inflation, his main priorities.
The IMF rejected the IMF, harassed the private sector and closed INDEC, the statistics agency, which started to doctor official inflation statistics.
Might Ms Fernández now moderate these policies?
She has called for talks between private business and union leaders.
The officials are talking about limiting wage increases next year to 18%.
The economy has been bugged by high world prices for Argentina's farm exports.
However, inflation has eroding the boost to growth provided by a big devaluation in 2002.
The reason for this may be why Ms Fernández is starting to show signs of wanting to restore Argentina's financial relations with the rest of the world.
The government signed a deal with bondholders who had refused an earlier forced restructuring of Argentina’s debt in 2001.
Soon Ms Fernández is edging towards an agreement with creditors grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes about $6.7 billion.
The Kirchners always insisted that this could not require oversight by the IMF, as is customary.
The fund will provide "technical assistance" to design a new national consumer-price index, which looks like a prelude to clean up INDEC.
It is unclear if Ms Fernández wants to remain in politics beyond the end of her term now that her husband is no longer at her side.
If she does, she must win the support of the middle class, much of which has tired of kirchnerism.
By the time Argentines return from their summer holidays in March, the waves of sympathy for her will have ebbed.
If she wants to win another election she will have to decide whether or not to quietly repudiate many of her husband's policy.
Half a cheer for China
Taiwan's voters are moving towards a closer union with the mainland.
What do Taiwan think of its big brother across the straits?
More than 7.5m voters turned out on November 27th, 70% of those eligible, to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts, in what is seen as a broad assessment of the president, Ma Ying-jeou.
Since 1949, Mr Ma has become a substitute for China proper, having established groundbreaking business links, including partial free-trade agreement, in the most important rearrangement of relations with China proper since 1949.
Mr Ma passed the test, but only a few minutes.
Although his Kuomintang party (KMT) ended up winning three of the five mayoralties, it failed to win a majority of the votes.
Instead, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which has a strong commitment to fuller independence for Taiwan, won nearly 50% of all votes to the KMT's 45%.
If this were a presidential poll, Mr Ma would be in trouble.
Since he was elected two years ago his party's share of the vote has declined by about 8%.
First, the DPP drew even with the KMT in city councils.
The election saw most of the Taiwanese election patterns, including rowdy campaign trucks and flag-waving mass rallies with skimpily clad dancing girls.
It even saw the obligatory mysterious assassination temptation.
Sean Lien, son of Lien Chan, the honorary chairman of the KMT, was fighting for a KMT candidate on the eve of the election.
The crowd shot the young Mr Lien clean through the face, wounding him and killing a bystander.
Bizarrely, it has not been determined whether the gunman intentionally killed Mr Lien or to resolve a dispute with the candidate.
Both ways, says Tsai Ing-wen, the leader of the DPP, the shooting affected the election, casting suspicion on the DPP and driving voters towards the KMT.
The only big winner from the campaign was China.
It was striking how the issue of the mainland was absent.
Instead candidates took a swipe at public housing and job creation plans.
Taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and loathes China's military threat.
The KMT tends to avoid parading its ties to the government in Beijing.
This time the DPP also refused to raise anti-China sentiment.
It is responding to a new awareness that Chinese business is essential to Taiwan's economic survival.
Mr Ma, for his part, claimed confirmation that his China policy is acceptable to the Taiwanese majority.
The Beijing government can expect to continue supplying commercial sweeteners, in line with its strategy for lure Taiwan back into the fold.
China wasted no time sending a negotiator to Taipei to arrange for a summit on investment protection and medical co-operation.
However, it would like to see political integration too, but first things first.
Better to wait till after the 2012 presidential election for that.
The DPP has anyway reinvented itself.
The province was at a low point, when its former leader, Chen Shui-bian, was sent to prison for corruption.
Since 2000-08, he was a firebrand for explicit independence.
The DPP is working hard to attract professionals and young people.
Ms Tsai has been called as a DPP candidate for the presidency, as has Su Tseng-chang, who served under Mr Chen.
Their party is now trying to show that it can also cooperate with Beijing.
Ms Tsai announced plans for a think-tank to act as a point of contact between the DPP and China, provided they can be held without preconditions.
Ms Tsai tells Taiwanese public that she is a "trustworthy alternative to Mr Ma's hasty approach to China.
Mr Chen seems infuriated by the shift.
In a statement issued from his cell, he said that the DPP candidates would have fared better if they insisted that Taiwan is a separate country.
The Supreme Court even ordered Mr Su not to run for the presidency.
Even without Mr Chen's interference, the DPP will struggle to select between its potential candidates.
The KMT is due for soul searching.
Mr Ma's ratings have been poor, despite breakneck economic growth; KMT candidates have not wanted to campaign with him.
The unpopularity of the candidate seems to be due to unemployment and widening gap between rich and poor.
A KMT spokesman says it will reshuffle its cabinet as well its local branches.
The strong showing suggests that Taiwan's support for rapprochement is limited.
The same time most Taiwanese see China as inevitable.
According to Antonio Chiang, a prominent columnist, "the point of no return has already passed."
nominations: Jazz singer Esperanza Spalding is a surprise pick in best new artist category.
Perform at the request of a president, and people are bound to take notice.
Esperanza Spalding, the 26-year-old jazz bassist and singer handpicked by President Obama to perform at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in 2009, was one of the Grammys' surprises this year with a high profile nomination in the best new artist category.
The nomination is a bit of a headache, but it is consistent with the Grammys' rules of no more than three albums before the release of the album that "establishes the public identity of that artist."
The 2010 album, "Chamber Music Society," certainly marked a step forward, and given her airy, inviting voice and a keen hand with pop, funk and Latin influences, it is possible to draw Spalding from Norah Jones' runaway success in 2003, the closest equivalent to Grammy voters looking for jazz's neighborhood in recent years.
The Grammy audience rightly voted for Vijay Iyer Trio's "Historicity" in the instrumental album category, a vigorous ride of a record that was a critical favorite last year.
Iyer will be competing against veteran saxophonist James Moody's "Moody 4B" and keyboardist John Beasley's "Positootly."
Shorty, a typical New Orleans favourite and frequent guest on HBO's "Treme," was honored in the contemporary jazz category, which otherwise tends towards fusion with references to albums by Stanley Clarke, John McLean and Jeff Lorber.
The wild, steampunk-informed Darcy James Argue's Secret Society earned some well deserved recognition in the large ensemble category, against the ever-adventant Dave Holland, whose ensemble's live album "Pathways" was a fine example of the democratic hand as a bandleader.
Grammy Awards nominations: Michael Daugherty, Steve Mackey lead classical categories
The classical nominations for the 53rd annual Grammy Awards feature a diverse mix of musicians and composers from around the world.
The nominations are for Michael Daugherty's "Deus Ex Machina," for piano and orchestra, with five nods, and Steve Mackey's "Dreamhouse," an eclectic orchestral work with three nods.
Another nominee with ties to Southern California is Estonian composer Arvo Pärt for his Symphony No 4, "Los Angeles," a piece that was commissioned by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and debuted at Walt Disney Concert Hall in 2009.
Also, composer Avner Dorman's Mandolin Concerto is up for a nomination.
Classical nominations are divided into 13 categories, covering orchestral, operatic and solo recordings.
The category for classical producer of the year features five nominees - Blanton Alspaugh, David Frost, Marina and Victor Ledin and James Mallinson.
The nominations for the classical album are Bruckner's Symphonies No. 3 and 4 from the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra; Mackey's "Dreamhouse" from the Boston Modern Orchestra Project and Synergy Vocals; Verdi's Requiem from the Chicago Symphony Orchestra and Chorus.
In the opera category, the nominees are Berg's "Lulu" from the Royal Opera House Orchestra; Adolf Hasse's "Marc Antonio e Cleopatra" from Ars Lyrica Houston; Rodion Shchedrin's "The Enchanted Wanderer" from the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra and Chorus; and Arthur Sullivan's "Ivanhoe" from the BBC National Orchestra of Wales.
Contemporary composers are Pärt for Symphony No. 4, Henze for "Appassionatamente Plus," Magnus Lindberg for "Graffiti" and Shchedrin for "The Enchanted Wanderer."
Symphony No. 4 was presented at Disney Hall in January 2009 in a performance recorded by the L.A. Philharmonic, conducted by Esa-Pekka Salonen.
The approximately 30-minute piece is called "Los Angeles" and is dedicated to former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is currently in Russia.
Dorman's "Mandolin Concerto" was nominated for instrumental soloist performance with orchestra.
The composer says that he wrote the 15-minute piece specifically for mandolin performer Avi Avital, who performs the concerto with the New York-based Metropolis Ensemble.
'I wrote it using Middle Eastern sounds and a lot of North African scales and rhythms', Dorman said.
Conductor Pierre Boulez, 85, received a nomination in the category of orchestral performance, for leading the Chicago Symphony in a recording of works by Stravinsky.
Instruments who received nominations include pianist Nelson Freire and Marc André Hamelin; organist Paul Jacobs; and harpist Sarah Schuster Ericsson.
Vocal-soloist nominees were all women this year, including Anne Sofie Von Otter, Cecilia Bartoli, Lucia Duchonová and Measha Brueggergosman.
In classical crossover category, soprano Jessye Norman received a nomination for her recording "Roots - My Life, My Song."
Proposed Temecula mosque wins planning commission approval
The proposed mosque in Temecula has received the unanimous support of the local planning commission after five hours of often heated public testimony.
Critics claimed the project as promoting both terrorism and traffic tieups.
The Commissioner rules Wednesday night that the new religious center complied with local laws and would be aesthetically pleasing.
'Many good people came to support it - Christians, Jews, Bahais, you name it'.
"I am proud to be an American citizen."
It shows that justice is always a priority.
The opposition is very minimal, he added.
"They just have very loud voices."
"We have beautiful people in this Valley."
The meeting started at 6 p.m. and lasted for nearly an hour, with most of the time spent speaking for or against the center, about evenly divided, according to the Press-Enterprise.
The debate continued on the newspaper's website.
There is no more America, wrote one comment.
It is another Planet of Apes with Miss Liberty dead in sand.
"America has fallen."
Planned Islamic centers have also been a cause for protests in other parts of the country, including near ground zero, the site of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York City.
In Temecula Valley, Imam Mahmoud Harmoush has denounced violence.
The group of about 135 families has co-existed without incident in Riverside County for years but wanted a bigger and better space than the warehouse it rented on a property shared with a water-filtration manufacturer.
The new 24,943 square foot mosque with Mediterranean-style architecture could include two minarets and rise as high as 43 feet.
It would occupy a 4.32-acre site on Nicolas Road about two miles east of Chaparral High School.
However, opposition can still appeal the project to the City Council.
Arsenic-tolerant microbe raise the possibility of new types of life on Earth or elsewhere.
The discovery of a strange bacteria that can use arsenic as one of its nutrients widens the possibility of finding new forms of life on Earth and possibly beyond.
The bacteria is a very unusual bacteria on Earth, and they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been considered essential.
This organism has dual capabilities.
"It can grow with either phosphorous or arsenic."
The findings are very peculiar, but they do not appear as a 'alien' life.
Six major elements have long been considered to be vital for life - carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur.
The researchers found that the bacteria, discovered in Mono Lake, Calif., is able to continue to grow after substituting arsenic for phosphorous.
The report makes you wonder what else is possible, says Ariel D. Anbar of Arizona State University, co-author of the report.
The find is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers need to recognise life, to know what life looks like, Anbar said.
The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth.
However, the announcement of a news conference to discuss it, which did not disclose details of the find, caused widespread speculation on Internet that the report would disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
It did not.
The discovery shows that in other planetary environments organisms may be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry, and that the standard set of elements we think are essential for life is not so fixed.
Cockell was not part of the research team.
This work is novel because it shows the substitution of one element for another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure.
It was not a chance discovery.
Female Wolfe-Simon of NASA's Astrobiology Institute, who led the study, targeted Mono Lake because it has high arsenic levels.
Arsenic and phosphorous are chemically similar, so she speculated that a microbe exposed to both might be able to replace one for the other.
Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is so similar to that of phosphorus.
"As a result, organisms have difficulty telling these elements apart.
However, arsenic is different enough to work as well as phosphorus, so it gets in there and gums up the work of our biochemical machinery.
The researchers collected the bacteria known as GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing concentrations of arsenic, which it adapted to and developed.
The microbe does grow better on phosphorous, but showing that it can live with arsenic raise the possibility of a life form using arsenic, either on Earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common.
Jamie S. Foster, an assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said the idea that arsenic could be substituted for phosphorous is not new, but there has never been an example where it worked.
Arsenic was more common on Earth, and researchers have speculated that early life forms may have used it.
However, it suggests that there are other ways to form life, not just how life formed on early Earth.
The research was supported by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institutes of Health.
Remaining stolen show dogs found in Compton
The remaining two of four show dogs stolen from a Bellflower motel have been found, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Office said Thursday.
The four show dogs - two Akitas and two Pembroke Welsh corgis - died Tuesday when someone stole the 2006 Chevrolet Express van they had spent the night in outside a Bellflower Motel 6, authorities said.
The two remaining canines were recovered Wednesday afternoon, and the remaining two were found late Wednesday evening, according to Steve Whitmore, a spokesman for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.
"Good news is that the dogs are fine," Whitmore said.
"They are good condition."
"They have been returned to their rightful owners."
Whitmore declined to describe where the dogs were found, in what neighborhood, and the circumstances surrounding their discovery.
There is an investigation going on.
"We do not want to say," Whitmore said.
"We are following leads."
The dogs owners, Kristina Rickard and David Peek, could not be contacted Thursday.
The two Akitas were reunited with their two Akitas at a County-run animal shelter in Downey on Wednesday afternoon.
Sheriff’s deputies found the van and two dogs separately in Compton.
The Akitas - Trace, a 3-year-old male, and Didi, a 10-month-old female - were without damage, authorities said.
However, Bunny and Peter, the corgis Rickard and Peek planned to show at area competitions this week for the Japanese owners, remained missing until they were discovered late Wednesday.
Trace and Rickard, who live in Redding, are in town for the AKC/Eukanuba National Championship in Long Beach this weekend.
Other dogs were expected to compete in other competitions scheduled in the days before the AKC/Eukanuba show, Peek told The Times on Wednesday.
Southern California is one stop on their annual tour of dog shows.
On Monday, Peek and Rickard checked into the motel.
The most common places they stay are hotels and park their van right outside their room window.
The dogs brought three other dogs - a Boxer puppy, a Parson Russell terrier and a Brittany - to stay with them in the motel room.
Then they left the thick-furred Akitas and corgis in the van where it would be cool.
Then they opened the windows a bit, so the dogs could get fresh air.
Peek and Rickard report the van stolen at 6 a.m. Tuesday.
They had announced that they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis, which are implanted with microchips to identify them.
It was unclear Thursday if an award would be given.
Lion ready to roar again as MGM restructuring gets final court go-ahead
After 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty, MGM has finally got the green light to start anew.
The New York federal bankruptcy judge on Thursday officially blessed the "pre-packaged" plan by creditors to wipe off about $5 billion in debt, allowing the company to focus its efforts on producing and releasing movies and television shows.
The Supreme Court rules that the plan meets the requirements of the U.S. bankruptcy code, no more legal obstacles remain for MGM to relaunch under Spyglass Entertainment founders Gary Barber and Roger Birnbaum, who will become chief executives of what will be a slimmed-down studio.
Recruiting staff will drop to about 320 from over 400.
MGM will not actually emerge from Chapter 11 until JPMorgan Chase closes its $500-million loan facility to fund the new MGM's operations and production.
It is currently syndicated by the investment bank - which is itself kicking in $75 million - and is expected to be funded by mid-December.
The restructuring process started in May 2009, when investment bank Moelis & Co. was hired to advise management on how to fix its finances as it was struggling to afford interest payments of $300 million per year.
The August, Chief Executive Harry Sloan was replaced by Stephen Cooper, a former CEO of Enron and a turnaround expert known for his work at Krispy Kreme Doughnuts.
Both Moelis and Cooper's efforts to resolve MGM's financial problems and satisfy the studio's 140-plus creditors took much longer than expected.
After several months of discussions, the parties agreed to sell the company.
The auction attracted few bidders and no one willing to pay the $2 billion-plus that creditors were seeking.
Then in spring of this year, the MGM team started working on a restructuring plan that, after months of internal debate and internal disagreements, was finally endorsed by the creditors in late October.
When MGM officially emerges from bankruptcy in the coming weeks, Moelis and Cooper's firms will receive multimillion dollar bonuses for their work.
Moelis & Co., which has already received $1.2 million, will get a $9.5-million payment.
Cooper's firms, which have been collecting $375,000 per month for their services running the company, will receive a $4-million "success fee."
Barber and Birnbaum plan to re-start production at MGM, which released only one movie this year, and a yearly slate of seven or eight films that will start in 2012.
The two films are planned to be based on "The Hobbit" with Warner Bros.
The studio must close a separate loan of between $265 million and $275 million to fund its portion of those two movies, which are to be produced by Peter Jackson.
Icahn, who owns about 18% of MGM's debt, has been seeking to arrange a merger of the studio with Lions Gate Entertainment, in which he is the largest shareholder.
However, recent talks between the two companies have not resulted in a deal.
Tech Toys to Keep Your Gift Budget in Balance
The most marvelous toy of the year is the iPad, followed by Microsoft Kinect video game system.
Imagine that for one iPad you can buy five $99 BMX bikes, and that one Kinect game costs about $48 bottles of Play-Doh.
There are ways to keep your gift budget balanced.
Recently I visited three national toy sellers - a Wal-Mart, Toys "R Us and BJ's Wholesale Club - to see what electronic toys I could buy for less than $80.
The immediately appeared that Moore's Law has been working, and this year's technology toy is likely to have more power, but costing less than last year's.
In addition, while there are generally fewer new toys with Web sites, two of the most well-known of this type, Webkinz and Club Penguin, have more options.
And button-cell powered toys are increasing, as well as toys with rechargeable batteries.
Here are some recommendations.
(All prices are from Toys R Us, except if otherwise noted.)
Sing-a-ma-jigs (Mattel, $13, for ages 3 and up) are guinea pig-sized plush toys that sing a note when you squeeze their belly.
One squeeze equals one note, and a second squeeze starts building a song.
If you buy more than one, they will sing in harmony.
Caution: Once you start squeezing, you cannot stop.
For singing combined with dancing, Dance Star Mickey (Fisher-Price, $65, for ages 2 and up) is the best choice.
The 14-inch animatronic doll plays turn-taking games like Simon Says, and can moon walk thanks to his innovative hinged feet with locking wheels.
Children testing the toy used Mickey as a dance teacher, but their parents complained about the lack of volume control.
If you are a child of the 1980s, you may remember Alphie, one of the first computer-controlled education toys.
The Quiz Card Backpack is back, (Hasbro/Playskool, $40, for ages 3 and up), with a backpack full of quiz cards designed to turn a car ride into a self-correcting, wisecracking workbook.
If you are hesitant to hand your child your smartphone, here are three alternatives.
VTech's MobiGo ($60, for ages 3 to 12) is the cheapest and most effective for children, with a newer, brighter screen.
No version is compatible with old cartridges.
Fisher-Price's iXL ($90, for ages 3 to 7) uses an iTunes-like system to deliver games and e-books, and has a SD card slot that allows family photos to be displayed.
Then Scrabble Flash ($30, Hasbro, for ages 8 and up) is a set of five blocks that are larger than a book of matches, each with its own LED screen.
The goal is to make words by placing the blocks in a row before time runs out; it's great for an informal spelling contest.
In recent years, toys have some sort of online connection.
Based on their presence in toy stores alone, the two most important are Webkinz and Club Penguin.
Then you can buy your child an online pet in Club Penguin, for example, you can get a Disney Club Penguin 2" Mix 'N Match Figure Pack, $5, for ages 6 to 12) that includes a coin with a secret code.
When you redeem the code online, your child is given enough credits in the Club Penguin store for any two items.
These may include roller skates or a pet Puffle toy.
Hexbug Nano ($10, for ages 5 and up) is the latest in a line of button-cell-powered micro-robots.
The fake bug moves quickly on 12 vibrating silicon legs, in random directions.
It is fun to make a maze out of blocks to see if it can get through.
It is also very durable.
Ours was able to drop off the kitchen table and even spend some time inside our dog's mouth.
Bringing a Softer Side to Policing in China
Like a city drill sergeant, Tang Shenbin kept his nervous strains, issuing stealthy commands with military authority.
The female members of chengguan - China's burly enforcer of urban order, feared and despised for their capricious crackdowns and violence - wanted to convey a certain impression to a clutch of observers.
"Stand straight!"
"Look sharp!"
Show them, he sighed, "what pretty girls are like!"
Four bare-past-teenage girls in white gloves and identical olive jackets and pants snapped to attention.
Four pairs of black pumps lined up ruler-straight.
Four prim hats perched perfectly on the hair bound in blue and white striped bows.
"Personally, I think they are average-looking," Mr. Tang said, without a laugh.
"Models are pretty."
More than one government has tried to brush up the image of China's urban inspectors.
One city mandated that all new recruits have a college degree.
Guangdong Province changed the gray-green uniforms to a supposedly more inviting blue.
officers in Wuhan, central China, substituted stare-downs for strong-arming: in 2009, one report reported, 50 officers encircled a wayward snack cart, glowing steadily for half an hour until the peddler packed up and left.
Xindu, an urban district with 680,000 in Chengdu, has chosen major image surgery.
Since 2003, the district has supplemented its urban street police with 13 women, specifically selected for their looks, shapeliness and youth.
The idea is to give the rough-hewn police a softer, feminine side.
However, even Scarlett Johansson might not be able to raise China's subterranean appreciation for these city squads.
And good reason, critics would argue.
They are authorised only to enforce city ordinances by making fines and other administrative penalties.
The Chinese news media routinely portray a different reality.
In January 2008, Hubei Province inspectors beat a bystander after he used his cellphone to film them breaking a protest against a dump.
The training manual for Beijing inspectors, which was found and posted online, describes how to effectively thrash offenders without drawing blood.
This year, a Shanghai watermelon peddler was left brain-damaged after a scuffle with five officers.
One violent video game, available online, features Chinese trained inspectors who assault street vendors.
"Chengguan has scared the government," China Daily, a national publication, lamented last year after yet another controversy over tactics.
The paper asked for a "truly thorough cleanup."
Skeptics say the approach here is far short of that.
After the district advertised for eight new women recruits in October, an editorial in The Beijing Evening News questioned whether the women had actual duties or were simply scenic diversions.
The answer seems to be a little of both.
The district advertisement called for women 18 to 22 years old, good figure and "the five facial features in proper order."
They should be above average height - taller than 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 1⁄2 inches.
Retirement at age 26 is mandatory.
Officials said the job was too physically arduous for women over 25 years of age.
"Their image is important," one unnamed district official told Rednet.com, a quasi-governmental Web site.
First, the candidates' external qualities will determine if they make the cut, such as height, weight, face features, etc.
Next come temperament and "inner qualities."
Female chengguan are like flower vases, he said, adding, "They will have other responsibilities.
Zheng Lihua, the deputy director of the district's city management bureau, is not keen to endorse that description.
The height requirements were standard in many Chinese job advertisements for both sexes.
So is the demand for orderly face features.
The debate is among Chinese.
However, the disabled or disfigured need not apply.
'We cannot allow a lame person or hunchback to come to serve here', Mr Zheng said.
"His image would not be good."
Liu Yi, who patrols the Baoguang Square near a monastery, is 22, apple-cheeked with fine curved mouth.
She does not consider the stress on her appearance to be sexist, she said.
"Do you think I look sexy in this uniform?" she asked with a wry look.
According to her fellow worker, 21-year-old Xu Yang, "Our job is to present the city's image.
They do not object to their limited tenure, because they have career ambitions higher than simply driving vendors into the alleyways where they are supposed to confine their business.
Every morning, the squad faces off against a dozen or so peddlers who ramble around on foot or bicycle, trying to sell as many buns or bowls of tofu as possible before they are taken off.
"Master Wang, you have to leave."
"We have told you many times!" she told the vendor as he took off on foot, temporarily deserting his bicycle-drawn cart of noodle-fixings.
The officers describe their duties as more monotonous than intensive.
"It is pretty much the same every day," said Huang Jing, 20, who studies marketing in her off hours.
"Very routine."
One reason is that women officers have less power than male counterparts to confiscate vendors' goods.
The only way they can report violators to their male supervisors is to report them to their male supervisors.
It protects them from sudden public displays of animosity against officialdom that are common throughout China.
This year hundreds of citizens in Kunming, Yunnan province, rioted after false rumors that chengguan officers had killed a vendor.
More than dozen police or chengguan officers were injured in the nighttime episode; 14 government vehicles were damaged or set on fire.
Xindu has already escaped such violence.
Calm is hardly guaranteed.
Then two blocks from the lovely Baoguang Square, where the women officers patrol that morning, more than 50 people gathered on a street corner.
Officers confiscated a motorcycle that was repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside a shop, as regulations require.
The bike owner was crying.
The 15-minute standoff followed before the officers, grim-faced, took off with the motorcycle and its owner.
Li Xuedong, 40, a coordinator attached to the male squad, remained behind, his white badge shifted over to conceal his name.
Like the women officers, the coordinators - men age 40 or over - play a purely supportive role.
They are not trained in maintaining a clean image.
"Sometimes we fight verbally."
"Sometimes we fight physically," Mr. Li said.
Most of the time it is the public who starts it.
Attorneys will not charge Senator Ensign
Justice Department prosecutors have cleared Senator John Ensign of criminal charges arising from his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to secure lobbying work for the woman's husband, the senator's lawyers announced Wednesday.
The decision ends the most serious legal threat to Mr. Ensign, the Nevada Republican who was considered a possible Republican presidential candidate in 2012, until his affair took national headlines last year and damaged his career.
Ensign's office said he was "surely pleased" with the decision, which followed a yearlong investigation.
The senator may still face disciplinary action by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Senator Ensign's lawyers said the Justice Department has "informed us that Senator Ensign is no longer a target of its investigation and that it has no plans to bring any charges against him in this matter."
The Justice Department declined to comment on the case.
The announcement came as a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the Justice Department, who said there seemed to be significant evidence to indicate that Mr. Ensign may have conspired to violate a federal lobbying ban.
Interviews, email and other documents first disclosed in October 2009 in The New York Times indicate that Mr. Ensign helped Douglas Hampton, who was one of his aides, secure lucrative lobbying work to keep the silence of Mr. Hampton and his wife, Cynthia, about the senator's affair with her.
Hampton was once a treasurer of an Ensign campaign.
Hampton contacted several political backers to find work for Mr. Ensign and then advocated on their behalf after they hired Mr. Hampton to lobby for them, according to the documents and interviews.
Because Mr. Hampton recently worked as an aide to Mr. Ensign, he was barred by law from lobbying his former employer or the Senate as a whole for a year.
 Ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between Mr. Ensign and Mr. Hampton, who were close friends before the affair, appeared to contradict the so-called revolving door lobbying ban.
The evidence has been made public, "there seems to be a prima facie case of a conspiracy to violate, and substantial violation of the revolving door statute," according to Stanley Brand, a Washington lawyer who specializes in defending clients investigated by the government.
While Justice Department officials declined to explain the reason for the decision in the Ensign case, Mr. Brand and other ethics lawyers believed the department was hesitant to take on political prosecutions after a number of high profile setbacks for its public integrity section, including the decision last year to drop the prosecution against former Senator Ted Stevens on charges of prosecutorial misconduct.
Chief Advocate of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a group that brought several complaints against Mr. Ensign in the case.
According to the report, high-ranking government officials can now assume the law is not applicable to them, she added.
Paul Coggins, Mr Ensign's lead lawyer, said in an interview that he received a phone call from a Justice Department prosecutor on Monday and follow-up the next day, telling him that the department was not seeking charges against his client.
Senator Ensign's defense team has been working with the Attorney General in trying to persuade them that the senator, as his office reiterated in a statement Wednesday, "acted in accordance with the law."
Coggins declined to explain the legal arguments he made to the judges.
However, I am not comfortable going into details of my discussions with the Justice Department except to say that we think they made the right decision.
The Federal Election Commission has decided to drop an investigation into a separate complaint by the Ethics Group alleging that a $96,000 payment from Mr Ensign's parents to the Hamptons violated federal election law.
The election commission said it has no evidence to prove the money was anything but a gift.
One company for which Mr. Ensign helped Mr. Hampton find lobbying work was NV Energy, a major Nevada company that had long supported the senator.
One email sent in December 2008 shows that after the company brought Mr. Hampton on as a lobbyist, Mr. Ensign's staff, John Lopez, communicated with Mr. Hampton and told him that he was "pounding" the Interior Department over a dispute.
Hampton also attended a lunch with Mr. Ensign and another Nevada client, Allegiant Air, and called the Transportation Secretary to set up a meeting on the airline's behalf.
The affair first surfaced last year, Mr. Ensign apologised to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth ranked Republican leader in the Senate.
After keeping low profile for many months, Mr. Ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he planned to run for a second term in the Senate.
In announcing that Mr Ensign was no longer the target of a criminal investigation, the senator asked the Ethics Committee to follow the Justice Department's lead and end its investigation.
Senator Ensign is looking forward to continuing his hard work for the people of Nevada, she said.
Cheshire Appeal Will Point to Twitter
There were half a dozen of them typing away in the courtroom rows.
Minutes by minutes, they sent out reports of ugly testimony via Twitter.
In the end, the defense says, there were more than 140,000 Twitter messages about the trial that involved rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was set ablaze.
The trial of Steven J. Hayes, who was convicted of killing three members of a Cheshire, Conn., family, is set to officially end with the judge's upon-death sentence voted for by the jury.
The lawyers for Mr. Hayes have already made court filings that sketch appeals arguments that will occupy the court for years.
The most provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - including mainstream reporters' extensive use of Twitter - caused such a huge, instant saturation with inflammatory details that the jury was unnecessarily swayed by public passions.
The claim could force appeals judges to consider whether new technology requires new courtroom rules.
While I have experienced it in this trial, I think there is a real risk that new technology is affecting an individual's fair-trial rights.
The trial judge, Jon C. Blue of State Superior Court, rejected the claims in his last week's ruling, which says the news media were carefully controlled and there is no evidence the jury was driven by passion.
The last word on the issue is not likely.
The courts have recognized that coverage of notorious cases can raise questions about fairness of a trial.
In an iconic 1966 decision, the United States Supreme Court reversed the conviction of a Cleveland osteopath, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, because of the news media.
The crime is believed to have been the inspiration for the television show and movie "The Fugitive."
Some lawyers believe that appeals courts reviewing Mr. Hayes' conviction half a century later may be interested by the argument that new rules could govern ways of communicating from courtrooms unimagined at the time of Dr. Sheppard's case.
The general concern is about the impact of new media in high-profile trials, which was reported to be arbitrarily enforced.
Professor Donohue said some appeals judges may be interested by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms might make trials fairer.
The Twitter issue is just one of many outlined by Mr. Hayes' lawyers that are likely to be argued for years, delaying an execution.
The defense lawyers also claim that Mr. Hayes may have been prejudiced by allowing them to test potential jurors' reactions by showing them grisly crime scene photographs during jury selection.
The jury has reported that they were horrified by the photographs of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11.
The defense lawyers say they will also challenge the death penalty and argue that the judge misused a juror who was critical of prosecutors and that he misused the jury to deliberate over a weekend.
They were not sequested.
Their arguments about the effect of the intense coverage of the trial may attract the most interest.
The challenge to the verdict was filed last month in a challenge to the verdict filed last month in a challenge to the verdict filed last month in a challenge to the verdict filed last month in the case of the Connecticut case dominating the news in Connecticut and was discussed during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the United States Senate.
The authors argued that the news media continuously flame the emotion about the case.
The daily crush of media tweets, cameras and reporters outside the courthouse was unlike any previously seen here in New Haven or statewide.
Their focus on Twitter coverage is controversial.
In interviews, some journalists said the claim that instant news was more incendiary than reports delivered more slowly would make poor court policy governing future trials.
The lawyers said appeals courts often attracted arguments that social and technological change required adaptation by the courts.
Attorneys are pressing that claim.
In their brief, they referred to the 1966 decision overturning Dr. Sheppard's conviction because of the trial coverage and made clear that the new media required new rules.
This case, they wrote, "represents the Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century."
civility bridges divide?
After a significant campaign for invective and negativity, a modest amount of civility has broken out in Washington this week.
It is a warning of genuine bipartisan cooperation or an illusory moment before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital?
However, Tuesday’s meeting between President Obama and congressional leaders produced no breakthroughs on the major issues that must be addressed during the lame-duck session.
It was at least a polite discussion of the two sides' differences as well as acknowledgement of their common responsibilities to govern.
The public meeting of the President's deficit commission was equally civilized, despite the policy differences among the members.
It seems clear that close interaction over a period of months produced mutual respect that transcends the ideological barrier still between the members.
It is hard to declare that a new era of cooperation has come.
Both sides are now in a period of testing - probing one another for cooperativeness and compromise, while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and voter patience for renewed partisan warfare.
The meeting on Tuesday and the participants' reviews after it were done with no demands or accusations.
The philosophical differences between Obama and the Republicans are too large and too deep to suggest any quick change in the climate that has been established in the past two years.
Taxes, spending, health care or benefits are miles apart.
Still, the November election has tempered Washington, at least for a short term.
The tone of things has changed, says Pete Wehner, a Bush administration official now with Ethics and Public Policy Center.
"Those are inevitable after elections.
Elections cause partisan passions, and then they die.
That is good.
On some issues, particularly those on the agenda for the lame-duck session, Republicans and Democrats have no choice but to find a solution.
The Bush tax cuts expire at the end of the year, and nobody favors that.
Both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of them, permanently or temporarily.
Similarly, compromise is likely on extending unemployment benefits, if only because Republicans cannot afford to look like they support tax cuts for the rich and denying unemployment workers unemployment compensation.
After Tuesday’s meeting at the White House, there is more optimism for a deal on these issues during the lame duck session, along with ratification of the New START pact.
The Brookings Institution says that successful cooperation on the pressing issues of the lame-duck session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th Congress convenes in January.
Instead, he said, a period of disagreement is likely, even inevitable.
After things that have to get done get done, the short term psychology will revert to one of confrontation, he added.
Wehner also expressed skepticism - which is widely shared - that civility will lead to real cooperation.
Currently, most of what happens between now and 2012 is shadow boxing to the main event in 2012.
The reasons are related to the makeup of the new Republican majority in the House and the tea party voters who played a role in creating it.
However mindful Republican leaders are of the dangers of overplaying their hand, they must try to live up to their promise to cut government spending and repeal the new health care law.
The partisan lines are already clear in the initial reactions to the deficit commission recommendations, which include reforming the tax code and raising some taxes, raising the retirement age and reducing spending.
They have taken on one of the most difficult jobs in Washington and have, in their own estimation, forced the issue of the deficit into the public agenda in ways that cannot be ignored.
The plan needs 14 votes on the 18-member Commission to be officially approved, and they have been struggling to get close to that number.
The most resistance is among the elected officials on the panel, suggesting that on fiscal issues there is no reason for or desire for compromise.
Galston predicts two phases in the fight between the White House and congressional Republicans.
The first will occur next year in form of partisan clashes, as Republicans challenge Obama on the budget, taxes and health care, followed by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation.
What would cause the shift?
Public opinion.
The evidence is considerable that, despite the recent political interference, a majority of Americans still want to see the two parties work together.
If confrontation leads to stalemate, as it happened in 1995, both parties will be careful to watch the public reaction.
Whoever is judged to be losing is likely to change course and seek compromise.
It may be an optimistic view.
Partisanship and polarization are increasing today than they were in mid-1990s, and there seems to be a bigger ideological gap between Obama and congressional Republicans than there was between Bill Clinton and the Republicans then.
However, both parties see 2010 as a prelude to a more consequential election in 2012.
Given that reality, civility on display this week may be welcomed by many Americans.
It will take much more effort from both sides to find common ground on the issues that still divide them.
The leaked US document shows Moscow as a haven of corruption
The city is in the hands of a "kleptocracy," and it takes a part of the bribes and protection money it collects to the Kremlin, the US Embassy in Russia reported in a memo in February.
Both the police and the Federal Security Service run large protection rackets that help account for the high cost of living in Moscow, it said.
They collect money not only from legitimate businesses but also from organized criminal groups.
The each layer of the bureaucracy - which Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of authority" - gets its cut as money moves up the ladder.
The letter, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted by WikiLeaks on its Web site Wednesday.
The memo is based on sources whose names have been redacted.
The book was written while Yuri Luzhkov was still Moscow's mayor, and it blames him for much of the corruption.
The prison was closed in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there has been no evidence of cleanup since then.
Luzhkov and his wife, Yelena Baturina, who owns a prominent construction firm, have consistently denied corruption accusations over the years, and has won several libel suits over such accusations.
In September he told a Russian television station, when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt: "It is mad, filth, a mess."
Russians overwhelmingly believe that they are a corrupt society, polling has shown.
It is rare to find the details as they were in the report, and it is unusual to find diplomats from a foreign country doing so.
The Moscow city government's direct links to crime have led some to call it 'dysfunctional' and to assert that the government operates more as kleptocracy than as a government.
"Criminal elements enjoy a 'krysha' (a term from criminal/mafia world literally meaning a roof or protection) that runs through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), Internal Affairs (MVD), and the prosecutor's office, as well throughout the Moscow city government bureaucracy.
"Analysts identify a three-tier structure in Moscow's criminal world."
"Luzhkov is at the top."
The FSB, MVD and militia are at second level.
Finally, ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.
This is an inefficient system, where criminal groups fill voids in some areas because the city is not providing any services.
The report says that the FSB takes money from the biggest firms, and that the police target small businesses.
One source, explained that Moscow business owners understand that they are better protected by the MVD and FSB, because they not only have more guns, resources, and power than organized crime groups, but they are also protected by the law.
Because of this, protection from criminal gangs is no longer so high in demand.
The memo notes that, while the collection of money is comprehensive, the protection of those who pay can be spotty, even those who pay are sometimes arrested.
The people who do not pay quickly shut down their businesses on one or another pretext.
Medvedev has talked several times about fighting corruption but has admitted that he has little progress.
The embassy memo reports men taking suitcases, probably stuffed with cash, into the Kremlin itself.
In his fight against corruption, Medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats, Georgy Satarov, Director of Indem, said in an interview.
"But he is part of this bureaucracy."
"He is not part of a political class, because political class is not existing in Russia anymore."
Without politics, without opposition, without a separate power, corruption is inevitable.
In Russia, Indem estimates that corruption costs Russia $300 billion a year.
The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on global perceptions of corruption by the nongovernmental organization Transparency International (countries are ranked from least to most corrupt).
The disclosure of the US Embassy memo, which occurred late evening Moscow time, is sure to stir displeasure in the Russian government, but to the extent that Luzhkov can be blamed for Moscow's failings, it might be an opportunity for the Kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem.
Larry King interviewed Putin for CNN by Larry King, Putin suggested that WikiLeaks documents may be fabrications and reacted angryly to disclosure that US diplomats had called him Batman to Medvedev's Robin.
The truth of the matter is, this is about our interaction, which is a key factor of domestic policy in this country.
However, to be honest with you, we did not suspect that this would be done with such arrogance, such push and, you know, so unethically done.
Khmer Rouge veterans forced to confront past
In a dimly lighted concrete classroom with smudged and peeling walls, the principal of Anlong Veng High School remembered the man who built it, the late Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok.
"Everyone here loves Ta Mok."
"He was a good leader, and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42.
The commander is still popular in this remote former Khmer Rouge stronghold in northwestern Cambodia, where he built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure and where thousands of the organization's former soldiers still live.
This year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge took the government, long held loyalties are finally challenged in Anlong Veng.
In April, a local truth and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront people who participated in the regime.
In June, the government distributed a high school textbook that first teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to children of its former soldiers.
In July, a joint U.N. and Cambodian tribunal handed out its first conviction of a former Khmer Rouge member, which sentenced the onetime head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as Duch, to 35 years in prison.
With each development, anxiety has grown among Anlong Veng's Khmer Rouge veterans, complicating reconciliation and reintegration into Cambodian society.
The former Khmer Rouge is a threat to any action, but they are unable to do anything.
Their life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious, but the regime has become a symbol of evil.
"It is creating divisions within families."
During the Khmer Rouge rule of Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died from starvation, disease or overwork.
The Vietnamese invaded and toppled the Pol Pot-led government in 1979, and the remaining military moved to Cambodia's border with Thailand.
Then they launched an insurgency that lasted until the last of the movement capitulated in December 1998.
As Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary directed the guerrilla war from their bases in western Cambodia, Ta Mok cultivated a following in Anlong Veng.
In mid-1990s, after a U.N.-sponsored peace agreement led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to withdraw from the government, resulting in the release of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998.
Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998, and Ta Mok, who had held out, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby Dangrek Mountains.
The man died in a Phnom Penh prison in 2006 while waiting for trial.
With no more donors providing for them, most former Khmer Rouge fighters have fallen into the grinding poverty common in rural Cambodia, and many remain nostalgic for the movement.
Although some elite Khmer Rouge officials kept their local government posts in exchange for laying down their arms, the rank and file remain poor, untrained farmers.
These people have little benefit after the surrender, according to Sok Leang of the Center for Justice and Reconciliation, which holds public forums throughout Cambodia, including in Anlong Veng.
"They are embedded with the utopian agrarian ideology of the regime."
"They were brought up with no concept of doing business."
Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a young teenager in 1974, lived in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settle into a poor rice farmer in 1998.
"Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said.
Ta Mok fed everyone.
"But now life is difficult because we have to provide for ourselves."
The current Khmer Rouge tribunal has also caused concerns here.
Early next year, the court is expected to begin trying Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan and his wife Ieng Thirith.
The court's mandate is to prosecute senior leaders and those most responsible for crimes, but it has not given any details on whether it will pursue cases beyond those four.
This has done little to calm fears in Anlong Veng.
Recent media speculation has focused on Im Chaem, 64, who was a district chief in Banteay Meanchey province in the late 1970s.
In 2007, she told researchers from the Documentation Center of Cambodia that she supervised construction of the Trapeang Thma dam, a project where thousands of forced laborers died.
In a recent evening, Im Chaem returned from working in the field to her wooden stilt house on the dirt road outside Anlong Veng.
As the sun spread long shadows across the parched grass, Im Chaem declined to discuss her past in the Khmer Rouge.
If the court summoned her, she said she would not go.
"Cambodia is peace and stable," she said.
If more prosecutions occur, there will be war.
Chief Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that stability will occur if the court pursue more suspects, although experts and historians dispute that.
"Cambodia must dig a hole and bury the past," he has said.
However, confronting past is what Cambodia must do to move forward, said Chhang Youk of the documentation centre.
"Reconciliation in Khmer terms is reconnecting the broken pieces," he said.
It is our obligation to put these broken pieces together so that we can understand.
The center produced the first government-approved textbook about the Khmer Rouge, the 75-page "A History of Democratic Kampuchea."
It was distributed in Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the Education Ministry's high school history textbook, which has less than four pages about the Khmer Rouge.
As in most Cambodia, Anlong Veng's young people do not know much about the Khmer Rouge, despite the town's connection to the regime.
Touch Valeak, 19, a student at Anlong Veng High School, said the new textbook was a good way to learn about their history.
The parents react with skepticism when he took the book home to study.
"My family rejects many parts of the textbook and the tribunal," he said.
The court is suspicious because they are not sure how many people the court will prosecute.
The resistance has made the process complex and difficult, Sok Leang said.
The public forums, the textbook and the tribunal are beginning to have impact, he said.
Still, the Khmer Rouge remains powerful in this region.
Up in Dangrek Mountains, a path overgrown with weeds and strewn with discarded plastic bags leads to a rectangle of black soot covered by a rusted tin roof.
Pol Pot's body was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998.
Nuom Sothea, 31, a roadside cellphone vendor, said she did not know much about the man who was cremated there.
The spirit of the Holy Spirit is strong, and many local people go to him to pray to him.
It was Nuom Sothea's birthday, and later on she planned to walk to Pol Pot's final resting place, where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing good luck.
Belarus agrees to give up its stock of weapons-grade uranium
In a surprise victory for President Obama's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide, Belarus announced Wednesday that it will give up its stock of highly enriched uranium, a key component of nuclear weapons.
The deal was disclosed in a joint statement issued after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met with Belarusan Foreign Minister Sergei Martynov on the sidelines of a security summit in Belarus.
The US government has been trying for years to persuade Belarus to give up its highly enriched uranium, and seems to have hit a roadblock last spring.
The Washington Post reported that two classified operations have been carried out with Belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapon-grade uranium from a Belarusan research facility.
The agreement set the stage for Wednesday's agreement to remove the rest of the material - about 500 pounds, according to one official who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the matter.
The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of Obama's 47-nation Nuclear Security Summit in April, which excluded Belarus.
The summit was apparently good enough to secure the former Soviet republic's invitation to the followup summit, in 2012.
"I was really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the 2012 Nuclear Security Summit."
The process is working, and I believe it is working.
Clinton called the agreement "a very important, important step" by Belarus.
According to Obama, all vulnerable nuclear material around the world will be secured within four years.
Since then, the US government has helped six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium.
Belarus would be the seventh.
A dozen countries did so under the George W. Bush administration.
At the time of Obama's Nuclear Security Summit, Belarusan President Alexander Lukashenko had declared that the country would never give up its uranium.
They have kept highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of weapons-grade and lower-enriched uranium.
This is our commodity... We are not going to make dirty bombs, and we will not sell it to anybody.
"We are using it for research purposes, is all."
Belarus approached the United States a few months ago, but indicate interest in reaching an agreement.
The first effort to remove Belarus's uranium, in October, was particularly difficult because the material was slightly irradiated, officials said.
It was loaded on a special train that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a Russian facility for storage and disposal, officials said.
The second operation ended Monday and was done by air, according to the officials.
The US government spent $13 million on the effort, mostly to provide Belarus's research facility with low-enriched uranium, which is not suitable for nuclear weapons.
The collaboration and orchestration of this agreement led to the signing of the agreement by Clinton, which was very carefully coordinated and orchestrated to build the trust that led to the signing of the agreement.
James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies estimates this year that Belarus had at least 88 pounds of weapon-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of pounds of highly enriched uranium.
Belarus will aim to eliminate its stockpile by 2012, according to the joint statement.
Belarus and the United States have been strained for years, mainly because of Lukashenko's harsh repression of human rights.
Wednesday's statement suggests a potential increase.
While progress on these global security issues is being made, the United States and Belarus recognised that enhancing democracy and human rights in Belarus is essential to the country's progress and its citizens' progress.
The Spanish Government did not raise objections to the CIA flights.
The Spanish Government did not raise objections to the CIA with Taliban prisoners and Al Qaeda that were going to Guantánamo via Spanish territory, according to the USA ambassador in Madrid's telegram.
The following is reflected in the filtered documents (cables) by Wikileaks to the newspaper El País, where it is added that the first Vice President of the Government at that time, Maria Teresa Fernandez of the Vega, asked the Executive to inform the Executive in order to ensure that they had carried out appropriate monitoring procedures on foreign aircraft that cross Spain.
In June 2006, after a report of the European Council about the complicity in human rights practices in dozen countries, among which Spain, a meeting took place between the ex-North American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernandez de la Vega.
The Vice President recognised that the report had taken the Government of Zapatero outside the game and stressed that Spain had no secrets about this matter.
"De Vega stressed that Spain does not raise objection to the intelligence flights over Spanish territory."
The people simply want to be informed to prevent being "caught by surprise" in a telegram.
Also the ex-Minister of External Affairs, Miguel Angel Moratinos, told the ambassador that the Executive wanted to give this issue as little attention as possible, although being in the hands of the judges, the Government had limited influence.
In January 2007, the public prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy that he would not try to block the initiative of the judge of requesting the declassification of documents of the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and of the Ministry of Defense regarding the company's flights.
This information is not incriminating or any sensitive information, explained the Embassy after speaking with the public prosecutor.
The USA reported on its concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and German public prosecutors" more than the declassified information of the CNI or the Defense ministry.
The coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle discreetly the case between Governments, says Aguirre.
In March 2007 during a lunch with the USA ambassador and minister of Internal Affairs, Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba, this one commented to him that " although the Spanish judges are rabidly jealous of their independence and will do what they consider to be right, he had given instructions to his collaborators to avoid commentaries of inflamed rhetoric in order to reduce the temperature."
The ambassador also expressed his concern for the action of the PP in this matter.
In spite his general pro American orientation, our experience suggests that the PP will not doubt in capitalizing any evidence that the Government of Zapatero tolerated or deliberately ignored USA action that could be interpreted as possible human rights violations, even if the revelations have negative consequences for the USA Government.
The parricide complained of the burden of being a mother.
The young woman spoke of the baby when he was already dead and she kept a blog: "Terror of the Galician"
Mónica Juanatey Fernandez is "Muki" in the network.
With this nickname, she has communicated with a cousin and at least one friend, both from Noia, Corua where she was born.
The messages are from 2008.
In order to understand them, it is essential to know the personal life that ABC reconstructs through her relatives' testimonials.
The young woman from Galicia, 30 years old, initiated a relationship in 1998 with Iván Túñez, an industrialist.
This affair lasted one year.
Then they decided to split, soon after they found out that she was pregnant.
The pregnancy was his, but his ex never allowed him to take the DNA test.
After that she found someone else.
The man she chose was Alberto, a man from Lousame, a neighboring municipality.
She remained with him for a long period of time.
Caesar lived with them.
The girl went to the Balearic Islands to test the labor market, and the child stayed with her aunt for one week in Palma.
The content of her messages shows that they have ended, it has been broken up.
In March in Menorca, single, she writes: "Alberto is very weird and upset, because I have come here to work.
When I told him this he seemed to be happy, sure, but now he realizes how hard it is to stay with the child all day long and not have the freedom to do what he wants.
Then she talks about a message received on her mobile phone that reads: "I want you to come this month or give me an address to which I can send you the child."
If he doesn't like leaving the child with my mother, I will take him when I get back.
In May she talks about her return to town: "I will go there this week, but I will only stay until the 19th, because on the 20th I must present myself at work.
She clarifies that if everything goes well, she will keep her firstborn child.
Then he will stay with whom he must stay, meaning with me and I will never ever leave him with anybody else except my mother.
In July, there is another post.
Then she writes it, it is assumed that the boy, who arrived at the island on 1st of that month and supposedly was assassinated on 10th, is already dead.
"Caesar is in contentment on one hand, but not on the other hand."
On one hand he is with me and he likes the location, but on the other hand he is going to classes almost every day.
She talks about a transfer to Mallorca.
"He will go to summer classes there, and thus I can save some money."
On 17th, there are memories and complaints.
"Hugs from Caesar, who asked me when you'll come back."
"Alberto says that he sent I do not know what videos to email and as you can see when he wants he can find me."
On the 30th, another one: "The boy is well, he goes to summer classes to learn Catalan.
Victor has one phrase: "He gives me money."
On the Internet there are messages of her in blogs dedicated to animation.
Then she even had a personal MySpace universe, where she called herself "Muki the ex prisoner."
"Terror of Galician woman (inscription)."
The last man who lived with her declares his grief for feeling guilty.
The man does not want to think that everything has happened for not having told him that she was a single mother.
Mónica enters yesterday in the provincial prison of Palm, coming from the center of judicial prisoners of Menorca.
Carlos Maceda, the appointed lawyer, explained that he does not know how the facts occurred, nor that he intentionally caused any minor pain.
Before she confessed that she had drowned Caesar in the bathtub and deposited his body in a suitcase.
The defence and the public prosecutor requested a psychiatric test.
The popular would gain 4 seats in the Congress and the PSC would lose 9 seats.
With the results of the 28-N, the PP could be decisive in the municipalities of Lérida, Tarragona and Barcelona.
After the important increase in the votes and experienced deputy in recent Catalan elections, the Catalan PP is already thinking about the general elections, which are usually double the number of votes received in the Catalan elections.
The popular Catalans received 610.473 votes in the general elections of 2008, while in the 2006 autonomic ones the number declined to 316.222.
Last Sunday, the PPC obtained 384.091 votes.
If this increase in the tendency ensures a transfer of votes PSC votes and the loyalty of the PP voter base, the PPC could get from 8 to 12 deputies in the Congress, whereas CIU would also gain four (now it has 10) and the PSC would lose no less than 9 deputies (it has 25).
This calculation would indicate that the Catalan area is fundamental for PP and PSOE.
According to opinion polls, ERC would lose a deputy - it currently has three- and ICV would lose one.
The immediate appointment will take place in May of 2011 with the municipal elections, where the popular seats can also play a key role in the aim of the socialist hegemony in the four capitals of the province and their change to the front of the Barcelona Delegation, one of the four administrations that handles the most budget - 661 million Euros for 2011.
Political Nationalists as much as popular ones coincide in the possibility that the PSC loses the city councils of Barcelona, Tarragona, Lérida and Gerona, where the Socialists would not obtain the majority nor the possibility of appealing to their traditional partners, ERC and ICV.
Given the republican fiasco, it would not be surprised if this formation loses its seat in the Town Hall of Barcelona - it needs to obtain 5% of the vote.
The PP has increased its number of votes in four capitals and could be decisive in Barcelona, Lérida and Tarragona.
The Nationalists are confident of being able to carry out the upset in Tarragona, where they governed with the PP before the current socialist mayor, Josep Felix Ballesteros.
In Lérida, the PP has been placed only 500 votes of the PSC, whose mayor, Ángel Ros, has good relations with Mariano Rajoy - in the last campaign they have met several times.
The popular ones have also grown in other important municipalities like Badalona, Castelldefels or Reus.
The current PP is present in 34 municipal governments in Catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations.
The Catalan group facilitated thousands of passports to Al Qaida.
Also seven prisoners in Barcelona were taken to Thailand.
The seven Pakistanis and Nigerian one stopped by agents of the General Barcelona police Intelligence formed a jihadist group that, directed from Thailand, facilitated passports to different Al Qaida groups, among them " The Tigers for Tamilm Territory" (LTTE) and " Laskar and Taiba" (Let), author of this last one of Bombay attacks that caused the death of 106 people in 2008.
The Ministry of Internal Affairs has kept closely to these investigations, to ensure that with the operation of "Kampai" it has "weakened" the false falsification apparatus of Al Qaida at international level and thus its operational capacities.
The investigators estimate that the cell has been able to send thousands of passports to Thailand, where they were falsified and then distributed to the groups that integrate the criminal galaxy Al Qaida, so that its " combatants" can cross European and other western borders with total impunity.
The dismantled cell is not the only one that the jihadist network had in Europe, and therefore in the investigations there have participated, aside from Thailand services, other European police units, which means that in EU territory similar events occur as the one developed on Tuesday in Barcelona.
In collaboration with this operation (Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Tanveer Arshad and Nigerian Babatunde Agunbiade were all captured) in Thailand another operation was developed with the capture of Pakistani Junaid Humayun, Atiqur Rehman, Jabran Asghar, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Malik Iftikhar Ahmad, Tanveer Arshad and Thai Sirikanlaya Kijbumrung.
The group seated in Spain and other European countries was directed by Bangcock.
The Catalan network - part of it was struck in 2009 - mainly robbed tourists who fulfil the requirements of the "Worldwide Islamic front."
The documents must be in the name of men between 25 and 45 years of age, with a lasting duration of several years and without printed visas.
In the investigation it is emphasized that no data has been found about the persons arrested in Catalonia regarding the Bombay attack, but the author of this attack, Laskar e Taiba, has been one of the receiving groups of the passports robbed in Spain and later falsified in Thailand.
However, it should be mentioned that days before the commotion, from Catalonia, some thousands of dollars were sent through an agency of transferences to the "commando" that killed 106 people.
The Police have captured a lot of documentation.
PP asks Mas to postpone the fiscal concert
The PPC leader, Alicia Sanchez-Camacho, had yesterday presented her conditions for supporting his appointment as Catalan Autonomous Government to Artur Mas, which are similar to those raised during the campaign and that continue to remain in the economic recovery and giving up phylo-sovereignty, as it is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in his mandate.
The President of the popular Catalans went to the meeting with the security of having obtained 18 deputies in last Sunday's elections, a number more than sufficient to be taken as popular, since the candidate of CiU needs at least one of the two formations that will force the opposition to abstain from the investiture vote.
The possible agreement with the PP depends on the future alliances that the nationalists want to remain in the Congress when general elections are held, but at the moment, the conversations that Mas maintains with the rest of the political leaders in Catalan are key.
The President of the PP will have to make all the sovereign and independent speeches, as well as the economic concert - similar to the one of Basque Country - that the convergent leader tries to put under referendum.
Both leaders have their gamble of using a very inflated autonomic administration and eliminating the successions and donations tax.
The details of the negotiation on the appointment of which Mas will take care, on behalf of the PPC, Jordi Cornet and Dolors Montserrat.
Artur Mas has already met Joaquim Nadal (PSC) - who promised a hard opposition, Joan Herrera (ICV) and today he will meet Joan Puigcercós (ERC) and Albert Rivera (Ciutadans).
The geriatrician says that the deaths were caused by "lack of means"
The owner of the Olot centre does not discard that his attendant killed more than 11 elderly people.
The management of the elderly hospital La Caritat in Olot (Gerona) held a press conference yesterday to underline the damage caused to the institution by the criminal conduct of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who while there killed at least 11 people.
The Director of the residence, Joan Sala, appeared accompanied by the Centre's lawyer, Joan Canada, and announced that "the intention of La Caritat was to pin the blame on the individual responsible for the deaths but legality and responsibility forces us to take the procedural position of civil responsible people."
The social loss of prestige that the organization can face for not detecting in time the criminal activities of the watchman is now a threat to the Caritat.
Joan Vila Dilmé has confessed that the first crime goes back to August 2009 and since then he has not stopped killing.
The judge already mentioned in the document that ordered the exhumation of eight dead patients - old patients of the geriatric hospital- whom she suspected that in many cases no doctor personally examined the dead bodies but, taking account of the age and the pathology of the patients, the procedure was made by phone.
La Caritat, through its Director, fully denied this end yesterday and added that "lack of measures could not have been at any moment the cause of what had happened."
The lawyer of La Caritat added that "in the case there is no evidence that there has been an imprudent action on any other person who is not the guilty one."
The murderer, named as "Angel of Death", confessed 11 murders yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on 29th August 2009 and a month and half later, killed another grandmother.
In this case an overdose of insulin caused her death, unlike the first crime he committed with a mixture of sedative tablets.
The Director of the Caritat says that it is difficult to control that the staff of the center have access to medicine.
The overdose of insulin and the sedative cocktail would have been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his eagerness to alleviate the suffering of the patients, used or killed them.
The laboratory tests are being carried out to clarify if Vila is lying and trying to assure his first victims a less cruel death or if he has deliberately given them lye as he has already confessed to have done with the three women he killed in the 12th and 17th of October.
In La Caritat they do not give credence to the appearance of the watchman, nor to the number of confessed murders, and justifies his attitude in the different versions Vila has given in his visits to the court and the nonsense of changing his method of killing after having committed eight murders.
This is why they say they put themselves at the disposal of justice to clarify the reach of this event.
The BCE threatens to threaten the BCE
The investors suddenly reacted yesterday to Trichet's threat that recognized that "markets do not underestimate our ability to react."
The differentials of peripherals have closed by force and the European banks have higher rates than 5%.
However, we should not underestimate the capacity of the BCE in being mistaken and the Euro has just dipped again which is a worrisome signal.
What happened yesterday is characteristic of a non-liquid market that collapses and recovers but motivated by the closing of short and very speculative positions.
The institutional investors will take time to regain confidence.
A month ago the BCE called us to retire liquidity measures and will spend time tomorrow to retire by fourth time in two years and those that are left.
The Bundesbank requested to finalize the national debt purchase plan and eliminate all extraordinary measures of liquidity on credit, leaving only limitless access by week.
After the Irish crisis we hoped that they prolong the present liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the quarterly auction with limitless access by the end of the trimester to guarantee liquidity at least until June.
Then we hope that they continue with their voucher purchase program and give signs of intensifying it.
If they do not fulfil the generated expectations they will transform the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they continue to ignore the generated expectations by withdrawing liquidity measures, Good Lord!
As happened in May when they affirmed that they had not thought about vouchers and collapsed the markets, tomorrow history could reappear.
The BCE must be credible and persistent.
In May announced the bazooka on Monday and Wednesday said it had already bought too much, causing a new collapse of the market.
The auction of bills organized once a year in Portugal was poor yesterday.
The Treasury only distributed 500 million to 5.28% of the previous auction.
Even so the types in Portugal fell 30 basic points in the whole curve, reflecting clearly a change in the market feeling after Trichet’s words.
In Ireland, the Allied and Bank of Ireland deficit figures have been publicised.
The estimates are about 10.000 million in the short term and another 15.000 are potential.
Although Ireland does not have any credibility for not having detected the problem in July with the economic stress test, the numbers are acceptable within the Aid Plan and help reduce uncertainty.
However, on Tuesday, the Government will have to secure the parliamentary approval of its new budget and still lacks support, which is why Ireland continues to be an uncertain centre.
Angela Merkel has moderated her speech to relax the tension ahead of the next Summit of Presidents and Government on 14th December, where political commitment could be a political commitment that could demonstrate that we are a union and that goes in the same direction.
The problem is that Germany wants to play Wagner and the rest want to play the hymn of joy of Beethoven.
In Spain, the president presented yesterday the set of measures that will be approved on Friday by the Cabinet.
The reform of pensions, transparency in independent communities and financial organizations, reduced deficit, liberalization, privatization, jobs re-entry sounds to the investors as four seasons of Vivaldi.
The double effect of Trichet and ZP explains that the Spanish stock market has risen by 4,5%, double compared to the rest of European stock markets.
In contrast to February, the response of the Government and the Bank of Spain has been fast and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise effect.
Today there is a key auction of a three year voucher with the Trichet effect, which is why we hope it will be resolved with increased demand and will help dissipating the doubts on our capacity to refinancing.
For Spain asking for a Plan of Aid would be self-sacrifice.
The Treasure has more than 40.000 million available in liquidity than March, to the most expensive types and closed the access to the markets indefinitely.
However, the strategy must continue to be the woman of Caesar, "besides being, looking like."
Come on, we can do it.
The president of Eulen will contest the meeting of Vega Sicilia requested by his children.
The storm does not moderate the Alvarez family conflict, owner of Eulen and Enbro.
David Alvarez, founding member of the group, will oppose, by considering "null and void," the judicial meeting of En Enebro of 16th, required by five of his seven children and when they try to impose their majority and control of the management organs of the company that owns the Vaga Sicilia warehouses.
David Alvarez and his children Jesus David and Maria Jose are considering the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation for control of part of the group.
The founder of the most important holding company of enterprise services is not willing to give up his litigation to be present in the control systems of Ebro.
The Council of Administration was taken off by five of his seven children who appointed themselves administrators in the shareholders’ council on 18th of January this year and whose opposition is written down in the Mercantile Register.
The judicial meeting of the 16th, called by the magistrate of Mercantile Affairs Number 2 of Madrid, has caused further havoc in the Alvarez family.
The appeal to the judge for determining the assembly is, until the conflict is resolved, the only legal mechanism that guarantees the meeting's convention.
The last actions of Juan Carlos, Pablo, Emilio, Marta and Elvira Alvarez Mezquiriz, is described by David Alvarez as a "desperate appeal by the representatives of his five children who, by means of procedural subtlety, clearly infringing the Law and abusing the right, try to confirm and change the meeting of 18th of January as null," according to his official spokesmen.
This argumentation will be the basis on which to establish that: once the meeting has been held, he will reject considering it "null and void."
The same protagonists, who maintain a mild silence, have already tried to have the magistrate summon a meeting in June.
In The Enebro, a patrimonial society with the Warehouses Vega Sicilia, among others assets, seven children of David Alvarez control 100% of the capital.
The founder of the service group claims the ownership of 51% of the capital, according to the familiar protocols.
This subject is the main aspect that must be resolved by the judge after the meeting on the request of opposition, for which no date is yet given.
Red Bull triumphs in F1 with its secret weapon: Siemens.
There is software that can design improvements to the cars in real time.
Since Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success.
Initially nobody considered the options of a new team, despite the ascending trajectory of the last seasons, last November, in the final race of the championship all betting on the victory of Fernando Alonso's Ferrari.
Without losing his reputation as champion driver, the German Sebastian Vettel, nor the power of the Renault motor that drives his car, in Formula 1 " the secret weapon that Siemens has placed into the hands of Red Bull to turn it into a winning team has become a legend.
It is a powerful simulation software that the German company started selling in 2007 with aims far away from high automobile competition.
Dedicated PLM, this powerful computer science instrument has been used to design assembly chains for manufacturing factories, energy plants, high precision instruments.
The aim is to reproduce, to faithfully simulate the product or process before constructing it in real mode, avoiding failures and avoidable costs.
Plm has facilitated the development of Canon cameras, Sukhoi airplanes and the most famous utilitarian cars of Nissan.
According to Russwurm, the use of this computer science instrument in his F1 factory has allowed Red Bull to design and make "in few hours, almost in time real" the modifications, changes and improvements needed during the races and tests.
Russwurm explains that the team in 1992 had an average of 10 technicians who could add a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during every season.
Red Bull has 180 professional young people with high qualifications working today, equipped with powerful computer science equipment, analyse and project all kinds of modifications to the cars.
The Siemens manager explained that the software PLM is able to analyse and improve all elements of Red Bull cars except the engine, which is entirely Renault’s responsibility.
The materials, fuel, aerodynamics and security elements are being modified.
The changes can be made from the virtual reality of the simulator to the real world in 24 hours thanks to advanced production systems using high-tech laser and autoclaves.
The only limitation of this technological improvement is the figure of 40 million dollars that each Formula 1 team can spend at most every season to facilitate the competition.
Red Bull has built a high-tech factory for designing and producing its cars in a locality about 50 KM from London.
There are two buildings in which visits are restricted, especially for journalists.
The entire process is considered "Top Secret."
The factory has 580 employees, including two drivers, the champion Vettel and Mark Webber.
The Red Bull hero, without doubt, is recent champion Sebastian Vetell.
The huge technological resources that the energetic drink brand has given to its participation in the circuits, other players hide whose contribution is significant and their notoriety is unrecognized.
The head of technology at the factory, Steve Nevey, says that five years ago it was possible to affirm that I+D advances in the cars contributed to 50% of the victories and the driver was responsible for the rest.
Today these percentages have changed and technology adds 85% of the success, while the driver contributes with 15% of the value.
Nevey recognises that neither Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by computer science, because they are indispensable gladiators.
HP will open two years 20 own stores with local distributors
Hewlett Packard (HP) inaugurated yesterday in Barcelona its first exclusive store in collaboration with its partner Pont Reyes.
This will be the first of a network of 20 stores with between 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational is planning to open in Spain in the next two years.
The company will make this initiative compatible with the 16 areas already present in big centres such as PC City, Carrefour, Saturn and El Corte Ingles.
The Vice President of HP Spain, Helena Herrero, presented the refurbished store in the Barcelonan Gran Via, property of Pont Reyes.
North American group has prepared a plan to open 200 points of sale in Europe in 2013, strategy which includes the 20 Spanish establishments.
The first ones to open were in Bucharest (Romania) and Belgrade (Serbia) last week.
Herrero did not want to divulge the next openings, but she recognised that Madrid could be the next destiny.
The Director of HP personal systems ensured that the philosophy to open the stores will always be the same, based on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector.
North American group provides consultancy services and is in charge with the exclusive furniture design of the stores (with products that can be touched in interactive form), that in Europe will have the same image.
In addition, HP covers training of the staff of the establishments.
Helena Herrero denied that it was a franchise system and stressed that the network is trying to improve the service to the client and the SMEs in the purchase, attention, post-selling and even packing.
The Barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program at the world level that is responsible for solving possible problems with HP computer science equipment still with guarantee.
Online service connects a technical centre in Maastricht (Holland).
In 10 minutes we can resolve problems that sometimes can last up to two days.
The system is especially designed for SMEs and users, since the great companies have contracted technical attendance services.
Sabadell is betting on stealing one million clients from its rivals in three years.
More optimistic than other managers, the Deputy Director of Sabadell Bank, Jaime Guardiola, believes that 2011 will be a hard year for the bank, but rejects initially a new liquidity crisis and predicts the end of the liabilities war.
In spite of it, he expects a collapse of the margins of interest that will try to partly compensate with raised commissions and the credit price.
Sabadell hopes to catch in three years a million particular clients.
Sabadell has found a way to exploit the next three years and survive in very complicated economic environments.
The bank will start in 2011 with a new Director Plan that will have a three year duration.
The goal, aside from surviving without asking for public aid, is to gain market quota by getting a million new particular clients -700.000 if discounted those that may leave the bank, pending on assignment.
This year has caught 250.000 particular clients and 50.000 companies.
It has a market share of individuals of 3.5%, while in companies exceeds 10%.
The other base of the plan 2011-2013 is the bet on productivity, meaning austerity, with reduced costs as objective, and challenges will be exhibited by the bank when presenting the results of the exercise.
few banks dare to set objectives and make them public since the financial crisis has changed all of the plans for the global bank.
Sabadell, however, will close this year its Director Plan Optima, which was initially for three years but the market conditions forced him to extend it for one year.
The clients who give up savings will be his main goal.
The breakfast organized by the APIE, Guardiola stressed that 2011 will be a difficult and transcendent year.
The Executive believes that the exit from the crisis in Spain will be slow.
In addition, in two or three years there will be "very difficult to create jobs," essential for the survival of the banking business.
The threat of liabilities is being reduced, but the risk subsidies that banks are paying for their emissions to obtain liquidity are already moving to the cost of credit to compensate the fall of the margins.
The subject of liquidity and financing is fundamental, and is going to be a pressure factor on credit.
"We have not closed the faucet, but the differentials are more important," Guardiola recognized.
Banesto already issued orders to his network to limit the long term credit and to raise the price of the differentials - See CincoDías from 22nd and 27th November.
Also he recognised that the tendency of the bank now is to raise the commissions, but "within a competitive frame."
The Director Plan of Sabadell is based on the organic growth, but as always, the group does not discard corporative operations.
Not without a promise, Spain will have "major sizes" expected.
Next year everything will change.
The financial crisis has "risen too much" and it does not discard that some Spanish financial organization enters red numbers.
The FROB is mentioned to replace the market in fundraising before new recapitalizations.
After assuring that Sabadell can survive the temporary closing of the markets, he takes attention to what some bankers already predicted as a new liquidity crisis.
The threat is not emitted, but similar to what happened in June, short term financing is possible through agreements, which softens the crisis.
The CECA discards a second wave of fusions in the saving banks.
The head of the main Directorate of ECDC, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a large wave of fusions of savings banks and stressed on the speed with which the sector is rebuilt.
When the concentration of the Spanish savings banks started, there were several organizations that guaranteed that they would not participate in this first stage and that they would expect the second round.
The head of the main Directorate of the Spanish Federation of Savings Banks (CECA), Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, disclosed yesterday that this new wave of operations is going to take place.
The most important part of the fusions has occurred, the accession of Cajasol to the Civica Group is not a second round, there are only adjustments.
The most important part is completed, and we can expect to have 17 or 14 but all the great processes have been done under the surveillance of Spain Bank, which has collaborated with many people in this matter.
In declarations at a breakfast of the Management Association and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta has emphasized that the concentration process is undertaken "with the highest possible speed, and we must be very happy with how this is done in terms that at the time, not now, were marked in the plans for business with the Bank of Spain."
The process from 45 saving banks with average 28.500 million assets to 17 with 75.500 million is a very different process in history, reducing the number of organizations to 62% to fulfil Basilea , he added.
The economist recognised that there are "a series of opinions rather pessimistic on the slowness of the process" that shows "lack of seriousness and reason."
The head of the main Directorate of CECA, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, asserted yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system of all Europe and "probably" of the whole world, and attributes to those who question the "lack of knowledge."
The manager explained that, in the current economic situation, "we can be very relaxed" with the situation of the financial organizations and the savings banks, a system that has undertaken a "very important" concentration process and that "goes with the greatest possible speed."
Also he remembers that the Spanish bank very well handled the stress tests that the BCE made in July.
Zapatero and the German red line
Berlin has chosen to keep the Euro, but has established the conditions for all the Union.
The market tensions have caused double government responses.
On the other hand, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero has suggested new measures of adjustment, from reductions in corporate regulation, regulation of private positioning agencies or suppression of 426 Euros of unemployed without contributions, to the privatization of 49% of AENA, management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and 30% of State Lotteries.
The other side, Vice President Elena Salgado, with the support of the ex-president Felipe González, has added to the criticisms to the Councillor Angela Merkel for her responsibility in sorting the present crisis.
How can those movements be interpreted?
Merkel continues to maintain that the position of Merkel is not an error in her communication policy.
It is not another bolt tightening in the difficult process of redefinition of the Euro.
There Germany has a radically new vision on how its future must look, contradicting the old traditional values of its main partners.
Following European resistance, in Germany there are speculations on three possible exits from the crisis.
First, a strong Euro, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, among others, and the south would leave the monetary zone.
Second, the German mark, although now seems to be science fiction, with a very positive opinion of about 50% of the population.
Third, a redesign of the Euro, according to the German proposals of greater macroeconomic control, budgetary rigor, fines to transgressor countries, possible suspensions of payments to some of them and extension of the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments.
The German position is clear and coming to define itself over a long time, so no excuses.
Firstly, in 2009, when as much the IMF as the European Commission stimulated the deficit, the German Government presented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016.
This was the first signal of divergent between what Germany thought it had to do (fiscal strictness and stability in public finances) and what its European partners were doing, including France.
The second headache for the Central European country was when Merkel laboriously extended the decision to rescue Greece.
Then it was a subject of fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and the published one were against the rescue of Greece.
Finally, in the last days of October, Merkel once again takes a clear position, demanding reform of the Union treaties to allow the rescue of a country and, at the same time, forcing private moneylenders to run with part of the cost.
This position has been interpreted as anti-European, since it has caused the Irish crisis and all the rest.
The proposal, although sweet, has been approved and in the next months we will have to attend the reform of the Union that will allow those measures starting with 2013.
Germany has drawn up a red line that does not allow crossing.
It is telling us that, although now it has to take measures with which it may not agree, starting with that date the old functioning of the Euro, will have been finished.
The 2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary area, in which violating countries will be severely sanctioned, can declare themselves in suspension of payments and, in that case, the private sector will also support the cost.
Since Germany has told us that we must follow a severe path of growth with high rates of saving and investment, moderation in consumption, improvement in productivity, competitiveness and positive balances.
Another alternative based on debt and construction, with huge balances of payments, such as the one faced by Spain during the boom years, will not be tolerated.
Offers are clear.
We need to better understand.
It is not about trying to lead back the public deficit to 3% in 2013.
What they ask us is much harder.
The worst thing we can do in these circumstances is to kid ourselves.
The present turbulences would open the way to a greater peace.
They have given us the time to take advantage of the time they have given us, until spring of 2013.
It seems that President Zapatero has understood it in the same way and its double manifest (the reforms promised after the last Saturday meeting with the great companies and the announcement of yesterday of new measures) suggests that despite the critics to Merkel, has given way to the thesis according to which order should be established in the house.
The red line that Germany has drawn up is there, and it seems to be moving.
The possibilities are considered to leave the monetary zone of little serious countries.
Then Germany will always tell us that it had warned us.
Sport and fraud law
Alonso and Ramos before the Ajax shows wittiness but not the will to get removed from a sanction.
The probable expulsion of two Madrid players (Xabi Alonso and Sergio Ramos) in the 23rd November match against Ajax in Champions League has caused rivers of written evidence about whether both players should be sanctioned by UEFA.
As we all know, a few minutes before the end of the game (which they had already won), both players deliberately wasted time, which made the referee show the second yellow card to both of them.
This way, and since Madrid will finish as the group leader, both players will fulfil the prescribed sanction in the next league game, against Auxerre, and will be able to get rid of the cards the following phase.
The Disciplinary Committee of the UEFA has awarded two games to the team’s manager, Jose Mourinho, and different economic amounts to the implied players.
The threat of yellow cards in similar circumstances as this one is not new practice, but is quite common in football.
It is so extended that it is part of the ethos, of unwritten rules, but followed nonetheless by this sport.
The main issue in the case is caused by the fact that it has been carried out by the team of the Real Madrid organization (which in its hymn claims nobility and honour, and has fined its players for similar acts) and by the dramatic sequence orchestrated by Mourinho, who adds one more to his extended arsenal of hysterical and provoking technician.
The debate is about if that type of behaviour not specifically prohibited by the regulation contradicts the sport principles, that is to say, if with such actions fraud is committed, then indeed they are respectful actions with the sport regulation, but they seem to blur its sense.
The matter examines the type of damage that is caused to the sporting spirit.
One of the advantages of the sport spirit is the physical integrity of the opposite players, aspect that with these actions was not threatened, that is to say, there was no violent game.
Other advantages to which the fare-play is referred to is to prevent that the lawbreaker team misuse the other team, which was not either.
The paradox of the action of the Madrid players is that they did not comply with what we normally characterize as legal fraud, because they did not act secretly to avoid the sanction, but they acted most explicitly to avoid the sanction.
They waited for and accepted the sanction with no complaints.
Other question is what type of advantage the violators acquired in deliberately carried out actions.
This is not a disadvantage for rival nor is a gain in the same game, because the result of the action would imply leaving their own team with less players.
The strategy is not useful for the next game, because the club will not be able to count on them.
The advantage, however, is that the players will start the next phase of the Championship without cards that could threaten their future participation.
It is a long term advantage with a certain degree of indeterminacy, as the team can be eliminated first of change and in addition they fulfil sanction game and go to the second cycle of cards, in which the suspension by card accumulation occurs with one less than in the first cycle.
Then, by passing rounds it is not so clear that it is an advantage.
The actions are really against the sporting spirit, which is part of strategic decisions that favour taking advantage of the rules.
Regarding this assumption, the players did not act to prevent the application of the sanction (this would have been clear legal fraud), but rather chose when to obey it.
They made a strategic decision without avoiding the punishment.
The border between wittiness and law fraud is diffuse, but in this occasion I believe it was a clear case of wittiness.
The controversy seems to arise from two factors: because it was about two auto expulsions and how the transmission of the directive was carried out to cause them.
The damage caused to the sport by these actions is not as much ethical as aesthetic.
Supply offensive to catch Christmas dinners of groups in BCN
The way the days fall this year, there is a concentrated concentration of reservations on the 16th and 17th.
The celebrations of the employees, who want to spend between 20 and 30 Euros.
As nougat and lottery, once with December the group dinners before Christmas return, continue to be a fresh air for the restoration and leisure of Barcelona, that because of the crisis has ended with an offensive of price fixing to catch the majority of the customers: most of them want to spend between 20 and 30 Euros on dinners or meals, agree the managers and associations in the interviewed sector.
In order to finish the accounting, the calendar of this year (for falling New Year's Eve on Friday) concentrated the requests in the week of 13th of December, resulting in an avalanche of reserved dinners for weekend (16 and 17) and little movement for the previous week.
As a result, since 2008, when the cost-cutting stage started, many companies have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reasons.
For not ruining the tradition, many workers maintain it by making it from their own pockets.
Whatever conjuncture, everyone asked for a price war, says the president of the Restoration Gremi of Barcelona, Gaiet Farrs.
The representative of the employer's association today does not dare to predict whether they will have celebrations this month.
People consider it long before making a reservation.
The people want to go out but they have to consider the price situation.
The business will go well for those who give quality for good price and good attendance.
In a poll made in diverse centric establishments one can see the collapse of reservations for the 17th.
Soteras group indicate that there is an authentic boom of requests for that Friday, with the pretense of spending no more than 30 Euros, which has been responding by adapting its menus to 25 and 35 Euros.
In another of the most powerful groups, Andilana, with 16 establishments in the city (Hostal de la Rita, Market and others), the calendar has involved more anticipatory reservoirs, even since the beginning of November.
They explain that they have done the impossible to keep the same prices last year, with menus for all tastes from 19.95 to 30 Euros.
In AN Group, which includes The Mussol, Attic, QuQu, and up to 23 bars, they remain optimistic after detecting an increase in invoicing from the second semester and some good, but concentrated, perspective of business for Christmas.
Sources of the group emphasize that the 18th will also be a hyperactive day for friends who celebrate the holiday.
The group has added a Christmas menu, with a 30 Euro or more as the star budget and the perception that there is a tendency to spend 10% more than last year in exchange for more details.
Then they also see green buds in some companies that invites their employees and the grater the volume the better.
The Fecasarm employer's association (which includes organizations like the Association of Bars, Restaurants and Leisure of Barcelona) believes that the reserves are "cheerful" although the clients "negotiate" as much as possible.
In fact, the illusion of celebrating has not declined for those who pay.
Pakistani nuclear program is a huge threat to USA.
Islamabad produces atomic weapons at a rate faster than any other country.
The filtrations of Wikileaks confirm the links between Taliban people and Pakistan.
The content of the diplomatic communications between the American Embassy in Pakistan and the US State Department filtered by Wikileaks portal confirms the enormous restlessness that Pakistani nuclear program brings to Washington.
Beyond the detailed and substantial details offered on the content of the conversations and thoughts of the credited North American diplomatic representatives in Islamabad, the documents reveal that the cooperation between both countries in atomic security, instead of increasing, "decreases," and that the unstable Asian country produces nuclear weapons with a "rhythm faster than any other country."
The peculiarity of Pakistani nuclear program - that the arms are not assembled but are stored in components to make them difficult to destruction in case of attack- is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington.
The following is enumerated by the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, in a report previous to the visit of the ex-National Security Advisor James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear power plants on the territory under Taliban attack, the rumored dispersion of the nuclear materials and the vulnerability of atomic materials transport.
The high number of people implicated in the nuclear arsenals and the missiles programs is being considered, not only by the USA but also by Russia, as a reason for maintaining its guard.
Since Pakistan has had to recruit strictly religious personnel to protect the nuclear plant, given the poor education and cultural levels, extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in nuclear programs or missiles.
The most recent information on the documentation filtered by Julian Assange is the declining cooperation between USA and Pakistan in nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani rate of nuclear weapon production.
The Office of the Embassy in May, describes as "frustrating" the communication with Pakistan, says: "The transparency is frequently non-existent; offers of aid remain without answer or are refused."
In another message, Peter Lavoy, civil servant of the National Intelligence for South Asia, states that "despite the economic crisis, Pakistan produces nuclear weapons in a rhythm faster than any other country in the world."
The ambassador also asks Washington, during a visit of the Head of the Army, General Ashfaq Kayani, to give clear orders to the person in charge that "the Army of Pakistan must end the tacit support to terrorist groups."
Hunting of Wikileaks head
Obama appoints a person in charge of the antiterrorism fight to prevent new filtrations.
Interpol emits a red alert to follow the movement and locating Assange where he may be.
All that is related to Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, is a complex labirinth in which no certainty is given on any of the facts.
Yesterday Interpol issued one "red alert" to "locate and follow the movements of Assange."
This is not a traditional order of arrest.
In addition, it is not new, since it dates from 20th November.
The issue is not related to the last filtration of more than quarter of million diplomatic documents from the USA but with the sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden.
In addition, the lawyer of the creator of Wikileaks, Mark Stephens, says that "the police know where and how to get into contact with Mr. Assange."
The order was issued on day 20 at the request of Sweden, but was not revealed until yesterday, after receiving permission from the authorities of Sweden.
Given the fact, the 188 countries of Interpol have indications for identifying or locating to Assange "with regard to his provisional arrest and extradition."
The Interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert, but many Member States consider the call network notice free way for arresting an individual, especially if they have a bilateral agreement of extradition, as in Sweden and England.
The movement irritated the lawyers of Assange, who published yesterday a letter denying that the founder of Wikileaks, 39 years old, would be willing to participate in a video conference to answer any questions from the Swedish authorities.
The reports also indicate that Assange asked and obtained permission to leave Sweden from the public prosecutor in his case, whom they compare to the mythical Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of the security of Stalin.
This seems to be hunting, not a legal persecution, says the letter.
While the world was searching for him - and from Australia his mother defends his innocence-- Assange follows in unknown places but not in silence.
On Monday, a unknown place a telephone interview with the Director of Time through Skype, a conversation in which he requested the resignation of Hillary Clinton.
If it is possible to show that she was responsible for ordering American diplomats to spy in the ONU violating international treaties that the USA has signed, she should resign.
The threat was insulted yesterday by the press secretary of the White House, Robert Gibbs, who described the request as "ridiculous and absurd".
CNN reported that "I do not know why we should pay any attention to the opinion of a man with a web page" according to the CNN.
According to Obama, a high person in charge with the anti-terrorism fight, Rusell Travers, has been ordered to prevent new documents leak.
The effort by the spokesman of President Obama to reduce the attention paid to Assange contrasts with opinions that politicians and commentators now claim.
The congressman who will preside over the National Security Committee in the House of Representatives has asked the State Department to study the possibility of including Wikileaks in the list of terrorist organizations in order to take part and his fund and to prosecute anyone who gives them any contribution or help.
Additionally went Tom Flanagan, a Canadian advisor to the Canadian president Stephen Harper, who had to withdraw his opinion after threatening to kill Assange.
"Obama should turn him into an objective and use a non-manned aircraft or something."
Who did not apologize was Mike Huckabee, Baptist minister, ex-governor of Arkansas and possible candidate to the presidency.
Everyone in the Government who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not the execution is too much gentle punishment.
Puigcercós looks for peace in ERC with winks to those who have the same opinion as Carod.
The republican leader will allow the party to secretly vote on his continuity.
Huguet proposes a more plural executive and end the full meeting system.
Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the prescription for negotiating for the third time the internal revolt in ERC, without sight for the loss of 11 deputies and half of the vote.
The party is aware that his resignation is insufficient for the supporters of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but he also knows that the influence of that sector today is so diluted as his mentor and can cause him the same concerns as he had with other extinct currents.
The leader of Esquerra will try to gain new critics with winks that allow him to be protected until the municipal elections.
In order to begin, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisors of ERC could pronounce privately on his continuity.
By means of tickets, and not by raised hand.
If the supporters of Carod want to carry a certain vote of punishment to the president, they can do it without fear of retaliation.
In fact, the head of the ranks wants to avoid the division image as much as the one of submission to him.
In several interviews, he affirmed that he would not consider himself ratified with half plus one of the votes, but without mentioning the percentage, it would not be good or a "Bulgarian result" either.
The close supporters of Carod demand the president to do more than giving his position to the militancy, a gesture that is not worth when Puigcercós controls the most important organ between congresses.
The executive will try to decide with the Executive from now until May.
This is expected to participate in the development of the strategic reorientation document that the direction will submit to the national advice on day 18.
The intention is to speak for Puigcercós in exchange for promising to advance the Congress to the autumn of 2011, something that the cupola considers already done.
The ERC leader recognised that polyphony harms stability and that it must once and for all clean the dirty rags inside.
This line is symptomatic of the article that counsellor in functions Josep Huguet posted on his blog.
Regarding the ideologist Puigcercós, the holder of Innovació considers it fulfilling that the leader will be authenticated "in exchange of diverse objectives."
And he enumerated five, of which two are emphasized.
First, "recompose" the Executive Board to represent at least 90% of the militancy, which is to say, to include new faces from the sector compatible with Carod.
Second can be the great newness.
Huguet proposes that ERC eliminates the assembly as an operation mechanism.
Thus, proposes a reform of the statutes that allow celebration of the congresses through delegates chosen by suffrage.
Ending with the assembly model, an exception in the Spanish system of parties has been an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, who has already clashed with this concept in both last congresses.
In fact, the 2008 conclave took the mission of direction review of the Assembly in a specific congress of statute reform.
This meeting has not been held yet, because the internal flood of last years advised against confronting the subject.
Now, without critical sectors on the matter, could be a good time to take it and try to close it for always.

China maintains the objectives of reducing greenhouse effect gases.
The representative of that country at the COP16 reiterated that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon track and detailed that his country will continue to maintain its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45% by 2020.
China maintains its offer to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by between 40 and 45 percent by the year 2020, according to Su Wei, China's representative to the COP16.
In his first public appearance at the 16th UJ Conference on Climatic Change (COP16), Su Wei stressed that his country has made enormous efforts to reduce the carbon track and re-convert its industry.
In fact, in the last four years his country has invested 245 million dollars in reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.
However, he reiterated that China will not change its objectives, but will continue working with the international community in that matter.
The Chinese strategy on climatic change is divided into four parts: dialogue; building capacities; building institutions and endorsement to pilot programs.
All those parts have been advanced, including the approval last year of a new Energy law with objectives regarding the reduction of gas emissions, he explained.
In China, the federal authorities have been working in a coordinated way with and the state and local authorities in order to achieve the objectives of energy saving, efficient energy use and reduce emissions.
In addition, there are already developed or completed multiannual plans, either funded by the Chinese government or by other countries.
The example is the Efficient Use of Energy Program, implemented in the last five years, with investments from the United Nations (UN), the government and the private initiative.
The project is also being developed for climatic change, one for the change of incandescent centres by economizers and another for mitigating and adapting, he added.
The same table, Martin Krol, the country's scientific adviser on climatic change, stressed that China's efforts have been much more than generally believed.
Examples are, the per capita greenhouse gas emission in China is six tons per person, whereas in the United States is 100 tons; China is responsible for the 9 percent of the historical contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.
Also, it has a without precedent effort in the use of the energy, increasing by 20 percent its energy efficiency over the last five years and anticipates to do the same in year 2020.
Caesar Nava
The national leader of the PAN detailed that the ex-baker leader is within his right to go to the National Order Commission to protest according to his rights.
The national leader of the PAN, Caesar Nava Vázquez, stressed that the expulsion of Manuel Espino Barrientos was a legal issue and that the ex-leader is in his right to go to the National Order Commission to protest.
In a previous interview to the protest of Gabino Cué Monteagudo as governor of the state, he said that the expulsion of Espino is a local decision.
"It is an independent decision by the Commission of the Order of Sonora."
However, Mr Espino has the right to go, if appropriate, via a claim made to the National Council Order Commission, being a decision taken in the scope of an authorised organ.
The other hand, he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that no alliance for the presidency was formed.
Nava Vázquez was convinced that the National Action will strengthen in the internal election of 4th and 5th December, where his successor will be elected.
This (an alliance in 2012) is a subject that has never been discussed at the negotiation table, or at least not thus far, but it was an exposition for the local election that was successful and fulfilled the objective.
The leader underlined that PAN is supported by 71 years of dialogue, which is the reason why we do not fear internal competition; on the contrary, we enjoy it and make us stronger.
The Council believes that they will know how to pick the best leader than the National Action would require for the next three years, and that he will give the office to whom the council chooses.
"I have that absolute tranquility and openness; to any of five I would be proud to give the office of the party president."
The candidate predicted that the rise in the party during past elections will reflect in the next fights, but he added that "it is not yet the time to think about 2012."
"So far it is about accompanying Governor Gabino Cué in this duty."
The framework of the alliances in Oaxaca, Puebla and Sinaloa will be the reason for a huge debate in the country, and I am sure that Gabino will be equal to the challenges.
While being interrogated on the criticism of the PRI to President Felipe Calderon for his speech within the four years of his government, Cesar Nava asked the PRI members to reflect on the 6 years of the previous presidents Ernesto Zedillo and Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
If the PRI believes that the governments of Zedillo and Salinas were better than those of Fox and Calderón, they should begin defending them and leave the closet, he added.
The Executive can say words as the ones he said in the National Audience, because in the country there is no gag or censure.
Promote Obama in Twitter law for undocumented students
If you agree to the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and make them agree to this legislation, tweeted the American president on Twitter.
President Obama joined today the national mobilization supporting the Dream Act, for legalising undocumented students, with a message on his personal account on Twitter.
If you agree to the approval of the Dream Act, call your senators and make them agree to this legislation, tweeted Obama.
The short message maintains a cybernetic link with an larger document asking the public to immediately communicate with the senators, since the legislation is imminently approved.
If a expected vote is made soon, now is the time to hear your voice, he says.
The message was disclosed after the 42 Republican senators threatened to block the vote of any legislation unless it approves the extension of Bush tax cuts and the government finance.
The blockade, announced in a letter signed by the 42 Republican senators, could affect the vote on the Dream Act and other projects as the ratification of the new START Treaty with Russia against nuclear proliferation.
When asked about the republican blockade of the law Dream Act and other projects, the president spokesman Robert Gibbs trusted that after the fiscal issue has been resolved, a schedule for the rest of the projects could be established.
"I think there is plenty of time..."
"We all agree that the fiscal issue should be resolved before the end of the year..."
However, I believe that we can get an agreement in this matter and later we can plan the rest.
The leader of the Democratic Senate majority, Harry Reid, announced on Tuesday that they would request a "close of debate" for the Dream Act, the reason why the initiative of legalizing undocumented students could be voted on next Thursday in the Senate, but next week is more likely.
The Senate version of the Dream Act or American Dream would legalize about 800 thousand young people who entered the United States before the age of 16 and have remained in the country for five years and have entered either higher education institution or the army.
The favourable parties require 60 votes for approving the initiative, thus requiring the participation of republicans, when the supporting organizations of the project carry out intense lobbying to ensure its approval.
The democrats, most of which support the Dream Act, have 58 seats.
However, at least one of them has stated that he will vote against, and only one republican has expressed his support for the law, Richard Lugar from Indiana.
The Republicans in favor of the Dream Act require gathering several republicans if other democrats decide to back the initiative.
The most assisted republicans are the senators of Maine, Olympia Snowe and Susan Collins, who completed the mandate of the senator Mel Martinez.
Other republicans who have supported the Dream Act have been Orrin Hatch, from Utah, and Kay Bailey Hutchinson from Texas, but they have declared that they will not turn back.
Other republican who was in favour, John McCain, has not defined his position at this moment.
The House of Representatives has a different version, but analysts agree that the Dream Act faces the major obstacles in the Senate.
With literature they can put their finger on it.
The second round of The Pleasures of Language was a walk over which participants acted the narration.
The second round of The pleasures of the language was opened with the subtitle of her question (in another way the table was dedicated to sex in language).
The finger on it... " it puts us in a difficult position," told the Argentine writer to the public, mainly young people, who gathered in the International Book Fair of Guadalajara (FIL) to listen to this round table moderated by Marisol Shultz and participated in the round table.
Luisa Valenzuela read a text she dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio and that Shultz would define later as a great story, with Luisa in first person as the protagonist who goes from doctor to doctor, from whom she does not get answers but remains stuck in the same story thread.
The doctor leaves her convinced: "maybe patience is not my forte, maybe it is my sore."
In the end, after a frustrated approach with the trauma doctor who clarifies that sore is not a scientific term, it is the psychoanalyst who unravels the mystery: "sore is the real open thing; the symbolic thing is the scar."
The protagonist sighed almost asleep and continued, "I only managed to know that the real thing is open and that it does not exist," but believed that the pleasures and tricks of the language must be mixed.
Valenzuela, the writer, played with both.
The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramirez also presented a delightful narration called Praise of the Invention, where the finger on the sore is not named but is discovered.
In broad terms, he tells the story of a famous witch who by touching the clouds brought back men who had gone far or repaired the virtues lost by a maid, a great novel that started with a few chroniclers who told it and mentioned Bernal Diaz del Castillo who attacks the excesses of the narrative told by the conquering captains.
Cervantes who invented us all (writers) laughed at the false witnesses who appear in historical accounts presented as real, but otherwise he would never tell America with imagination which lacks shyness.
However, he stressed that "crazy people and liars are the best artists to imagine things" and it is where reality and falsehood mix, where one can know if the story is a side or other, where the fictional literature reaches its peak.
In fact it is called "Cervantes tradition.
"For its philosophy of: we are what is told of us."
The writer Mayra Montero saw and applauded the variety of interpretations that FIL causes with her round table The finger on the sore.
The Cuban-Puerto Rican pointed to the great sore of social violence that crosses her country - and divides Latin America - resulting from traffic and drug sale disputes.
Literature, good poetry, good songs involve a tacit commitment that is usually not premeditated, but that is one "chemical reaction" of this last one.
The night was closed by the Spanish poet Luis Garcia Montero, whose intervention also stressed the finger on the sore of the writer committed to writing.
The thought is that in a world that is in a hurry, also in the intellectual customs and control of the consciousness, it has effects in dogmatisms, forgetting that behind each affirmation there is a small no and behind each negation there is small yes.
Because we must clarify, and clarify often means to put the finger on the sore and to bother people who are more comfortable thinking about the cartoon, in black and white, in ideas established without shade and also to bother the powers that prefer a black and white world.
Romano goes towards his first title.
Rubén Roman Omar has three defeats in the finals, having during his career ups and downs, but he knew how to reach the final series in three occasions.
With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, two different faces of their technicians meet each other with a contrast marked by results.
Rubén Roman Omar has three defeats in the finals, having during his career ups and downs, but he knew how to reach the final series, but until now he has not reached the target and this is why this opportunity is very special for him.
The Argentinean has been rewarded with the bronze medal, and remained one step behind the winners and peculiarly with similar equipment he has played consecutive finals.
Fernando Santos reached his first final as trainer in 2002, when he took the reins of Morelia with which he lost to 4-2 before Toluca; later, in the Final Event of 2003 he also took the reins of Morelia with which he lost to 3-1 and indeed before Rayados.
Once with Santos Laguna, in the 2010 Anniversary Match, Rubén again suffers a reverse, when his team finished equally places 2-2 with 210 minutes of game, but in the penalty time he took the lead by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title.
Rubén has already lost two finals with Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, its rival, so he wants to celebrate a first title for the first time, and he says that the most important thing for him is the institution.
Because I want to be a champion, I do not want to break any statistic, this is for a club, for passion and the title will come to me.
Very effective he has the previous final, from which he says, has learned much, "until the referee signals the end we cannot celebrate, we prepare ourselves and the players to celebrate until the end of the game.
Understanding that this series could be defined by penalties, he says: " It is not a problem to be prepared for penalties, but to finish in regular time is a good thing, and this is what we want to do in the final, because we have no alternative and we have to play in regular time.
Roman should stop being a technical runner and start getting the first taste of the glory that the titles give.
EU changes the rules for obtaining the visa
Applicants will have to go to the Centres for Visa Applicants before their interview in the Consular Section, the cost will be smaller and so will waiting times.
From 10th January 2011 the procedure of issuing a visa in the Embassy of the United States and consulates will be altered.
With the new procedure, most applicants will have to go to the attendance centres for Visa Applicants (ASC) prior to their interview in the Consular Section.
The ASC staff will take the biometric information of the candidate, which will be reviewed by the Consular Section before the interview.
The new procedure will have many advantages for the applicants, among which:
The total cost of issuing the visa will be reduced, as there will no longer be a payment to get the appointment, another payment to process the request and another payment to the correspondence service will give the document.
The applicant will make only one payment for the three services.
The present tariff will remain unchanged, equivalent to 140 dollars for a tourist visa, 150 dollars for requests for visas (including visas for temporary workers), and 390 dollars for visas for retailers and investors.
People who wish to renew their visa will not have to go to an interview with the Consular Officer, but they will have to go to the nearest ASC where they will present their documents and have fingerprints taken.
Because the biometric information will be taken in the ASC, applicants who require a second date for being interviewed in the Consular Section will have to attend one less time than previously.
Also, those requesting a visa in the Consulates of Ciudad Juarez, Monterrey and Nuevo Laredo will no longer pay the extra tariff on service of 26 dollars.
Additional information on the new procedure for asking for a visa can be found on the following page http://mexico.usembassy.gov/boletines/sp101201_Visas-FAQ.htm
NASA will announce the discovery of extraterrestrial life.
The American Space Agency called the press to present a discovery that will have impact in the search for living beings in the space.
The National Administration for Space and Aeronautics (NASA) of the United States will present tomorrow, Thursday, an astrobiological discovery that could prove the theory that there is extraterrestrial life.
The discovery will be presented at a press conference tomorrow Thursday at 13:00 PM at NASA headquarters in Washington by experts in astrobiology, a science defined as the science that studies the origin, evolution, distribution and future of life in the Universe.
The press conference, NASA announced that it will present "a discovery that will have impact in the search for extraterrestrial life," which caused speculation in other countries.
The discovery could prove the theory that there are creatures that look like humans living in hostile spaces thought to be uninhabitable, and would place the possibility that they could become intelligent beings like humans if they improve their living conditions.
According to the reports, the microbe is based on a microbe that was found at the bottom of the Monkey Lake in the National Park Yosemite, California, where it lives in an environment considered too poisonous for any form of life, since the lake is rich in arsenic.
The creature uses arsenic as a way of survival and out of this capacity increases the possibility that similar life could exist on other planets that do not have our benevolent environment.
According to astrobiologists, if these organisms use arsenic in their metabolism, it will be demonstrated that there is another form of life, a second form of life, different from the one we know.
The Space Agency will present the full extent of the discoveries in the press conference on Thursday.
Pamela Conrad, who studies the possibility of life in Mars; and Steven Benner, one of the scientists studying Titan (the greater Saturn moon), with the perspective that its chemistry is similar to the one of Earth.
PRD, PT, Conservative and Patron block
With reforms to the Organic law of Congress, a "two-party system" emerges, they say.
The 60 Legislature was not resolved when a competing block emerged in Congress, headed by the deputies of the PRD, PT, Convergencia and Jesus Manuel Patron Montalvo, who declared himself independent.
Before the inaugural session, Felipe Manzanarez Rodriguez, from Conservative, Ezequiel Reyna Esparza from the PTB, Javier Corvera Quevedo from the PRD, and Patron Montalvo, were against the reform of the Statutory law, because it excluded them.
The reform, they reiterated, will begin 'the two-party system' because now there will be two representatives and an equal number of parties that will control the Congress.
This four deputies, together with Gloria Margarita Santos Aguilar, coordinator of the PRD, were the only ones to vote against the Directive Table, headed by the PAN supporter Salvador Lopez Brito and Luis Antonio Cardenas Fonseca as Vice Presidents.
Corvera Quevedo, detailed that these reforms institutionally constitute the political marginality from the PRI and PAN.
The chairman added that in the near future they will meet with the representatives of PAN and PRI to change the scheme, starting from political will, and if they do not have it, they will be dominated by both parties and thus the coalition was ended.
How far they have got (the competing coalition), is what I see, because we are excluded from any decision, they do not have the political deference to consider the opinion of the rest.
Felipe Manrez Rodriguez, from Convergencia, mentioned that with the PRD, PT and Patron there are similarities and that they are forming a plural group.
It is not possible to allow that the Congress after having been monopolistic now is a "two-party system."
It is not the spirit of the reform the law that has an eternal two-party system in Congress.
In order to begin, this group is initiating with 5 legislators, and is talking with other partners to increase the number, added the convergent.
Eduardo Reynoso Esparza, from the PT, explained that at the time the Congress became a "plunder" between two, referring to PAN and PRI.
Before it was only one party, now it is divided between two.
Patron Montalvo, asked for the integrity of the deputy to be respected and to give him his place at the negotiation table.
Because of leaders' agreements, we have decided to look for a slot in the negotiation table, that is the subject of the reform reform that they have decided to implement, and we are outside.
200 $ thousand more for the provider
The City Council of Mazatlán pays another check to the questioned owner of the company of electrical equipment.
One more check of more than 200 thousand pesos in favour of Lorena Guadalupe Camacho Palazuelos was issued by the City Council.
With this, the amount paid in this second semester to the owner of the electrical equipment company reaches 1 million 200 thousand pesos.
In accordance with the Municipality transparency document, this last check number 9258447 was issued on 16th November, with the amount of 200 thousand 144,56 pesos, under the concept of "liquidation of accounts to be paid."
The Treasurer Luis Miguel Lopez Moreno previously told the Municipality that they were being paid more money by the Municipality in favour of this supplier, which was observed by the State Audit of the State for selling at a higher price.
What was not reported is the total that still has to be paid and, therefore, how many checks have to be issued to Camacho Palazuelos.
Nothing has been acquired, they simply pay the supplier the owned amounts as other providers, said in an interview.
The last checks "appeared again" in the last quarterly of the year: 24th of September, two issued on 15th of October, 19th of October, 29th of October and this last one, on 16th of November.
The supplier has not been published yet in the State Official News, as the law requires when a company is questioned by ASE, in order to prevent other governments from using its services, the Treasurer assured that they no longer used its services.
After, after 25th of July, Noroeste published a revision of the checks that the City Council issues for its suppliers, it was revealed that, from March 2008 to September 2010, the City Council paid to Camacho Palazuelos more than 10 million pesos through 42 checks.
It also completed transactions with Jumapam, where received checks for more than 3 million pesos.
It is urgent that tourist sites are taken care of.
The tourist industrialists feel sorry for the accident of the foreign tourist caused by poor conditions of the Sanchez Taboada Glorieta in Mazatlán.
After the fall of a foreign tourist in the downfall of Glorieta Sanchez Taboada, the tourist sector of Mazatlán asked the authorities to take care of areas and sites that are in poor state and that promote a bad image of the port.
Salvador Barraza Rubio, president of the Association of Retailers of the Zone Dorada, recalled that in different occasions they have stressed that the image of the destination should be carefully taken care of and to change the bad perceptions that tourists may have with new activities or routes.
The streets and sidewalks have been affected by tourists who walk and see the disorder and avoid the complementary businesses.
The politicians do not know what it means to close for one day and have no idea about the amount of money that is lost, or else they would not do the jobs this way for such a long period of time and without prior planning.
The hotelkeeper Jose Ramon Manguart Sanchez said that the fall of tourists revealed the lack of preventive and maintenance from the City Council.
The city must take its responsibility and prevent this from happening again, by providing preventive maintenance and not only repairing.
The city is looking forward to being clean, because not only must the area be maintained, but as citizens who deserve clean sites to live on, the City Council must change its strategy to maintain good living and visiting conditions.
There are other sites that are also neglected and incomplete, such as the Escudo and the Mazatlán Venadito.
Currently, for tourists to come, they depend on promotion, good products, clean beaches and avenues, permanent maintenance of the tourist attraction area.
There was no attention paid and this underlines something that is well known to all, maintenance is a must.
RAUL Llera Martinez, Assistant Director of Tourist Promotion, stressed that the rescue of Mazatlán tourist sites is urgent, because they are not enjoyed in the correct way and they project a bad image.
The city has to be always clean, ordinate and attractive, because it is a tourist city.
The city has many historical and cultural sites and places that must be cleaned and made attractive in order to be able to add them to the inventory when promoting the city.
IP requests results from the Congress
Eduardo Dávalos, president of the CEC, proposed that the deputies take the responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa by the diverse challenges that it faces.
The establishment of a decent work Legislature and free from agreements between parties and the Executive State is being asked by the enterprise sector of Mazatlán, because there is a convulsed Sinaloa that is having great problems.
Yesterday the 60th Legislature was voted in, integrated by seven political forces, 19 of the PRI, 13 of the PAN, three of the Nueva Alianza, two of the PRD, one of the PVEM, meaning total of 40 popular representatives.
The list of expectations of the new members of the S-state Congress is a list of expectations for the new members of the S-state Congress that include clean management of commitment to the public and the different sectors that require responsible legislative work.
Eduardo Dávalos Zamora, president of the Enterprise Coordinating Council, proposed that the newly appointed 40 members of the State Congress took the responsibility of being an example for a better Sinaloa by the diverse challenges that face.
The deputies will really exercise their right, free from agreements between the parties, because it is a custom to make agreements to protect their own interests and they become a character in the carnival of the governors and leaders of the parliamentary fractions.
The reason for this was that he spoke about certifying the commitment to establish the necessary bridges that could help the Governor to go ahead.
The candidate will do a good work and mainly committed to the community and the sectors because the people of Sinaloa gave them the vote of confidence in last elections.
Jose Ramon Manguart Sanchez, president of the Association of Hotels Tres Islas, believed that one of the most important challenges for the 40 popular representatives is pushing and adding forces in search of the economic growth of the state, because nowadays the economic situation is very complicated.
The most important thing is to push economic growth, that generates incentives for investment and infrastructure and that somehow will form a new generation of jobs.
The new legislators would revise the weight of the state budget to strengthen the Office of Tourism.
As I have understood this is the second department of the state with fewer budgets and is unacceptable to a major economic activity generating currencies and investment and directly competes with the agro industry.
Beyond labelling resources, tourist projects that provide security to the state and update the Alcohol Law that has not been solved in previous legislatures.
Magician is looking for work
Dolls, cars and bicycles, among others, are the desire of children of the family Coronado from Valenzuela.
The next King’s Day will be difficult to please his illusions, since they are made of no more than 12 people and a goat.
However, Adelaida, Isabel, Jesus, Jose Alfredo, Maria Guadalupe, Isaias, Jose Juan and Miguel do not lose hope that Melcher, Gaspar and Balthazar will give them the toys and clothing they so much want.
The family lives in a small house in Salvador Allende Colony and lives in poor conditions because the father has no job.
sometimes it is very difficult for us because my husband has no job, but we sell mandarin and daddy... in the morning I go with the kids to sell in the street.
Adelida, 4 years old, wants a doll or a bike, while her sister Isabel, 3 years old, wants a Barbie doll.
The other hand, Jose Alfredo, 10 years old, has always wanted a "monster" car and for his brother Jesus, 8 months old, Cayetana suggests clothes suitable for a one year old baby.
Then he told me (Jose Alfredo), I would like this monster, but I said "we will see son" because it was very expensive.
For the younger children that were at school clothes and shoes would be perfect.
Maria Guadalupe, 11 years old, is size 12; Isaias, 10 years old, is size 10, while Miguel, 8 years old, uses size eight.
Jose Juan, 14 years old, needs tennis, reason why a size five and half or six would be helpful to him.
If you want to make this dream come true for the children of the Coronado family from Valenzuela you can participate in the campaign by donating a toy or cash at the Noroeste reception.
14 presumed drug traffickers arrested
Eight searches were carried out in Estrie on Wednesday in the context of dismantling a network of cannabis production and sale.
Fourteen persons were arrested and will face various charges.
The searches took place in Sherbrooke, Oxford and Stoke, mostly in the places which served as the production of drugs.
Around 750 cannabis plants, 4 kilograms of hashish, money and equipment were seized, according to KLouis-Philippe Ruel, spokesman of the Quebec Sûrété.
All, eleven men and three women were arrested, including two presumed head of this network, two Sherbrooke men.
The arrested persons had to appear at Sherbooke Court during the hours following their arrest.
They may face accusations of cannabis production, its possession with the purpose of trafficking plotting, and theft, among other things.
This search occurred after a long investigation that lasted for over a year.
The public information that we received enabled us to make these arrests, according to Mr Ruel.
Some 70 police officers from the reginal enquiry unit of the Estrie of the Quebec Sûreté, of the Sherbrooke Police Department and Nephrémagog police headquarters participated in this police operation.
Clandestine migration can be pursued without probations.
The government believes the draft law should solve the problem of boatloads of illegal migrants, but will likely be defeated, as the three opposition parties announced on Wednesday that they cannot support it.
"I strongly rely on the Charter."
'I support your party, which created the granite beneath your feet' declared the liberal chief Michael Ignatieff, surrounded by deputies after the weekly caucus meeting.
Liberals claim that the draft law in its present form which would allow any person from a ship identified as carrying clandestine immigrants to carry a ship identified as carrying clandestine immigrants, would violate the Canadian charter of rights and liberties.
The head of the Quebec Block, Gilles Duceppe has also said that he cannot support the draft law because it is wrong.
They are opposed and it seems that all opposition parties are opposed and we will now see what the government does.
The critic of NPD on immigration, Olivia Chow, has rejected the out of hand criticisms against her party.
'the neo-democrats approve the taking of steps against persons handling illegal immigrants and this is what we are doing by another draft law, the C-35'.
They do not support the Conservatives' draft law because it attacks refugees and prisons their children for at least one year.
The Minister of Immigration, Jason Kenney, accused the opposition parties of playing politics and ignoring the will of Canada.
Canadians are telling deputies loudly and clearly that they will not tolerate this kind of illegal immigration, these criminal operations that target Canada and treat Canada like a doormat.
"They expect Canada to adopt firm measures" was the response of Minister Kenney.
The government has not announced a vote of confidence on the draft law, which could lead to elections in the event of its rejection.
The Conservative has however told the QMI Agency that the government would ask for a vote so that every opposing deputy shall explain his reasons to his fellows.
New unity does not create unanimous opinions.
Although Jean Charest announced the possible creation of a permanent unit for combating corruption and collusion, many observers continue to demand the creation of a public inquiry into the subject.
The Public Security Minister, Robrt Dutil, says that this idea is not new: Quebec consulted the New York Department of Investigation on the subject last January.
The metropolis has had a permanent anti-corruption unit since 1870.
The Tuesday announcement surprised more than one person.
It must be noted that at a meeting of the Quebec permanent police council last 29 October this step was never discussed, despite the presence of Robert Dutil.
The public security critic Stephane Bergeron could not have needed more than to call this announcement a "rabbit produced from the hat" and as a "solution thrown together on the corner of a table".
Minister Dutil replied to those fearing that political power would have too much influence on the future unit.
"You will see the result when it is announced," he contented himself with affirming.
"One is aware of that problem."
The President of the CSQ, Réjean Parent, believes that no substitute is launching a public investigation.
The more obstinately M.Charest refuses to create this investigation commission, the more people will think like you and I that there is something to be hidden.
The only way to get a Commission of Inquiry is by resigning Jean Charest.
In order to get out of this impasse he suggests that the General Verifier should give a special mandate to the General Verifier to investigate collusion and corruption.
"One must be able to broaden the mandate of the General Verifier," he decides.
The Verifier also feels that Quebec could confer on the Verifier the same powers as a Commissioner, allowing the latter to compel people to testify.
The creation of a permanent group of people is not the only project on the Charest government programme.
Quebec would also ask Ottawa to modify the criminal code to make it more appropriate for this type of crime.
This request would come from the prosecutor of the Marteau operation, who informed the Minister of Justice Jean-Marc Fournier that precedent is not explicit on such investigation.
The Federal Minister of Public Security, Vic Toews confirmed that his colleague at Justice, Rob Nicholson is currently inclined to introduces certain amendments.
At the time of the Spring 2001 operation, which targeted motor cyclists, even though the criminal code was not adapted, 181 persons were arrested.
Ottawa later voted to adopt the gangsterism law.
Rivers under close surveillance
Various watercourses are under close surveillance after the heavy rainfall in several regions of the province since Tuesday.
The land slide occurred on Wednesday afternoon at Shawinigan in Mauritia.
Two houses were evacuated as a precaution.
In the evening another landslide occurred at Saint-Lin-Laurentides in Lenaudière.
A road collapsed.
Tuesday and Wednesday evening heavy rain (from 40 to 70 millimetres) fell in several regions.
Around 20-40 millimetres of additional rain were expected between now and Thursday evening depending on region.
North River and Outaouais alley were most affected.
They received up to 100 millimetres of rain.
Since these falls will add to the thaw of snow already lying in certain sectors, the overflowing of several rivers is feared.
Emergency flood alerts were issued on Wednesday evening by Quebec Civil Security for the rivers Ouareau and Achigan in Lenaudière.
The rivers Nord in Saint Jerôme, in the Laurentides and Chène in Lotbinière were the subject of flood warnings and remain under surveillance.
In Lanaudière region, heavy rains caused overflowing of some lakes at Sainte-Julienne, Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare, and Rawdon.
At Sainte Calixte, a provisional bridge was broken by heavy rain.
Eight buildings were evacuated as a precaution.
In Outaouais, overflowing of some lakes caused closure of several roads, particularly in the municipality of Mansfield-et-Pontfract.
Annik Bouchard, a security consultant, reported that Civil Security was in alert and closely monitoring the situation.
The Centre issued flood warnings in several rivers, including Maskinongé, Assomption, Ouareau, Batiscan and Loup.
Dupont acknowledged that he was partly blamed for the failure of Dupont.
The Quebec radio animator Stphane Dupont suffered a partial reverse before the Canadian Radio and Television Standards Council (CCNR) on social assistance and Haitians, as well on his coarse language while on air.
Tne CNNR feels that M. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98,1 FM had the right to express their views, but that some topics contained "inaccurate information on social assistance, unnecessarily negative statements about Haitians and coarse language not suitable for daytime broadcasts."
The Council also concluded that a discussion about suicide, including the broadcasting of the names of two persons who have committed suicide, did not infringe broadcasting codes.
The CCNR received several complaints on comments made during bradcasts between 2008 and 2010.
The first decision was given after a complaint from the Quebec Common Front of persons receiving social assistance.
The group complained that the sums quoted in the broadcasts were not accurate.
The animators must present solid, not deceptive information.
Suicide, the animator Stephane Dupont thought that suicide was the action of a coward.
The majority of the Committee members agreed that suicide should not be seen as a solution to life's problems.
The majority of the Committee feels that the episodes in question of "Dupont midday" approached a delicacy in a balanced and appropriate way.
Accordingly, no blame is attached to him.
The last dispute was the declarations that followed the Haiti earthquake.
Stphane Dupont and Jean-René Dufort then had a face to face media discussion, which caused a lot of reactions.
The CHOI animator declared that he had not made any contribution to help the Haitians, because he was unsure that the people in need would receive the money.
The Committee believes that the comments were not improper, but that the cumulative effect on Haitians was unnecessarily negative.
"I have already served my three-day suspension there."
"My record has now been clean for eight months," says the animator.
In all its decisions the Committee condemns coarse language broadcasting.
The broadcaster CHOI-FN collaborated "beyond the call of duty" in all cases.
The consequences are minimal for the station, which must, inter alia, announce these decisions once during the hours of maximum audience within three days.
The King of Kung-fu in Montreal
The Montreal resident of Algerian origin, Nacereddine Zemmal has an extremely individual programme.
The athlete, who excels in "sanda" kung-fu, kickboxing and Thai boxing, is entering the tatami and the rings of the world in search of fresh challenges.
”I started practicing martial arts such as kung-fu and kickboxing 12 years ago in Algeria,” explained Zemmal.
In my case I look for fights everywhere, since for those who do not like floor fights present in mixed martial arts, North America is rare.
The man working as a security agent for UPS, had good news for his rivals, having earned two gold medals in the amateur world championship of the World Karate and Kickboxing Association (WKA) held from 23 to 30 October in Edinburgh, Scotland.
"I won in full contact kickboxing and Thai boxing," he explains.
"I am currently preparing to go to China for the San Shou World Cup."
"Competitors who finished among the first four zt the previous world championship in each class were invited.
"In Toronto 2009 I won the bronze medal."
"In Vietnam in 2005 I finished eighth."
"I finished fifth in 2007 China and second in Toronto in 2009," he added.
What is interesting is that I did better at each competition.
"At this rate I will be first this year or next!"
The "san shou" or "sanda" is an original Chinese contest, where punch and kick, as well as throwing to the ground is authorised.
The fights occur on a platform and more rarely in a ring.
The most famous pugilist from this form of combat is the American of Vietnamese origin, Cung Le, well known in the world of martial arts.
If Nacer Zemmal is asked to recall only one event of his career, it will surely be his participation in the "King of Sanda" tournament in the Kung-fu Super Bowl.
The most frequently mentioned and most prestigious competition in China, explained the young man.
It is the equivalent of Lumpinee Stadium, (the largest stadium in Thailand).
"It was a great experience."
Zemmal won his first fight, a semi-final in his class (80 kg), before losing in the finals.
The man who beat me was a real professional, he explained.
"There are four fighters in each class (80 kg, 85 kg and 90 kg) "
"The winners of the semi-finals fight one another in the finals of their class."
"The winners in each class fight each other for the title of a sigle champion, the king of kung-fu."
450 million worth of contracts without tender calls
Hydro-Quebec awarded 450 million dollars in contracts to engineering companies for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert hydroelectric project.
The core of this massive flood of over 100 contracts is a consortium of companies BPR, Dessau, SN Group and Axor, which secured the most important contract, which was the management of the project for the sum of 295 million dollars without a tender.
The consortium called Energie Gérance was formed in 2004, leaving Hydro-Quebec with the option to pass its responsibility for managing this important hydroelectric project to the private sector.
The start of 2005 the Energie Gérance consortium secured this lucrative contract without prior public tender.
The Quebec Party believes that using corporate partnerships poses serious problems, which include elimination of competition and price increase.
This is a new way of colluding and defeating competition.
The shift in behavior means that people now act openly.
The morning Simard raised the question in the National Assembly, because he found it difficult to see how public interest could be served in that way.
In his reply, the Minister of Natural Resources Nathalie Normandeau, denied collusion in this contract.
"I am starting my journey," she claimed, maintaining that the Quebec Party was "dishonest and lack of rigour."
The lawyer added that "it would be the least thing" for the Quebec Party to excuse itself.
The formula of consortia is current practice worldwide.
What is usually involved is an limited time alliance, which allows two or more companies to combine their expertise to respond to a tender for a complex project.
Eastmain project is a highly complex project, taking account of the extent of the work.
The site is progressing and must extend until 2012.
The contract was awarded without involving competition; there were negotiations.
Likewise, the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in Quebec, even in relatively simple projects.
The formula of consortia in engineering consultancy is a subject of a government investigation.
The Register of Quebec companies shows the presence of over 200 consortia, some of which are permanent.
Desseau works with most of its main competitors, including CIMA+, Génivar and others such as Roche and Tecsult.
Every combination and there are tens of them, returns to one and the same company, Desseau.
The overall environmental guidance consortium is a very specific area of the Baie James region, and Hydro-Quebec has been adhering to them since nineteen seventies.
The head of Eastmain project, Réal Laporte of the James Island Energy Company (SEBJ) gave an explanation, which raised eyebrows about the fact that the project management contract was awarded by mutual agreement.
If you launch a tender and there are few tenderers, your prices will be too high.
either you accept the people who are in that market and you say that we will negotiate a satisfactory alliance and a good price.
The idea is that it is not the price which is important, but people's skills.
This contract awarded to the Energie Gérance consortium is part of a long list of over 50 000 $ contracts secured by the Quebec Psrty.
The contracts were awarded by Hydro-Quebec or SEBJ for the Eastmain-1-A-Sarcelle-Rupert project.
After verification, Le Devoir counted 109 engineering consultancy contracts awarded between 2002 and 2010 to companies or to their subsidiaries, especially soil laboratories.
SNC-Lavalin took 22 contracts, Genivar 16, Tecsult 14 and Dessau 10.
All contracts were negotiated.
The total amount of the contracts totals 449 783 344 $, including the contract awarded to Energie Gérance worth 295 131 564 $.
According to Simard, the four companies involved in the consortium are well known to the Quebec Liberal Party.
The Minister forgets that the Quebec Party is also linked to these companies who "finance" it, before adding that it was its directors who were involved.
Consumer barometer of responsible consumption - the green label does not inspire confidence.
Greener but frankly sceptical.
The Quebec consumer has little confidence in durable development players, but also in equitable brands and certificates claimed to be ecologically acceptable, to guide his choice.
The worst thing is if he goes into the media where messages for more responsible consumption flit, he describes the lack of reliable information, a neglect that he describes as a brake on his commitment.
If they caused an increase in consumption of socially responsible products in 2010, Quebec inhabitants seem to have little faith in those who are trying to sell it to them.
The majority of them believe in the environmental commitment of companies or their green publicity using the tool of the responsible consumption observatory of Sherbrooke University.
Other findings: Half of consumers have doubts about the reliability of official certifications on so-called equitable products, but also concerning the credibility of products and brands marked as eco-responsible, according to the Barometer.
In a similar way, the talk of politicians on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebec inhabitants.
However, information about responsible consumption seems to be fundamental for the encouragement of this current consumption by two-thirds of Quebec inhabitants.
In fact, the vacuum and doubtful nature of the information would cool the ardour of 46% of consumers.
It is the second most important brake after the high price of these products identified by the Barometer.
Moreover, twothirds of Quebec inhabitants believe that they mistrust the alleged performance of "green" products or services which are being placed in their hands.
In 2010 almost half of consumers had to change their habits and most importantly change the brand of one or more of their products to reflect their conviction.
Up to 61% of them favoured buying from their local shops and preferred foodstuffs grown in their region, according to the Barometer.
Greener and more responsible - the responsible consumption index has reached 64 out of 100 for this year - the Quebec homo consumus likes to appear as the King of Recycling trying to reduce its environmental impact by thinking about animal protection.
The social and ecological conscience remains restricted to the outside of its vehicle, according to the Barometer: in 2010, only 28% of Quebec inhabitants reported that they used public transport or recommended its use to defend their green interests.
Walking and cycling were also supported by 19.1% of participants in this huge inquiry.
State loan for the purchase of the eXcentris.
The Quebec government, which was asked to be financially involved in the purchase of the eXcentris cinema complex by the Angus and Parallel company, agrees to cooperate but only in the form of a loan.
The Angus and Parallel development company which hoped to acquire from Daniel Langlois the cinema complex eXcentris on Saint-Laurent, restoring its full cinemaphile vocation, will not secure what they are asking for.
The government agrees to participate but on its own conditions.
The expected donation is a loan that will be less than initially expected and which could be a viable solution on favourable conditions.
The first plan of action and a request for 12.8 million have been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests have since been revised downwards.
The proposal and an action plan were sent to Minister St-Pierre by the Chairman of the Society for the Development of Cultureal Enterprises (SODEC), who is piloting the eXcenrtic file.
The final report was sent him ten days ago.
The counterproposal of the cabinet arrived at SODEC on Tuesday.
Parallèle and Angus have until 31 December to respond to it.
It appears that the assumption of a donation must be abandoned.
The Association of Quebec Owners of Cinemas and Cineparks opposed direct State investment in eXcentris, arguing that the Ministry of Culture should not finance real estate projects, as it did for other cinemas.
The other local players claimed substantial economic support.
Daniel Langlois, the previous owner, supported the author's cinema on the complex premises after having himself financed its construction, which allowed a Treasury approval.
The lack of independent films in Montreal is a serious lack of halls for independent films and eXcentris knew how to gain loyalty from its customers.
The Angus Company and Parallel, headed by Christian Yaccarini, are piloting a private fundraising campaign to collect 700 000 $ to make the acquisition possible.
Since spring 2009, one of three screens, the Parallel, continues to broadcast eXcetris films.
The future buyers are expected to reopen the three halls on 27 February, showing the very beautiful film by Xavier Beauvois titled Men and Gods.
The proposal for a reduction has not been called back to them and it is unclear what he and his Group think about the proposals for a reduction that have been made to them.
The veil lifted on a complex Canada.
The new American diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks have lifted the veil on what the United States consider to be an inferiority complex of Canadians towards Americans, but they also betray a superiority complex of the later towards Canada.
The American diplomats are astonished that every Canadian voter does not have Canada-American relations at heart when voting and believe that the visit by President Obama helped the Conservative government to adopt its 2009 budget!
The four new communications between the American Embassy in Ottawa and Washington published yesterday, give more spicy details to get one's teeth into.
The cable dated 22 September 2008, in the midst of the federal election campaign, tells how the United States is part of the political debate.
To great shock of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins.
Wilkins provides some explanations of this situation.
The almost inherent Canadian inferiority complex is probably driving political leaders to speak about internal issues, rather than blame this election on the United States (as in the free exchange campaign of 1988).
The United States are, he says, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent but potentially too threatening to be talked about."
The ambassador does not understand this "deafening silence" either, since the two countries have a political and economic relationship.
Logically, he feels, "the ability of a candidate, of a party and even more of a party leader must be a key factor in voting.
The other expression of this important sentiment is found in the cable sent on 22 January 2009 by Terry Breese, a corporate affairs manager in Ottawa preparing for President Obama's first visit to Ottawa.
The journey will help ensure the government's survival of the confidence vote at the start of February on the federal budget, which will post Canada's first deficit for over ten years due to a relaunch plan of 30 to 40 million dollars.
No mention is found of the government having to adjourn parliament before Christmas to avoid being defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the proposed relaunch plan.
Another communication dated Jan 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington about the increasingly negative image of the United States transmitted by CBC.
The ambassador is concerned by broadcasts such as Border, Little Mosque on the Prairie, Intelligece and H2O, which contain unsubtle references to Maher Arar, to the No Fly List or again to rigorous interrogation by the CIA.
The other cable tells that during the first meeting, Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to receive Guantanamo prisoners.
M Kouchner replied “yes,” but on case-by-case basis.
The meeting ended with a paper to the State Secretary on Omar Khadr, a 15 year old Moslem of Canada origin.
"The Secretary agreed to review the case."
It should be noted that tempers started to heat about WikiLeaks website.
Tom Flanagan, a former adviser to Stephen Harper, declared on CBC waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be "assigned."
He echoes Mike Huckabee in the United States.
A global plan for renewing lighting.
Yesterday at Cancun UNO presented a plan for renovation of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries with a view to reducing almost onethird of the additional reduction needed to stabilise the planet's climate by 2020.
This ambitious plan is one of many concrete projects that UNO hopes to adopt at Cancun to counter the lack of mandatory reduction initiatives by industrialised countries.
According to the plan tabled yesterday, if incandescent bulbs, which still hold 50% to 70% of the market, were replaced by fluocompact bulbs or better still by electroluminescent diode bulbs (DEL or LED in English), the bulk of the 1.8 million tonnes of GES emitted on the planet to provide human beings with light, would be avoided.
Illumination is responsible for 8% of worldwide emissions.
This is equivalent to 70% of the emissions by world's motor vehicles.
The highly emissions countries such as the United States, China, Europe and others including Canada, adopted voluntary reduction plans to reduce global GES emissions from 53 Gt to 49 Gt.
Then it will be necessary to add further 5 Gt to stabilise the increase of climate warming by 2020 at 2°C to prevent loss of control.
In incandescent bulbs 95% of the energy is dissipated in the form of heat and only the remaining 5% produce light.
With fluocompact bulbs, the dissipation of energy is reduced by 75% and with the new DEL bulbs, the energy requirement is also reduced by double that amount.
Fluocompact bulbs last on average between 6000 and 10 000 hours.
The new DEL bulbs, which have a life expectancy of 25 000 hours and consume 80% less energy than incandescent bulbs, give an idea of the saving that could be achieved in a 100 country replacement plan.
The newly developed bulbs also work with rheostats, providing little heat.
And they contain no mercury.
The experts have voiced a few negative opinions about fluocompact bulbs, because they contain mercury and because they are dangerous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries unless they issue instructions.
The main source of mercury emission on the planet is not fluocompast bulb, but carbon thermal emission centres, which emit a lot of mercury to produce the electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs.
In the United States alone, these centres emit 25 000 tonnes of mercury a year.
The report details the gains, which every country would achieve through this international programme.
Examples include Indonesia saving thousands of dollars a year on electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, equivalent to 3.5 thermal centres, which costs 2.5 thousand million dollars.
Ivory Coast is nervously waiting for the announcement of the election results.
The UNO Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, has called for the publication "without delay" of the results of the Ivory Coast presidential election, on the expiration of the set period.
The Secretary-General stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay" stressed a spokesman for the head of UNO.
According to the declaration, all Ivory Coast parties and institutions should show responsibility and abstain from any initiatives pending the announcement of the provisional results.
However, despite pressures from foreign governments, the EOC has allowed the target date of Wednesday midnight to pass, without publishing the results three days after the Sunday voting.
About 30 minutes after the expiration of the set period the Independent Electoral Commission President "continued to work" on the announcement of the results.
The calls for the second round of the second elections started to become more frequent on Wednesday for the Election Commission to declare the name of the winner, Laurent Gbagbo or his opposition Alassane Ouattara.
The Gbagbo camp is counting on the cancellation by the Constitutional Council of "fraudulent" votes in the north, received by the ex-New Forces (FN) rebels since the September 2002 failed coup.
Pascal Affi N'Buessan, campaign director of the Ivory Coast president, stated that the intimidation of electors by the FN in north-western country had discouraged the political parties of the leaving president from voting.
Any election can be cancelled if complaints by Ghagbo are accepted by the Constitutional Council.
Gbagbo's enemies allege that the highest court of the coutry is not independent, since it is presided by Paul Yao N'Dré, a close political ally of Gbagbo.
Alassane Ouattara, the man from the north, who does not have any links with the ex-rebels, has described the delay in making the announcement as "unacceptable" and has asked Gbagbo to respect them, but has not gone so far as to declare victory.
The fellows believe that Gbagbo is blocking the publication of the results because he knows that he lost and that complaining to the Constitutional Council after having prevented the electoral commission from publishing the results would be illegal.
The second round of polling in the president’s election on Sunday was thought to have crowned the process of reunification and reconcilation of a country divided into two for years.
On Wednesday, UNO warned the Ivory Coast political class that it might be respoonsible for any violence.
Laurent Gbagbo finished at the top in the first round on 11 October, with 38% of votes against 32% for Alassane Ouattara, who received the public support of the former president Henri Konan Bedié (25% in the first round).
The unemployment rate in France has remained stable in the 3rd quarter.
The rate of unemployment in France according to the International Labour Office has remained stable at 9.3% in metropolitan France (9.7% taking account overseas Départements) based on preliminary seasonal variations (CVS) published on Tuesday by Insee.
The number of unemployed is 2.631 million in metropolitan France.
The data for the second quarter confirmed at 9.3% of native working population and 9.7 of the DOM.
One year of unemployment has risen by 0.1 points.
More broadly, 3.4 million persons in metropolitan France are not working during the third quarter but wish to work, whether or not they are available for work within two weeks.
The younger generation in the labor market has become worse with a fresh rise in unemployment rate to 24.2% in metropolitan France (+,9.2 points over three months +0.5 points over the year).
In the third quarter, 637 000 young people between 15 and 24 were unemployed (BIT).
Older people experienced a mild rise in unemployment to 6.4% in metropolitan France (+0.2 points over three months and over year), equal to 482 000 persons of 50 or over and 6.6% for the DOM.
Only 25-39 people benefitted from stable unemployment in the third quarter, being 8.3% in metropolitan France (-0.1 points over three months and +0.1 points over a year).
In 2006, Insee no longer publishes the annual unemployment rate, after arguments about its method of calculation.
On the other hand, Eurostat, the statistical agency of the European Union, continues to do so and on Tuesday announced a 9.8% rate for France (DOM included) in October after 9.9% in September.
Alexandre Guerini is under arrest.
Alexandre Guerini, 53, Director of Waste processing companies and brother of the President of the General Council of Bouches-du-Rhone, was arrested and sent to Luynes prison near Aix-en-Provence in the context of a investigation of public contracts presumed fraudulent.
According to his lawyer, Alexandre Guerini is accused of abusive use of public property, theft of public fund, receipt of stolen goods, active corruption and selling influence.
"Alexande Guereini is combative and will answer any questions which the magistrate may ask but not fantasies."
'It is easy to accuse him of many reprehensible actions, but quite another to prove them' declared his lawyer Florence Rault to APF.
Ms Guerini, brother of the strongest socialist man in the department, Jean-Noel Guerini, presented to his judge prior to his hearing through his lawyer.
One of his close friends, Philippe Rapezzi was also detained on Wedesday evening.
According to his lawyer, Me Lucien Simon, his client never do anything other than perform his duties.
Regarding contract awarding or the destination of the related fund, he had no knowledge of them, said Me Simon.
In this matter, Daniel Pinna, former Director-General of Servicies of the Aubagne conurbation was detained for questioning on Wednesday regarding theft of public funds and complicity and was released on police bail.
"My client has given explanations of the alleged claims against him."
3"The examining magistrate took this into account and did not deprive him of his freedom," said his lawyer, Me Yann Arnoux.
Four others were detained for questioning and released during the night Tuesday to Wednesday, two of them on bail, said the Assistant Public Prosecutor, Michel Raffin.
Michel Karabadjakian, Assistant Director of the Cleansing of Marseille Province Metropole (MPM) is being investigated for "sale of influence and passive corruption."
The two Aubagne conurbation employees, Michèle Duval and Christophe Bringuier, were arrested and xeroxed one for "theft of public property by a public service worker" and the other for "complicity in the theft of public funds."
The companion of Alexandre Guerini, Jeanne Peretti was questioned about "receiving stolen company roerty."
Among persons confronted with M. Guerini is Stephane Brunengo-Girard, who was arrested in a parallel affair involving fraudulent public contracts involving Corsica.
Investigators suspect his companies of having served for large scale money laundering.
The investigation is conducted in the context of several Court investigations of X in April 2009 following anonymous letters concerning presumed fraud in public contracts, particularly for waste disposal.
According to a source close to the investigation, the investigation focuses on the conditions of awarding and functioning of a discharge in La Ciotat, which collects Aubagne waste and waste from several towns of the Marseille urban community (MPM).
Clothilda Reiss: The Elysées has exaggerated the involvement of Syria
During over ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French intelligence worker arrested in Iran for "espionage" shocked diplomacy and underlined the deteriorating relations between Paris and Teheran.
All under careful surveillance of US diplomats.
The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde, reveal some of the background of this crisis.
The accounts describe how the Elysée explained its strategy to the Americans, going further than to give them advice on how to treat their own "hostage" in Iran crises (a small group of trippers).
The evidence shows how the French authorities have tried to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman was not balanced by the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian under arrest in France and sought by American justice for trafficking materials for the benefit of Iran’s nuclear programme.
The evidence shows how the French presidency tried to manipulate the media to give credence to the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, was the main cause for the release of Clotilde Reiss.
In reality, he had not done anything.
The diplomatic cable sent on 12 August 2009 to Paris is titled "Iran: French comments on how to manage cases of hostages."
The Elysée adviser on strategic matters, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quay of Orsay for North Africa and Middle East, Patrice Paoli, had a discussion with the American diplomat, Kathleen Alegrone.
Then they explain to her the French method.
The Americans advised the Americans to arrange for repatriation of their own nationals detained in Iran.
"Make a lot of noise," they said, "hammering repeatedly the words "human rights," "innocence" and "immediate release" in the media.
"You must not annoy the Iranian regime, which is sensitive to its image."
"Do it all more when Iranians ask you not to."
After efforts to discuss the matter through discreet channels have failed, silence will not solve anything, Iranians being past-masters of delaying tactics.
M. Richier adds that foreigners are a familiar Iranian tactic, taking hostages for political blackmail.
The release of Clotilde Reiss from prison (which will take place on 16 August, the day she took refuge in the French Embassy) would require the Iranians to pay a large sum of money (230 000 Eur as a caution).
The Elysée advised that the Elysée was expecting other hostage crises, a phenomenon that would get worse.
The Iranians might arrest another of some 1800 French citizens who live in Iran.
28.8.09
Clotilde Reiss has been out of prison for twelve days but is unable to leave Iran.
The information was broadcast: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose extradition for illegal traffic in sensitive electronic material to Iran the United States are demanding, was freed in Paris by a Court.
According to many observers, the American Embassy is considering this interesting coincidence.
For Washington which monitors Iranian illegal nuclear material acquisition networks, the release of Majid Khakavgand is a good news.
Has France accepted a deal?
The release of the Iranian woman against that of the Frenchwoman?
While François Richier provided assurance that this was not the case, he guaranteed that this was not the case.
Elysée was not only completely surprised by the Judge's decision, but also tried to oppose it.
The lawyer added that there were lively exchanges between the French Presidency and the Chief Justice at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie, but the French government could not change the Court ruling.
Ms Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand continues to be under close surveillance by the French secret service.
The Elysée adviser calls the number, hangs up and then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian is currently in a Paris building managed by the Iranian embassy.
During Clotilde Reiss' detention in Iran, the Elysée failed to control its efforts by communication and media leaks to create the impression that the Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad was playing an important and influential role as an intermediary.
The Americans observe this activity without irony and find that manipulation is fruitful because several Press articles reproduce the official French version.
A telegram dated 25 August 2009 mentions the media "blitz" by French officials.
What is the basis for so much gratitude to Mr Assad, asks the Paris Embassy.
While their declarations are full of praise, French officials privately admit that they only have the vaguest notion of what the Syrians really did.
The document then deals with the reasons why the Elysée published this fiction.
It states that the intense communication effort is trying to validate Sarkozy's policy of closer Syria.
A policy launched in 2008, which was seen by many critics in France and abroad as premature and without merit.
By exaggerating the role played by Syria, Paris is trying to show Syria how much praise it can get by playing a constructive role in the region.
The goal is also to spread discord between Syria and Iran.
American Embassy knows this from a reliable source.
On 11 August, François Richier told him that the French do not know if the Syrians have done anything.
Then they still thank them.
This may at least confuse Iranians.
Clotilde Reiss returns to France on 16 May 2010
NIcolas Sarkozy receives her at Elysée.
In a communique, he thanks the presidents of Brazil, Senegal and Syria for their "active role in the release of our fellow citizen."
No on-line games for young Koreans after midnight.
According to government authorities, South Korea will pass a law called “Cinderella” that will prevent adolescents from playing on-line games after midnight by bocking their access.
According to representatives of the Ministers of Culture and Family, a draft law will be submitted to the parliament in December to ask on-line game companies to block access of under 16 to their games after midnight.
A lot of children play these games all night and then experience difficulties in school and in daytime life.
They believe that this law is needed to protect their health and their right to sleep.
On-line games will now be available at 6 a.m.
The Minister stated that the companies would have one year to prepare themselves for the application of the law.
The government would also ask the companies to limit the daily access to these games by young people whose parents have requested this.
The software would also be available to people requesting it, free of charge software making it possible to limit time spent on Internet.
South Korea is one of the most "connected countries and the newspapers regularly report various facts linked to the use of the Internet.
The country is also undisputed champions of world online games.
In November, South Korea won four gold medals at World Cyber Games in a contest of 58 other countries.
World Championships 2018-2022: Fifa appoints organising countries.
The Fifa Executive Committee will appoint countries to organise World Cup matches in 2018 and 2022, a political choice, where influence and lobbying battles are likely to take precedence over technical criteria.
The fact is that the 2018 Fifa competition will be held in Europe, the traditional base of the game (4 candidates, England, Russia, Spain-Portugal and Netherlands-Belgium).
The 2022 tournament will be much more exotic, with Fifa aiming to establish new territories (Quatar, Australia) after a first African contest in 2010 or to pursue its introduction into the USA or the Far East (Japan, South Korea).
The list of the delegations (David Cameron, Price William, Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, Bill Clinton, the Emir of Qatar, the Heads of the Belgian and Dutch governments, Zidane, Beckham, Cruyff) give an idea of the economic and political challenges of a world competition.
Behind-the-scenes bargaining may last up to the last minute.
The rest of the candidates are difficult to establish a hierarchy among them.
According to a Fifa assessment report, the British, Spanish-Portuguese (2018) and American (2022) cases advance better than their competitors.
The considerations will not weigh much with the 22 members of the Executive Committee when it comes to voting.
The Sunday Times’ disclosures resulting in the suspension of two members of the Executive Committee (Reynald Temerii and Amos Adamu) may have damaged its chances of hosting the World Cup in 1966.
The BBC on Monday broadcast a documentary about three influential members of the Executive Committee, Ricardo Teizeira, Nicolas Leoz and Issa Hayatou.
Upsetting Fifa and annoying the British representatives, who have been in intense lobbying in recent weeks, mainly through David Beckham.
The head of the British government is aiming to repeat the successful coup of his predecessor Tony Blair, who in 2005 secured the choice of London as the venue of the 2012 Olympic Games.
This intense activity will suffice to shield England in the eyes of the Executive Committee?
Nothing is less certain, because the Spain-Portugal duo has no shortcomings, with its already completed stadia, its experience (World Cup 82, 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona, Euro 2004 in Portugal) and its football culture.
The dark economic and financial prospects of the two countries could cause cold water on their ambitions.
The possible repressions against the British and doubts about the solvency of Spain and Portugal only improve the position of Russia, which has become a powerful outsider, despite its lack (station, hotels, transport).
The Prime Minister Vladimir Putin decided not to travel to Zurich and denounced "unfair competition in the preparedness of voting" in a veiled reference to British Press claims against the Executive Committee members.
The bodies are being sprinkled with mud and attempts are made to compromise them, he added.
2022, USA with a decade of experience, appear to be the most likely favourites.
The world’s most important ecological power, the seat of the main sponsor of Fifa, the country seems to have a big lead over Japan and South Korea, who have separately built a very good project.
The new candidates seem premature for two countries, which jointly organized the 2002 trial.
Another threat: The award of the 2026 World Championship to China, ardently desired by Fifa, will in fact destroy Asian chances for 2022.
Regarding Qatar which has played great play in proposing futuristic stadia and Australia, Fifa would pursue its expansion into new regions, but these two countries offer more risk than certainty.
Like Japan and South Korea, Australia could also suffer from the weakness of European TV rights, the nerve centre of Fifa’s fighting.
Second mandate: the evidence
De Gaulle really hesited.
However, a few people believe that he does not.
Valery Giscard d'Estaing and Jacques Chirac had no hesitation.
And Nicolas Sakozy still less than they.
Elysée mandate tells different story.
The current Head of State will be a candidate in 2012.
The evidence contradicts the mystique of the presidency.
It is now necessary to pretend that the doubt had always existed.
In one sense as in other.
In 2006, even without believing it, friends of Jacques Chirac falsely claimed that a third mandate was not excluded.
On 15 November with a heavy air, Nicolas Sarkozy promise that he would make his decision "sometime in the fall of 2011"
The fact that on Tuesday night at Elysée before UMP deputies he called for two mandates evoked some feverish reflections.
This is the official announcement of his candidacy?
Far from.
The president only mentioned that the 2008 revised constitution limited the five year term to two.
The fact was stated, but he did not make an announcement.
This is not the first time he humorously mentions the president’s election at such meetings.
The husband told him that at best they only had seven and half years of him.
Rebelote in May 2010: Do not believe that I only thought about it afterwards.
The intentions of the day before yesterday do not make him more or less a candidate than those of the day before that.
If they occasionally occasion comments, the reason is twofold.
On the other hand, the acceleration of the progress of the socialist party Candidate Candidate.
The entry into the lists of Segolene Royal is not the entry into the lists of Nicolas Sarkozy, which causes him to unmask himself.
The reason is, however, that his 2012 candidacy is clearly what many socialists are calling for, an earlier plan of battle than was originally planned.
The bad polls, on the other hand.
The first time right-wing voters preferred the candidature of François Fillon to that of Nicolas Sarkozy (45% against 44%, according to EVA-L'Express).
The Prime Minister immediately announced that it had a candidate and that there was no debate about this in UMP.
Jean-Pierre Raffarin said if he believed that defeat was possible, he would not be a candidate.
Alain Juppé told in the face of evidence and by way of correction that the candidate always believed that he could win.
Euro: BCE ordered to buy State securities
The last annual meeting of the European Central Bank (ECB) board was aimed at specifying the methods of emerging from the crisis, or at least of announcing the end of a number of unconventional monetary policy operations, which have to be completed by the end of the year.
The European sovereign debt crisis obliges the issuing institute in Frankfurt to be less peremptory, because the situation is now more than tense on European obligation markets.
The political cost would be all the higher.
The French Minister of Finance, Christine Lagarde welcomed the active role of the BCE in resolving the European debt crisis.
The Central Bank did not wish to say if she thought that the Central Bank needed to do more, for example by increasing its programme of buying sovereign bonds.
She asked European partners to communicate her thoughts.
In Brussels on the day before, during his hearing before the European Parliament, the Chairman of the BCE, Jean-Claude Trichet kept quiet about his intentions, content with simply telling that the programme of secondary market buying State securities would continue and that they will see what will be decided at the meeting on Thursday.
The only certainty: The BCE would keep its principal rate of interest unchanged at 1%, historically the lowest since May 2009.
Factually, the obligatory Treasury purchases by the BCE doubled during last week to almost 1.35 million Euros.
The Irish and Portuguese bonds are now in the circulation.
In total, Eurosystem central banks have acquired 67 million millions of Euros since May 2010.
There is no doubt among market operators about the expectations of a desire to acquire (see page 29).
Economists no longer expect any marked change in cap.
The latter continues to offer unlimited cash loans on generous terms and for periods from one week to three months.
Economists now expect that the facility will be extended by some months.
Michael Schubert, an economist at Commerzbank cannot imagine that it will modify its programme to any great extent.
The WHO says that this would cause new short-term tensions.
Norbest Bräms, an economist at Sal says that a gradually exit is more likely to occur in the first quarter of 2011.
Oppenheim.
Norbet Bräms adds that on the level of its intervention in the public debt market, the BCE would have to make adequate purchases of these bonds to revive the lacklustre market.
The large exposure of European banks to sovereign debt markets of the Euro zone, the issuing institute has no choice but to maintain a presence in the market.
The important bonds manager yesterday stressed that the Bank must at all costs address the shortage of investors in the market and prevent a boom of payments by the most vulnerable States.
If interest rates drop, States will be more anxious to reduce or stabilize their debt.
This is the price of safeguarding the Euro.
In Italy, the Berlusconi government is turning its back.
After a disquieting week for Italy, the situation yesterday was a little better with the reflux of 10-year compulsory rates.
Return to precarious calm.
The regional presidents reported that Giulio Tremonti described the situation as "insoluble" and that he was waiting for an unforeseen weekend.
In any event on Tuesday the difference between long-term rates reached a record of 210 base points and the price of CDS contracts took off to reach 263 points, causing some anxiety in Rome.
In a meeting of the Council of Ministers, Silvio Berlusconi pointed to the difference between Spain and Germany by over 400 base points.
The right arm, Gianni Letta, reportedly very concerned by market turbulence and possible transmission from Ireland.
The good news is that Italy, the third largest economy of the Eurozone, is not like Greece and Ireland.
The good news is that it is like Portugal.
The problem is lack of growth and inadequate tax revenue, which could place the State in a risk of no longer being able to meet its financial requirements.
The most recent forecasts from Brussels have been a cold shower on the government.
Italian growth is now expected to be 1.1% in 2011 and 1.4% in 2012. The Senate budget now under scrutiny is expected to record 1.3 and 2.0% respectively.
The European Commission forecasts that the public deficit will be 4.3% of the GDP next year (versus 3.9% forecast by the government) and 3.5% in 2012 (instead of the forecast of 2.7%).
This is the reason for the rumor of a new collective budget of 7 million million Euros, which might be drawn up after the holiday.
The economic affairs commissioner Olli Rehn said if necessary, new austerity measures will be taken.
The moment, Italy receives support from international institutions.
Arrigo Sadun, the Italian administrator of the International Monetary Fund in charge of Italy at the IMF ensures that the Italian economy is sound.
Pier Carlo Padoan, the head of the OCDE, states that no problem in the future, short or long term, because despite its large debt (119.2% of GIP in 2011, NDLR), stabilisation efforts from Italy are smaller than those demanded from other countries.
There is still the question of political instability.
On 14 December, Silvio Berlusconi will face a motion of censure in the Chamber of Deputies, following which an early general election could occur in March.
The period not suited to taking decisions in the event of a serious crisis would then begin.
Europeans are thinking about ways to strengthen anti-crisis devices.
Christine Lagarde hammered the following home yesterday at a Press conference in Paris:
Although that was only relative, the recent detente of European State bonds on European State bonds brought water to the mills of governments and of the BCE.
It is still unclear if a start of normalisation is expected.
The Standard & Poor agency announced that it might devalue the Portuguese debt, the target of most today's speculation.
The economists of Exane BNP Paribas feel that as in May, there is a real lack of clarity and political transparency in banking systems in particular.
Political time moves much slowly than market time.
Aware of this gap and of the dangers which it holds, European countries are intensifying their discussions to strengthen their existing anti-crisis devices.
Informal consultations between Finance Ministers of the most directly affected countries and more widely their G20 opposite numbers are well advanced.
In addition, the Eurogroup and the Ecofin meetings start next week.
BCE is meeting today.
On the agenda is the future of unconventional support for Eurozone countries in the market collimator (see above).
The European financial stability fund (FESF) Executive Director Klaus Regling began a tour of Asia starting from Singapore, to inform Far East investors about the progress of the European crisis.
The purpose of these visits is not to raise funds, but it is certainly intended to prepare the ground for that.
The first issue of FESF bonds is expected next month.
Today, an official American representative told Reuter that the United States would support a possible increase of funds for direct supplemental involvement of the IMF.
Front line countries such as Spain and Portugal are preparing to adopt structural reforms, particularly concerning the organisation of the labor market.
Reforms that are added to austerity measures with a more rapid effect.
Lisbon and Madrid wish to embark on a different path from that taken by Greece and Ireland.
Both are anxious to avoid any circumstances asking for international help before introducing its own budgetary corrective measures and deciding on structural reforms essential for long-term confidence.
Lastly, European funds are discussing options to speed up the process of normalisation of sovereign debt markets.
In Paris on 24 November, Axel Weber first presented the idea that if the 750 million Euros released by Europe and the IMF were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to resort to the portfolio.
Economists at Barclay Capital, a top European sovereign debt market player, feel that an increase of about 100 million Euros, preferably in the form of direct cash injection, would suffice.
The vehicle exists: The vehicle exists in the form of the European financial stabilisation mechanism, currently containing 60 million million Euros.
A piece of advice likely to be examined carefully in European capitals.
Most importantly, if market conditions prevail.
Snow and ice: 24 provinces have received an orange warning.
Snow episodes still cause traffic problems, especially in the secondary network in Brittany and may affect some economic activities.
20 provinces are on orange alert due to a risk of snow and ice.
Eure, Eure and Loir, Dengue and Gironde have joined the 20 already orange alert areas, 18 since Wednesday afternoon and two, Dordogne and Gironde later in the night.
According to Meteo France, continued snow flurries are affecting the north of the Gironde and both Charentes and it is snowing lightly over the France.
Snow drops from 2 to 5 cm, 7 to 10 cm in places, are expected in the respective areas and 1 to 3 cm, indeed up to 5 cm in Paris region.
The areas in question are Charente, Charente-Maritime, Cotes d'Armor, Finistere, Gironde, Poitou and those of the northern regions of Northern France, Northern Ireland and Limousin.
According to Meteo France, snow episodes are sufficiently marked to create traffic problems and to disruption some economic activities.
In Cotes d’Armor, access to vehicles over 7/5 tonnes to several major roads is restricted, including the Guingamp-Lannion and the Saint-Brieuc-Loudeac roads.
The traffic on the Brittany secondary network is very difficult and the gendarmerie recommends that vehicles should only be used where necessary.
In Picard, all school transport on Thursday has been prohibited.
No special measures are planned for Wednesday evening to restrict the traffic of heavy loads.
The province calls on all drivers to exercise the highest possible care on road and to adapt their driving.
The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC) has asked all air transport companies to cancel on Thursday 25% of their flights to Roissy airport and 10% to Orly airport due to expected snowfall.
The DGAC recommends air passengers to contact their carrier.
In Great Britain, Gatwick airport in south London and Edinburgh airport in Scotland will be closed until Thursday morning.
Metro Grand Paris: First financial proposals;
Since the time when the debate about modernisation of transport in the Ile-de-France reached its high point, thousands of millions of Euros have been haemorrhaging.
In the discussion of means.
The mention is made of the 23 million million Euros for the Grand Paris metro which the Grand Paris company is to build.
To start this SGP, the State announced a contribution of 4 tousans million Euros.
In the theoretical scheme, it is this sum that will then allow the SGP to borrow in the market for its double loop financing.
Today, the first calculations have begun.
The 2010 parliamentary finance commission’s report on rectification financing examined this morning, contains the devices needed to find the initial sum.
There are two ways to increase the tax on offices in the Republic of France.
The first, says Article 15 of the draft law, is for the establishment of the Grand Paris company.
It is defined as: The yield of this tax is 117 million Euros annually.
The second is a recasting of an existing office tax, in order to modernise, to increase its yield and allocate this increase to the Grand Paris company.
How much will this bring in?
Mystery.
This is not listed in the text.
It is far short of the 4 million million.
The expose states that tax resources are added to the 4 million million Euros of investment by the State and passed to the Grand Paris company as the project progresses.
SGP does not find this system shocking.
The explanation is that from the moment the two sources of cash were created (the two taxes, ndlr) it would be possible to cover the cost of three years of study and then resort to the 4 million million Euros.
"This would be included in the budget and drawn as the project develops"
The SGP estimates that the 4 million million Euros would be included in 2013 in the 2014 budget.
This device, which has already included the promised 4 million million Euros, may cause somewhat exciting parliamentary debates.
First public session on 7 December.
Vengeful hackers and spies are waiting.
The WikiLeaks affair has double significance.
On the other hand, it is a scandal, which only looked scandalous in light of the hypocrisy which reigns in relations between States, citizens and the Press.
On the other hand, it announces significant international change and shows a future dominated by regression.
But let us take things in the right order.
The first aspect of WikiLeaks is a confirmation of the fact that every secret service case (of any country) is solely based on Press cuttings.
The "extraordinary American revelations about Berlusconi's sexual habits only report what it could read for months in any daily (except in those belonging to Berlusconi), and the silly caricature profile of Khadafi has long been a cabaret sketch material.
The rule according to which secret files may only contain already known news is essential for secret services dynamic and not only in the present century.
If you visit a library dedicated to American publications, you will see that every work repeats what was already written in previous works.
The author of occult texts does not like to do previously unpublished research (and knows nowhere to look for news about what is not exist), but because those who devote their time to occultism do not believe what they already know and confirm what they have learned.
This is Dan Brown's success mechanism.
The same applies to secret files.
The informant is lazy and lazy (or limited) is also the head of secret service (otherwise he could be an editor at Liberation).
The secret information about Berlusconi, which the American Embassy in Rome sent to the State Department, was the same as that which Newsweek had published the week before.
What caused the revelations about these files to make so much noise?
On the other hand, they believe that every cultivated person already knows that diplomatic missions have, at least since the end of the Second World War and since heads of State could telephone one another or fly to meet for dinner, lost their diplomatic function and except for some little representation exercises, become intelligence centres.
Every investigation film viewer knows this very well and it is hypocritical to pretend that he does not.
However, repeating it in public does not void the duty to be hypocritical and only places American diplomacy in a bad light.
Secondly, the idea of a hacker being able to acquire the deepest secrets of the most powerful country in the world represents a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department.
The scandal affects both victims and executioners equally.
Then let us look at the profound nature of what has happened.
The old world was defined by Big Brother, who controlled every action of his subjects.
The Orwellian prophecy proved to be absolutely true, since being able to be completely control thanks to the phone, the hotel visit, the motorway taken and so on, the citizen became a total victim of the power eye.
If one demonstrates that even the secrets of power cantan escape the control of a hacker, the control report becomes unidirectional and can circulate.
Citizens control every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker as the citizen's avenger, can learn all the secrets of power.
How can a power last if it can no longer keep its secrets?
The fact is that a real secret is an empty secret and can never be discovered; it is also true that knowing everything about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is a secret without secret, because it is public domain, but to disclose that Hillary Cliton’s secrets were empty secrets means taking away all her power.
WikiLeaks did not injure Sarkozy or Merkel, but it significantly injured Clinton and Obama.
What will be the consequences of this injury on a very powerful entity?
The future States will no longer be able to place on line secret information, which would be like posting it on a street corner.
It is also clear that with current technologies it is unwise to hope to discuss confidential reports on the phone.
Nothing is easier than to discover if and when a Head of State has flown away and to contact one of his/her colleagues.
How can private and secretive reports be discussed in future?
While I know that for the moment my forecast is science fiction and fantasy, I have to imagine government agents who travel discreetly on routes which cannot be checked and that they have learned messages by heart, or have secretly written information in the heel of a shoe.
The information will be on a single copy kept in a locked drawer; essentially, Watergate espionage was less successful than WikiLeaks.
I had occasion to write that technology goes forward like a crab, namely backwards.
A century after the invention of wireless telegraphy revolutionised communication, Internet re-established wire telegraphy (telephone).
Video clips (analogue) have allowed cinema research workers to explore a film step by step, going backward and forward and discovering all the secrets of montage.
With high speed trains one can travel from Rome to Milan in three hours, while going by air takes about three and half hours.
It is not therefore unusual that politics and communication techniques revert to horse-drawn carriages.
Last observation.
Other days the Press tried to understand what was secretly going on in the diplomatic houses.
Now it is the diplomatic bodies which ask the Press for confidentiality information.
Climate: How France takes a swipe at its finance promises.
A year after the Copenhagen agreement it is time to look at the observance of the promise of fast finance (called fast start finance) by developed countries.
Large scale tampering appears.
The Copenhagen agreement requires developing countries to provide 30 million million dollars between 2010 and 2012.
The European Union promised 7.2 thousand million Euros over three years and France 1.25 thousand million Euros (420 million a year).
The European Union tried to convince its partners of the authenticity of its rapid start finance promise, submitting a report detailing its Member States’ action, Press Conferences, major side events, distribution of brochures...
The operational transparency is appreciated and valued at its right value: developing countries and the civil society are doing the same and at the same level of precision.
The European Union announces having allocated in 2010 2.2 million million Euros, a good token of observance of its promise of 7.2 million Euros in 2012.
Looking at details, things are more complicated.
This money must be "new and additional" to ensure that a supplementary effort is made without detrimental impacts on public development assistance.
Unfortunately, there is no agreement about what "new and additional" means.
The European Commission has proposed a harmonization, but some Member States have blocked the procedure.
Today, everyone chooses what suits him/her best.
The European Commission, for example, took for reference the year 2009; international finance is maintained and it adds 150 million over 3 years as fast start finance.
Other countries chose similar references in terms of year or level of public development assistance.
In contrast, France considers all 2010 new projects as "new and additional projects."
In other words, there is no reference to the previous years, or globally, of public development assistance.
Concretely, the total support given by France to developing countries can remain stable (or even decrease) because France maintains that it is keeping its commitment in response to new and additional finance.
Other important element is the separation of gifts and loans.
There is no rule and everyone chooses his own method of calculation.
Some, like France, consider that a Euro lent is equal to a Euro donated.
Clearly, this is difficult to justify; the effort is not coparable.
If the custom of loans can be justified for certain investments which are profitable (often projects linked to emissions which require more efficient technology) it is unreasonable to call a Euro which one will recoup as a donated Euro.
It needs only reason to recognize that it "observes" its commitments of 420 million Euros by making 91.5% of loans (399.8 million Euros) and 8.5% of donations (36,1 million Euros) - see European Union document for your own verifcation.
It is the only country in the Union to use loans on such a large scale.
Germany is lending 46%, while Denmark, The Netherlands and Slovak (among others) maintain their commitment with 100% as donations.
In other words, when the great majority of the European Union gives 1 Euro to meet its commitment, France only gives 10 centimes and regards its effort as similar.
A nice sleight of hand!
Summary: France operates in its fast start finance double blackmail: on one hand on the evolution of the action over time and on the reality of the financial effort.
By only spending 36.1 million Euros it believes that it is generating a belief that it is spending 420 million "new and additional" Euros as it promised.
The manipulation of the Finance Minister (because it appears that it is Bercy that implemented the arbitrage) could have double negative impacts, both within the European Union (why should other Member States continue to give if sufficient lending is available?) and in the negotiations, since the developing countries are not completely duped.
The early finance chapter is only a small, relatively short term matter in relation to all the discussions about climate change.
It can be popped more sand in the huge machine, the UNFCCC.
However, we hope that this is not the case.
In any case, it is essential to draw lessons from this first year of early finance.
First of all, France could announce a change in its accountancy method for 2011 and 2012 in order to honour its commitments and to equal equity with other European Union countries.
It is also possible to promote the discussions about long-term financing stakes (another crucial chapter currently discussed) but it is not possible to avoid the question of "additionality" or the method of accountancy of loans.
France could change its position to be as progresive on these stakes as it is on others.
The hope is based on the new Environment Minister, Ms Kosciusko-Morizet, who will arrive in Casun next week.
A surprise announcement on France's fast start and on the view of "additionality" and the use of loans would increase international confidence in progress in these discussions.
Alert on pesticides consumed by children.
Future Generations Association (formally Movement for Future Generations Rights and Respect) reports that a child of 10 consumes in one day 81 different chemical substances.
The association which predicts that its results do not have any statistical value, but indicate the problem being addressed has bought in markets of the Oise and Paris in July and September, the basket of foodstuffs generally consumed in four meals by a child of ten.
The meals included official recommendations, five pieces of fresh fruit and vegetables, three dairy products and 1.5 litres of water, as well as delicacies, were examined in clinical research laboratories dealing with chemicals, pesticides, heavy metals and other pollutants.
The balance sheet is staggering: 81 chemical substances, including 42 potentially or probably carcinogenic and five definitely carcinogenic, as well 37 substances able to induce endocrine disorders, according to studies by several institutions such as the International Cancer Research Centre.
According to the Association, even if in most cases the legal limits of each chemical substance are not exceeded, our investigation shows that the reality of exposure to potentially carcinogenic contaminant is very concerning.
For breakfast, butter and milk alone contain over ten possible and three proven carcinogenic residues and almost twenty potentially damage the hormone system.
An apple from Brazil contains traces of six chemical substances, including a fungicide, prohibited in France.
The same applies to beans from Kenya included in a luncheon, in which the study found traces of a powerful insecticide prohibited in the European Union.
In addiiton, minced steak, canned tuna, even a baguette and chewing gum contained pesticides and other chemicals.
Tapwater contained nitrates and chlorophyll.
The most chemically rich salmon steak was the "richest" with 34 chemical residues, and even the plastic plate used for warming the meal in the microwave was not exempted.
According to the study, the final risk for the consumer in this "contaminant cocktail" is probably underestimated.
The European Ecology Alliance - the Greens proposed, in view of the urgency of the situation, the introduction of a pesticides moratorium to stop the growth of civilisation's diseases.
In July, a study by the European Food Safety Agency pointed to the presence of 365 different pesticides in fruit and vegetables consumed in Europe, including 76 in cereals.
