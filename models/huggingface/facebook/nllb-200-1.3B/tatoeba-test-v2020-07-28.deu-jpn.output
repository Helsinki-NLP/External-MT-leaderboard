What song is that? I've heard it before, but I can't remember the title.
You must be tired from the long journey.
Tom and Mary When I was a kid, I loved Tom and Mary. I read this book to the last minute.
I take back my comment.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
He contradicted my testimony.
I'm a law officer.
Sometimes he can be a strange boy.
He showed up with his new car.
I got the letter he wrote.
How many eggs are in the fridge?
I wet my shoes.I wet my shoes.
Thomas, tell him to stop following me.
He is a very solitary person.
The thief reluctantly admitted his guilt.
His geography is insufficient.
She shrugged.
They were afraid they'd be overheard.
You have a too romantic view of the world.

I looked around.
I'll bleach the shirt to remove the stain.
Is this the ticket?
Tom has only ten minutes for his lunch.
Is that true?
Spontaneously, I decide to take a detour.
Don't let me down. I'm not going to let you down.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
Where are we going tonight, to an amusement park? Or should we go see a movie?
What do you think of America?
Tom became ill because of overeating.
Can I turn the TV off?

Tom is not sure what Mary intends to do.
Tom is red in the face.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️

I get yelled at if I'm late!
Are you still mad at me?No, not at all.
Add some pepper.
I got your e-mail address from Mr. Wilder.
Tom is a coach.
This coat fits you.
We crossed the river in a boat.
We lost almost every away game.
She's making progress.
Tom became depressed because of overwork.
He was restrained with the drinking.
Tom is in London on business right now.
I said get out!
I'm crazy about golf.
After we'd gone a while, we came to the lake.
I'm a teacher too.
I've changed my mind.I've changed my mind.
Why did you lie?
If you flatter him, he'll do anything for you.
She didn't answer.
Are you sleepy?
I knew it would be fun today.
When did you buy this?
Long hair is out of fashion right now.
It's important that we think about the future of the world.

It's against the law to carry weapons.
Let me buy you a drink.
She demands the impossible.
I'm ashamed of my son's laziness.
I pick fresh herbs in the spring field, while the snow falls down my sleeve.
He kept lying.
It's dangerous to bathe in this river.It's dangerous to bathe in this river.
Sorry to call so late, but I was dying to hear your voice.

The trees have begun to bud.
I negotiated the price with him.
He sat down on the chair.
I have a lot of money.
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
