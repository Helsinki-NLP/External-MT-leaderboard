Members of the Welsh Assembly worried about being seen as puppets
Welsh elected officials are appalled by a proposal to replace their title with the initials MWP (Member of the Welsh Parliament).
This proposal arises from the proposed change of the name of the Assembly, which would become the Welsh Parliament.
In the political sphere, some Members of the House feel that this could be derided.
A Labour MP said that his group was concerned that the symbol  rhymed with Twp and Pwp .
For those of you who are not from Wales: in Welsh, twp means stupid, and pwp means crotch.
According to one of its members, Plaid Cymru (the Welsh Party) is not satisfied and has proposed other formulas.
The Conservative party would be open to a name change, but noted that the distance between MWP and Muppet is narrow.
In this context, in Welsh, the letter w is pronounced as the letter u in the Yorkshire region of English.
The Assembly Commission, which is currently preparing legislation introducing the name change, said that the final decision on the appointment of members of the Assembly is up to the members of the Assembly.
The Government of Wales Act 2017 gives the Welsh Assembly the power to change its name.
In June the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposal to designate the Assembly as the Welsh Parliament, which received broad support.
On the issue of the title of members, the Commission leans in favour of Members of the Welsh Parliament (or WMP); however, a large majority of Welshmen prefer MWP.
It appears that members of the House are making other suggestions, but the effort to reach consensus could prove a real headache for the Speaker of the House, Elin Jones, who is expected to table a name change bill in the coming weeks.
The reform legislation will include further changes to the functioning of the Assembly, including rules on the exclusion of members and the design of the committee system.
The members of the Assembly will take the final decision on the name issue during the debates on the bill.
Macedonia: referendum on changing the name of the country
The Macedonians will decide on Sunday whether their country should henceforth be called  Republic of North Macedonia .
The popular vote was organized in an attempt to resolve a decades-old dispute between the country and its Greek neighbor, for whom Macedonia is the name of one of its provinces.
Athens has long insisted that the name Macedonia constitutes a claim to its territory and has repeatedly vetoed the accession of its neighbour to the European Union and NATO.
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov, who opposed the referendum, said he would ignore the results.
However, supporters such as Prime Minister Zoran Zaev maintain that the name change is only a small price to pay for joining the EU and NATO.
Harlem: churches in difficulty, bells of St. Martin's silenced
 The elderly people I have spoken to say that traditionally there was a bar and a church on every street corner, Mr Adams said.
 There is none today 
He thinks it's normal that bars are becoming scarce.
Today,  we don't hang out in the same way anymore, he explains.
 We used to go to the bar as if we were at the neighbor's house, but that's not the case anymore. 
As for the churches, the money from the sale of buildings will run out much earlier than the leaders imagine and this worries him: sooner or later, they will return to square one.
He adds that churches could be replaced by condominium complexes, inhabited by individuals who will not help maintain the last sanctuaries in the neighborhood.
 The people who will buy condominiums in these buildings will be largely white people who will precipitate the closing of all churches, as they are unlikely to become members, he worries.
Before Harlem became a black metropolis, white congregations built both churches: Metropolitan Community in 1870, and St. Martin's 10 years later.
The original white Methodist congregation left the area in the 1930s.
A black congregation, which had been preaching in the surrounding area, took possession of the building.
St. Martin's Church was taken over by a black community led by the Reverend John Howard Johnson, who initiated a boycott of the shops on 125th Street, one of the main shopping streets in Harlem, where blacks struggled to get jobs or promotions.
In 1939, a fire destroyed the building, but Father Johnson's parishioners were preparing to rebuild and ordered a new carillon,
that Father Johnson's son and successor to the leadership of St. Martin's Church, the Reverend David Johnson, proudly called the bells of the poor people "the poor people's bells".
Tiffany Ng (University of Michigan), the professional who played it in July, gave it a completely different name:  a cultural treasure  and  an irreplaceable historical instrument .
She also mentions that it was the first carillon in the world played by a black musician, Dionisio A. Lind, who, 18 years ago, took the place of the larger carillon at Riverside Church.
Mr. Merriweather claims that St. Martin did not replace him.
In recent months, there has been much talk of the architectural and entrepreneurial stirring, provoked by the lay elite of the church on the one hand, and the Episcopal diocese on the other.
In July, the parish council, the governing body of lay officials, informed the diocese that it was concerned that the diocese would impose the costs on it, even though it had not been involved in recruiting the professionals.
Some parishioners complained of the lack of transparency on the part of the diocese.
California: 13-year-old boy injured by shark at lobster fishery
Authorities say a shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old boy Saturday while he was fishing for lobster in California on the opening day of the season.
The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon Beach in Encinitas.
Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV, the San Diego television station, that he had been diving with friends for half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the boy screaming for help and paddled to get him out of the water.
At first, Chad thought the boy was screaming for joy at having a catch, then he realized that he was actually
I was bitten.
As he approached the young man, Hammel noticed that he had an open fracture of the clavicle.
"I was yelling for everyone to get out of the water: There's a shark!" says Chad.
The boy was evacuated to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego, where he remains in critical condition.
The species of shark responsible for the attack is unknown.
At a press conference, rescue chief Larry Giles said a shark had been sighted a few weeks earlier but was not a dangerous species.
He added that the victim suffered traumatic injuries to the upper torso.
Authorities closed access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami Beach in Ecinitas for 48 hours, for investigation and security reasons.
Giles said there are more than 135 species of sharks, but most are considered to be harmless.
Sainsbury's plans to enter the British beauty market
Sainsbury's is taking over Boots, Superdrug and Debenhams and filling them with supermarket-like stores filled with beauty and cosmetics and managed by experts in the field.
As part of a major breakthrough in the UK's £2.8 billion beauty market, which continues to grow while fashion and home goods sales are falling, wider ranges of beauty products will be trialled in 11 stores and applied to others if the experiment proves successful.
Supermarkets are now investing in the beauty market in order to reuse the space previously occupied by televisions, microwaves and other household items.
Sainsbury's said it would increase the volume of its offerings to up to 3,000 cosmetic items, which will include brands such as Revlon, Essie, Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw for the first time.
The existing ranges of L'Oreal, Maybelline and Burt's Bees will also have more space in similar areas to those of shops such as Boots.
The supermarket is also relaunching its Boutique make-up line to offer a majority of products not tested on animals, an increasingly important criterion among young consumers.
In addition, the fragrance retailer Fragrance Shop will test concessions in two Sainsbury's stores, the first opened last week in Croydon, south London, and a second is due to open later this year in Selly Oak, Birmingham.
Supermarket managers are struggling to attract consumers, who are increasingly shopping online and heading to local stores for everyday groceries.
Mike Coupe, managing director of Sainsbury's, said that outlets will increasingly resemble department stores as the supermarket chain attempts to counter the discount stores Aldi and Lidl by offering more services and non-food products.
Sainsbury's has set up Argos outlets in hundreds of stores and has also opened the doors of several Habitat stores since buying the two chains two years ago, which the group says has helped to boost sales of consumer goods and make acquisitions more profitable.
Previous attempts to restructure the pharmaceutical and cosmetics divisions of the UK chain had failed.
In the early 2000s, Sainsbury's attempted a partnership with Boots, but it ended after a dispute over the distribution of profits from pharmacies in supermarkets.
It was only after selling its 281 pharmacies for £125 million to Celesio, the owner of the Lloyds pharmacy chain, three years ago that the new strategy was put into effect.
Lloyds was to play a role in this, introducing a wide range of high-end skin care brands, including La Roche-Posay and Vichy, to four stores.
Paul Mills-Hicks, commercial director of Sainsbury's, announced that the appearance of the beauty products' shelves had been changed to improve the customer experience.
 We have also invested in training to enable our staff to offer sound advice.
Our range of brands is designed to meet all types of needs and, thanks to the beautification of our shelves and the ideal location of our premises, our dominance of the cosmetics market is now undeniable and is changing shopping habits", added Mr Mills-Hicks.
Peter Jones' anger after Holly Willoughby pulled out of a £11m deal
The star of the television programme Dragon's Den, Peter Jones, has expressed his anger after announcing that host Holly Willoughby has withdrawn from a £11 million contract with her home decoration brand to focus on her new contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Willoughby doesn't have time to deal with the Truly home decor and accessories brand.
The two protagonists' activity has been compared to Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop brand.
The 37-year-old This Morning host announced on Instagram that she was retiring.
Holly Willoughby infuriated Peter Jones, the star of Dragon's Den, by withdrawing from their successful textile and interior decorating business at the last minute, to devote himself to her new exclusive contracts with Marks & Spencer and ITV.
Sources said Jones was furious when the TV darling revealed in a tense meeting at the Dragon's Den star's business empire headquarters in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, that his new contracts, worth £1.5 million, would no longer allow him to run Truly, their brand of interior decoration and accessories.
The Truly brand has been likened to that of actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Goop, and could have doubled the value of the actress' estimated £11 million fortune.
When Willoughby, 37, announced on Instagram that she was leaving Truly, Jones jumped on her private jet to join one of her second homes outside Britain.
According to a source, Truly was by far one of Holly's top priorities.
And on the way to securing its future for the next two decades.
His decision left everyone speechless.
No one could have imagined what would happen on Tuesday, the launch was so close.
Marlow's chair is filled with merchandise ready to be sold.
Experts believe that the departure of the This Morning host, who is one of Britain's most bankable celebrities, could cost the company millions, due to significant investments in products ranging from pillows and candles to clothing and interior items, and the risk of a delayed launch.
It could also end a long-standing friendship.
Willoughby and her husband Dan Baldwin, parents of three children, were close friends of Jones and his wife Tara Capp for 10 years.
Holly Willoughby co-founded Truly with Capp in 2016; Jones, 52, joined the group as president in March of that year.
The couples were on vacation together and Peter Jones owns 40% of Baldwin's TV production company.
Willoughby is expected to become the brand ambassador for M&S and will take over from Ant McPartlin as host of ITV's I'm A Celebrity.
A source close to Jones said last night that he would not comment on his business dealings.
The debate was heated, but in the end we love each other
Trump mocked the media for criticizing him for making a comment that some deemed "unfitting of a president" and for being so positive about the North Korean leader.
 Why has President Trump given in so much? 
He laughed, taking on the voice of a TV reporter.
I didn't give up anything at all.
He said Kim had expressed his support for a second meeting after Trump called the first, in Singapore in June, a major step towards denuclearisation of North Korea.
However, the negotiations on denuclearisation are at a standstill.
More than three months after the June summit in Singapore, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told world leaders at the UN General Assembly on Saturday that he saw no corresponding response from the United States to North Korea's first disarmament moves.
He regretted that the US was continuing to impose sanctions to maintain pressure.
In his rally speech Trump offers a far more optimistic perspective.
"Everything is fine with North Korea", the US president says.
We've been to the brink of armed conflict.
 Millions of people are said to have been killed.
We have a great relationship now.
According to Trump, his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results: the end of missile testing, the release of hostages, and the return of the remains of American servicemen to their families.
He also justified his unusual approach to Kim's relationship.
 It's so easy to play the role of chairman, but instead of having 10,000 people trying to get into this packed arena, there are barely more than 200 standing in front of me, he criticised, pointing his finger at the crowd.
Tsunami: Island devastated and hundreds killed in Indonesia
After the earthquake that shook Lombok, the help of foreign NGOs was supposedly not necessary.
More than 10% of the population of Lombok was dispersed, but no national disaster was declared, a condition for the release of international aid.
 Unfortunately, they have made it clear on many occasions that they do not want international help, which makes things a bit more complicated, said Ms Sumbung.
While Save the Children is setting up a team to travel to Palu, it is still unclear whether work on the ground will be allowed.
The spokesman for the National Disaster Management Agency, Mr Sutopo, said that the Indonesian authorities were assessing the situation in Palu to determine whether international agencies would be allowed to contribute to humanitarian aid.
Despite the constant shocks, the country is still severely lacking in resources to protect itself from the vagaries of nature.
Shelters have been set up in Aceh, but they are rare in other coastal areas.
Although a warning was issued, no sirens were sounded in Palu, which no doubt contributed to the loss of life.
Even under ideal conditions, moving from one Indonesian island to another is not easy.
Natural disasters further complicate the use of transport.
A hospital ship that had been posted to Lombok to treat the victims is now en route to Palu, but it will take at least three days to reach the site of the latest disaster.
Indonesian President Joko Widodo has made the reform of dilapidated infrastructure a central issue in his election campaign and has spent considerable sums to repair roads and railways.
The lack of funds has however undermined Joko's government, which is due to stand for re-election next year.
The Indonesian head of state is also under pressure from the continuing ethnic tensions in the country, where members of the Muslim majority practice their faith in a more conservative way.
Over a thousand Indonesians lost their lives and tens of thousands were driven from their homes amidst street clashes between Christians and Muslims, armed with machetes, bows and arrows and other crude weapons.
Liverpool striker Daniel Sturridge has been given a free kick against Chelsea
Daniel Sturridge saved Liverpool a defeat in the Premier League against Chelsea, scoring in the 89th minute, Saturday at Stamford Bridge (London).
Sturridge was given a pass by Xherdan Shaqiri as he was about 30 yards from Chelsea's goals, and his team were leading 1-0.
He shot into the ball on his left, before escaping a shot to the second post.
The ball flew over the repair area before heading to the upper right corner of the net.
The ball eventually reaches Kepa Arrizabalaga and ends its journey to the bottom of the cage.
"I was just trying to get in, try to get the ball, but players like Shaq always shoot as far as they can, so I tried to buy as much time as possible", Sturridge told LiverpoolFC.com.
I saw Kante coming to check and without really thinking much I decided to shoot.
Chelsea led 1-0 at half-time after a goal from Belgian star Eden Hazard in the 25th minute.
The Blues forward tailed a pass to Mateo Kovacic, before slipping to the midfield and sprinting to the Liverpool side.
Kovacic made a quick back-and-forth in the middle of the field,
Then he fired a magnificent deep-firing shot that brought Hazard to the surface.
Hazard passed the defence and finished his run in the net from the second post, with a left-foot shot behind Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson Becker.
Liverpool will face Napoli in the Champions League group stage on Wednesday at 3pm at the San Paolo Stadium in Naples, Italy.
Chelsea will play Videoton in the UEFA Europa League, at 3pm on this Thursday in London.
Indonesia: death toll from tsunami reaches 832
The disaster management agency said Sunday morning that the death toll from the earthquake and tsunami was 832.
Many people are trapped under the rubble of buildings destroyed by the 7.5-magnitude earthquake that shook the country on Friday and triggered waves up to 6 meters high, agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told a press conference.
With a population of over 380,000, the city of Palu was littered with the debris of collapsed buildings.
Police arrest 32-year-old suspect for stabbing a woman
A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.
At 7:55 a.m., a 44-year-old woman was found stabbed to death on John Street in Grayson Mews, and a 32-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder.
Police are urging residents in the area who may have seen or heard something to come forward.
Police Captain Brian O'Hagan made the following statement: "The investigation is only just beginning, but I would ask anyone in the vicinity of John Street in Birkenhead who has seen or heard anything suspicious to contact us.
I'm calling taxi drivers, who may have picked up something on their dashcam, and asking them to provide us with any information that's crucial to our investigation.
A police spokesman confirmed that the murdered woman was found at a property in Birkenhead where she had been staying.
This morning, people claiming to know the woman showed up at the crime scene and asked about where she was discovered.
The investigation is ongoing and police said they are informing the victim's next of kin.
A taxi driver has just been denied access to his apartment in Grayson Mews, with police not allowing anyone to enter or leave the building.
The news left him speechless.
Residents have just been informed that the building will be inaccessible for several hours.
A police officer said the entire area was being treated as a crime scene.
A woman in tears appeared at the scene,
I said, "This is too horrible".
At 2:00 p.m., two police vans were stationed inside the cordon, and another outside.
Several officers were guarding the building on the inside of the cordon.
Anyone with information is asked to send a message to @MerPolCC, call 101 or contact Crime Stoppers anonymously at 0800 555 111, says the 247 register from September 30.
Parliament: the statue of Cromwell, the latest victim of an attempt to rewrite history
The ban would be the right thing to do, given the destruction of countless religious and cultural assets of England by its puritanical followers, such as the fanatical Taliban.
However, the Cromwell Society considers Mr Crick's proposal  unreasonable  and has called it  a revisionist attempt .
The Cromwell Society's president, John Goldsmith, said that given the current debate about the removal of statues, it was obvious that the statue of Oliver Cromwell in front of the Palace of Westminster would not be spared.
Cromwell did not order or lead the iconoclasm in the English civil wars.
It is likely that he was sacrificed for the actions of his ancestor Thomas in the previous century.
The magnificent representation of Cromwell, sculpted by Sir William Hamo Thorneycroft, is a testament to the esteem in which he was held in the 19th century and is part of the historiography of a personality many of us still celebrate. 
Mr Goldsmith told the Sunday Telegraph: "Cromwell is regarded by many, perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today, as a defender of parliament against external pressures, I mean the monarchy of course.
Whether or not this representation is accurate is a continuing historical debate.
What is certain is that the conflict that broke out in the mid-17th century shaped the later development of our nation, and Cromwell is a particularly recognizable figure who represents one side of the fracture.
His achievements as Lord Protector also deserve to be highlighted and commemorated.
China: pig kills farmer
According to local media, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a market in southeastern China.
The man, identified as M. Yuan, was found dead, his heart slashed and covered in blood near a pig market in Liupanshui in Guizhou province, the South China Morning Post reported on Sunday.
A pig farmer prepares to inject vaccines into pigs in a pig farm, May 30, 2005 in Xining, Qinghai Province, China.
He reportedly travelled with his cousin from the neighboring Yunnan province on Wednesday, with the aim of selling 15 pigs at the market.
The next morning, his cousin found him dead and discovered that a door to the nearby pigsty was open.
He says there was a huge male pig inside and blood was coming out of its mouth.
A forensic report confirms that the 250-kg animal maimed the farmer to death.
According to Guiyang Evening News, Mr. Wu, the farmer's cousin, said that his legs were crushed and covered in blood .
Security cameras show Mr. Yuan arriving at the market at 4:40 on Thursday to feed his animals.
His body was discovered about an hour later.
The pig that caused Mr. Yuan's death did not belong to the farmer or his cousin.
A market official told the Evening News that the animal was locked away to prevent further incidents and allow the police to gather evidence.
The family of Mr. Yuan and the market managers are negotiating compensation.
Although rare, there have been reports of pig attacks on people.
In 2016, a pig attacked a woman and her husband on a farm in Massachusetts, seriously injuring the husband.
Ten years earlier, a 295-pound pig ran over a Welsh farmer on his tractor before his wife could get him away.
In 2012, after an Oregon farmer was eaten by his pigs, a Manitoba farmer told CBC News that he was not an aggressive animal in principle, but that the taste of blood could cause this type of behavior.
They're rather playful animals,
Very curious kids... they have no intention of doing harm.
All we have to do is show them the respect they deserve, he says.
The remnants of Hurricane Rosa are expected to bring heavy rain to the southeastern United States .
As forecast, Hurricane Rosa is weakening as it moves over the colder waters of the northeastern coast of Mexico.
However, Rosa will bring rain to northeastern Mexico and the southwestern United States in the coming days.
Winds were at 135 km/h (Category 1 hurricane) since 5 a.m. eastern time on Sunday, while Rosa was 620 km southwest of Punta Eugenia, Mexico.
The hurricane is expected to move north on Sunday.
Meanwhile, a depression is beginning to form over the Pacific Ocean and is moving eastward toward the west coast of the U.S. As it approaches the Baja California Peninsula as a storm on Monday, Hurricane Rosa will bring intense tropical moisture northward into the southwestern United States.
Up to 25 centimeters of rain will fall in parts of Mexico on Monday.
Then, the tropical humidity combined with the approaching depression will create widespread torrential rains in the southwest over the next few days.
Locally, rainfall of between 2.5 and 10 cm will cause dangerous flash floods, debris flows and potential landslides in the desert.
Rainfall will reach a rate of 5 to 7.5 cm per hour in places, especially in southern Nevada and Arizona, due to the intensity of tropical humidity.
Rainfall is expected to be in the 5 to 10 cm range in southwestern areas, including much of Arizona.
Widespread tropical rains can cause flash floods and rapid deterioration of conditions.
It is strongly discouraged to venture into the desert on foot due to the threat of tropical rainfall.
Heavy rains could turn canyons into raging rivers and storms will produce gusts of wind and dust in places.
The approaching depression will result in heavy local rainfall in some areas of the southern part of the country, on the California coast.
The rainfall totals can reach more than 1.3 cm, which could lead to low debris runoff and make the road slippery.
This could be the first rains of the region's dry season.
Dispersed tropical showers will reach Arizona late Sunday and early Monday morning, then intensify later Monday and Tuesday.
Heavy rains will fall across the country on Tuesday and continue through Wednesday.
The United States is expected to experience significant temperature variations in October due to the cooling of the Arctic, but the tropics will remain warm, with temperatures expected to be around 40°C in the northern hemisphere.
which sometimes causes a drastic change in weather over short distances.
The central region of the United States, which will experience considerable temperature variations on Sunday, is a perfect example.
The difference between Kansas City, Missouri, and Omaha, Nebraska, or between St. Louis and Des Moines, Iowa, is almost 20 degrees.
Over the next few days, a persistent summer heat will try to infiltrate and intensify again.
Much of the central and western United States is expected to experience a warm early October, with temperatures hovering around 26 degrees covering the southern plains and other areas of the northeast.
The temperature in New York City could reach 26 degrees on Tuesday, about 10 degrees above the season average.
The multi-day forecast indicates that temperatures are expected to be above average in the western United States during the first half of October.
Brett Kavanaugh's trial attracts over 20 million viewers
Broadcast on six television stations Thursday, the sweeping hearings of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accuses him of sexually assaulting her in the 1980s, were watched by more than 20 million people.
As the political impasse continues, the broadcasters interrupted their usual Friday program to announce a prank: a deal devised by Arizona Senator Jeff Flake to allow the FBI to investigate the allegations for a week.
Speaking before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Christine Ford said she was 100% sure that Kavanaugh, while under the influence of alcohol, had engaged in physical contact with her and had tried to remove her clothes at a high school party.
Kavanaugh, in a passionate tirade, claimed he was also 100 percent certain that this never happened.
According to a Nielsen report, the trial probably reached an audience of over 20.4 million people.
The company calculated the number of viewers of CBS, ABC, NBC, CNN, Fox News Channel and MSNBC.
Figures for other networks broadcasting the trial, including PBS, C-SPAN and Fox Business Network, were not immediately available.
Furthermore, Nielsen is not always able to estimate the number of people watching TV at the office.
By comparison, the trial attracted as many people as a football game or the Oscars.
According to Nielsen, Fox News Channel, whose hosts have largely supported Kavanaugh's nomination, was the most watched channel on the day of the auditions, with an average of 5.69 million viewers.
ABC was second with a viewership of 3.26 million.
It was followed by CBS (3.1 million), NBC (2.94 million), MSNBC (2.89 million) and CNN (2.52 million), all according to Nielsen.
Interest did not diminish after the hearing.
Flake was the center of the drama that was playing Friday.
After the moderate Republican's office released a statement saying he would vote for Kavanaugh, cameras on CNN and CBS revealed a scene in which the senator is being attacked by protesters as he attempts to take the elevator to the Judiciary Committee hearing.
Flake looked down for several minutes as CNN broadcast the live interview footage.
"Don't look away, look at me", one of the women said.
Do you really believe he 's telling the truth ?
You have the power while so many women are destitute. 
Before the elevator doors closed, Flake said his office had issued a statement and that he would say more at the committee meeting.
All cable and broadcast networks were covering the session live hours later as the Judiciary Committee prepared to vote on the process to advance Kavanaugh's nomination by the full Senate.
Flake, however, said a week-long investigation should first be conducted by the FBI into the allegations against the candidate, as the minority Democrats had called for.
Flake was partly convinced by a conversation with his friend, Democratic Senator Chris Coons.
He made his decision after talking with Coons and several other senators afterwards.
His choice weighed heavily on the scale, as Republicans would not have actually obtained the votes to approve Kavanaugh's nomination without a prior investigation.
President Trump authorized the FBI to investigate Brett Kavanaugh's allegations of sexual assault.
Britain: May accuses Brexit opponents of playing small-time politics
In an interview with the Sunday Times newspaper, Prime Minister Theresa May accused critics of her plan to leave the European Union of playing small-time politics at the expense of Britain's future and national interest.
May arrived at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmingham on 29 September 2018.
In another exchange with the paper, which published a picture of Theresa May on the cover, her former foreign minister, Boris Johnson, continued his attacks on her so-called Chequers plans, saying that the proposed free trade between Britain and the European Union was "properly ridiculous".
Wayde Sims: Police arrest Dyteon Simpson, suspected of causing the death of LSU player
Police have arrested a suspect in the fatal shooting that led to the death of Wayde Sims, a 20-year-old LSU basketball player.
Dyteon Simpson, also 20, has been handcuffed and charged with second-degree murder, the Baton Rouge Police Department said.
Authorities released video of the confrontation between Sims and Simpson, and police said Sims lost his glasses during the altercation.
The glasses found at the crime scene were found to have Simpson's DNA, according to CBS affiliate WAFB.
During his interrogation, Simpson confessed to the police that he was responsible for Wayde's death.
According to his lawyer, his bail was set at $350,000.
The Baton Rouge Parish Medical Examiner's office released a preliminary report Friday, which determined that the death was caused by a bullet wound that passed through the head and lodged in the neck.
The police department acknowledges the assistance received from the Louisiana State Fugitive Task Force, the State Police Forensic Laboratory, the Southern University Police, as well as citizens, in the investigation that led to the arrest.
LSU Athletic Director Joe Alleva thanked law enforcement for their commitment and pursuit of justice.
Sims was only 20 years old.
The 6-foot-1, 225-pound player grew up in Baton Rouge, where his father, Wayne, also played basketball at LSU.
He averaged 5.6 points and 2.6 rebounds per game last season.
On Friday morning, LSU basketball coach Will Wade said the team was "devastated and shocked" by the news of Wayde's death.
"We've been dreading this kind of thing all along", Wade said.
Mexico City: volcano spewing ash
Ash from the Popocatépetl volcano has reached the southern districts of Mexico's capital.
On Saturday, the National Center for Disaster Prevention advised Mexicans to stay away from the volcano after the crater recorded a peak of activity, with 183 emissions of gas and ash in 24 hours.
The center was monitoring several rumblings and tremors emanating from the Popocatepetl.
Images on social media showed thin layers of ash covering the windshields of cars in Mexico City neighborhoods, such as Xochimilco.
Geophysicists have observed an increase in activity at the volcano, 72 km from the capital, since a 7.1 magnitude earthquake shook central Mexico in September 2017.
The volcano, nicknamed Don Goyo, has been active since 1994.
Catalonia: clashes between police and separatists as independence vote anniversary approaches
Six arrests were made in Barcelona on Saturday after clashes between pro-independence protesters and riot police, as thousands of opponents joined protests to mark the first anniversary of the referendum that split Catalonia.
Before being pushed back by riot police, masked separatists threw eggs and colored powder at them, creating dust clouds in the streets, which are not usually crowded with tourists.
Skirmishes also broke out later in the day as police used batons to contain the clashes.
For several hours, pro-independence groups chanting "Neither Forget, Neither Forgive" faced Unionist supporters shouting "Long live Spain".
14 protesters with minor injuries were treated, according to local media.
One year after the October 1 referendum, which was deemed illegal by Madrid but celebrated by pro-separation Catalans, tensions remain high in the separatist region.
An overwhelming majority of voters chose independence, despite a low turnout, with opponents of secession largely boycotting the referendum.
According to Catalan authorities, nearly 1,000 people were injured last year after police tried to prevent Catalans from accessing polling stations in the region.
Independence groups had camped out Friday night to block a demonstration in support of the National Police.
It still took place, but was forced to take a different route.
Narcis Termes, a 68-year-old electrician who participated with his wife in the separatist demonstration, said he had no hope for independence for Catalonia.
We have witnessed a great moment last year.
My parents were crying with joy at the thought of being able to vote, but now we are in a dead end, he laments.
Despite their major, albeit meager, victory in regional elections last December, Catalan independence parties have struggled to maintain momentum this year, with many popular leaders in exile or detained awaiting trial for organising the referendum and declaring Catalonia's independence.
Joan Puig, a 42-year-old mechanic who filmed the demonstration in support of the police on his phone, believes that politicians are responsible for blocking the situation, on both sides.
 The tension is only increasing , he regrets.
On Saturday, Oriol Junqueras, one of nine Catalan leaders in prison awaiting trial since last year, announced his intention to run for the European Parliament elections next year.
 For me, this is the best way to denounce the regression of democratic values and the repression unleashed by the Spanish government, he added.
Arrest in Londonderry: Men drive into a house
Three men, aged 33, 34 and 39, were arrested after they repeatedly stormed a house in Londonderry.
The incident took place at Ballynagard Crescent on Thursday at approximately 7:30pm local time.
Police Captain Bob Blemmings reported that the doors and walls were damaged.
The car was also reportedly shot at.
Livingston wins the game 1-0 against the Rangers thanks to Menga
Dolly Menga's first goal ensures Livingston's win
Recently promoted, Livingston's team surprised the Rangers by imposing a second victory in 18 games on Steven Gerrard, the current coach of the club from Ibrox.
Menga's goal made all the difference and allowed Gary Holt's team to finish in 2nd position in the standings, tied with Hibernian.
Gerrard's men are without a win away in the Premiership this season, and face Hearts on Sunday, who are 8 points up.
But first, the Rangers will face the Vienna Rapids in the Europa League on Thursday.
Livingston's team is six games into the unbeaten run in the division, and head coach Holt, who replaced Kenny Miller last month, can boast that he has not lost a single game yet.
Livingston missed an opportunity in the face of numbed opponents .
Holt's team could have taken the lead long before the score, as their direct approach put the Rangers in a difficult position.
Scott Robinson attempted to break but was bogged down in front of the opposing goal; followed by a late intervention from Alan Lithgow, on a Craig Halkett header.
The Livingston team let the Rangers have the ball, knowing that they could get in their way with their tactics.
That's when the decisive goal came.
The Rangers conceded a free hit and Livingston attempted an opening; Declan Gallagher and Robinson combined to corner Menga, who took a touchdown and scored a field goal.
At this point, the Rangers were dominating the game but faced an impenetrable defence and goalkeeper Liam Kelly was rarely worried.
The second half was similar, although Alfredo Morelos forced a stop on Kelly.
Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor kicked a shot from Scott Pittman, while Lithgow managed to foil one of Livingston's shots.
The Livingston keeper repelled all attempts and protected his cage, while two penalties were refused by the referee, one for Halkett's provocation directed at Glenn Middleton and the other for a foul.
The Livingston phenomenon - an analysis of the
Alasdair Lamont from BBC Scotland at the Tony Macaroni Arena
A performance and results that are mind-blowing for Livingston.
They were all excellent and continue to exceed expectations on this uphill climb.
Their style and team composition have barely changed since their return to the top, but much of the credit for this goes to Holt for having since his arrival motivated a team of
It's a great club with a lot of great players.
Captain Halkett's defense was magnificent and beautifully organized, and Menga kept Connor Goldson and Joe Worrall on their toes for the entire game.
Unfortunately, the Rangers were not inspired.
Despite a good level achieved with Gerrard, they were not up to their past talent.
They missed a final opportunity and only managed to break through once, a warning to Rangers, who were mid-table.
President Erdogan receives mixed reception in Cologne
On Saturday, 29 September, the Turkish and German leaders met for breakfast in Berlin in a relaxed atmosphere.
It was the last day of President Erdogan's controversial visit to Germany, which was aimed at improving relations between NATO allies.
A number of issues were discussed, such as human rights, freedom of the press and Turkey's accession to the EU.
Erdogan then flew to Cologne for the inauguration of one of the largest mosques.
One of the largest Turkish communities abroad lives in this city.
Citing security concerns, police prevented 25,000 protesters from gathering outside the building, while many supporters were allowed to approach to see their president.
Hundreds of anti-Erdogan protesters, mostly Kurdish, raised their voices, condemning both Erdogan's policies and the German government's decision to welcome him to his country.
The split that emerges from the protests reflects this dual vision of Erdogan: a visitor greeted as a hero by some Germans of Turkish origin and called an autocrat by others.
Deptford road accident: cyclist dies after collision with car
In London, a cyclist was killed in a collision involving a car.
The accident occurred at about 10:15 am local time near the junction of Bestwood Street and Evelyn Street, a busy thoroughfare in Deptford to the south-east of the city.
The driver of the vehicle stopped, and the rescue team arrived on the scene, but the man died at the scene.
This accident occurred several months after the death of a cyclist on Chiders Street, about 1.5 km from the accident that occurred on Saturday.
London police said officers were doing their best to identify the man and alert his relatives.
Roads have been closed and bus diversions have been put in place.
Long Lartin Prison: 6 officers injured in a riot
The head of the high security men's prison said that six prison officers were injured in a riot.
The riot began at HMP Long Lartin Prison in Worcestershire at about 0930 local time on Sunday and is still not under control.
Specialist riot police officers were dispatched to unblock the situation, involving 8 inmates and contained in a prison wing.
Officers were treated for minor facial injuries.
A spokesman for the prison management said: "Specially trained personnel have been deployed to restore order in HMP Long Lartin.
Six officers were treated for injuries.
We will not tolerate violence in our prisons, and those responsible will be held accountable to the police authorities and may have their sentences extended.
More than 500 prisoners, including some of the country's most dangerous criminals, are held at HM Long Lartin.
In June, the prison director was hospitalized after being attacked by an inmate.
In October last year, riot police were sent to the prison to stop a serious disturbance: prisoners had attacked the staff with pool balls.
Hurricane Rosa: Phoenix, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City threatened by flash floods (which could benefit areas affected by drought)
It's rare for a tropical depression to hit Arizona, but it's likely to do so early next week as Hurricane Rosa heads toward the desert southwest with what's left of its strength, a region that could be hit by flash floods.
The National Weather Service has already issued flood warnings for Monday and Tuesday for western Arizona, southern and eastern Nevada, southeastern California and Utah, including the cities of Phoenix, Flagstaff, Las Vegas and Salt Lake City.
Rosa should head directly for Phoenix on Tuesday, with rains expected Monday night.
The Phoenix-based National Weather Service tweeted that  only ten tropical cyclones have remained at the tropical depression or tropical storm status within a 200-mile radius of Phoenix since 1950!
Hurricane Katrina (1967) had stopped 40 miles from the Arizona border.
The latest estimates from the National Hurricane Center are predicting 5 to 10 inches of precipitation, and up to 15 inches in places in the Mogollon Rim, Arizona.
Other desert regions of the southwest including the central Rocky Mountain region and the Great Basin are expected to record 2.5 to 5 cm of precipitation, with isolated total measurements as high as 10 cm.
Rosa's rains could be life-saving for drought-stricken areas that are not at risk of flash floods.
Although the risk of flooding should not be taken lightly, the rain could be beneficial for the southwestern region, given the current drought situation.
According to the U.S. Drought Monitoring System, just over 40 percent of Arizona is experiencing at least one extreme category of drought, the second most severe category, weather.com reports.
Hurricane Rosa begins its path along the coast of the Baja Peninsula.
Still high in power Sunday morning and generating winds of up to 85 mph (135 km/h), Rosa was located 400 miles (620 km) from Punta Eugenia, Mexico, and is moving northward at 12 mph (20 km/h).
The storm hits the cold waters of the Pacific and loses its strength.
It is expected to reach the Mexican coast with the strength of a hurricane by Monday afternoon or Monday night.
In some parts of Mexico, the rainfall could be massive and lead to flooding.
 In total, between 7.5 and 15 centimeters of rain are expected from Baja California to northwest Sonora and could reach up to 25 centimeters, weather.com said.
Rosa will then cross Mexico northward, with the strength of a tropical storm, and reach the Arizona border early Tuesday morning as a tropical depression.
 Heavy rains are expected in Baja California, northwest Sonora and the southwest desert and are the main hazard , the National Hurricane Center explained.
It is estimated that this rainfall will lead to potentially deadly flash floods and debris flows in arid areas, as well as landslides in mountainous areas.
Midsomer Norton attack: four arrested for attempted murder
Three teenagers and a man in his 20s have been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a 16-year-old boy was found stabbed in Somerset.
The teenager was found in the Excelsior Terrace area of Midsomer Norton around 4:00 a.m. local time on Saturday.
He was sent to the hospital, and is currently in stable condition.
Avon and Somerset Police said they arrested the four young men (aged 17, 18 and 20) in the night in the Radstock area.
Officers have issued a call for anyone who may have filmed the scene with their phone.
Trump says Kavanaugh was a victim of the Democrats' malice and anger.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote against the ruthless and outrageous methods of the Democratic Party", Trump said at a rally in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Trump claimed that Kavanaugh had been the victim of Democratic malice and anger throughout his nomination process.
Kavanaugh spoke to Congress on Thursday, vigorously and emotionally rejecting allegations by Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him of sexually assaulting her decades ago when they were teenagers.
Ford also testified at the hearing.
The president said Saturday that the American people witnessed Kavanaugh's intelligence and courage today.
"A vote for Judge Kavanaugh is a vote for one of the most accomplished jurists with a distinguished career in public service", he told the crowd of supporters gathered in West Virginia.
The president indirectly referred to Kavanaugh's nomination when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever , he said.
 That's why I'm fighting on all fronts for great candidates. 
Trump said the Democrats were on a mission of "resistance and obstruction".
The first decisive Senate vote on Kavanaugh's nomination is expected by Friday, according to a Republican aide who spoke to CNN.
Indonesia: earthquake and tsunami claim hundreds of lives, but toll still rises
On Saturday, authorities said at least 384 people had died, most of them swept away by huge waves that washed onto beaches as an earthquake, followed by a tsunami, hit the Indonesian island of Celebes.
Hundreds of people gathered for a beach festival in Palu on Friday when six-meter waves overwhelmed the beach at nightfall, taking many lives and destroying everything in their path.
The earthquake, measuring 7.5, preceded the tsunami.
 When the tsunami threat came yesterday, everyone was still on the beach, but people  did not immediately flee, and that cost them their lives , said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB), at a press conference in Jakarta.
"The tsunami didn't happen by itself. It took cars, pieces of wood, houses, it took everything with it", Nugroho explained, adding that the tsunami had moved in the open sea at a speed of 800 km/h before hitting the coast.
Some people were able to save their lives by climbing trees, he added.
Nearly 16,700 people were evacuated to 24 centres in Palu.
Aerial images released by the Disaster Management Agency show destroyed buildings and shops, deformed and collapsed bridges, and a mosque surrounded by water.
The aftershocks continued to shake the coastal city on Saturday.
The earthquakes were felt by 2.4 million people.
The Indonesian Agency for Technology Assessment and Application (BPPT) said the energy released by Friday's earthquake was 200 times greater than the power of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in World War II.
The geographical location of the city, which borders a long narrow bay, could have magnified the size of the tsunami, she explained.
Nugroho said the damage was extensive, with thousands of homes, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsing.
Bodies were found trapped under the rubble of collapsed buildings, he added, noting that 540 people were injured and 29 were still missing.
Nugroho said the loss of life and property could be greater on the 300 km coastline north of Palu, an area called Donggala, the closest to the epicenter of the earthquake.
Communications were completely paralyzed  from Donggala, Nugroho said.
More than 300,000 people live there, the Red Cross said in a statement, adding that its staff and volunteers were on their way to the affected areas.
 The situation is dramatic and could well worsen , she added.
On Saturday, the agency was widely criticized for not releasing the news that a tsunami had hit Palu, although officials said the waves had arrived by the time the alert was issued.
An amateur video shared on social media shows a man on the roof of a building frantically shouting to passersby on the street that a tsunami is approaching.
A few minutes later, a wall of water washed over the coast, washing away buildings and cars.
Reuters was not immediately able to authenticate the footage.
The earthquake and tsunami caused a general power outage that cut off all communications in Palu, making it difficult for authorities to coordinate rescue operations.
The military has started airlifting aid from Jakarta and other cities, according to authorities, but evacuees still need food and other basic necessities.
The city's airport has reopened as part of the relief effort, but will remain closed until October.
President Joko Widodo was scheduled to visit the evacuation centers in Palu on Sunday.
Indonesia: The death toll from the tsunami has risen to over 800 people.
This is a tragedy.
The World Vision staff from Donggala arrived safely in Palu, where they took refuge in shelters set up in the courtyard of their offices, and on the way, they discovered scenes of devastation, Doseba said.
They told me they saw many houses destroyed , he explained.
This is a tragedy.
When aid groups started to provide relief to the victims, some complained that highly experienced foreign aid workers were not allowed to travel to Palu.
According to Indonesian regulations, foreign funds, supplies and personnel may enter the country only if the affected site is declared a national disaster area.
And it is not yet.
 This disaster is still considered a regional disaster , says Aulia Arriani, spokesperson for the Indonesian Red Cross.
 As soon as the government declares that it is a national disaster, international assistance can be provided. 
When the second night after the earthquake and tsunami of Friday hit Palu, the relatives of the missing people still hoped for a miracle.
Saturday, a little boy was found in the sewers.
On Sunday, rescue workers pulled a woman from the rubble two days ago, near her mother's body.
The coach of the Indonesian national paragliding team, Gendon Subandono, had prepared two of the missing athletes for the Asian Games, which were held a few days earlier in Indonesia.
Other students were trapped in the Roa Roa Hotel, Mr. Mandagi added.
As an elder in the discipline of paragliding, I have experienced my own dramas, he explains.
In the hours after the news of the Roa Roa Hotel collapse reached the paragliding community, Mr. Gendon recounted how he had desperately sent WhatsApp messages to athletes in Palu who were participating in the beach festival.
His messages went unanswered.
I don't think they ever got my messages.
In Newport on the Levee, thieves embezzle $26,750 from a vending machine.
On Friday morning, thieves extorted $26,750 from a Brink's officer who was filling a vending machine in Newport on the Levee, according to a news release from the Newport Police Department.
The driver of the vehicle was draining a vending machine at the entertainment complex and preparing to feed it, Detective Inspector Dennis McCarthy said in the release.
While he was busy, a man appeared behind the Brink's employee and stole a bag of money intended for the vending machine.
Witnesses reported seeing many suspects leaving the scene, but police did not specify how many people were involved in the incident.
Anyone with information on their identities is asked to contact Newport Police at 859-292-3680.
Kanye West: The rapper changes his name to Ye
Rapper Kanye West is now Ye.
Announcing the news on Twitter on Saturday, he wrote:  Formerly known as Kanye West. 
The 41-year-old West, who has been calling himself Ye for some time, used the nickname as the title of his eighth album, which was released in June.
The rapper made the change just before heading to Saturday Night Live, where he is expected to debut his new album, Yandhi.
Her participation replaces that of Ariana Grande, who canceled her coming for "emotional reasons", explained the show's creator.
In addition to being the abbreviation of his current professional nickname, this nickname also has religious significance for West.
"I think 'Ye' is the most used word in the Bible, where it means 'star,'" West explained earlier this year, referring to the title of his album with his host Big Boy.
So I am you, I am we.
I went from Kanye, which means "the one", to Ye -- the reflection of good, evil, confusion, everything.
This album is a reflection of who we are.
West isn't the only rapper known to change his name.
Sean Combs has been called Puff Daddy, P. Diddy or Diddy, but this year he has announced his preference for Love and Brother Love.
JAY-Z, who has collaborated with West in the past, also played on the hyphen and the capital letters.
In Mexico, AMLO says he will never use military force against civilians.
Mexico's President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has vowed never to use military force against civilians, nearly fifty years after bloody reprisals by law enforcement against students.
Lopez Obrador promised on Saturday in the Plaza de Tlatelolco that he would never use military force to repress the Mexican people.
On October 2, 1968, troops opened fire on a peaceful demonstration, killing 300 people as student movements took root across Latin America.
Lopez Obrador has pledged to support Mexican youth by giving monthly stipends to students and opening more free public universities.
He said unemployment and lack of educational opportunities are pushing young people to join criminal gangs.
The US should double funding for artificial intelligence
As China becomes more active in the field of artificial intelligence, the US should double its research funding in the field, according to AI investor and expert Kai-Fu Lee, who has worked for Google, Microsoft and Apple.
These statements come after several US government actors made announcements regarding AI, while an official AI strategy is lacking in the US.
At the same time, China presented its roadmap last year: it plans to become the leader in AI innovation by 2030.
'Doubling funding for AI research would be a good start, because all other countries are way ahead of the US, and we are looking for the next big AI breakthrough,' says Lee.
Doubling the funding could double the chances that the next key step in AI will come from the US, Lee told CNBC in an interview this week.
Lee, whose book  AI Superpowers: China, Silicon Valley and the New World Order  was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, is the CEO of Sinovation Ventures, which has invested in one of China's largest AI companies, Face++.
In the 1980s, while at Carnegie Mellon University, he worked on an AI system that beat the top-ranked American Othello player.
Lee has previously participated in technology competitions organized by the US government, such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, and asked when the next competition would be held, in order to identify visionaries.
According to Lee, American researchers often have to work hard to get government funding.
 China is not appropriating academic leaders, it is corporations, says Lee.
In recent years, Facebook, Google and other tech companies have recruited big name academics to work on AI.
Lee added that changes in immigration policies could also support US efforts on IAI.
 I think green cards should be automatically granted to AI researchers,  he said.
The State Council of China unveiled its next generation AI development plan in July 2017.
China's National Natural Science Foundation provides funding to members of academic institutions, just as the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to American researchers, but the quality of academic work in China is lower, Lee explained.
Earlier this year, the US Department of Defense established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center, which is expected to involve industry and academic partners, while the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence.
This month, DARPA announced a $2 billion investment in an initiative called AI Next.
The NSF, meanwhile, is currently investing over $100 million a year in AI research.
In parallel, the US legislation that is working to establish a National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence has not taken any action for several months.
Macedonians take part in referendum on their country's name
On Sunday, Macedonians voted in a referendum to change their country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia, a change that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece, which had blocked Macedonia's application for membership in the European Union and NATO.
Greece, one of whose provinces is called Macedonia, maintains that the name of its northern neighbour represents a right on its territory and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU.
In June, the two governments signed an agreement based on the proposed new name, but nationalist opponents claimed that the change would affect the ethnic identity of Macedonia's majority Slavic population.
President Gjorge Ivanov announced that he would not vote in the referendum and that a boycott campaign had raised doubts about the achievement of the minimum turnout of 50% required to validate the referendum.
The question on the referendum was:  Are you in favour of membership of NATO and the EU under the terms of the agreement signed with Greece ? 
According to the proponents of the name change, including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, this is the price to pay for joining organizations such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia, which survived the collapse of Yugoslavia.
 I have come today to vote for the future of my country, for the youth of Macedonia, so that they can live freely under the aegis of the European Union.  This means a safer life for each of us , said Olivera Georgijevska, 79, in Skopje.
Although the vote is not legally binding, enough MPs have said they will follow the result of the vote to make it decisive.
Changing the name would require a two-thirds majority in parliament.
The State Election Commission announced that no irregularities had been detected as of 1 p.m.
But the turnout was only 16%, compared to 34% at the same time in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 which mobilized 66% of registered voters.
 I came to vote for my children. Our place is in Europe , said Gjose Tanevski, 62, who voted in the capital, Skopje.
Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, his wife Zorica and son Dushko participated in the referendum and voted for the name change, to open the vote for NATO and European Union membership, in Strumica, Macedonia, on 30 September 2018.
In the parliament building in Skopje, 54-year-old Vladimir Kavardarkov is preparing a small stage and arranging seats in front of tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum.
We want to enter the EU and NATO, but we want to enter through the big door, said Kavadarkov.
We are a poor country, but we have our dignity.
If they don't want us as Macedonian, we can turn to China and Russia and participate in Eurasian integration.
According to Prime Minister Zaev, membership of NATO will allow Macedonia to benefit from the necessary investments.The unemployment rate in the country is over 20%.
 I think that a large majority will be in favour, because more than 80% of our citizens want to join the EU and NATO", said Mr Zaev after casting his ballot.
He added that a 'yes' would be a 'confirmation of our future'.
According to a poll published on Monday by the Institute for Policy Research in Macedonia, between 30 and 43 per cent of voters intend to participate in the referendum, which is below the expected turnout.
Another poll, conducted by the Macedonian TV channel Telma, estimated the turnout at 57%.
70% of those intending to vote said they would vote 'yes'.
For the referendum to be valid, it needs 50% of the votes plus one vote.
The referendum's failure would be the first blow to the pro-Western government's policy since it took power in May last year.
Decisive action: Sergio Aguero of Manchester City, breaking through the Brighton defense to score
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling defeated Brighton's defending champions in Manchester and won the match 2-0 on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester.
Aguero's goal, in the 65th minute, seemed to be the easiest move in the world for the player.
The Argentine scorer received the ball in the middle of the field, at the beginning of the action.
He ran between three Brighton defenders, before plunging into the field.
Aguero was then surrounded by four green jerseys.
He went around one defender before he beat the others right near Brighton's goal.
Then he passed the ball to Sterling, on his left.
The English forward took advantage of the opportunity to return the ball to Aguero, who used his right foot to deceive Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan with a shot from the right side of the net.
"Aguero has some problems with his feet", Pep Guardiola, the team's coach, told reporters.
We said he'd play 55, 60 minutes.
That's what happened.
We were lucky that he scored at that time.
But it was Sterling who had given the Skyblues the lead in the first game of the Premier League,
from the 29th minute.
Aguero received the ball directly on Brighton's court.
He sent it to Leroy Sane on the left.
Sane made a few touches before leading Sterling to the second post.
The Skyblues forward threw the ball into the net just before slipping out of the field.
City will face Hoffenheim in the Champions League group stage at 12.55 on Tuesday at the Rhein-Neckar-Arena in Sinsheim, Germany.
Scherzer wants to play the holiday troublemakers against the Rockies.
With the Nationals out of the playoff race, there was no reason to go into a new game.
But Scherzer, who is very competitive, is hoping to play against the Colorado Rockies on Sunday, but only in the event of a playoff for the Rockies, the real legends against the Los Angeles Dodgers of the National League West.
The Rockies won 5-2 against the Nationals on Friday night, but they're still looking to secure their division title.
Even if this game is not a contender, we want to step on the field in Denver, with this atmosphere, with the crowd, and against a team that will probably play at the highest level I'll face this year.
Why wouldn't I want to participate?
The Nationals have yet to announce a starting pitcher for Sunday, but would be willing to give the job to Scherzer, given the situation.
Scherzer, who will be making his 34th start, will be in practice Thursday and will pitch on his usual rest day on Sunday.
The Washington right-hander is 18-7 with a 2.53 earned run average and 300 strikeouts in 220 2/3 innings this season.
Trump's Interventions in West Virginia
The president alluded to the situation that he created by supporting Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court when he spoke of the importance of Republican participation in the midterm elections.
 All our actions will have an impact in November.
We are five weeks away from one of the most important elections of our lives.
"I am not a candidate, but I am more involved than ever before, which is why I am fighting on all fronts for great candidates", he said.
Trump went on to say, "You see this horrible, really horrible, radical group of Democrats, you see it at work.
And they're determined to take back power by any means necessary.
They don't care who they hurt, who they crush to take power and control. That's what they want, power and control, and we're not going to give it to them.
The Democrats are on a mission of resistance and obstruction.
"You can see that in the last four days", he added, before calling the Democrats "angry, evil, and lying".
He invoked the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee and Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein, which earned him a public outcry.
Do you remember what he said ?
Did you leak the document?
Ha ha, of course.
No, no, I'm waiting for one.
The Labour Party is not the great community it used to be.
He is not tolerant of those who express their ideas.
When activists from my local Momentum party voted to censor me, it was no surprise.
After all, I am the last of a long line of Labour MPs who were deemed unwelcome, all for expressing our ideas.
My colleague Joan Ryan in Parliament was treated the same way because she spoke out against anti-Semitism.
As for me, I was censored because I disagreed with Jeremy Corbyn.
On the importance of responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically, these are subjects on which Jeremy himself was at odds with previous leaders.
The notice for the Nottingham East Labour rally on Friday said:  We want the rally to be inclusive and productive. 
That is exactly what Friday evening general meetings were like during my eight years as a Labour MP.
Unfortunately, today this is not the case for many rallies and the promise of softer and more respectful policies has long since been forgotten, if ever taken into consideration.
It has become clear that opposing views are no longer tolerated within the party, each opinion being judged by its acceptability by the party leaders.
It started shortly after Jeremy took office, and colleagues with whom I thought I shared a political vision started expecting me to turn my back and take positions that were the opposite of my beliefs, whether it was national security or the EU's internal market.
Every time I spoke publicly, and no matter what I said, there was an abusive rant on social media, calling for withdrawal, denouncing the policies of the Centre, telling me that I shouldn't be a party member.
And this is not just my experience.
I was more fortunate than some of my colleagues, because the comments that were addressed to me were political in nature.
I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of these colleagues who face a barrage of sexist and racist language every day, but who do not give up.
One of the most disappointing things about current policy is the normalisation of different forms of abuse.
Last week, Jeremy Corbyn said that the Labour Party must encourage a culture of tolerance.
The reality is that we are no longer that big community and the party is shrinking with motions of no confidence and changes in the selection rules.
I've been given a lot of advice over the last couple of years: look down, don't speak my thoughts so loud, and everything will be fine.
But I don't do politics to act like that.
I joined the Labour Party 32 years ago as a schoolboy because the neglect of the Thatcher government had caused my classroom to collapse, and since then I have been keen to work for better public services for those who need them most, whether as a local councillor or a government minister.
I have never hidden my political ambitions, even during the last election.
No one in Nottingham East could be disturbed by my political positions and by my disagreements with the current party leadership.
All I would like to say to those who supported the motion on Friday is that the country is moving towards a Brexit that will affect households, businesses and public services, and I think this is not really the time to waste time and energy debating my loyalty to the party leader.
My only message is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no threat of withdrawal or opportunism will stop me from acting for the causes I stand for, which are in the interests of all of you.
Chris Leslie is the Member of Parliament for Nottingham East.
Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose: Ayr is undefeated
Two late tests may have distorted the final result, but there is no doubt about it: Ayr deserved this triumph after the intense match of the day in the Scottish Rugby Championship.
The team now sits at the top of the standings and becomes the only undefeated team in the league.
In the end, it was the superiority of their defence and the way they seized the opportunities that allowed them to open the score.Coach Peter Murchie can congratulate himself on this match.
 Until now, we have been tested, but we remain invincible, so I must consider myself lucky!, he said.
Robyn Christie, from Melrose, congratulated Ayr:  Bravo to them, they were more efficient than us and knew how to seize the opportunities. 
Grant Anderson's 14th-minute try, converted by Frazier Climo, put Ayr in good position, but a yellow card for Scotland's Rory Hughes, released for the match by the Warriors, allowed Melrose to make the numbers count.
Climo made things worse for Ayr with a penalty, just before half-time, he scored and converted a solo try to make it 17-5 for Ayr at the break.
Melrose started the second half well and Patrick Anderson's try, converted by Baggot, reduced the gap to five points.
A long wait followed due to a serious injury to Ruaridh Knott, who left the field on a stretcher.
Acting Ayr captain Blair Macpherson was then given a yellow card and, once again, Melrose tried his luck with an unreformed try from Bruce Colvine, which created palpable tension.
But the home team recovered and when Struan Hutchinson was given a yellow card for tackling Climo when he didn't have the ball, from the penalty area, MacPherson hit the back of Ayr's goal, which was advancing.
Climo turned the try, as he has done almost every time since the resumption, after Kyle Rowe collected David Armstrong's box kick and sent winger Gregor Henry off for the team's fifth home try.
The star of Still Game is going into the restaurant business.
Ford Kieran, the star of Still Game, decided to pursue a career in the restaurant business, and the actor was appointed as the director of a licensed restaurant company.
The 56-year-old plays Jack Jarvis in the popular BBC show, which he writes and co-hosts with his long-time stage partner, Greg Hemphill.
The duo have announced that the upcoming ninth series will be the show's finale, and Kiernan seems to be preparing for the aftermath of Craiglang.
According to official records, he is a director of Adriftmorn Limited.
The actor declined to comment on the story, although a source in the Scottish Sun revealed that Kiernan wanted to get involved in the burgeoning restaurant scene in Glasgow.

Public buildings are flying a blue flag like the ocean.
From Lake Titicaca to the Amazon, the naval bases display the following motto:  The sea is our right.
It's a duty to get it back.
Across blockaded Bolivia, the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody 19th century resource conflict is still fresh, as is the desire to sail the Pacific Ocean once again.
These hopes have not been so palpable for several decades, as Bolivia awaits a decision from the International Court of Justice, which will be handed down on 1 October, after five years of deliberations.
 Bolivia has the will, a spirit of unity and serenity, and of course expects a positive outcome , explains Roberto Calzadilla, a Bolivian diplomat.
Many Bolivians will be watching the International Court of Justice's decision on large screens across the country, hoping that the Hague court will rule in favor of Bolivia's claim.Bolivia wants Chile to be obliged to negotiate a sovereign passage to the ocean to Bolivia after decades of sporadic negotiations.
Evo Morales, Bolivia's charismatic indigenous president (who faces a controversial re-election battle next year), also has a lot to say about the decision that will be made on Monday.
 We are so close to being able to return to the Pacific Ocean , he said at the end of August.
But some analysts believe that there is little chance that the court will rule in favor of Chile and that little will change, even if it does.
The Netherlands-based UN body has no power to grant Chile territory, and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of any talks.
The fact that the International Court of Justice is giving its decision six months after the final arguments shows that the case  was not complicated , explains Paz Zárate, a Chilean expert in international law.
And far from helping the Bolivian cause, the last four years may have even been detrimental to it.
 The problem of access to the sea has been hijacked by the current Bolivian administration, said Zárate.
Morales' bellicose rhetoric has undermined any remaining Chilean goodwill, she suggested.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to exchange, but after that it will be very difficult to organise talks.
The last exchange of ambassadors between the two countries took place in 1962.
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé, who represents Bolivia at the Hague, rejected the idea that the Court's decision-making was unusually rapid.
Monday will bring Bolivia "an extraordinary opportunity to start a new era of relations with Chile" and a chance to "end 139 years of disagreements with mutual benefits", he said.
Calzadilla also challenged the fact that Morales - who remains to this day one of the most popular presidents in Latin America - was using the maritime issue as a political crutch.
 Bolivia will never give up its right of access to the Pacific Ocean , he added.
 The Court's decision is an opportunity to see that we must get rid of the past. 
North Korea says nuclear disarmament will only happen when it can trust the United States
Ri Yong Ho, the foreign minister of North Korea, said that his country would not give up its nuclear weapons until it gained the trust of Washington.
He spoke at the UN General Assembly on Saturday.
He called on the US to honour the promises made at a summit in Singapore between the leaders of the two rival countries.
He spoke as US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appeared poised to revive nuclear diplomacy in the impasse more than three months after the Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un, the current leader of North Korea.
Ri says it is "illusion" to think that the continuation of sanctions and the US opposition to a declaration that would end the Korean War will bring the North to its knees.
Washington is reluctant to accept the declaration in the absence of significant disarmament measures by Pyongyang.
Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit.
But the seriousness of Pyongyang's relinquishment of an arsenal that the country considers as its only guarantee of security is debatable.
Pompeo plans to visit Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second meeting between Kim and Trump.
The Paris fashion shows reveal the latest trends in head coverings, which may soon be available in your shops.
If you want to add XXL to your hat collection or get 100% sun protection, look no further.
Designers Valentino and Thom Browne presented their collection of outrageous oversize hats at a PE19 fashion show that honored the style of Paris Fashion Week.
More and more extravagant hats have been flooding Instagram this summer, and designers have decided to integrate their outrageous pieces into the fashion shows.
Valentino's signature piece was an eccentric beige hat with a wide brim that resembled a feather, which engulfed the heads of the mannequins.
Other oversize accessories included jewelled watermelons, a witch hat and even a pineapple, but these pieces were not designed to keep you warm.
Thom Browne also presented a collection of original masks, just in time for Halloween.
Most of the masks had sewn lips and were more Hannibal Lecter-like than Haute Couture.
One creature looked like a scuba gear, with a snorkel and goggles, while another looked like a cone of melted ice.
And if you follow the fashion trends, then you're in luck.
According to fashion observers, the towering hats could come down to your shopping streets.
The XXL hats follow in the wake of the  Bomba , the wide-brim straw hat that stars wear, from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski.
The iconic brand that markets the hard-to-wear hat that has flooded social media has unveiled another of its flagship creations on the podium: a straw beach bag nearly as big as the swimsuit model who wore it.
The burnt orange rafia bag, with rafia fringes and a white leather handles, was the centerpiece of Jacquemus's La Riviera show at Paris Fashion Week.
Celebrity stylist Luke Armitage told FEMAIL: "I expect to see big hats and beach bags in stores next summer. The designer has been so successful that it's obvious there will be demand for oversize accessories".
John Edward: Language skills are essential for global citizens
Independent schools in Scotland maintain a record of academic excellence, a trend that continued in 2018 with further excellent examination results reinforced by collective and individual success in sports, the arts, music and other community activities.
With over 30,000 pupils across Scotland, these schools, represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools (SCIS), strive to provide the best possible service to pupils and their parents.
Independent schools work to prepare their students for higher education, their chosen careers and their place as global citizens.
As an education sector able to design and implement a tailor-made school curriculum, we find that contemporary languages remain popular and desired subjects in schools.
Nelson Mandela said, "If you talk to a man in a language he understands, you talk to his head".
If you speak to him in his own language, you speak to his heart.
It reminds us that we cannot rely on English to build relationships and build trust with people in other countries.
If we look at the excellent results in the examinations this year, we see that languages are at the top of the rankings, with the highest success rates in independent schools.
In total, 68% of students who studied foreign languages obtained the highest grade, A.
Data from the 74 SCIS member schools show that 72% of students achieved the highest grade, A, in Mandarin, as did 72% of students who studied German, 69% of students who studied French and 63% of students who studied Spanish.
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are supporting foreign languages as absolutely essential skills for children and young people in the future.
Now, languages as subjects are organised along with science, technology, engineering and mathematics in the curricula of independent schools and other schools.
A 2014 survey by the UK Commission for Employment and Skills found that 17% of the difficulties employers face in recruiting candidates are related to insufficient language skills.
Language skills are therefore becoming increasingly vital in preparing young people for their future careers.
With more job opportunities requiring languages, these skills are essential in our globalised world.
Whatever career choice, a person who speaks a second language will have a real advantage in the future from this lasting skill.
Being able to communicate directly with foreigners automatically puts the multilingual person ahead of his competitors.
According to a 2013 YouGov survey of 4,000 adults in the UK, 75% of them did not have sufficient foreign language skills to hold a conversation, with French being the only language spoken by a double-digit percentage (15%).
This is why investing in language learning is important for children today.
By speaking several languages, including those of emerging economies, children will have a better chance of finding a rewarding job.
In Scotland, each school will teach different languages.
Many of these will focus on contemporary classical languages, while others will teach languages considered important for the UK in the run-up to 2020, including Mandarin and Japanese.
Whatever your child's preferences, several languages will be available in independent schools, with staff specialised in the field.
Independent schools in Scotland want to provide a learning environment that will prepare children and give them the skills they need to succeed, no matter what the future holds.
It is clear that in today's global business environment, languages remain of vital importance to the future of the country.
Modern languages should be considered as international communication skills.
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice, diversity and excellence to Scotland's young people.
It's got to be done.
John Edward is the head of the Scottish Council of Independent Schools
LeBron will make his debut with the Lakers on Saturday in San Diego.
The wait is almost over for fans who are eagerly awaiting LeBron James' debut with the Los Angeles Lakers.
Lakers coach Luke Walton announced that James would play in Sunday's preseason opener against the Denver Nuggets in San Diego.
But we don't know how many minutes he'll play yet.
"More than June, less than 48", Walton said on the Lakers' official website.
Lakers reporter Mike Trudell tweeted that James would likely play for a limited number of minutes.
After practice earlier in the week, James was asked about his plans for the preseason schedule, which includes six games.
 At this point in my career, I don't need pre-season games to be ready. 
Trump campaign in West Virginia (YouTube channel)
President Donald Trump begins a series of campaign rallies tonight in Wheeling, West Virginia.
Other stops, including in states like Tennessee and Mississippi where the president is popular, are planned.
With the confirmation vote for the vacant Supreme Court seat postponed, Trump is seeking to garner support for the upcoming midterm elections and prevent Republicans from losing control of Congress in the November vote.
What time is Trump's West Virginia meeting tonight and how do we watch it online?
Trump's meeting in Wheeling, West Virginia, is scheduled for 7:00 pm Eastern time this evening, Saturday, September 29, 2018.
You can follow it online below, live on YouTube.
Trump is expected to address the issue of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's sexual assault hearings this week. Kavanaugh's Senate confirmation vote is expected to be delayed until next week while the FBI investigates.
But the main purpose of this series of rallies is to help the Republicans gain ground in the run-up to the November elections.
According to Reuters, the US president said in his campaign that the five rallies were aimed at encouraging volunteers and supporters as Republicans try to protect and expand their Senate and House majorities.
 Controlling Congress is such a key part of his agenda that the president will visit as many states as possible at the start of a busy election campaign, a Trump team spokesman, who declined to be named, told Reuters.
According to the West Virginia Metro News, tonight's rally, scheduled for the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling, could bring together supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania, and draw attention from the Pittsburgh media.
Saturday will be Trump's second visit in a month to West Virginia, a state he won in 2016 by more than 40 percentage points.
Trump is trying to help Patrick Morrisey, the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate, who is lagging in the polls.
 It is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president has to come to try to revive him in the polls , said Simon Haeder, a political scientist at West Virginia University, according to Reuters.
Ryder Cup 2018: Team USA ready to fight to keep hope as Sunday's singles draws near
After three singles, Saturday afternoon's four-in-a-row might just be what this Ryder Cup was missing.
The swinging motion of the pendulum is a sporting concept invented by accident but one that players sincerely believe in, and more so than ever in tournaments such as this one.
Where would they place the momentum now?
"They were six points ahead and now four, so it gives us a bit of wings", said Jordan Spieth as he headed back for the day.
Europe is, of course, ahead with four points and twelve more to play for.
The Americans, Spieth said, felt they had a bit of a lead and were encouraged by Spieth and Justin Thomas, who played together all day and boasted three points each out of four.
Spieth has been a terrific example of the green tee.
The energetic cheers intensified as his play progressed, with a crucial putt to tie him in the fourth as he and Thomas were down by two after two holes.
His putt, which won the match on the 15th hole, has prompted a similar outcry from those who tell you he believes the U.S. team is still in the game.
 You really have to stay determined and focus on your game , said Spieth.
That's all any of these players have left now.
18 holes to stand out.
The only players to score more points than Spieth and Thomas in the last two days are Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, as the history of the Ryder Cup attests.
The strange but adorable European pair have won four out of four matches and have no room for error.
Not only were they the only team to not make a bogey on Saturday afternoon, but they also missed it on Saturday morning, Friday afternoon and the last nine holes on Friday morning.
This series, the way their energy seems to circulate between them and the raving crowd point to them as the players to beat on Sunday, and there is no player more popular than Fleetwood or Molinari to whom a potential European victory may be in store as the sun sets on the National Golf Course.
Preferably both at the same time in different holes.
But it is still too early to talk about European glory.
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson quickly defeated Sergio Garcia, the hero of the morning fourball, as he teamed up with Alex Noren.
A bogey and two doubles on the first nine shots sent the Spaniard and Swede into a hole they never got out of.
On Sundays, however, no one is there to help you.
Fourballs and foursomes are so fascinating to watch closely because of the interactions between the pairs, the advice they give and the advice they don't give, and the way a strategy can be flipped in the blink of an eye.
Europe has played better as a team so far and took a considerable lead on the final day, but this foursome session also proved that the Americans have the courage to fight back, which some doubted, especially at home.
Europe leads 10-6 on the final day of the Ryder Cup
Europe will enjoy a strong lead on the final day of the Ryder Cup after beating the United States 10-6 in both the four-ball and foursomes on Saturday.
The inspired duo of Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the charge with two wins over a distressed Tiger Woods, allowing them to score four points so far.
Determined to retain the title they lost to Hazeltine two years ago, Thomas Bjorn's European team made a difference by winning 3-1 in the morning fours, against a disorganized American team.
The United States showed more resilience in the foursomes and won two victories, but failed to close the gap.
Jim Furyk's men must score eight points out of 12 in the singles on Sunday to retain the trophy.
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to score four points in a row, while he and Molinari, nicknamed "Molliwood" after a smashing weekend, are only the second pair in Ryder Cup history to score four points in their first four matches.
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs, they beat the pair of American rookie Bryson Dechambeau and an already tired Woods by an even more decisive 5 and 4.
Woods, who had been lagging through both games on Saturday, has been brilliant on a few occasions, but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in fourballs and foursomes, and seven in a row.
Justin Rose, well-rested for the morning fourballs, teamed with Henrik Stenson in the foursomes, winning the 2-1 victory over Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka, respectively number one and three in the world rankings.
Europe was not spared in the tournament, which took place in the southwest of Paris in cool but clear weather.
Triple winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the record for the Americans by scoring two points on Saturday.
They won a well-deserved 2-1 victory over Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourballs and again beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4-3 in the foursomes, the latter having lost the first two holes.
Only twice in the history of the Ryder Cup has a team recovered from a four-point gap in singles, although Furyk's team, who held the crown, now had to tie to retain their trophy.
After being second for two days, however, they might not recover from a counterattack on Sunday.
North Korea says that disarmament cannot be unilateral without trust.
On Saturday, North Korea's foreign minister told the United Nations that the continuation of sanctions was reinforcing his mistrust of the United States and that it would be impossible for his country to unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons under these circumstances.
At the annual general assembly of the world body, Ri Yong Ho said that North Korea had taken important goodwill measures last year, such as stopping nuclear and missile tests, dismantling the nuclear test site and committing itself not to proliferate nuclear weapons and technology.
 However, we do not see any corresponding response from the US , he regretted.
In the absence of trust in the United States, we will fear for our national security and, in such circumstances, there is no way that we will be the first to disarm unilaterally.
While reiterating North Korea's well-known criticisms of Washington's opposition to a "step-by-step" approach to denuclearisation under which North Korea would be rewarded if it took incremental steps, his statement proved important in that it did not reject the idea of unilateral denuclearisation as Pyongyang had done in the past.
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump, made on June 12 in Singapore at the first-ever summit between a sitting US president and a North Korean leader, when Kim pledged to work towards the "denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula" while Trump promised to guarantee the security of North Korea.
North Korea is seeking to formally end the Korean War (1950-53), but the United States has said Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons.
Washington has also refused calls to ease tough international sanctions on North Korea.
The US is insisting that North Korea denuclearize first and is increasing the pressure by imposing sanctions to achieve their goal in a coercive manner, even opposing "the declaration of the end of the war".
Those who think that these sanctions can make us bend do not know us.
The problem is that the continuation of sanctions increases our mistrust. 
Ri made no comment about the second summit between Kim and Trump highlighted by the US leader at the UN earlier this week.
The minister instead highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the past five months, and added:  If the party concerned with the denuclearization issue was South Korea and not the United States, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a deadlock. 
Still, Ri's tone was radically different from last year when he told the UN General Assembly that it was inevitable that North Korean missiles would be pointed at North American soil after the evil President Trump called Kim a "suicide missile man".
Trump, who last year threatened to "totally destroy" North Korea at the United Nations, did not hold back this year from praising Kim's courage in implementing disarmament measures, but added that much more needs to be done and that sanctions will not be lifted until North Korea disarms.
On Wednesday, Trump said that "no deadline has been set". "It can take two years, three years, or five months; it doesn't matter", he said.
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for its actions.
However, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the UN Security Council last Thursday that:  The Security Council sanctions must be firmly and systematically maintained until complete, final and verified denuclearization. 
The Security Council has unanimously strengthened sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to curb funding for Pyongyang's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes.
Pompeo met with Ri on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly and then announced that he would travel to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit.
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year, but his last trip was somewhat disastrous.
In July, he left Pyongyang claiming that progress had been made, but within hours, North Korea denounced his "gangster-like" methods.
In a meeting with Moon this month, North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile site and a nuclear complex if the United States took equivalent action.
He has said that Kim is demanding the security guarantees Trump promised Singapore, and efforts to normalize relations with Washington.
Harvard: students taking a break from school
This year, Harvard University introduced a new class that allows all undergraduate students to get more sleep and fights the growing male-dominated trend of studying while drinking caffeine all night.
A professor has observed that most students at the world's best universities are not able to care for themselves
The course, designed by Charles Czeisler, a sleep medicine professor at Harvard Medical School and a specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital, is believed to be the first of its kind in the United States.
It was after giving a lecture on the effects of sleep deprivation on learning that the idea came to him.
And at the end, a student came up to me and said, "Why do I only get this in my senior year?"
She claimed that no one had ever talked to her about the importance of sleep, which surprised me, he told The Telegraph.
This course, which was taught for the first time this year, explains to students the need to adopt good sleep habits to improve their academic and physical performance and their general well-being.
Paul Barreira, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and the university's chief medical officer, said the university decided to introduce the course after finding that students were suffering from severe sleep deprivation during the week.
The class hour consists of various interactive exercises.
One of the sections shows a picture of a dormitory containing various objects (coffee cups, curtains, sneakers, books, etc.) that students click on to learn about the effects of caffeine and light, as well as the impact of lack of sleep on their physical performance and the importance of integrating a bedtime routine.
In another section, participants learn how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, depression and cancer.
A campus map with interactive icons then invites participants to reflect on their daily routine.
We know that this will not change the behaviour of the students instantly.
However, we believe they have a right to know this information - just as you have a right to know what the health effects of smoking are", added Professor Czeisler.
He says the culture of pride in "sleeping through the night" still exists, and he adds that modern technology and the ever-increasing pressure on students are making sleep deprivation a growing problem.
Getting enough and good quality sleep should be the secret weapon of students to combat stress, exhaustion and anxiety, he said - even to avoid gaining weight, as lack of sleep puts the brain in a 'nutrition mode', making them hungry all the time.
Raymond So, a 19-year-old chemistry and physical biology student from California, helped Professor Czeisler design this course after he was one of his students last year during his first year at Harvard.
He said that the course had opened his eyes and made him insist that it be offered to the entire campus.
He hopes that the next step will be to offer all postgraduate students a similar programme of study before joining the reputable institution.
Professor Czeisler recommends that students have an alarm for both bedtime and wake-up time, and be aware of the harmful effects of blue light from electronic screens and LED light, which can disrupt their circadian rhythm and lead to sleep disturbances.
Livingston 1-0 Rangers: Menga 's goal knocks off Gerrard 's men and the game is over .
Rangers suffered another tough blow on the outside, with Dolly Menga's attack leading Steven Gerrard's disjointed Livingston team to a 1-0 defeat.
The Ibrox side were hoping to record their first away win since their 4-1 triumph in February at St Johnstone, but Gary Holt's side inflicted Gerrard's second defeat in 18 games as manager, leaving his side adrift, eight points behind Ladbroke Premiership leaders Hearts.
Menga struck seven minutes before half time and the Rangers, out of breath, failed to equalize.
As Rangers now drop to sixth, Livingston climbs to third, just behind Hibernian on goal difference.
And more trouble could be in store for the Rangers, with referee Calum Spence having to be treated for a head injury from a throw from the opposite side.
Gerrard made eight changes to the team, which swept Ayr in the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup.
Holt, on the other hand, picked the same Livi 11 who took a point off the Hearts last week and would have been delighted to see his well-trained team smothering their opponents every turn.
The Rangers may have mastered possession, but Livingston did more.
They should have scored two minutes from the end when Menga's first shot sent Scott Pittman on to Allan McGregor's goal, but the midfielder let his chance pass.
Keaghan Jacobs then fired a powerful shot at Captain Craig Halkett, but his defensive teammate Alan Lithgow could only reach the second post.
The Rangers managed to take control, but there seemed to be more hope than faith in their play in the final third.
Alfredo Morelos certainly felt he should have been given a penalty after the free kick when he and Steven Lawless collided but referee Steven Thomson dismissed the Colombian's claims.
The Rangers only managed two shots in the first period, but former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was barely disturbed by Lassana Coulibaly and a strike from Ovie Ejaria.
If Livi's opening goal in the 34th minute was against the flow of the game, no one can deny that they deserved it because of their hard work.
Once again, the Rangers failed to take Jacobs' free kick.
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher handed the ball to Scott Robinson, who kept his cool and chose Menga for a simple finish.
Gerrard responded at half-time by replacing Coulibaly with Ryan Kent and the trade did have an immediate impact when the winger was introduced to Morelos, but the impressive Kelly rushed to block.
Still, Livingston continued to push visitors to play exactly the type of game they liked, with Lithgow and Halkett sweeping long balls on long balls.
Holt's team could have taken the lead in the last few minutes, but McGregor did a good job of pushing Jacobs back before Lithgow missed the goal.
Rangers replacement Glenn Middleton again claimed a late penalty as he struggled with Jacobs, but Thomson again ignored it.
The inventor of the Geiger counter
And now, a page from our Almanach  Sunday Morning : On September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, and THE COMPUTER TOURNE... the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm  Hans  Geiger was born in Germany.
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity, an invention that later gave rise to the device known as the Geiger counter.
A mainstay of science since then, the Geiger counter has also become fundamental in pop culture, as seen in the 1950 film  Bells of Coronado  starring Roy Rogers and Dale Evans, two unlikely scientists:
Man: What is that ?
Rogers: It's a Geiger counter, we use it to look for radioactive minerals, like uranium.
With these earphones, you can actually hear the effects of atoms released into minerals by radioactivity.
Evans: "You're right, it's going to blow up!"
 Hans  Geiger died in 1945, a few days before his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name remains.
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to detect cancer cells
A new cancer vaccine allows the immune system to  detect  cancer cells and kill them
As part of the treatment, the vaccine tells the immune system how to recognize cancer cells
This technique involves extracting immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory
They can then detect a protein that is common to many cancers, and then they are reinjected
An experimental vaccine is showing encouraging results in patients with various types of cancer.
One woman who received the vaccine, which is designed to teach the immune system to recognize cancer cells, had her ovarian cancer disappear for more than 18 months.
The method involves taking immune cells from a patient and modifying them in the laboratory so that they can detect the HER2 protein, which is common in many cancers, and then injecting them again.
Professor Jay Berzofsky, of the US National Cancer Institute based in Bethesda, Maryland, said: "Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine".
According to Professor Berzofsky, the HER2 protein  causes an increase in several types of cancer , including breast, ovarian, lung and colorectal cancer.
A similar approach, which involves taking immune cells to train them to target cancer cells, has been proven to work in the treatment of a type of leukaemia.
Wearing a MAGA hat, Kanye West has been engaged in a pro-Trump rant after his stint on SNL.
It didn't go well.
Kanye West was booed on set after a wild performance in which he praised US President Donald Trump on Saturday Night Live and announced that he would run for president in 2020.
After his third track, Ghost Town, which he sang while wearing a Make America Great Again hat, West took to the Democrats and reiterated his support for Trump.
A lot of times, I talk to white people, and they say, "How can you love Trump?
 Well, if I was worried about racism, I would have left America a long time ago , he said.
SNL started with a Matt Damon sketch in which the Hollywood star mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee regarding allegations of sexual assault made by Christine Blasey Ford.
Although it was not aired, the recording of West's rant was relayed on social media by comedian Chris Rock.
We don't know if Rock intended to mock West with this publication.
In addition, West had complained to the audience that he had spent the wrong 15 minutes behind the scenes because of his cap.
They put pressure on me.
They told me not to come with that hat on.
They pressured me!
And then they say I'm in a hole", he said, according to the Washington Examiner.
West continued: "Do you want to see him, the abyss?" and said he would wear his Superman cape, because no one could dictate his actions.
Try the love.
His comments drew public boos at least twice and SNL members seemed embarrassed, Variety reported. A person on the set told the magazine:  A dead silence fell on the entire set. 
West was called up at the last minute to replace singer Ariana Grande, whose former boyfriend, rapper Mac Miller, had died a few days earlier.
West has thrown a lot of people off by singing the song I Love it in a Perrier bottle suit.
West was supported by the leader of the TPUSA conservative group, Candace Turner, who tweeted:  To one of the bravest minds: THANK YOU FOR BEING TENU DEAF TO THE FOOL. 
But Karen Hunter, the show's host, tweeted that West was just being true to himself, and that it was absolutely wonderful.
 However, I choose not to reward someone (by buying their music, their clothes or by supporting their art) who I feel is adopting and rejecting an ideology that is harmful to my community.
He's free to go.
And so are we, she added.
Prior to the show, the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and claimed that he was now officially known as Kanye West.
He is not the first artist to change his name and follows in the footsteps of Diddy, also known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Rapper Snoop Dogg was named after Snoop Lion and of course the late legendary Prince, who changed his name to symbol, then the artist formerly known as Prince.
Belfast: Accused of attempted murder after stabbing at restaurant
A 45-year-old man is charged with attempted murder after a man was stabbed last Friday at a restaurant in west Belfast.
Police say the incident took place at Ballyhackamore.
The defendant is due to appear in the Belfast Magistrates' Court on Monday.
The charges will be examined by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
"Game of Thrones" star Kit Harington is taking on toxic masculinity
Kit Harington is best known for his role as the thin-skinned, Jon Snow in HBO's medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor is caught up in the stereotype of the macho hero, saying that this type of role on screen often leads young boys to pose as tough guys to get respect.
In an interview with the Sunday Times Culture, Kit said he thinks "something is wrong" and addressed the issue of toxic masculinity in the #MeToo era.
Kit, who recently married Rose Leslie, also a Game of Thrones co-star, said he was "firmly" committed to tackling the issue.
I personally think deep down we have misused masculinity.
 What lessons have we taught young men who are becoming adults, in relation to the problem that is now being faced? 
According to Kit, television may be partly responsible for the increase in toxic masculinity because of its very masculine characters.
He continued: "What behavior is innate, what behavior has been inculcated?
What is it that television and the streets teach young boys that they have to behave like that to be a man?
I think it's really one of the fundamental questions of our time - how can we change that?
There's obviously something wrong.
In the interview, he also admitted that he would not be doing prologues or sequels when the series ended next summer, claiming to be done with "battlefields and horses".
Starting in November, Kit will star in a remake of Sam Shepard's True West, which tells the story of a film producer and his thieving brother.
Recently, the actor revealed that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that ever happened to him on Game of Thrones.
 I met my wife in this series, so she gave me my future family and my life from now on , he says.
Rose played Ygritte, the lover of Kit's character Jon Snow, in the Emmy-winning fantasy series.
The couple married in June 2018 in Scotland, at Leslie's family estate.
China reports 14% increase in new HIV cases
China reported a 14 percent increase in the number of people living with HIV and AIDS.
According to the Chinese health authorities, more than 820,000 people are affected.
Almost 40,000 new cases were reported in the second quarter of 2018.
Most of the patients were infected during sexual intercourse, which is a new development.
Historically, the virus spread rapidly in some parts of the country through contaminated blood transfusions.
However, the number of people infected with HIV in this way has been reduced to virtually zero, Chinese health authorities said at a conference in Yunnan province.
However, over the past year, the number of people living with HIV and AIDS in China has increased by 100,000.
In the Chinese LGBT community, HIV transmission through sexual intercourse is a serious problem.
Homosexuality was decriminalized in China in 1997, but discrimination against the LGBT community remains widespread.
Because of the country's conservative values, studies estimate that 70 to 90 percent of gay men end up marrying a woman.
Many cases of transmission are due to inadequate sexual protection.
As part of its efforts to combat this problem, the Chinese government has promised universal access to HIV medicines since 2003.
Maxine Waters denies that a GOP employee leaked data about senators, and denounces dangerous lies and conspiracy theories.
On Saturday, U.S. Republican Maxine Waters denounced allegations that a member of her staff had posted personal information about three Republican senators on Wikipedia's lawmakers' pages.
The Los Angeles Democrat claimed that these statements were backed by experts and right-wing extremist websites.
"Lies, lies, and more infamous lies", Waters responded in a statement on Twitter.
It appears that the leaked information included the addresses and phone numbers of U.S. senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch, both of Utah.
The information was posted online Thursday by an unknown person on Capitol Hill during the Senate hearing on the allegations of sexual assault against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
The leak occurred shortly after the three senators questioned Kavanaugh.
According to the Hill, conservative sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState have reported that the IP address identifying the source of the messages was associated with Waters' office and have leaked information from a Waters staff member.
According to Waters,  this unsubstantiated allegation is completely false and an absolute lie .
 The member of my team, whose identity, personal information and security has been compromised due to these fraudulent and false allegations, is in no way responsible for the leak of this information. 
 This fallacious claim is completely false and a complete lie. 
Waters' statement quickly drew criticism online, including from Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary.
"This denial is anger", he wrote.
 This indicates that she does not possess the necessary temperament to be a member of Congress.
When a person is accused of something he has not done, he should not be angry.
It must not be provocative.
It must not call into question the motives of the accuser.
She needs to stay calm and collected.
Fleischer appeared to be comparing Waters' reaction to Democrats' criticism of Judge Kavanaugh, who was accused of appearing too angry at Thursday's hearing.
Omar Navarro, a Republican candidate for the Waters seat in the midterm elections, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
 If it is true, it is huge , he wrote on Twitter.
In his statement, Waters said that his office had alerted the relevant law enforcement authorities and services to these fraudulent claims.
 We will ensure that the culprits are unmasked , she added,  and that they are held accountable for all their destructive and dangerous acts towards all members of my team .
Johnny English has struck again, parodying Rowan Atkinson, under-the-radar spy
It has now become a tradition to seek out the significance of Brexit in brand new British films and this seems to apply to this revival of the action comedy Johnny English, which debuted in 2003 with Johnny English and resurfaced in 2011 with Johnny English, the Return.
Will the ironic self-satire on the question of the obviousness of our insignificance represent the new export opportunity of our country?
In any case, the incompetent Johnny English, with his rubbery face and beady eyes, has had his licence renewed for a second time in a confusing context - this name indicating above all that this is a great comic creation designed for a non-English-speaking cinema audience.
Of course, he's the silly secret agent who, despite his dubious attempts at glamorous charm, possesses a little of Clouseau, a hint of Mr Bean and a good dose of the type who executes a small note in Chariots of Fire at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games.
It was also originally inspired by the traveller and international mystery man Atkinson once played in the now-forgotten Barclaycard TV commercials, leaving the chaos behind him.
The last Johnny English has one or two sympathetic moments.
I liked Johnny English approaching a helicopter while wearing medieval armor and the rotor blades briefly hitting his helmet.
Atkinson's talent for physical comedy is highlighted, though the humour is rather lacking and strangely superfluous, especially at a time when serious franchises like 007 and Mission Impossible confidently compose themselves with comedy.
The humor seems more child-oriented than adult-oriented, and, to me, Johnny English's wacky misadventures are less creative and less focused than Atkinson's silent film gags in Bean's character.
The perpetually current premise is that Britain has serious problems.
A hacker infiltrated the top-secret web of British spies, revealing the identities of all British agents on the ground, much to the dismay of the agents in charge - an unfortunate low-level role for Kevin Eldon.
This is the final straw for a Prime Minister who is a pompous figure on the verge of crisis and already suffering from political unpopularity: Emma Thompson gives her best with this quasi-Teresa-May character, but there is not much to be put under the tooth in the script.
Her intelligence advisors have informed her that with every active spy compromised, she'll have to get someone out of retirement.
That means we have to disturb Johnny English himself, who is now employed at a fancy establishment as a school teacher, but who is secretly giving lessons on how to become a secret agent: some pretty good jokes here, because English offers a Rock Academy style espionage academy.
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and is reunited with Bough, his long-time partner, once again backed by Ben Miller.
Bough is now married, attached to a submarine commander, a fun hockey-stick role in which Vicki Pepperdine is a bit of a waste.
So, Batman and Robin, who have been causing a lot of trouble for His Majesty's secret services, go back to the drawing board and meet Olga Kurylenko, the beautiful, fatal woman Ophelia Bulletova.
Meanwhile, the Prime Minister falls dangerously under the spell of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain's IT problems: the sinister Jason Volta, played by Jake Lacy.
English and Bough launch their odyssey of far-fetched jokes: disguised as waiters, they set fire to a flamboyant French restaurant; they create chaos by sneaking onto Volta's luxury sailboat; and English sets off a veritable anarchy when he tries, with a virtual reality headset, to familiarize himself with the interior of Volta's house.
All the stops are secured for this last sequence, but still, there's a lot of stuff for the kids in this.
It's a moderate film.
I couldn't help but wonder, as with other Johnny English films, if the British film industry could not offer Rowan Atkinson a role that would really value his talent.
The Labour Party denies having devised a plan whereby the British could work four days but be paid for five
Jeremy Corbyn's Labour Party must consider a radical plan that will allow Britons to work four days a week - but be paid for five.
Apparently, the party wants business leaders to benefit workers from the savings generated by artificial intelligence (AI) by giving them an extra day off.
This would allow employees to enjoy a three-day weekend, while still receiving the same pay.
According to some sources, the idea would be in line with the party's economic program and plans to orient the country in favour of the workers.
The move to a four-day week was approved by the trade union congress as a way for workers to take advantage of economic changes.
A senior Labour Party source told the Sunday Times: "A policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year".
 It will not be done overnight, but a four-day work week is a goal that goes hand in hand with the party's approach to rebalancing the economy in favour of workers and its overall industrial strategy .
Labour would not be the first to support this idea, as the Green Party committed to a four-day working week during its 2017 general election campaign.
However, this aspiration is not currently supported by the Labour Party as a whole.
A Labour spokesman said: "A four-day work week is not a party policy and is not being considered by the party".
Deputy Chancellor John McDonnell took the opportunity of last week's Labour conference to detail his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy.
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to take power back from the 'anonymous' directors and 'profiteers' in the public utilities.
The plans of the Deputy Chancellor also envisage that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover their full stake since the Labour government could make  deductions  due to alleged misconduct.
It also confirmed its plan to integrate workers into company boards and to create an inclusive shareholders' fund which will pay 10% of the capital of private companies to employees, who will receive up to £500 in dividends a year.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy tell 60 Minutes that the FBI's investigation into Kavanaugh may change their minds.
The final vote on Brett Kavanaugh's Supreme Court nomination has been postponed for at least a week following the FBI's investigation into the charges against him and raises the question of whether the Bureau's findings could prompt Republican senators to withdraw their support.
In an interview aired Sunday, Scott Pelley, a correspondent for 60 Minutes, asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham if the FBI could find anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was more open than his South Carolina colleague.
"Of course", said Kennedy.
When I went to the hearing, I said I had spoken to Judge Kavanaugh.
I called him after it happened, when these allegations were made, and I asked him, "Did you do this?"
He was resolute, determined, unequivocal.
However, Graham's vote seems to be set in stone.
"I've made my decision on Brett Kavanaugh and it would require an explosive indictment", he said.
"Dr. Ford, I don't know what happened, but I do know this: Brett categorically denied it", Graham added, referring to Christine Blasey Ford.
And the people she named couldn't verify it.
This is a 36-year-old case.
I don't see anything new or changing.
What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it done anything to reduce poverty?
This Saturday, New York will host the Global Citizen Festival, an annual music event with a very impressive star lineup and an equally impressive mission: to end world poverty.
The Global Citizen Festival, now in its seventh year, will see tens of thousands of people flock to the Great Lawn of Central Park to not only enjoy the performances of artists such as Janet Jackson, Cardi B and Shawn Mendes, but also to raise awareness of the festival's true goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030.
The Global Citizen Festival, which was first held in 2012, is an extension of the Global Poverty Project, an international advocacy group that hopes to eradicate poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it.
In order to receive a free ticket to the event (unless you are willing to pay for a VIP ticket), spectators had to complete a series of tasks, or actions, such as volunteering, emailing a world leader, phoning or any other useful effort to raise awareness of the fight against poverty.
But how much more can the Global Citizen organization achieve in the twelve years that remain?
Does the idea of rewarding people with a free concert really persuade them to demand a call to action, or is it just another example of "clicktivism" - a situation where people really think they can make a difference by signing a petition or sending a tweet?
Since 2011, Global Citizen has recorded over 19 million actions by supporters, who advocate for many different causes.
According to the organisation, these actions have helped to push global leaders to commit to and adopt policies worth more than $37 billion that are expected to change the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In early 2018, the group listed 390 commitments and announcements arising from its shares, of which at least $10 billion has already been disbursed or raised.
The group estimates that the funds secured have so far directly impacted nearly 649 million people worldwide.
Key commitments include The Power of Nutrition, a UK partnership of investors and practitioners who have pledged to help children develop their full potential, while also pledging £35 million to help Rwanda end malnutrition in that country after receiving over 4,700 messages from Global Citizens.
 With the support of the UK government, donors, national governments and global citizens like you, we can make the social injustice of malnutrition a footnote in history , Tracey Ullman, ambassador for The Power of Nutrition Programme told the crowd at a concert in London in April 2018.
The group also said that following the launch of more than 5 000 actions to ask the UK to improve nutrition for mothers and children, the government has announced funding for a project, The Power of Nutrition, which will benefit 5 million women and children through nutritional interventions.
In response to one of the most frequently asked questions on its website, "What makes you think that it is possible to end extreme poverty?"
Global Citizen said:  The road to get there will be long and difficult, sometimes we will fall and fail.
But like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us, we will succeed, because we are stronger together.
Janet Jackson, The Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the artists performing this year in New York, where Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman will host the show.
US could use Navy to create blockade to impede Russian energy exports - Home Secretary
To prevent Russian energy from reaching markets, including the Middle East, Washington may use the US Navy if necessary, US Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke was quoted by the Washington Examiner as saying.
Zinke said that Russia's presence in Syria - particularly where it operates at the request of the legitimate government - is a pretext for exploring new energy markets.
 I believe they are in the Middle East to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe, the southern centre of Europe, he would have said.
According to the official representative, there are ways to remedy this.
 The US can, with our Navy, ensure that the sea lanes are open and, if necessary, obstruct them to ensure that their energy is not put on the market , he added.
Zinke was addressing participants at the event held by the Consumer Energy Alliance, a non-profit organisation that describes itself as the "voice of energy consumers" in the US.
He compared Washington's approaches to relations with Russia and Iran, stressing that they are in fact identical.
 As for Iran and Russia, the economic option is more or less to exploit and replace fossil fuels, he said, while referring to Russia as having  more than one string in its bow  with an economy dependent on fossil fuels.
These statements come as the Trump administration has pledged to boost its liquefied natural gas exports to Europe, replacing Russia as a much cheaper alternative for European consumers.
To do this, Trump administration officials, including US President Donald Trump himself, are trying to convince Germany to exit the inappropriate Nord Stream 2 pipeline project, which Trump says makes the city of Berlin a prisoner of Moscow.
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline, which is expected to double the current capacity to 110 billion cubic meters, is a purely economic project.
The Kremlin claims that Washington's strong opposition to the project is simply motivated by economic reasons and is an example of unfair competition.
In a speech in Moscow in September following a meeting with Rick Perry, the US energy secretary, Russian energy minister Alexander Novak said: "I believe we share the view that energy cannot be a tool of pressure and that consumers should be able to choose their suppliers".
The US position was met with negative reactions from Germany, which reaffirmed its involvement in the project.
The main German industrial organisation, the Federation of German Industries (BDI), has called on the US not to get involved in European energy policy or in the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow.
I have a huge problem when a third country interferes with our energy supply, said Dieter Kempf, the director of the Federation of German Industries (BDI) following a recent meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Elizabeth Warren will seriously consider running for president in 2020, says Massachusetts senator
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren announced on Saturday that she would seriously consider running for president following the midterm elections.
At a public meeting in Holyoke, Massachusetts, Warren confirmed that she would consider running.
"It's time for women to go to Washington and fix our broken government, and for that, a woman will have to be at the top", she said, according to The Hill.
 After November 6th, I will seriously consider running for president. 
Warren spoke out about President Donald Trump at the rally, saying he was leading this country in the wrong direction.
 I am very worried about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy , she said.
Warren has been outspoken in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Friday, in a tweet, Warren said: "Obviously, we need an FBI investigation before we vote".
However, a poll released on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren's voters do not think she should run in 2020.
According to the Suffolk University and Boston Globe Political Research Center poll, 58 percent of likely voters in Massachusetts said the senator should not run.
32 per cent were in favour of such a campaign.
The poll found that former Governor Deval Patrick had more support, with 38 percent in favor of a potential campaign and 48 percent against it.
Other high-profile Democratic names mentioned for a potential 2020 campaign include former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to the Associated Press, Biden said he would make an official decision by January.
Sarah Palin discusses Track Palin's PTSD during the rally for Donald Trump
Track Palin, 26, spent a year in Iraq after his enlistment in September.
On Monday night, he was arrested and charged in connection with a domestic violence incident.
"What my own son is feeling right now, what he's feeling coming home, I can relate it to other families who are feeling the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are coming back with", she told the crowd at the Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma.
Palin called his arrest a "taboo subject" and said of his son and other veterans that they come back a little different, hardened, wondering if they respect what their comrades and members of the Air Force, and every other military, have given to the country.
According to Dan Bennett, a spokesman for the Wasilla Police Department, he was arrested Monday in Wasilla, Alaska, and charged with assault and domestic violence against a woman, which interferes with a report of domestic violence and possession of a weapon while intoxicated.
18 states and the District of Columbia support a legal challenge to the new asylum policy
18 states and the District of Columbia are in favor of a legal challenge to the new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence.
In Washington on Friday, representatives from 18 states and the District filed a brief in favor of an asylum seeker who challenged the policy, NBC News reported.
The full name of the plaintiff in the case Grace v. Sessions filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the federal policy has not been released.
She said that her partner  and his sons , members of violent gangs, had assaulted her, but the US authorities decided to reject her asylum application on 20 July.
She was arrested in Texas.
State prosecutors supporting Grace described El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala, which generate large numbers of asylum claims in the United States, as countries facing widespread gang and domestic violence problems.
The new U.S. asylum policy overturned a 2014 ruling by the Board of Immigration Appeals that allowed illegal immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum.
Karl Racine, the Attorney General for the District of Columbia, said in a statement Friday that the new policy "ignores decades of state, federal and international law".
 Federal law states that all asylum applications must be examined in the light of the particular facts and circumstances of the application, and such a ban violates this principle , the amicus curiae stated in its brief.
The lawyers also argued in the brief that the policy of denying entry to immigrants harms the US economy, arguing that they are more likely to become entrepreneurs and provide the necessary work.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions in June ordered immigration judges to stop granting asylum to victims fleeing domestic violence and gang violence.
 Asylum is granted to people who leave their country of origin because of persecution or fear on account of race, creed, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political convictions,  Sessions said in his June 11 policy announcement.
 Asylum was never designed to alleviate all the problems - even the most serious ones - that people face every day around the world. 
Desperate rescue efforts in Palu as death toll doubles in race to find survivors
For the survivors, the situation is becoming more and more tragic.
"I feel very tense", said Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, as she comforted her feverish baby boy in Palu, an evacuation center in the emptied city.
 Every minute, an ambulance is bringing back bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
Residents were seen running to their destroyed homes, collecting waterlogged property and trying to save what they could find.
Hundreds of people were injured and hospitals damaged by the 7.5-magnitude quake were flooded.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, who suffered from fractured back and shoulders, rested outside the Palu Military Hospital, where patients were being treated outside due to persistent strong aftershocks.
Tears filled his eyes as he told how he felt the strong earthquake that shook the hotel room on the fifth floor where he lived with his wife and daughter.
We didn't have time to save ourselves.
I was crushed in the ruins of the wall, I believe", Haris told the Associated Press, adding that his family was in town for a wedding.
I heard my wife calling for help, but then there was silence.
I don't know what happened to her or my child.
I hope they're safe.
US Ambassador accuses China of intimidating China through propaganda ads
A week after a Chinese official newspaper ran a four-page advertisement extolling the mutual benefits of U.S.-China trade in an American daily, the U.S. ambassador to China accused Beijing of using the U.S. press to spread propaganda.
US President Donald Trump on Wednesday referred to the China Daily surcharge in the Des Moines Register - the largest selling newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of trying to interfere in the US congressional elections on November 6, an accusation China denies.
By accusing Beijing of seeking to interfere in the US election, Trump marked what US officials told Reuters as a new phase in a growing campaign by Washington to put pressure on China.
While it is common for foreign governments to place advertisements to promote trade, Beijing and Washington are currently paralyzed in a growing trade war that has led them to apply reciprocal tariffs on their imports.
In the early days of the trade war, China's tariff measures were aimed at hitting exporters from states like Iowa that supported Trump's Republican Party, Chinese and American experts said.
Terry Branstad, the US ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa, a major agricultural exporter to China, said Beijing had hurt American workers, farmers and businesses.
China, Branstad wrote in an opinion piece in Sunday's Des Moines Register, "is doubling down on its intimidation by publishing propaganda in our own free press".
 In spreading its propaganda, the Chinese government is using the American tradition of freedom of speech and freedom of the press by placing a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register , Branstad writes.
 On the other hand, at the Beijing press counter, you will find few dissenting voices and will not see the true reflection of the divergent views that Chinese people may have on China's troubling economic trajectory, as the media is firmly obedient to the Chinese Communist Party , he writes.
He added that one of the most important newspapers in China avoided publishing his article, but did not say which newspaper.
Analysts warn Republicans are alienating female voters as the midterm election approaches because of the Kavanaugh debacle.
While many senior Republicans are defending Brett Kavanaugh, who was nominated to the Supreme Court amid allegations of sexual assault, analysts have warned that a backlash, especially among women, could occur during the upcoming midterm elections.
The sentiment surrounding this case has been extremely strong, and most Republicans have already publicly shown that they want the vote to take place.
In a September 29 article in The Hill, Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University's Maxwell School, argued that "we can't go back".
Reeher added that he doubts that Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) 's last-minute efforts to push for an FBI investigation will be enough to quell voter anger.
According to Karine Jean-Pierre, senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn, "women will not forget what happened yesterday; they will not forget tomorrow, and not in November", she said on September 28 according to the Washington Post.
On Friday morning, protesters chanted "November is coming!" in the Senate corridor as Republicans overseeing the Judiciary Committee chose to move forward with Kavanaugh's nomination despite testimony from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
 Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be out of proportion , said Stu Rothenberg, a non-partisan political analyst.
 People say it's already high, it's true.
But it could be even higher, especially among suburban voters and young voters aged 18 to 29 who, even if they don't like the president, often don't vote. 
Even before Ford's public testimony detailing the sexual assault allegations against the Supreme Court nominee, analysts suggested that the backlash could be sharp if the Republicans move forward with confirmation.
According to NBC News, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele said earlier this week that "it's become a confusing mess for the GOP".
 It's not just about the committee vote or the final vote, or Kavanaugh's nomination, it's also about how the Republicans handled the situation and how they handled it , Guy Cecil, director of America's Priorities, a group that helps elected Democrats, told the newspaper on television.
Following the testimony of Ford and Kavanaugh, however, Americans seem to be divided over the credibility of both sides, with a small majority leaning towards the latter.
A new YouGov poll found that 41% of respondents either completely or probably believed Ford's testimony, while 35% said they either completely or probably believed Kavanaugh.
In addition, 38 percent said they believed Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his testimony, while only 30 percent said the same about Ford.
According to The Guardian, the FBI is investigating allegations made by Ford and at least one other accuser, Deborah Ramirez, after pressure from Senator Flake.
Ford testified under oath last week before the Senate Judiciary Committee that she was assaulted by Kavanaugh while he was drunk at the age of 17.
Ramirez claims that when they were students at Yale in the 1980s, the Supreme Court nominee showed him his genitals at a party.
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning to launch a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is launching a brand new company that seeks to compete with Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project of the tech legend, Inrupt, is a company that leverages Berners-Lee's free Solid platform.
Solid enables users to choose where their data is stored and who is authorised to access it.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee jokingly stated that Inrupt was aiming to dominate the world .
"We have to do it now", he said of the launch.
 This is a historic moment. 
The application uses Solid technology to enable people to create their own personal data store online or DPL.
It can contain contact lists, to-do lists, a calendar, a music library and other personal and professional tools.
It's as if Google Drive, Microsoft Outlook, Slack and Spotify were all available at the same time in one browser.
The peculiarity of the online personal data store is that it is entirely up to the user to decide who can access what type of information.
The company calls this 'personal responsibility through data'.
According to the company's CEO, John Bruce, the idea behind Inrupt is that the company brings the right resources, processes and skills to make Solid accessible to everyone.
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee, Bruce, a security platform bought by IBM, a few developers working on contract on the project and a community of volunteer coders.
Starting this week, technology developers around the world will be able to create their own decentralized applications using the tools available on the Inrupt website.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team are not yet in discussions with Facebook and Google about whether or not to make a complete change where all their business models are completely upended in an instant.
 We don't ask their permission.
In an article published Saturday on Medium, Berners-Lee writes that the mission of Inrupt is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem for the purpose of protecting the integrity and quality of the new web built on Solid.
In 1994, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee transformed the Internet by creating the World Wide Web Consortium.
Over the past few months, Berners-Lee has been an influential voice in the net neutrality debate.
Although he launched Inrupt, Berners-Lee will remain the founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium, the Web Foundation and the Open Data Institute.
 I am extremely optimistic about this new era of the web , added Berners-Lee.
Bernard Vann: Celebration of a First World War clergyman decorated with the Victoria Cross
The only Church of England clergyman to be awarded the Victoria Cross during the First World War as a combatant was commemorated in his home town 100 years later.
Lieutenant Colonel Bernard Vann won this distinction on 29 September 1918, during the attack on Bellenglise and Lehaucourt.
He was killed by a sniper four days later, however, and was unaware that he had been awarded Britain's highest military honour.
His two grandchildren unveiled a memorial stone at a parade in Rushden, Northamptonshire, last Saturday.
Michael Vann, one of his grandsons, said it was "brilliantly symbolic" to unveil the stone exactly 100 years after his grandfather's feat.
According to the London Gazette, on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant Colonel Vann led his battalion over the St Quentin's Canal  through a very thick fog and under heavy fire from field guns and machine guns .
Later, he rushed to the firing line and, with the greatest bravery, led the line before blowing up a field gun by himself and knocking out three soldiers of the detachment.
On October 4, 1918, a German sniper killed Lieutenant Colonel Vann, just over a month before the war ended.
Michael Vann, 72, said that his grandfather's actions were something I could never measure up to, but that made me humble.
He and his brother, Dr James Vann, also laid a wreath after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band.
Michael Vann said that he felt very honored to be part of the parade and added that the courage of a true hero is reflected in the support that he will be given by many people.
Mixed martial arts fans stayed up all night watching Bellator 206, but instead they got Peppa Pig.
Imagine this, you spent all night watching a fully loaded Bellator 206, but you couldn't see the main event.
In San Jose, the event featured 13 fights, including six on the main card, and was broadcast live all night in the UK on Channel 5.
At 6am, as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to face off, UK viewers were startled when the broadcast changed to Peppa Pig.
Some were unhappy about staying up until the wee hours of the morning, especially for the fight.
One Twitter supporter described the move to children's cartoons as a kind of bad joke.
Regarding the broadcast, Bellator senior vice president of marketing and communications Dave Schwartz said that "the government regulation says that at 6 a.m., that content is not appropriate, so they had to switch to kids' shows".
 "Peppa the pig", yeah. 
Scott Coker, chairman of Bellator, said they would work on their programming to include British viewers in the future.
 I think when I think about broadcasting, I think we can probably find a solution , said Coker.
 However, it is six o'clock in the morning on a Sunday and we will not be able to find a solution until Sunday our time, or Monday their time.
But we're working on it.
Believe me, when the program flipped, there were a lot of messages going back and forth and not all of them were friendly.
We were trying to fix it, we thought it was a technical problem.
But it wasn't a problem, it was a government issue.
I can guarantee you that it won't happen next time.
We'll limit ourselves to five fights instead of six - as we usually do - and we tried to give more for the fans and we ruined everything.
This is a regrettable situation.
Desert Island Discs: Tom Daley felt inferior in terms of his sexuality
Olympic diver Tom Daley says he grew up feeling inferior to others because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to succeed.
The 24-year-old said he didn't realize until he was in high school that "not everyone [was] like me".
As part of the first Radio 4 Desert Island Discs show presented by Lauren Laverne, he said he spoke about the issue of gay rights to give others hope.
He also said that becoming a parent had made him less interested in winning the Olympics.
The regular host of the show, Kirsty Young, has taken a leave of absence for several months due to her illness.
Appearing as a castaway on the first Laverne's show, Daley confessed that he felt less than all the other kids growing up because it was not socially acceptable to like boys and girls.
He said, "Even today, those feelings of inferiority and being different are the very things that gave me the power and the strength to succeed".
In order not to disappoint everyone when they finally learned the truth about his sexuality, he wanted to prove that he was "something", he continued.
The two-time Olympic bronze medalist is now a prominent LGBT activist and took advantage of his participation in this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalise homosexuality.
He said he spoke out because he felt lucky to be able to live openly without ramifications and that he wanted to give hope back to others.
The three-time world champion said he "didn't expect" to fall in love with a man - American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom he met in 2013
Daley married the Oscar winner last year, 20 years her senior, but he said the age difference had never been an issue.
 Having seen so much at such a young age  - he participated in his first Olympic Games at the age of 14 and his father died of cancer three years later - he confidently says that it was difficult to find someone of his age who had experienced the same ups and downs.
In June, they became parents to a son named Robert Ray Black-Daley, and Daley claimed that his entire outlook had changed.
"If you had asked me last year, I would have thought only of winning a gold medal", he said.
You know what, there are more important things than Olympic gold medals.
My Olympic gold medal, this is Robbie.
His son is named after his father Robert, who died in 2011 at the age of 40 from brain cancer.
Daley said that his father had not accepted that he was going to die and that one of the last things he asked him was if they already had their tickets for London 2012, as he wanted to sit in the front row.
I couldn't tell him, 'Dad, you're not going to be there to be in the front row,' he said.
I was holding his hand when he stopped breathing and it took him to stop breathing and die for me to finally recognize that he was not invincible, he added.
The following year, Daley competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics and won a bronze medal.
 It was everything I had dreamed of my whole life - to dive in front of a home crowd at the Olympic Games, there is nothing better , he said.
In addition, it inspired his first song choice - Proud by Heather Small - which had accompanied him in the preparations for the Olympics and still gave him goosebumps.

A Mickelson out of shape on the Ryder Cup bench Saturday.
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday in his 47th Ryder Cup match, but he'll have to straighten out to avoid an unfortunate step.
Mickelson, who was competing in the biannual event for the 12th time, a record, was disqualified by Saturday's fourball and foursome captain Jim Furyk.
Instead of being in the thick of the action, as he so often was for the United States, the five-time grand champion split his day between the role of endurance and fine-tuning his pitch play in an attempt to remedy his ailments.
He was never the greatest of all leaders, even at the peak of his career, and at 48 years of age, he is not the most suitable for the difficult Golf National, where the long rough systematically punishes stray shots.
And as if the course wasn't scary enough, Mickelson, in Sunday's ninth match, faces British Open winner Francesco Molinari, who teamed up this week with Tommy Fleetwood to win all four of their matches.
If the Americans, down four at the start of the 12 singles matches, get off to a good start, Mickelson's match could prove to be absolutely crucial.
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man, but he couldn't say much else.
"He fully understood the role he had to play today, gave me a pat on the back, put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow", Furyk said.
He has great confidence in himself.
He's a legendary champion and he's added so much to these teams in the past, just like this week.
I probably didn't see him play two games.
I had planned more, but that's the way it happened and that's the way we felt we should proceed.
He wants to be there, like everyone else.
On Sunday, Mickelson will beat Nick Faldo's record for the most Ryder Cup matches played.
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never quite reached the heights of his individual record.
Mickelson has 18 wins, 20 losses and seven draws, although Furyk has claimed that his presence has brought some tangible elements to the team.
He is funny, sarcastic, witty, likes to make fun of people, and is a great guy to have in the team room", he explained.
I think the younger players had a lot of fun competing against him this week, which was fun to watch.
He's doing more than playing.
The captain of the European team Thomas Bjorn knows that the lead could soon disappear
Thomas Bjorn, the European captain, knows from experience that a small lead before the last day of the Ryder Cup can easily turn into a tough race.
The Dane played his first match in 1997 in Valderrama, where a team captained by Seve Ballesteros had a five-point lead over the Americans, but eventually climbed to the top of the standings with the smallest possible gap on the finish line, winning 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"You keep reminding yourself that we were going wide at Valderrama; we had a big lead at Brookline, where we failed, as well as at Valderrama, where we won, but just by a little bit", said Bjorn, after watching the 2018 Rankings win 5-3 on both Friday and yesterday at the National Golf to lead 10-6.
History will prove to me and all the members of this team that this is not the end.
You'll have to do it tomorrow.
Go and do whatever you have to do.
It's not over until we get the points on the board.
We have one goal, which is to try and win this trophy, and that's what we have to stay focused on.
I always said I focus on the 12 players on our side, but we are very aware of what is happening on the other side - they are the best players in the world.
Delighted with the performances of his players on a difficult golf course, Bjorn added:  I would never go that far.
Tomorrow is a whole different set of sleeves.
Tomorrow, it's the individual performances that will be presented and it's a whole different story.
It's great to be with a teammate when things are going well, but when you're out there on your own, you're being tested to the full extent of your ability as a golfer.
That's the message to the players, is to make the best of yourselves tomorrow.
When you leave your partner behind, he has to go get the best out of himself, too.
Unlike Bjorn, his counterpart Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players achieve better results individually than as teammates, with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, who got three out of four points.
Furyk himself experienced both ends of these final day twists, having been part of the winning team in Brookline before losing at the end of the Miracle of Medina, where Europe took the victory.
"I remember every word", he said in response to a question about how Ben Crenshaw, the captain in 1999, had rallied his players on the last day.
We have 12 important meetings tomorrow, but you'd want to make this quick start as you saw in Brookline, as you saw in Medina.
This dynamic, when it goes in one direction, puts a lot of pressure on the midfield games.
We set up our training accordingly and put the guys like we thought we were supposed to do, we're trying to do magic tomorrow. 
Thomas was given the task of leading the counterattack and will face Rory McIlroy in the first-class duel, with Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter, the other Europeans in the top half of the standings.
"I've accompanied this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole course", Bjorn said of his singles selections.
Germany's new warship delayed again
According to local media, the new German Navy frigate was supposed to be commissioned in 2014 to replace the aging warships dating back to the Cold War, but it will not be commissioned until at least next year due to faulty systems and exponential spending.
According to the newspaper Die Zeit, which quotes a military spokesman, the commissioning of the  Rheinland-Pfalz , the flagship of the new frigates of Baden-Württemberg, has been postponed to the first half of 2019.
The ship was scheduled to enter the Navy in 2014, but troubling post-delivery issues jeopardized the fate of this ambitious project.
The four Bade-Wurtemberg class ships that the Navy ordered in 2007 will replace the aging Bremen class frigates.
It is certain that they will be equipped with a powerful gun, a range of anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles as well as certain stealth technologies, such as a radar, infrared and reduced acoustic signature.
Other important features include longer maintenance periods - it should be possible to deploy the latest frigates for up to two years outside home ports.
According to Die Zeit, however, the incessant delays mean that the forward-thinking warships - which should enable Germany to project its strength overseas - will already be obsolete when they are commissioned.
Last year, the cursed frigate F125 made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to commission the ship and sent it back to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time the Navy had returned a ship to a shipbuilder after its delivery.
The reasons for this return were little known, but the German media mentioned a number of software and hardware defects that rendered the warship useless in case of deployment on a combat mission.
The software flaws were particularly significant as the Baden-Württemberg class ships will be operated by a crew of around 120 sailors, which is half the number of the old Bremen class frigates.
In addition, it appears that the ship is significantly overloaded, which reduces its efficiency and reduces the Navy's ability to make future improvements.
It is estimated that the 7,000-tonne Rheinland-Pfalz weighs twice as much as the similar class of ships used by the Germans in World War II.
Apart from the failures of the computer system, the cost of the project as a whole - including the training of the crew - also becomes a problem.
It is said to have reached the astronomical sum of 3.1 billion euros (3.6 billion dollars), up from 2.2 billion initially.
The problems of the new frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany's naval strength is declining.
Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German parliament's defense committee, acknowledged earlier this year that the Navy is in fact  short of ships able to deploy .
The official said that the situation had a snowball effect over time, as the old ships were decommissioned but no replacement vessels were designated.
He regretted that none of the Baden-Württemberg-class frigates had been able to join the Navy.
The National Trust is monitoring the secret lives of bats
New research in a field in the Scottish Highlands is revealing how bats use the landscape in their search for food.
It is hoped that the observations will shed new light on the behavior of these unique flying mammals and guide future conservation activities.
The study by researchers from the National Trust for Scotland will follow common bats and sopranos as well as long-eared brown bats and Daubenton bats at Winterweed Garden in Wester Ross.
Special recording devices will be placed at key locations around the property to track bat activities throughout the season.
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile studies using portable detectors.
A professional sound analysis will determine the frequency of the bats' calls and the activities of the different species.
A map and habitat report will be drawn up to provide a detailed picture of their behaviour at the territorial level.
Rob Dewar, conservation adviser for the NTS, hopes the results will reveal the most important areas of habitat for bats and how they are used by each species.
This information will help to determine the benefits of habitat management work such as the creation of grasslands and how best to preserve forests for bats and related species.
In Scotland and the United Kingdom, bat populations have declined considerably over the past century.
They are threatened by construction and development work which affects perch and leads to habitat loss.
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk, as can fly-killing paper and certain chemical treatments of building materials, and attacks by pet cats.
Bats are not really blind.
However, because of their nocturnal hunting habits, their ears are more useful than their eyes when it comes to catching prey.
They use a sophisticated echolocation technique to spot insects and obstacles in their flight path.
Responsible for protecting more than 270 historic buildings, 38 important gardens and 76,000 acres of land across the country, the NTS takes bats very seriously.
It has ten trained experts who regularly conduct digging, inspections of the perch and occasionally rescue operations.
The organisation also established Scotland's first and only bat reserve at the Threave site in Dumfries and Galloway, which is home to eight of Scotland's 10 bat species.
David Thompson, the estate manager, says that the site is the ideal territory for them.
"Here in Threave, we have a perfect place for bats", he said.
We have old buildings, lots of old trees and all the good habitat.
But there is still much to learn about bats, so the work we are doing here and elsewhere will help us to better understand what bats need to thrive.
He stresses the importance of checking for bats before maintaining properties, as the unintentional destruction of a single mothering nest can result in the death of 400 females and young, or the disappearance of an entire local population.
Bats are protected and it is illegal to kill them, disturb them, or destroy their nests.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the Scottish director of the Bat Conservation Trust, urged the public to help.
She said:  We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species, we don't know what's going on in their populations yet. 
Ronaldo denies the rape charges as his lawyers prepare to sue a German magazine
Cristiano Ronaldo called the rape allegations against him "fake news" and said that people "want to be known" by using his name.
His lawyers are preparing to sue the German magazine Der Spiegel, which published the allegations.
The Portugal and Juventus striker was accused of raping an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a Las Vegas hotel room in 2009.
He then allegedly paid her $375,000 to keep quiet about the incident, Der Spiegel reported last Friday.
Addressing his 142 million fans in a video posted live on Instagram, just hours after the allegations were made public, Ronaldo, 33, called the news "fake news".
No, no, no, no, and no.
What they said today is false information, the five-time Ballon d'Or winner told the camera.
They want to make a publicity using my name.
It's not unusual.
They want to be famous by saying my name, but it's part of the job.
I am a happy man and everything is fine , added the player with a smile.
According to Reuters, Ronaldo's lawyers are preparing to sue Der Spiegel over the allegations, which they have called "unacceptable denunciation of suspicion in the area of privacy".
Lawyer Christian Schertz said the player would seek compensation for the 'moral damage' in an amount proportionate to the seriousness of the offence, which is probably one of the most serious violations of human rights in recent years.
The alleged incident took place in June 2009 in a suite at the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas.
After meeting at a nightclub, Ronaldo and Mayorga apparently returned to the player's room, where an alleged anal rape occurred, according to court documents filed in Clark County, Nevada.
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo went down on his knees after the alleged incident and assured him that he was a "99% good guy" but that he didn't know what was going on with the remaining 1% of the population.
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had had sexual relations, but that they had consented.
Mayorga also claimed that she went to the police and that photos of her injuries were taken in a hospital, but that she later accepted a settlement because she felt "terrified of retaliation" and feared "public humiliation".
The 34-year-old says she is now seeking to overturn the ruling because she remains traumatized by the alleged incident.
Ronaldo was about to join Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack, and this summer, he joined Italian giant Juve in a €100 million deal.
Brexit: The UK would forever regret the departure of car manufacturers.
According to Greg Clark, the Secretary of State for Trade, the UK would "regret forever" if it lost its status as the world's leading car manufacturer after Brexit.
He added that it was "worrying" that Toyota UK had told the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its Burnaston plant near Derby if Britain left the EU without an agreement.
"We need a deal", said Clark.
The Japanese carmaker indicated that the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs.
The Burnaston plant - which makes Toyota's Auris and Avensis vehicles - built almost 150,000 cars last year, 90% of which were exported to other EU countries.
'I believe that if Britain leaves the EU at the end of March, production will stop at our plant,' said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's manager in Burnaston.
Other British carmakers, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover, have expressed their fear of leaving the EU without an agreement on how to operate cross-border trade.
For example, BMW says it will close its Mini plant in Oxford for a month following Brexit.
The biggest concerns are what carmakers say are risks to the supply chain in the event of a no-deal Brexit.
Toyota's production line is run in a 'straight flow' with parts arriving every 37 minutes from suppliers in the UK and EU for the custom-built vehicles.
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without a deal, there could be disruption at the border, which the industry says could lead to delays and shortages of parts.
It would be impossible for Toyota to hold inventory for more than a day at its Derbyshire factory, the company said, and so production would be stopped.
According to Clark, Theresa May's Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is precisely calibrated to avoid these border checks.
"We need a deal, we want to have the best deal that will allow us, as I said, not only to enjoy the success of the moment, but also to seize this opportunity", he said on the BBC's Radio 4's Today programme.
 The evidence, not just from Toyota but from other manufacturers, is that we absolutely need to be able to maintain what has turned out to be a great set of supply chains. 
While Toyota was unable to say how long production would be halted, it did warn that in the longer term, the extra costs would reduce the competitiveness of the plant and eventually cost jobs.
Peter Tsouvallaris, the Unite union coordinator at the factory and who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years, said that his members were increasingly worried: "In my experience, once these jobs are gone, they never come back".
A government spokesman said:  We have proposed a clear and credible plan for our future relations with the EU. 
The White House says that the Trump-Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again.
The White House announced on Sunday that the high-stakes meeting between Donald Trump and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be postponed for a week, while the fight for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh continues.
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller, the special counsel tasked with investigating Russian interference in the election, ties between Trump associates and Russia, and possible obstruction of justice by the president.
The question of whether or not Trump will fire the deputy attorney general, and thus jeopardize Mueller's independence, has been a hot topic in Washington for months.
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had talked about wearing a wire to record conversations with Trump and the possibility of eliminating the president by the 25th Amendment.
Rosenstein denied these claims.
However, last Monday, he showed up at the White House, as he was about to resign.
Instead, a meeting with Trump, who was then at the United Nations in New York, was announced for Thursday.
Trump indicated that he would prefer not to fire Mr. Rosenstein, but the meeting was postponed to avoid a clash with the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and Dr. Christine Blasey Ford, one of the women who accused him of sexual assault, testified.
On Friday, Trump directed the FBI to conduct a week-long investigation into the complaints against Kavanaugh, further delaying the Senate vote.
On Sunday, Trump press secretary Sarah Sanders made an appearance on Fox News.
Asked about the meeting with Rosenstein, she said:  No date has been set for that, it could be this week, I could see if they postpone it another week given all the other things going on at the Supreme Court.
But we'll see, and I'd like to keep the press informed.
This claim is disputed by some journalists: Since September 10, Sanders has not held any press conference at the White House.
Host Chris Wallace asked why.
Sanders responded that the rarity of the conferences was not due to an aversion to "demagogic" television reporters, although she did state: "I have nothing against them stunning the gallery".
Then she hinted that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase.
Without citing evidence, she added that  the president participates in more Q&A sessions than any president before him:  We checked the numbers. 
Press conferences will always be held, Sanders said, but if the press has the chance to directly question the president of the United States, it is infinitely better than talking to me.
We're trying to do it frequently, you've seen it in the last few weeks, and it's going to take the place of a press conference where you can talk to the president of the United States.
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or when he attends public hearings or press conferences with dignitaries.
He rarely gives a press conference alone.
This week in New York, the president may have demonstrated why, by making a casual and at times bizarre appearance before the assembled press.
On Brexit fears, the Health Secretary writes to EU workers at NHS Scotland
The Secretary for Health has written to EU officials working in the Scottish NHS to express the country's gratitude and wishes for their continued employment after Brexit.
Scottish MP Jeane Freeman sent a letter less than six months before the UK is due to leave the EU.
The Scottish Government has already committed to covering the cost of status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public services.
Freeman wrote in his letter: "Throughout the summer, negotiations on withdrawal have continued between the UK and the EU and should lead to decisions this autumn.
But the UK government has also stepped up its preparations in the event of a no-deal scenario.
I understand this must be a very troubling time for all of you.
This is why I wanted to reiterate how much I appreciate the contribution of each staff member, regardless of their nationality.
Colleagues from across the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve the work of health services, and benefit patients and the communities we serve.
Scotland is your home and we really want you to stay here.
After suffering a head injury, Christion Abercrombie underwent emergency surgery
Tennessee State's Christion Abercrombie, the Tennessee Tigers' second baseman, was rushed to emergency surgery after suffering a head injury Saturday in a 31-27 loss to the Vanderbilt Commodores.
Rod Reed, the head coach of Tennessee State, told reporters that the injury occurred just before halftime.
"He came to the touchline and collapsed there", Reed said.
The coaches and medical staff administered oxygen to Abercrombie on the touchline before placing him on a stretcher and taking him for another examination.
A Tennessee state representative told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville, Tennessee, that Abercrombie had been released from the operating room at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris said that there was "no further information about the type or extent of the injury" and that the state of Tennessee was trying to determine when the injury occurred.
Abercrombie, a sophomore student-athlete, is in his first season with Tennessee State after transferring from Illinois.
He had five tackles in total on Saturday before being sidelined, bringing his season total to 18 tackles.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK
Foreign buyers will have to pay higher stamp duty if they buy property in the UK and the extra money will be used to help the homeless under the new Conservative schemes
This will undo the success of Corbyn's campaign to attract young voters.
The increase in stamp duty will be imposed on those who do not pay UK tax
The Treasury expects to collect up to £120 million a year to help the homeless.
Foreign buyers will be subject to a higher stamp duty rate if they buy property in the UK - the extra money will go to help the homeless, Theresa May announced today.
The move will be seen as an attempt to counter the success of Jeremy Corbyn's campaign to attract younger voters by pledging to provide more affordable housing and targeting high-income earners.
The increase in stamp duty will be levied on individuals and businesses who do not pay UK taxes, and the extra money will be used to bolster the government's efforts to help the homeless.
This surtax - which is added to the current stamp duty, including the higher levels introduced two years ago on second homes and buy-leases - could reach 3%.
The Treasury expects the project to raise up to £120 million a year.
Around 13% of new buildings in London are bought by non-UK residents, which drives up prices and prevents first-time buyers from gaining a foothold in the housing market.
Many wealthy areas of the country - especially in the capital - have become ghost towns because of the high number of foreign buyers who spend most of their time outside the country.
This new policy comes just weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a reduction in stamp duty to help more young people buy their first homes.
Accusing large construction companies of keeping property prices high by squatting on land without using it, he called on Mrs May to give up quotas on affordable housing in order to tackle the UK's "housing shortage".
Mr Corbyn has put forward an attractive series of proposals for housing reform, including rent controls and the abolition of 'no-fault' evictions.
It also wants to give councils more powers to build new housing.
Mrs May said: Last year, I said I would dedicate my time as Prime Minister to the rebirth of the British dream - that every new generation would have a better life.
To do that, we need to fix our broken housing market.
Britain will always be open to anyone who wants to live, work and build a life here.
It is unfair, however, that it is as easy for non-UK residents and foreign companies to buy a house as it is for hardworking UK residents.
For far too many people, the dream of home ownership has become distant and the plight of the homeless remains too real. 
Jack Ross: My ultimate ambition is to lead Scotland.
Sunderland manager Jack Ross says his ultimate ambition is to become Scotland's head coach at some point.
The 42-year-old Scottishman is delighted with the challenge of re-establishing the North East club, which is currently in third place in League One, three points behind the leader.
He joined the Stadium of Light this summer after taking St Mirren to the Scottish Premier League last season.
I wanted to play for my country as a player.
I was selected for the B division and that's it", Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound.
But I grew up watching Scotland play in Hampden with my father and that's something I've never forgotten.
But that opportunity would only come if I succeeded in managing the club.
Ross's predecessors as Sunderland coaches include Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin ONeill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
The former coach of Alloa Athletic says he has no qualms about following such iconic names at such a big club, having already turned down offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
 For me, the success of the moment will be measured in the light of the question  Can I bring this club back to the Premier League? 
The club's structure and infrastructure make it a Premier League club without a doubt, he added.
 It's not easy to get there, but I would probably consider myself a success here only if I could get the club back there. 
Ross has only three years of coaching experience, after a spell as an assistant at Dumbarton and 15 months on the Hearts coaching staff.
He then helped Alloa to rise from relegation to the third division and transformed St Mirren, who were on the verge of relegation, into the big winner of the championship the following season.
Ross said he was more comfortable now than he had been during his time at Clyde, Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren and Hamilton Academical.
Taking charge of Alloa was probably a real crossroads, he recalls.
I really thought being a coach suited me better than playing.
It seems strange because I've been doing well, making a good living and enjoying some notable peaks.
But playing is sometimes difficult.
There are a lot of details to be worked out every week.
I continue to experience this in terms of stress and tension at work, but being a coach is fine with me.
I've always wanted to lead and now I'm doing it, I'm more comfortable in my own skin than I've ever been in my adult life.
The full interview is available on Sportsound on Sunday 30 September on Radio Scotland between 12:00 and 13:00 BST.
According to a survey, the ideal time for a pint is 5:30 on a Saturday.
The summer heat has boosted the revenues of struggling British pubs, but has added to the pressure on the restaurant chains.
The figures show that bar and pub groups recorded a 2.7 per cent increase in their sales in July, but revenues in restaurants fell by 4.8 per cent.
Peter Martin, of the CGA consultancy firm, which compiled the data, said: "The permanent sunshine and England's longer than expected World Cup participation meant that July followed the pattern of June, when bars had risen 2.8%, except for restaurants, which suffered an even bigger shock.
The decline of 1.8% in the catering sector in June worsened in July.
The pubs and bars where alcohol is served are by far the most popular, with more points of resemblance than restaurants.
Food stores have also been hit by the sun, but not as much as restaurant owners.
It seems like people just want to go out for a drink.
In pubs and bars, drink sales increased by 6.6% over the month and food sales decreased by 3%.
Paul Newman, RSM's leisure and hospitality analyst, said: "These results follow the trend seen since the end of April.
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the most important factors in sales in the off-market.
It is not surprising that catering groups continue to experience difficulties, although a decline in sales of 4.8% on average per year is particularly painful, in addition to ongoing cost pressures.
The long, hot summer could not have been less favourable for food business operators and time will tell whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide a well-deserved respite. 
The total increase in sales in pubs and restaurants, including new openings, was 2.7% in July, reflecting the slowdown in employment.
Industry sales are monitored by the Coffer Peach Tracker for the UK pubs, bars and restaurants sector, which collects and analyses performance data from 47 operating groups, with a combined turnover of over £9 billion and is the established industry standard.
One in five children on social media has secret accounts that they hide from their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have secret social media accounts they hide from their parents and teachers, according to a survey
A survey of 20,000 high school students found an increase in fake Instagram pages
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of pupils said they had a  main account  to show to their parents
One in five children - some as young as 11 - have a social media account that they keep hidden from adults.
A survey of 20,000 high school students found a rapid growth of fake "Insta" accounts - a reference to the photo-sharing site Instagram.
The news has heightened concerns about the publication of sexual content.
20% of students reported running a cleaned-up  main account to show their parents, while having a private account.
A mother who stumbled onto her 13-year-old daughter's secret website discovered a teenager who was encouraging others to "rape" her.
According to the study carried out by Digital Awareness UK and the Headmasters and Headmistresses Conference (HMC) of independent schools, 40% of 11 to 18 year olds have a dual profile, with half of pupils admitting to having private accounts.
Mike Buchanan, head of the CSM, said: It is worrying that so many teenagers are being tempted to create online spaces where parents and teachers cannot find them. 
Eilidh Doyle will represent the athletes on the Board of Scottish Athletics.
Eilidh Doyle was elected to the Board of Directors of Scottish Athletics as a non-executive director at the annual general meeting of the governing body.
Doyle is Scotland's most decorated athlete in athletics and chairman Ian Beattie described the choice as a great opportunity for the sport's leaders to build on his extensive experience gained internationally over the past decade.
"Eilidh enjoys immense respect within the Scottish, British and global athletics community and we are sure that athletics in Scotland would benefit enormously from her involvement on the council", Beattie said.
Doyle said: "I'm very keen to be the voice of the athletes and I really want to be able to contribute and guide the sport in Scotland.
The American, who won the 200 metres and 400 metres events at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics where he won four gold medals and is now a regular commentator for the BBC, was unable to walk after suffering a transient ischemic attack.
He tweeted:  A month ago, I had a stroke.
I couldn't walk.
The doctors said that only time would tell if I would recover or how much.
It was a tough job, but I recovered completely, I learned to walk again and now I do agility exercises!
Thank you for the encouraging messages!
Online milk pump ad comparing mothers to cows divides opinion
An online advertisement by a company offering a breast pump compares nursing mothers to cows during milking.
To mark the launch of what is being called the "world's first silent breast pump", Elvie, a consumer technology company, has launched a bold ad inspired by a music video to showcase the freedom its new breast pump offers breastfeeding women.
In a barn full of hay, four real mothers dance to the beat of a song whose lyrics are: "Yes, I'm licking myself, but you don't see a tail", and "In case you haven't noticed, it's my boobs, not nipples".
The refrain goes on:  Pump it, pump it, I feed the babies, pump it, pump it, pump it, I help the women who milk. 
However, the ad, which was posted on the company's Facebook page, sparked controversy online.
With 77,000 views and hundreds of comments, the video has received mixed reactions from the public, many of whom say it sheds light on the dairy industry's "horrors".
 A worse decision than using cows to promote this product.
Like us, they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk, except that their babies are taken from them in the days following their birth", one of them wrote.
The Elvie breast pump fits discreetly into a breast-feeding bra (Elvie/Mother)
Another commented:  It is understandable trauma for the mother and the baby.
But yeah, why not use them to advertise a breast pump for mothers who are keeping their babies?
Someone else added: "So off-the-charts advertising".
Others defended the ad, with one woman admitting that she found the song "hilarious".
I think it's a great idea.
I would have bought one if I was still breastfeeding.
Pumping made me feel like a cow.
The commercial's a little crazy, but I took it for what it was.
It's a great product, someone wrote.
Another commented: "It's a funny commercial for mothers who pump their milk (often at work or in the toilet) and feel like cows".
This is not an advertisement that praises the dairy industry.
At the end of the video, the women reveal that they danced with the discreet breast-pulling devices hidden in their bras.
The concept behind the campaign is based on the idea that many women who use the milk pump say they feel like cows.
However, the Elvie is completely silent, cordless and discreetly tucked into a breastfeeding bra, giving women the freedom to move, hold their baby and even go out while they are sucking.
Ana Balarin, Partner and DPE at Mother commented:  The Elvie breast pump is such a revolutionary product that it deserves a bold and provocative launch.
By drawing a parallel between lactating mothers and dairy cows, we wanted to highlight the extraction of breast milk and all its challenges, while expressing in a fun and reliable way the incredible sense of freedom that this new milk extractor will bring.
This isn't the first time that Elvie the milkman has been in the headlines.
During London Fashion Week, a mother of two appeared on designer Marta Jakubowski's runway while she was using the product.
Hundreds of migrant children quietly settled in a camp on the Texas border
The number of migrant children in detention has increased sharply, although the number of monthly border crossings has remained relatively stable, in part because the Trump administration's tough rhetoric and policies have made it difficult to place children with respondents.
Traditionally, most of the respondents were themselves undocumented immigrants and they feared that they would jeopardize their own ability to stay in the country by coming to the rescue of a child.
The risk increased in June, when federal authorities announced that prospective responders and adult members of their households would be required to submit their fingerprints and that these data would be passed on to immigration authorities.
Matthew Albence, a senior official with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, testified last week before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for sponsorship of unaccompanied minors.
The agency later confirmed that 70% of those arrested had no criminal records.
 Nearly 80% of respondents or their family members are here illegally, and many of them are foreign criminals.
Therefore, we continue to prosecute these people", said Mr Albence.
According to the shelters' stakeholders, in order to process the children's cases more quickly, the authorities have introduced new rules that will require some of them to appear in court within one month of their detention, rather than after 60 days, which was the norm before.
Many of them will appear by videoconference, rather than in person, to argue their case regarding their legal status before an immigration judge.
Those found to be ineligible will be promptly deported.
According to the stakeholders and reports submitted in recent months by the shelter network, the longer the children are in detention, the more likely they are to become anxious or depressed, which can lead to outbursts of violence or attempts to escape.
In a large institution like Tornillo, these concerns are exacerbated by the fact that signs that a child is in difficulty are more likely to be overlooked because of their size, according to children's rights advocates.
They added that moving children to the camp without giving them time to emotionally prepare or to say goodbye to their friends could accentuate a trauma that many are struggling to cope with.
Syria asks the US, French and Turkish occupation forces to withdraw immediately.
In a speech to the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called for Syrian refugees to return home, even as the war in that country is now in its eighth year.
Moualem, who is also the deputy prime minister, said that foreign forces were on Syrian soil illegally, under the pretext of fighting terrorism, and that they would be treated accordingly.
"They must withdraw immediately and unconditionally", he told the assembly.
Moualem argued that the war on terrorism is almost overin Syria, where more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 and millions more have been uprooted from their homes.
He said that Damascus would continue to wage this holy battle until all Syrian territory was cleared of both terrorist groups and any illegal foreign presence.
The United States has some 2,000 troops in Syria, most of them training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad.
In this war-torn country, France has over 1,000 soldiers on the ground.
Moualem said about the refugees, that conditions were favorable for their return, and accused  some Western countries  of  spreading irrational anxieties  that discouraged the refugees from returning.
 We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to make sure that these returns are facilitated , he said.
 They are politicizing what should be a purely humanitarian issue. 
The United States and the European Union have said there will be no support for rebuilding Syria until a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to end the war is reached.
UN diplomats say a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to create a buffer zone in the last rebel stronghold of Idlib has helped advance political negotiations.
The Russian-Turkish agreement has prevented a large-scale assault on the province of three million people by Russian-backed Syrian forces.
However, Moualem stressed that the agreement included "specific deadlines" and expressed hope that military measures would target jihadists, especially Nusra Front fighters, who are linked to Al-Qaeda and who "will be eliminated".
Staffan de Mistura, the UN representative, hopes to convene soon the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draft a post-war constitution and prepare the way for elections in Syria.
Moualem set out the terms of the Syrian government's participation in the committee, saying the group's work should be limited to  revising the articles of the current constitution , and warned against any interference.
Why Trump Will Win a Second Term
According to this logic, Mr. Trump would be re-elected in 2020 unless, as many liberal viewers may hope, the impeachment and scandal lead him to prematurely leave office.
Which would be the most spectacular finale of a presidency.
At this point, the audience shows no signs of fatigue.
Since 2014, the peak hour ratings have more than doubled, to 1.05 million on CNN, and have nearly tripled, to 1.6 million on MSNBC.
According to Nielsen, Fox News averages 2.4 million viewers during prime time, up from 1.7 million four years ago, and MSNBC's  Rachel Maddow Show , which reaches 3.5 million viewers during prime time, is the top cable network.
"It's a case that appeals to people because it's not something we understand", said Neal Baer, host of the ABC drama series "Designated Survivor", which follows a minister who becomes president after an attack destroys the Capitol.
Nell Scovell, a seasoned comedy writer and author of Just the Funny Parts: And Some Undeniable Truths About Sneaking Into the Hollywood Boys Club, has another theory.
She remembers taking a cab in Boston before the 2016 election.
The driver told him he was going to vote for Mr. Trump.
Why? she asked him.
He said, "Because he makes me laugh".
Chaos has a play value.
Of course, unlike anything on TV, the Washington scenarios could determine the future of Roe v. Wade, whether immigrant families can be reunited and the health of the global economy.
Disconnecting is a luxury only the wealthiest of viewers can afford.
And yet, it's beyond being an informed citizen when you find yourself watching a six-hour panel of experts debate the way Bob Woodward used deep craftsmanship for his book Fear, on Paul Manafort's $15,000 ostrich leather jacket and the consequences of Stormy Daniels' extravagant descriptions of, uh, Mr. Trump's anatomy.
I mean, I'll never look at Super Mario the same way again.
 If part of what he does feels like watching a reality TV show, it's because he makes you swallow something every night,  said Brent Montgomery, CEO of Wheelhouse Entertainment and creator of  Pawn Stars , about Trump's shifting teams and daily twists (fighting the NFL, congratulating Kim Jong-un).
We can't afford to miss an episode or we're gonna be behind.
When I contacted Mr. Fleiss this week, it was 26 degrees at his home on the north shore of Kauai, but he was holed up inside watching MSNBC while recording CNN.
He couldn't let go, not with Brett Kavanaugh preparing to face the Senate Judiciary Committee and the future of the Supreme Court at stake.
"I remember when we were hosting all these crazy shows and people would say: 'This is the beginning of the end of Western civilization'", Fleiss told me.
I thought it was some kind of joke, but it turns out they were right.

Outside money floods tightest midterm elections
It's no surprise that Pennsylvania's 17th district is awash with money, thanks to a redistricting of congressional districts that allowed two incumbents to run for the same seat.
This recently restructured suburban Pittsburgh district is the seat of Democratic Representative Conor Lamb, who won his seat in a different district in a special election last spring.
Lamb faces another incumbent, Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents the old Pennsylvania's 12th district, which strongly overlaps the new 17th district.
The maps were redrawn when the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutionally manipulated in favor of the Republicans.
The race for the new 17th district has sparked a clash over campaign finance between the major party finance arms, the Congressional Committee for the Democratic Campaign (CCCD) and the Republican National Campaign Committee (CNCR).
Lamb has become a household name in Pennsylvania after a narrow victory last March in a highly popular special election in Pennsylvania 's 18th Congressional District .
The seat had been held by a Republican for more than a decade and President Donald Trump won the district by 20 points.
Political scientists have given the Democrats a slight advantage.
The United States considered penalizing El Salvador for its support for China, then backed off.
Diplomats noted that the Dominican Republic and Panama had already recognized Beijing, and Washington had little objection to this.
Mr. Trump had a friendly meeting with Panamanian President Juan Carlos Varela in June 2017 and owned a hotel in Panama until the partners expelled the Trump Organization leadership.
State Department officials decided to summon the heads of the US diplomatic missions in El Salvador, the Dominican Republic and Panama to protest against their recent decisions to no longer recognize Taiwan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement earlier this month.
But sanctions were only planned against El Salvador, which received an estimated $140 million in US aid in 2017, including for drug control and to provide development and economic support.
The planned sanctions, which included cuts in financial aid and targeted restrictions on visas, would have been painful for the Central American country and its high unemployment and homicide rates.
While internal meetings were continuing, representatives from North and Central America delayed a high-level conference on security and economic prosperity to follow up on a similar meeting held last year, which was seen as a breakthrough in efforts to prevent immigrants from traveling to the United States.
But by mid-September, senior administration officials made it clear that they wanted the conference to continue, ending any consideration of sanctions against El Salvador.
Vice President Mike Pence is now scheduled to speak at the conference in mid-October to show the importance the administration attaches to the meeting, diplomats said.
And the three American envoys quietly returned to El Salvador, Panama and the Dominican Republic, without any further messages or harsh punishments from Washington.
A spokesman for Mr. Bolton at the White House declined to comment on the details of the debate as described by the three US dignitaries, including two diplomats, who agreed to discuss internal deliberations on the condition of anonymity.
Their statements were corroborated by an independent analyst close to the administration, who also remained anonymous.
The study of history
The next tiles could be special counsel Robert Mueller's report on Mr. Trump's possible obstruction of justice.
Mr. Mueller would also be directing his investigation to the question of whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russia in its attack on our election.
If control of Congress changes hands, Mr. Trump will find himself accountable to that body as he prepares to face the electors and, perhaps, a jury of his peers.
There are many "ifs" and I am not saying that the downfall of Mr Trump is inevitable - or that of his counterparts in Europe.
We all have decisions to make on both sides of the Atlantic that will affect the potential length of this struggle.
In 1938, German officers were about to stage a coup against Hitler, if only the West had stood up to him and pushed the Czechoslovaks back to Munich.
We failed, and missed an opportunity to avoid the years of carnage that followed.
The course of history revolves around these divisions and the inevitable march of democracy is accelerated or delayed.
Americans are currently facing a number of these divides.
What are we going to do if Mr. Trump sends Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the man who controls the fate of the Mueller investigation?
Rosenstein has been in a tight spot since the paper reported last year that he proposed secretly registering the president and speculated about his inability to perform his duties.
Mr. Rosenstein claims that the Times story is inaccurate.
What do we say if the FBI's recent request for an investigation into Brett Kavanaugh is not thorough or impartial - or if he is being held to account in the Supreme Court despite allegations of sexual assault and dishonest testimony?
And above all, are we going to vote in the midterm elections for a Congress that will hold Mr. Trump to account?
If we fail to pass these tests, democracy will have a long winter.
But I am convinced that we will not fail because of the lesson I learned in Prague.
My mother was a Czechoslovak Jew deported to Auschwitz under the Nazi regime, which had occupied my former residence as ambassador.
She survived, immigrated to America, and 60 years later, sent me to light the Sabbath candles on the table with the swastika.
With this legacy, I can't help but be optimistic about our future.

Graham Dorrans of the Rangers, confident against Rapid Vienna.
Rangers will host Rapid Vienna on Thursday, while knowing that victory against the Austrians, following the impressive draw in Spain against Villarreal earlier this month, will put them in a strong position to qualify from Group G in the Europa League.
A knee injury has deprived midfielder Graham Dorrans of his first start of the season until the 2-2 draw against Villarreal, but he is convinced that Rangers are able to make the most of such a result to achieve feats.
"It was a positive point for us, because Villarreal is a quality team", commented the 31-year-old striker.
We went into the game thinking we were going to get something and we came out with a point.
We might have won in the end, but overall, a draw was probably a fair result.
They were probably better in the first half and we came back in the second half and we were the better team.
Thursday is another important European evening.
With a little bit of luck, we can hope to get three points, but it will be a difficult match because they made a good result in their last match, nevertheless I am sure that we can go on and get a positive result with the crowd behind us.
Last year was really tough, between my injuries and the changes made to the club as such, but there's a satisfaction factor about this place now.
The team is good and the guys have a lot of fun; the training is quality.
Hopefully we can move forward now, put last season behind us and triumph.
Women can't sleep because of this fear about their retirement savings.
Although the respondents were clear about how they wanted to be cared for, few people discussed the issue with their family members.
Almost half of the people who took part in the national study said that they discussed the cost of long-term care with their spouse.
Only 10 percent said they had told their children about it.
"People want a family member to look after them, but they don't do the necessary things to have that conversation", explained Holly Snyder, vice president of Nationwide's life insurance business.
Here's where to start.
Talk to your spouse and children about it: You cannot prepare your family to care for you if you do not communicate your wishes well in advance.
Work with your counselor and family to determine where and how you can get care, as these options can be an important factor in determining the cost.
Call your financial adviser: Your financial adviser can also help you to find a way to pay these costs.
Your decisions about financing long-term care may include a traditional long-term care insurance policy, a hybrid life insurance policy with a surrender value to help cover these expenses, or other insurance on your estate - provided you have the means to insure it.
Prepare your legal documents: Avoid legal battles in the process.
Provide a healthcare proxy that allows you to appoint a trusted person to verify your medical care and to ensure that professionals respect your wishes if you are unable to communicate.
Consider also a power of attorney for your financial resources.
You would choose a trusted person who would make financial decisions for you and make sure that your bills were paid if you were incapacitated.
Think about the small details: Suppose your elderly relative has a medical emergency and has to go to the hospital.
Would you be able to answer questions about medications and allergies?
List these details in a written document so that you are well prepared.
'It's not just the finances that are at stake, but also who are the doctors?' asked Martin.
What are the medications?
Who 's gonna take care of the dog ?
Put that plan in place.
A man was shot several times with an air rifle in Ilfracombe
A man was shot several times with a BB gun as he walked home from a party.
The victim, who was in his 40s, was in the Oxford Grove area of Ilfracombe, Devon, when he was shot in the chest, stomach and hand.
Police described the incident, which occurred at about 2:30 BST, as a "random act".
The victim didn't see his attacker.
His injuries are not life-threatening, and the police have called for witnesses.
Earthquakes and Tsunamis in Indonesia
At least 384 people were killed by a powerful earthquake and tsunami that devastated the Indonesian city of Palu on Friday, authorities said, and the death toll is expected to rise.
With communications paralyzed, rescue services could not receive any information from the Donggala Regency, an area north of Palu that is closer to the epicenter of the magnitude 7.5 earthquake.
In Palu, more than 16,000 people were evacuated as a result of the disaster.
Some key facts about Palu and Donggala on Sulawesi Island:
Palu is the capital of the Central Sulawesi province, located at the tip of a narrow bay on the west coast of Sulawesi Island, with an estimated population of 379,800 as of 2017.
The city was celebrating its 40th anniversary when the earthquake and tsunami hit.
Donggala is a regency that stretches over 300 km (180 miles) of coastline in the northwest of Sulawesi Island.
The population of the Regency, an administrative region below a province, was estimated at 299,200 in 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the main pillars of the economy of Central Sulawesi province, and particularly of the coastal area of Donggala.
Nickel mining is also a major activity in the province, but is mainly located in Morowali on the opposite coast of Sulawesi.
Palu and Donggala have been hit by tsunami several times in the last century, according to the Indonesian Disaster Mitigation Agency.
In 1938, a tsunami killed more than 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes in Donggala.
A tsunami also hit the west of Donggala in 1996, killing nine.
Indonesia is located on the Pacific seismic ring of fire and is regularly shaken by earthquakes.
Here are some of the major earthquakes and tsunamis in recent years:
2004: A major earthquake on December 26 off the west coast of the Indonesian province of Aceh triggered a tsunami that swept across 14 countries, killing 226,000 people along the Indian Ocean coastline, more than half of whom were in Aceh.
2005: Several strong earthquakes shook the west coast of Sumatra from late March to early April.
Hundreds of people died on the island of Nias, off the coast of Sumatra.
2006: A 6.8-magnitude earthquake struck southern Java, the most populated island in Indonesia, triggering a tsunami that struck the southern coast and killed nearly 700 people.
2009: A 7.6-magnitude earthquake shook the city of Padang, the capital of the province of West Sumatra.
Over 1,100 people were killed.
2010: A 7.5 magnitude earthquake devastated one of the Mentawai Islands off Sumatra, triggering a tsunami more than 10 meters (33 feet) deep that destroyed dozens of villages and killed about 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake rocked the Pidie Jaya regency in Aceh, causing destruction and panic, reminding residents of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
No tsunami was caused this time, but over 100 people were killed by collapsing buildings.
2018: Major earthquakes rocked the Indonesian tourist island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly on the north side of the island.
The earthquake destroyed several thousand buildings and left thousands of tourists temporarily stranded.
Sarah Palin 's oldest son arrested for domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of former Alaska governor and vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin, has been arrested on charges of assault.
Palin, a 29-year-old from Wasilla, Alaska, was arrested on suspicion of domestic violence, violating a domestic violence report and resisting arrest, according to a statement released Saturday by the Alaska State Troopers.
According to the police report, he took the phone of a female acquaintance who was trying to call the police to report the alleged crimes.
Palin is being held in pre-trial detention at the Mat-Su Pre-trial Detention Center and is being held on $500 bail, KTUU said.
He appeared in court on Saturday, pleading "not guilty, that's for sure" when asked to make a statement, the network said.
Palin faces three Class A misdemeanors, which means he could be sentenced to up to one year in prison and is subject to a $250,000 fine.
He was also charged with a Class B misdemeanor, punishable by one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time that criminal charges have been brought against Palin.
In December 2017, he was accused of assaulting his father, Todd Palin.
His mother, Sarah Palin, contacted the police to report this alleged assault.
The case is pending in the Alaska Veterans Court.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence, interfering with the report of a domestic violence crime, and possession of a weapon while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
Her partner claimed he punched her in the face.
Sarah Palin was criticized by veterans groups in 2016 after she linked her son's violent behavior to PTSD stemming from his service in Iraq.
Earthquake in Indonesia: several hundred dead
At least 384 people died as a result of the earthquake that struck the Indonesian island of Sulawesi last Friday.
The 7.5-magnitude quake caused a tsunami and destroyed thousands of homes.
The electricity and telecommunications networks are down and the death toll is expected to rise in the coming days.
The quake struck just off the coast of central Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital, Jakarta.
Videos circulating on social media show the point of impact.
Several hundred people were gathered for a beach festival in the city of Palu when the tsunami swept across the coast.
Federal prosecutors are seeking a rare death sentence for a suspect in the New York City bombing.
Federal prosecutors in New York are seeking the death penalty for Sayfullo Saipov, the alleged New York City assailant who killed eight people - a rare sentence that hasn't been carried out in this state for a federal crime since 1953.
Saipov, 30, allegedly used a rented truck from Home Depot to attack a bike path on the West Side Highway in Lower Manhattan, killing pedestrians and a cyclist in October.
In order to justify a death sentence, prosecutors will have to provide evidence that Saipov  intentionally  murdered the eight victims and  intentionally  inflicted serious bodily harm, according to the statement of intent to seek the death penalty filed with the Southern District of New York.
Both charges are punishable by the death penalty, according to the court document.
A few weeks after the attack, a federal grand jury convicted Saipov of 22 counts, including eight counts of murder for extortion, usually used by federal prosecutors in organized crime cases, and one count of felony assault and destruction of motor vehicles.
The attack required careful preparation and premeditation, prosecutors said, calling the method used by Saipov "odious, cruel and depraved".
 Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has caused injury, damage and loss to the families and friends of Diego Enrique Angelini, Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco , the statement of intent states.
Five of the victims were Argentine tourists.
The Southern District of New York had not sought the death penalty in any of its ten-year-long lawsuits.
The defendant, Khalid Barnes, was found guilty of the murder of two drug traffickers but was subsequently sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2009.
The last time the death penalty was used in a New York federal case was in 1953 in the case of Julius and Ethel Rosenberg, a married couple executed for conspiracy and espionage for the USSR in the two years following the Cold War.
Both Rosenbergs were executed by electric chair on June 19, 1953.
Saipov, a native of Uzbekistan, showed no remorse in the days and months following the tragedy, according to court documents.
According to the police, he told investigators that he was happy with what he had done.
Saipov told authorities that he was motivated to commit the attack after watching Daesh videos on his phone, according to the indictment.
He also asked to have the Daesh flag displayed in his hospital room, police said.
He pleaded not guilty to all 22 counts.
David Patton, one of the federal public defenders representing Saipov, said he was "obviously disappointed" with the decision to prosecute.
"We believe that the decision to seek the death penalty rather than accept his guilty plea and sentence him to life in prison without the possibility of release can only prolong the trauma of these events for all concerned", Patton said.
Saipov's defense team had already asked prosecutors not to seek the death penalty.
Conservative MP says Nigel Farage should be in charge of Brexit negotiations
Nigel Farage today promised to "mobilise the people's army" at a rally at the Conservative conference.
The former UKIP leader said politicians should feel the pressure from Eurosceptics - as one of Theresa May's MPs suggested, he should be in charge of negotiating with the EU.
Backbencher Conservative MP Peter Bone claimed at the Birmingham march that the UK would have been "free" by now if Mr Farage had been Brexit Secretary.
But the dilemma Mrs May faces in reconciling her deeply divided troops was highlighted by the Remain Conservatives who joined an isolated anti-Brexit demonstration in the city.
The Prime Minister is struggling to maintain his Chequers compromise plan despite threats from those who want to leave and those who want to stay and from the EU.
The allies stressed that she would continue her attempts to reach an agreement with Brussels despite the hostilities - and would force Eurosceptics and Labour to choose between her programme and "chaos".
Mr. Bone told the Leave Means Leave rally in Solihull that he wanted to "get rid of Chequers".
He said that Mr Farage should have become a partner and be given the responsibility for negotiations with Brussels.
If he had been in charge, we would have been out by now, he said.
The MP for Wellingborough added:  I will support Brexit, but we must get rid of Chequers. 
Expressing his opposition to the EU, he continued: "We did not fight world wars to subjugate ourselves.
We want to make our own laws in our own homeland.
Mr Bone dismissed suggestions that public opinion had changed since the 2016 vote:  The idea that the British people have turned the page and want to stay is completely wrong. 
Conservative Andrea Jenkyns, who is in favour of leaving, was also present at the march to tell the journalists:  I'm just saying: Madam Prime Minister, listen to the people.
Chequers is not liked by the general public, the opposition will not vote for him, nor will our party and our activists who walk the streets and make us vote first.
Drop Chequers and start listening.
In a message to Mrs May, she added: 'Prime Ministers keep their jobs when they keep their promises. 
 Mr Farage told the rally that politicians should be made to "feel the pressure" if they were about to betray the decision that was taken in the 2016 referendum.
It is now a matter of trust between us - the people - and our political class, he said.
They are trying to cheat Brexit and we are telling them today: We will not let you get away with it.
He added in a message to the enthusiastic crowd:  I wish you would make the pressure felt on our political class who are about to betray Brexit.
We are mobilising the people's army of this country that won the Brexit victory and we will not stop until we are an independent, self-reliant and proud United Kingdom.
Meanwhile, pro-European supporters marched through Birmingham before holding a two-hour rally in the city centre.
A small number of activists have been waving anti-Brexit Conservative banners after the group launched this weekend.
His Labour counterpart Lord Adonis mocked the Conservatives over security issues concerning party enforcement at the start of the conference.
 They are the ones who assure us that they are able to put in place the IT systems and all the technology for Canada, plus, for the frictionless border, for the borderless free trade in Ireland  he added.
It's a real prank.
There is no such thing as a good Brexit, he added.
Warren intends to seriously consider running for president.
On Saturday, Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would seriously consider running for president after the November elections.
The Boston Globe reports that the Massachusetts Democrat discussed her future at a public rally in western Massachusetts on Saturday.
Warren, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, is running for re-election in November against GOP state representative Geoff Diehl, who was a 2016 co-chair for the Trump campaign in Massachusetts.
She has been at the center of speculation that she could face Trump in 2020.
Saturday afternoon's event in Holyoke was his 36th meeting with voters as part of a public meeting since Trump took office.
One participant asked her if she had any intention of running for the presidency.
Warren responded that the time had come for women to go to Washington to fix our broken government, which means having a woman as head of state.
Arrested in the shooting death of Sims of Louisiana State University
On Saturday, police in Baton Rouge, Louisiana announced that a suspect has been arrested in connection with the shooting death of LSU basketball player Wayde Sims on Friday.
Baton Rouge police are assisting in the arrest of 20-year-old Dyteon Simpson at 11:00 a.m.
On Friday, they posted a video of the shooting, asking for help identifying a man who appeared in the footage.
Sims, 20, was shot and killed Friday morning near the Southern University campus.
 Wayde Sims received a gunshot wound to the head and succumbed to his injuries , Police Chief Murphy J. Paul told 247 Sports on Saturday.
Wayde defended his friend and was shot by Simpson.
When questioned, Simpson admitted that he was at the scene, with a gun, and that he shot Wayde Sims.
Simpson was arrested without incident and taken into custody at the East Baton Rouge Parish Police Department.
Sims, a 6-foot-2 junior who grew up in Baton Rouge, played in 32 games, including 10 as a starter last season, and averaged 17.4 minutes, 5.6 points and 2.9 rebounds per game.
Russian Grand Prix: Lewis Hamilton headed for the world title after the team's guidance helped him win the race against Sebastian Vettel
It was soon clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas qualified by beating Lewis Hamilton last Saturday that the Mercedes team's slogans would play a big part in the competition.
From pole position, Bottas made a strong start and nearly drove Hamilton to the flank as he defended his place in the first two laps, and invited Vettel to attack his teammate.
Vettel entered the pits first and left Hamilton to go into the turmoil at the tail of the peloton, which should have been a deciding factor.
Mercedes came through the pits a lap later and found itself behind Vettel, but Hamilton took the lead after a wheel-to-wheel action which saw the Ferrari driver reluctantly leave the inside section at the risk of holding out after a double attempt to defend in the third corner.
Max Verstappen started from the back of the grid and was seventh at the end of the very first lap to celebrate his 21st birthday.
He then dominated much of the race while maintaining his tyres to aim for a fast finish and overtake Kimi Raikkonen in fourth place.
He finally made it to the pits on lap 44, but was unable to pick up the pace in the remaining eight laps, with Raikkonen finishing fourth.
It's a difficult day because Valtteri did a great job all weekend and was a real gentleman to let me pass.
The team did an exceptional job to get a one-two-three, said Hamilton.
That was really bad body language .
At a meeting last Saturday, President Donald Trump mocked Senator Dianne Feinstein, who pointed out that she had not released the letter from Christine Blasey Ford accusing Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault.
Speaking at a rally in West Virginia, the president did not directly address Ford's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, but he argued that events unfolding in the Senate showed that people were "evil, disgusting, and dishonest".
"The only thing that could happen and the beautiful thing that happens in the Senate these days, when you see anger, when you see people who are angry and mean and disgusting and dishonest", he said.
When they see the leaks and the leaks, they say: "Oh, I didn't do it.
I did not do it".
Do you remember ?
Dianne Feinstein, have you leaked any information?
Remember his response -- did you leak any information -- "oh, oh, what?
Oh, no, not at all.
I didn't disclose anything".
Well, wait a minute.
"Did we disclose information... No, we did not disclose information", he added, thinking of the senator's impression.
Feinstein received the letter from Ford detailing the allegations against Kavanaugh last July, and the leak occurred in early September, but Feinstein denied that the leak came from his office.
"I didn't cover up Dr. Ford's allegations, I didn't disclose his story", Feinstein told the committee, The Hill reported.
She told me to keep it confidential and I kept it confidential like she asked me to.
But his denial doesn't seem to have been well received by the president, who commented at the rally on Saturday night:  I'll tell you, it was very bad body language.
Maybe she didn't, but that's the worst body language I've ever seen.
Continuing his defense of the Supreme Court nominee accused of sexual assault by three women, the president suggested that the Democrats were using these allegations for their own ends.
They are determined to take back power by any means necessary.
You see the wickedness, the meanness, they don't care who they hurt, who they have to crush to get power and control, the president told Mediaite.
Dundee Stars 5-3 Belfast Giants in the Elite League
Patrick Dwyer scored two goals for the Giants against Dundee
The Dundee Stars have erased their Friday night Elite League defeat to the Belfast Giants by winning the second leg 5-3 in Dundee last Saturday.
The Giants opened the scoring with two goals from Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillier.
Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought home the tie before Dwyer returned the lead to the Giants.
François Bouchard equalised for Dundee before Lukas Lundvald Nielsen scored two goals, securing the win.
It was the third defeat of the season in the Elite League for Adam Keefe's men, who had beaten Dundee 2-1 on Friday night in Belfast, after being overtaken.
It was the fourth meeting of the season between the two teams, with the Giants winning the last three games.
Dwyer gave the lead in the fourth minute, at 3:35, thanks to a pass by Kendall McFaull, while David Rutherford served Beauvillier who doubled the bet four minutes later.
In a very busy first period, Sullivan regained the home team lead at 13:10 before Matt Marquardt took over for Cownie, at 15:16, with a draw.
Dwyer gave the Giants the lead before the first break when he hit his second goal of the night late in the first period.
The home team rallied and Bouchard once again tied with a goal giving them a numerical advantage at 27:37.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran collaborated to help Nielsen put Dundee ahead for the first time of the match at the end of the second period, thus securing the victory for his team by scoring a fifth goal at half-time.
The Giants, who have now lost four of their last five games, will host Milton Keynes in their next game on Friday.
An air traffic controller died while helping hundreds of people on board a plane to escape the quake
An Indonesian air traffic controller is being hailed as a hero after he died ensuring a plane carrying hundreds of people could take off safely.
More than 800 people died and many more are missing after a major earthquake hit the island of Sulawesi last Friday, causing a tsunami.
Strong aftershocks continue to devastate the area and many people are trapped under rubble in the city of Palu.
But despite the flight of his colleagues, 21-year-old Anthonius Gunawan Agung refused to give up his post in the shaken tower at Palu's Mutiara Sis Al Jufri Airport.
He remained on the ground to ensure that Batik Air Flight 6321, which was on the runway at the time, could safely take off.
He then jumped off the control tower when he felt it was going to collapse.
He died later in the hospital.
Yohannes Sirait, the spokesman for Air Navigation Indonesia, said the move could have saved hundreds of lives, according to Australian ABC News.
We mobilized a helicopter from Balikpapan, Kalimantan to transport him to a larger hospital in another city.
Unfortunately, we lost him this morning before the helicopter arrived in Palu.
 We are heartbroken to hear this , he added.
Authorities fear the death toll could run into the thousands, with the country's disaster prevention agency saying that access to the cities of Donggala, Sigi and Boutong is limited.
 The death toll would continue to rise as many bodies were still under the rubble and many could not be rescued, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, spokesperson for the agency
Waves up to six meters high have ravaged Palu which will hold a mass funeral on Sunday.
Military and commercial aircraft bring aid and food.
Risa Kusuma, a 35-year-old mother, told Sky News:  Every minute, an ambulance is bringing back bodies.
Clean water is scarce.
The mini-markets are being looted everywhere.
Jan Gelfand, head of the International Red Cross in Indonesia, told CNN:  The Indonesian Red Cross is running to help the survivors, but we don't know what they will find.
This is already a tragedy, but it could get worse. 
Joko Widodo, the Indonesian president, arrived in Palu on Sunday and addressed the country's military:  I ask you all to work day and night to complete all tasks related to the evacuation.
Are you ready?
Indonesia was rocked earlier this year by earthquakes in Lombok that killed over 550.
Air crash in Micronesia: Air Niugini now says one man is missing after a plane crashed into the lagoon.
The airline that handled the plane that crashed in a Pacific lagoon in Micronesia now says one man is missing, after all 47 passengers and crew were safely evacuated from the sinking plane.
Air Niugini said in a statement that since Saturday afternoon, it had been unable to trace a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities, hospitals and investigators to try to locate the man in question.
The airline did not immediately respond to requests for more specific information about the passenger, such as his age or nationality.
Local boats were involved in the rescue of the other passengers and crew after the plane hit the water while trying to land at Chuuk Island airport.
Authorities said Friday that seven people had been hospitalized.
The airline said on Saturday that six passengers were still in hospital, and that they were all in a stable condition.
The cause of the crash and the exact sequence of events remain uncertain.
The airline and the U.S. Navy said the plane landed in the lagoon near the runway.
Witnesses said the plane had overshot the runway.
American passenger Bill Jaynes reported that the plane had come too low.
"That's a very good thing", said Jaynes.
Jaynes said he and the others may have slipped into the water to the emergency exits of the sinking plane.
He claimed that the flight attendants panicked and screamed, and that he suffered a minor head injury.
The U.S. Navy claimed that sailors working nearby on a dock improvement also participated in the rescue by using a pneumatic boat to transport people to dry land before the plane sank in about 30 metres (100 feet) of water.
Data from the Aviation Safety Network indicates that 111 people died in accidents involving registered airlines in Papua New Guinea over the past two decades, but none were involving Air Niugini.
The analyst presents the timeline of the night the woman was burned alive.
The prosecution adjourned its case on Saturday during the trial of a man accused of burning a woman alive in Mississippi in 2014.
The US Department of Justice analyst Paul Rowlett testified for hours as an expert in the field of intelligence analysis.
He described to the jury how he used cell phone records to trace the movements of the accused, 29-year-old Quinton Tellis, and the victim, 19-year-old Jessica Chambers, on the night of the latter's death.
Rowlett said he had obtained location data from several cell phones that indicated Tellis was with Chambers the night of his death, which contradicted his previous statements, The Clarion Ledger reported.
When the data showed that his cell phone was at Chambers' house when he had claimed to be with his friend Michael Sanford, the police went to talk to Sanford.
Sanford appeared before the bar on Saturday and testified that he was out of town that day.
When prosecutors asked Tellis if he was telling the truth when he said he was in Sanford's truck that night, Sanford said he was lying because my truck was in Nashville.
Another inconsistency is that Tellis stated that he had known Chambers for about two weeks when she died.
Phone records show that they'd known each other for a week.
Rowlett claimed that sometime after Chambers' death, Tellis deleted Chambers' texts, calls and contact information from his phone.
"He erased her from his life", Hale said.
The defense is scheduled to begin its arguments on Sunday.
The judge said he expected the jury to hear the case later today.
The High Breed: What is political hip hop ?
A hip hop trio wants to challenge the negative view of the genre by imbuing their music with positive messages.
The High Breed of Bristol claims that hip hop has moved away from its roots of political messages and social issues.
The group wants to reconnect with its roots and make political hip hop popular again.
Artists such as The Fugees and Common have experienced a recent resurgence in the UK thanks to artists such as Akala and Lowkey.
Another black woman ?
New York nanny sues couple for firing her after a racist text
A nanny in New York is suing a couple for discriminatory dismissal after receiving a message sent by the mother who complained that she was "still a Black woman".
The couple denied being racist, and equated the prosecution with a  extortion .
Lynsey Plasco-Flaxman, a mother of two, expressed her dismay when she found out in 2016 that Giselle Maurice, the new nanny, was black when she arrived for her first day on the job.
"NOOOOOOOOOON ANOTHER BLACK WOMAN", wrote Mrs. Plasco-Flaxman in a text message to her husband, who was in the hospital.
However, instead of sending it to her husband, she sent it twice to Mrs. Maurice.
According to the New York Post, after realizing his "awkward" gaffe, Plasco-Flaxman fired Ms. Maurice, explaining that their former African-American nanny had done a bad job and was instead waiting for a Filipina.
Ms. Maurice was paid for a day's work and then sent home by Uber.
Now Maurice is suing the couple for compensation for her dismissal and $350 a day for the six-month home-care service she was originally hired for, but without a contract.
 I want to make them understand, listen, we don't do that kind of thing , she told the Post on Friday, adding  I know it's discrimination .
The couple responded to the allegations of racism by saying that it was reasonable to terminate Maurice's employment, fearing that they would not be able to trust him after having wronged him.
My wife sent him something she didn't want to say.
She's not a racist.
We are not racists , Joel Plasco told the Post.
But would you trust your children to someone you've been rude to, even if it was by mistake?
Your newborn ?
Let 's see !
Likening the lawsuit to "extortion", Plasco claimed that his wife was only two months away from having a baby and was in a "very delicate situation".
Would you pursue someone like that ?
It's not a very pleasant thing to do,' added the business banker.
While the case is still pending, the court of public opinion did not hesitate to denounce the couple on social media, blaming them for their behavior and logic.
Paddington's editors feared readers might not identify with a talking bear, reveals a new letter
Bond's daughter, Karen Jankel, who was born shortly after the book was accepted, said of the letter: "It is difficult to put oneself in the place of someone who reads it for the first time before its publication.
It's very funny, knowing what we know about Paddington's enormous success.
She said her father, who had worked as a cameraman for the BBC before writing the children's book inspired by a teddy bear, would have remained optimistic in the face of the rejection of his work.She added that the 60th anniversary of the books' publication had a "bitter-sweet" flavour after his death last year.
She describes Paddington as a "very important member of our family", and adds that her father was very proud of her eventual success.
"He was a very quiet man, and he was not a pretender", she said.
But because Paddington was so real to him, it was almost like having a kid who accomplished something -- you're proud of him, even if it's not really his own accomplishment.
I think he saw Paddington's success in that way.
Although it was his creation and the fruit of his imagination, he always attributed the credit to Paddington himself.
My daughter was dying, and I had to say goodbye to her on the phone.
On landing, her daughter was taken to the Louis Pasteur 2 hospital in Nice, where doctors did everything they could to save her life.
 Nad called regularly to explain how bad the situation was, we did not expect it to get better , commented Ms Ednan-Laperouse.
Then Nad called me to warn me that she was going to die in the next two minutes and that I had to say goodbye.
And I did it.
I said, "Tashi, I love you so much, honey.
I'll be with you soon.
I'll be with you.
The medication that the doctors had given her to keep her heart rate up was slowly running out of her system.
She had died some time before and everything had stopped.
I had to sit there and wait, knowing that this was all happening.
I couldn't scream or shout or cry because I was surrounded by families and people.
I really had to hold on.
Finally, Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse, mourning her daughter, boarded the plane with the other passengers, unconcerned about the ordeal she was going through.
"No one knew", she said.
 I had my head down, and I cried all the time.
It's hard to explain, but it was during the flight that I felt this immense sympathy for Nad.
That he needed my love and my understanding.
I knew how much he loved her.
Mourning women are leaving postcards to prevent suicides on the bridge.
Two women who have lost loved ones to suicide are trying to prevent others from taking their own lives.
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphreys posted postcards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring messages and phone numbers that people can call for help.
Mrs. Davis' son, Tyler, was 13 when he began suffering from depression and committed suicide at 18.
"I don't want any parent to feel what I'm forced to feel on a daily basis", she said.
Mrs Davis, 45, from Lydney, said her son was a promising leader with an infectious smile.
Everyone knew him for his smile.
They always said her smile lit up any room.
However, he quit his job before he died, because he was in a very dark place.
In 2014, Tyler's brother, who was 11 years old at the time, found his brother after he committed suicide.
Mrs Davis said: 'I am constantly concerned that there is a spillover effect.'
Ms. Davis created the  cards to let people know that there are people you can go to and talk to, even if it's a friend.
Don't keep quiet - you have to talk. 
Mrs. Humphreys, a longtime friend of Mrs. Davis, lost Mark, her partner of 15 years, shortly after her mother's death.
"He didn't say he felt down, depressed or anything", she said.
A few days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his attitude.
He was at his lowest on Christmas Day - when the kids opened their presents, he didn't have any eye contact with them or anything.
She said that his death was a huge trauma for them, but they have to get over it:  It's heartbreaking for the family.
It's destroying us.
But we all have to go forward and fight.

Brett Kavanaugh's future is on the line as the FBI begins its investigation.
"I thought that if we could get something like what he was asking for - a limited in time, limited in scope investigation - we might be able to bring some unity", Flake said Saturday, adding that he feared the committee would collapse into a partisan impasse.
Why didn 't Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters want the FBI to investigate ?
Their reluctance is due to the timing.
The midterm elections are only five weeks away, on November 6th, and if, as expected, the Republicans do a bad job, they will be seriously weakened in their efforts to get the man they want on the highest court in the land.
George W. Bush picked up the phone and called the senators, asking them to support Mr. Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House for Mr. Bush and through him met his wife, Ashley, who was then his personal secretary.
What happens after the FBI submits its report?
There will be a vote in the Senate, which currently has 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats.
We don't yet know if Mr. Kavanaugh will be able to get at least 50 votes in the Senate, which would allow Mike Pence, the vice president, to split the vote and confirm him in the Supreme Court.
North Korea: Number of deserters falling under the leadership of Kim
The number of North Korean defectors to South Korea has decreased since Kim Jong-un's rise to power seven years ago, a South Korean lawmaker said.
Park Byeong-seug, citing data from the Ministry of Unification of the South, said that 1,127 desertions had occurred last year, compared to 2,706 in 2011.
Mr Park said that the tightening of border controls between North Korea and China and the increase in tariffs demanded by smugglers were key factors.
Pyongyang has not made any public comment.
The vast majority of North Korean defectors will eventually be granted South Korean citizenship.
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953.
Most of them are fleeing through China, which shares the longest border with North Korea and is easier to cross than the heavily protected Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between the two Koreas.
China considers deserters to be illegal migrants rather than refugees and often forcibly repatriates them.
Relations between the North and the South - which are still technically at war - have improved markedly in recent months.
Earlier this month, the leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang for talks focused on the previously stalled denuclearisation negotiations.
This followed the historic meeting in Singapore in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un, during which they agreed, in broad terms, to work towards a denuclearised Korean Peninsula.
However, on Saturday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the US sanctions for the lack of progress since then.
 Without confidence in the US, there will be no confidence in our national security and under such circumstances, we cannot be the first to unilaterally disarm , Mr Ri said in a speech to the UN General Assembly in New York.
Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and says he's unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Pelosi, the House Minority Leader, called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hysterical" and said he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court because of his temper.
Pelosi made the comments in an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin, Texas.
I couldn't help but think that if a woman had behaved in this way, they would have called her "hysterical", Pelosi said of her reaction to Kavanaugh's testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee last Thursday.
Kavanaugh emotionally denied the allegations that he sexually assaulted Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both teenagers.
During his opening statement, Kavanaugh was very emotional and at times nearly screamed and choked himself as he talked about his family and his high school years.
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats on the committee, calling the allegations against him a grotesque, coordinated assassination by liberals who were disappointed that Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election.
Pelosi said that in her opinion, Kavanaugh's testimony demonstrated that he was unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, since he showed that he was against the Democrats.
"I think he's discrediting himself with these statements and the way he's dealing with the Clintons and the Democrats", she said.
Pelosi hesitated when asked if she would try to impeach Kavanaugh if he was confirmed, and if the Democrats got the majority in the House of Representatives.
"If he doesn't tell the truth to Congress or the FBI, he's not only unfit to serve on the Supreme Court, he's unfit to serve on the court where he currently sits", Pelosi said.
Currently, Kavanaugh is a judge on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi further added that as a Democrat, she was concerned about Kavanaugh's possible rulings against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, since he is considered a conservative judge.
During his confirmation hearings, Mr. Kavanaugh has evaded the question of the possible overturning of certain Supreme Court decisions.
"This is not the time for a hysterical and biased person to go to court and expect us to say, 'Isn't it wonderful?'" said Pelosi.
And women have to use it.
It's a legitimate diatribe, months and years of rage that flood, and she can't get it out without crying.
"We cry when we are angry", Mrs. Steinem told me 45 years later.
I don't think that's unusual, do you?
I was helped tremendously by a woman who was an executive somewhere, who told me that she also cries when she gets angry, but she developed a technique that allowed her to say to the person she was talking to, when she got angry and cried:  You may think I'm sad because I'm crying.
I'm mad at you.
And then she kept going.
And I thought it was brilliant.
Tears are allowed as an outlet for anger, in part because they are fundamentally misunderstood.
One of my most vivid memories of my first job in a male-dominated office, where I found myself crying in an inexpressible rage, was being grabbed by the skin of my neck by an elderly woman - a cold headmistress who had always been a little terrified of me - who dragged me down a staircase.
"Don't let them see you cry", she told me.
They don't know you're angry.
They think you're sad and they're happy because they got you.
Patricia Schroeder, then a Democratic congresswoman from Colorado, had worked with Gary Hart on his presidential campaign.
In 1987, after Mr. Hart had been caught up in an extramarital affair aboard a ship called Monkey Business and had withdrawn from the campaign, Mrs. Schroeder, deeply frustrated, said there was no reason for her not to explore the idea of running for president herself.
"It was not a well-considered decision", she confided to me laughing, 30 years later.
There were already seven other candidates in the running, and the last thing they needed was one more person.
Someone called it "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs".
As the campaign was very advanced, she was behind in fundraising, and so vowed that she would not participate unless she raised $2 million.
The battle was already lost.
She learned that some of her followers who usually gave $1,000 to men were only going to give her $250.
"Do they think I'm entitled to a discount?" she wondered.
When she announced in her speech that she would not launch an official campaign, she was so overwhelmed by her emotions - gratitude for the people who had supported her, frustration with the system that made it so difficult to raise funds and target voters rather than delegates, and anger at sexism - that she felt dizzy.
"You would have thought I was having a nervous breakdown", Mrs Schroeder recalled about the press reaction to her.
You would have thought Kleenex was my sponsor.
I remember asking what they were going to put on my tombstone.
"She cried" ?
How the US-China trade war could benefit Beijing
The first salvoes of the US-China trade war have been deafening, and although the battle is far from over, a disagreement between the countries could benefit Beijing in the long run, experts say.
US President Donald Trump issued the first warning earlier this year by taxing key Chinese exports including solar panels, steel and aluminum.
The biggest increase came this week with new tariffs affecting US$200 billion (£150 billion) worth of goods, taxing half of all goods from China that arrive in the US.
Each time, Beijing has fought back in kind, most recently slapping tariffs of 5 to 10 percent on $60 billion of American goods.
China is committed to equal the United States, and it is unlikely that the world's second largest economy will falter anytime soon.
To back down Washington is to give in to the demands, but to publicly give in to the US would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping, the Chinese president.
However, experts believe that if Beijing can play its role properly, the pressures of the US trade war could have a positive effect on China in the long run by reducing the interdependence of the two economies.
 The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing could set up conditions conducive to an economic slowdown in either country is actually far more dangerous than observers have previously acknowledged , Abigail Grace, a research associate who focuses on Asia, told the Center for New American Security think tank.
Syria is  prepared  for the return of refugees, says Foreign Minister
Syria is ready for the voluntary return of refugees and is asking for help to rebuild the country, which has been devastated by more than seven years of war.
Addressing the UN General Assembly, Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the situation in the country was improving.
 Today, the situation is more stable and safer thanks to the progress made in the fight against terrorism, he said.
The government is continuing to rehabilitate areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normalcy.
All conditions are now in place for the voluntary repatriation of refugees to the countries they were forced to leave because of terrorism and unilateral economic measures targeting their daily lives and livelihoods.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
Another six million people still living in the country are in need of humanitarian assistance.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian regime would welcome help in rebuilding the devastated country.
However, he stressed that he would not accept conditional aid or assistance from countries that sponsored the insurgency.
Europe wins the Ryder Cup in Paris
Team Europe won the 2018 Ryder Cup by beating Team USA by a final score of 16.5 to 10.5 at the Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States have now lost six times in a row on European soil and have not won a Ryder Cup in Europe since 1993.
Europe regained the title when Danish captain Thomas Bjorn's team crossed the mark of 14.5 points to beat the United States.
American star Phil Mickelson, who was in trouble for most of the tournament, put his shot into the water on the par-3 16th hole, giving up his duel to Francesco Molinari.
Italian golfer Molinari excelled in all his rounds, becoming one of only four players to ever reach 5-0-0 since the current format of the tournament, which was first played in 1979.
American Jordan Spieth was beaten 5-4 by the lowest ranked player on the European team, Thorbjorn Olesen of Denmark.
The world's best golfer, Dustin Johnson, lost 2-1 to England's Ian Poulter, who may have played his last Ryder Cup.
The Spanish Sergio Garcia, an eight-time Ryder Cup winner, became the all-time European champion with a career total of 25.5 points.
I don't usually cry, but today it's stronger than me.
It was a turbulent year.
I'm so grateful to Thomas for choosing me and believing in me.
I'm so happy, so happy to get the cup back.
What matters is the team, and I am happy to have been able to help it", said Garcia with emotion after the European victory.
He passes the torch to his fellow countryman John Ram who defeated American golf legend Tiger Woods 2-1 in singles last Sunday.
"I feel incredible pride, beating Tiger Woods, I grew up watching this guy", said Rahm, 23.
Woods lost his four matches in France and now holds a career record of 13-21-3 in the Ryder Cup.
A surprising statistic for one of the greatest golfers of all time, who won 14 major titles, just behind Jack Nicklaus.
The U.S. team struggled throughout the weekend to find the fairways, with the exception of Patrick Reed, Justin Thomas and Tony Finau, who played top-level golf for the duration of the tournament.
Captain Jim Furyk commented after a disappointing performance for his team: "I'm proud of these guys, they fought hard.
This morning we had a certain moment where we put pressure on Europe.
We gave up.
Hat to Thomas.
He's a great captain.
All 12 of his players played very well.
We're going to get together, I'm going to collaborate with the PGA of America and our Ryder Cup committee and we're going to move forward.
I love these 12 guys and I'm proud to be captain.
You have to bend over.
We've been outnumbered.
Red tide information point: decreased concentrations in Pinellas, Manatee and Sarasota
The very latest report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission indicates a general decrease in red tide concentrations in certain areas of the Tampa Bay area.
According to the CPF, more irregular flowering conditions are reported in areas of Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Charlotte and Collier counties - leading to concerns of declining concentrations.
The red tide covers approximately 209 km (130 miles) of coastline, from northern Pinellas to southern Lee counties.
There are islets about 10 miles off the coast of Hillsborough County, but fewer than last week.
The red tide was also observed in Pasco County.
Moderate concentrations in or off Pinellas County were reported last week, low to high concentrations off Hillsborough County, higher concentrations in Manatee County, higher concentrations in or off Sarasota County, medium concentrations in Charlotte County and low concentrations in and off Lee County, high concentrations in or off Collier County.
There are cases of respiratory distress in Pinellas, Manatee, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties.
No respiratory irritation has been reported in northwest Florida in the past week.
