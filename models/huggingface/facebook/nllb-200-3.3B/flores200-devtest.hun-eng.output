Not only does this confirm that some dinosaurs were feathered, as that theory was already widely held, but it also sheds light on details that fossils are not usually able to reveal - such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was chestnut-colored above and pale or orange-colored on the sides.
The discovery may also provide insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur shells do not have a well-developed tongue, called a stem, but have other features of feathers - feather fibers and scales - the researchers concluded that stem cells are likely the result of a later evolutionary development.
The structure of the feather suggests that it was used not for flight but for temperature control or to stimulate excitement, and the researchers found that although this is a tail of a juvenile dinosaur, the pattern is a reference to an adult feather, not a feather of a fork.
The researchers suggested that although this was a young dinosaur tail, the specimen suggested adult feathers, not juvenile feathers.

In France, elections are traditionally held with little technology: voters lock themselves in a voting booth and put a pre-printed ballot paper indicating the candidate they have chosen into an envelope.
After the officials have verified the identity of the voter, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
French electoral law is quite strict about the procedure.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers could see that there was no envelope in them before the vote and so that only duly registered and eligible voters could put an envelope in.
Candidates can send representatives to monitor every step of the process, and votes are counted in the evening, following well-defined procedures, under strict supervision by volunteers.

The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
The driver, however, suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed while emergency responders extract the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoy has since been charged by the Edinburgh Police Court with the murder of his son.
He's being held pending charges and trial, but any eyewitness evidence could be compromised, since his mug shot was widely published.
This is standard practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and the courts consider the publication of the photographs to be potentially prejudicial.
Pamela Ferguson, a professor at the University of Dundee, says: "Journalists are on a dangerous path when they publish photos or other material of suspects".
The Crown Prosecution Service has informed reporters that they will no longer be discussing the case before the arraignment.
According to leaked information, the document refers to the territorial claim claim that Palestine has based on the pre-1967 borders in the Middle East.
Other topics reportedly discussed included the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the Jordan Valley problem.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years after the treaty is signed, while the Palestinians are only willing to accept such a presence for five years.
The shooters in the complementary pest control experiment were kept under close control by rangers as the experiment was monitored and evaluated for effectiveness.
The NPWS and the National Shooting Society of Australia (NSW) have been recruiting trained volunteers as part of the NSW Shooting Society's hunting programme.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the executive director of the NPWS Parks and Heritage Bureau, the four shooters selected for the first launch operation received extensive safety and practical training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday by a new nine-member provisional electoral council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Violent protests in some places have been triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which have been due since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported cases where malfunctioning iPods overheated, causing a total of six fires, and injuring four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said it had knowledge of the accident involving 27 assets.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had notified it of 34 additional overdose cases, which the company called "not serious".
"In its response, the Department called the delay in Apple's announcement ""genuinely regrettable""".
The quake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (19:19 p.m. on Friday, Greenwich Central Time).
The Northern Mariana Islands Disaster Management Agency reports no damage to the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also reported no sign of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has been kidnapped after he hijacked a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Many hostages were rescued, but at least six others were confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the photographers from the Philippines.
The photographers later took over the place of an elderly lady who had to go to the bathroom.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
She trained as a midwife and began work at the Auckland National Women's Hospital in 1959.
Liggins, while working at the hospital, began to study premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that the administration of a hormone can accelerate the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reports that government investigators found two black boxes on Wednesday.
The other wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of extremity, my first manager, and she died two nights ago, very unique, just like you.
"Dustin Goldust Runnels noted that Luna was at least as weird as I am... "maybe even more so... "I love her and I'll miss her...
In the run-up to the 2010 federal election, the proportion of 1,400 people who opposed Australia becoming a republic rose by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard campaigned for the 2010 federal election, claiming that at the end of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II, Australia should become a republic.
Thirty-four percent of the voters agree that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme end of the public opinion poll, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist swimmer was set to compete in the 100- and 200-meter sprints and three relay events at the Commonwealth Games, but her complaints raised questions about her fitness.
He was unable to take the medication he needed to control the pain, since it is forbidden in the games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25.
A number of people verified the discovery in early February using various hardware and software, which was then announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been the largest suppliers of water to Earth, along with the organic materials that make proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets, especially the Earth, formed after comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political chatter and nonsense".
Some say he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter distances, save millions of gallons of fuel every year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It uses satellite technology, as opposed to older ground-based radar technology, to enable air traffic controllers to determine the position of aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transport options, no overground trains stopping at Wembley, and no parking or P+R parking.
Fears of a lack of transportation have raised the possibility of the game being played behind mandatory closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the appearance of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported the appearance of a new species that was created by crossing the native medium ground pine (Geospiza fortis) with a migrant species, the large cactus pine (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be shaped into any shape, even small.
It is a thin, easily twisted and threaded, thread that allows for forging or rolling into plates.
It can be very thin and flattened to other metals, and it can be so thin that it's sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted images of illuminated manuscripts.
This is called chemical pH, and the red clover leaf can be used to make an indicator.
The color of cabbage leaves varies depending on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen ions (H in pH) of the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that are formed by electron transfer (as the hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders and then press them into balls with clean, wet hands.
The moisture in your hand reacts with the outer layers, which gives it a strange sensation and forms a kind of crust.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flushing toilet connected to a sophisticated sewer system.
Remains of canal systems have been found in houses in the small towns of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Ancient Egyptians, Persians, and Chinese also had toilets, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, where men and women mixed in company.
When you're making a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you're using satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the signal and sends it back to Earth almost instantly.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket, and scientists use astronomical telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and visibility.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has brought incredible change to the world, and the greatest thing we owe to the wheel is that it makes transportation much easier and faster.
It has brought us the train, the car and many other means of transportation.
Below them are the medium-sized cats, which eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to antelopes to deer.
Finally, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat a much larger number of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a special activity that every cat performs, preventing it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social of the cat family, and they live in large groups called packs.
The flocks consist of one to three related females and up to 30 females and cubs.
Females tend to bond more closely with each other as a family of big sisters and daughters.
Lion packs are surprisingly similar to wolf packs or dog packs, animals that are similar in behavior to lions (but not to other big cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a well-balanced athlete, the tiger can climb trees (though not very well), swim, jump for great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger (genus Panthera) is one of four big cats, along with the lion, the leopard, and the jaguar, and the only one that can howl.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's roar in full force, but more like a sentence made up of words that are whispered together.
Your ocelot eats pets, and if they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, almost all of which are much smaller than their own size.
Scientists believe that ocelots find prey by following the smell of the animals and sniffing the ground.
They have excellent night vision and stealth, so they see well in the dark, and the parrot hunts by stealing into the environment and striking its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, when they cross a mountain range or a river, or when they cross a new island and cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment from that of their former home.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population has to have different characteristics or adapt to become a stronger competitor than it needed to be before.
The original population has not changed, they still need the same adaptations.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it will become less and less like the other population.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will be so different from each other that they can no longer be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants are able to produce oxygen that humans breathe in and absorb carbon dioxide that we exhale.
Plants get their food from the sun by photosynthesis.
We build our houses with plants, we make our clothes with plants, most of the food we eat is plant-based, and without plants, animals would not survive.
The mosasaurus was the apex predator of its time, so it was not afraid of anything except another mosasaur.
Its long jaws have more than 70 razor blades, and there is a row of razor blades on the floor of its mouth, so that nothing gets out that gets in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have been a forked tongue, fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, even cannibals.
But it attacked anything that got into the water, and even a giant dinosaur like T. rex couldn't match it.
While much of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their own strange or unusual festive delicacies, including wild boar, peacocks, snails, and a rodent, the peanut butterfly.
The other difference was that while the poor people and the women ate their meals sitting on chairs, the rich men liked to have meals together, where they would sit and chat.
Ancient Roman dishes could not include foods that were introduced to Europe in later centuries from the Americas or Asia.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and the ancient Romans never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built temples for all their gods, which they considered to be the home of the god.
People offered sacrifices to their gods and priests and tried to satisfy the needs of the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which only the priests could enter.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower served as a special sanctuary for the deity.
The warm climate of the Middle East made the house less important.
Most of the life of the Hebrew families was outdoors.
The cooking was done by the women in the courtyard; the shops were open only, with their counters facing the street.
The land of Canaan had no large forests, so the tree was considered a very precious treasure.
The Norse say that Red Erik was banished from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But regardless of his discovery, the Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although each country was Scandinavian, the people, kings, customs, and histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were very different.
If you've seen the movie The Nation's Gold, you might think that a treasure map was inscribed on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Although the document has a note on the back, it is not a treasure map.
"The words 'The original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776' are written on the back of the Declaration of Independence, and the text is printed on the bottom of the document, upside down".
Although the identity of its author is uncertain, it is known that shortly after its completion the large (29 1/4 inches long and 24 1/2 inches wide) parchment document was stored in a folded form.
So it's likely that the marking was simply added as a label.
The Normandy landings and the fighting that followed liberated the north of France, but the south was still not free.
This was ruled by the Vichy French, these were French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked with the invaders instead of fighting them.
"On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, an invasion known as Operation Dragoon".
In less than two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated southern France and turned toward Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture that is shared by a larger group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word civilization is derived from the Latin civilis, civis, and civitas, which means citizen, citizen, or city or city-state, the latter defining to some extent the size of society.
City states are the forerunners of nations, and civilized culture involves the passing of knowledge across generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and a decent distribution.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving any relevant historical evidence behind, and therefore cannot be recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the 13 states first established a weak central government - with Congress as the only constituent - under the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to levy taxes, and it had no national executive or judicial agency to enforce its laws, so it was often left to the reluctant state authorities.
Nor did it have the authority to override tax laws and interstate tariffs.
The amendment to the Constitution required the unanimous consent of all the states, but the states did not take the central government seriously enough to have their representatives absent from the sessions.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world, next to the German national football team, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller skating, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making it the seventh largest island in the world!
"Because of its concentration/grouping of islands, Japan is often called an 'island group' geographically".
The history of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name Ilha Formosa, or Island of Beauty.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, reformed native grain production methods, and employed Chinese laborers in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of western Taiwan and the northern coastal areas and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which gave sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is divided into three main parts: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings at the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of their original appearance.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work is still ongoing today.
For example, the most common still photograph format in the world is 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the dawn of the analogue film era.
It's still being made today, but what's important is that it's been scaled up to the image sensor format of the digital camera.
The 35 mm format actually, somewhat confusingly, means 36 m wide and 24 mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (after division by 12 to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) can therefore be set to 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS family) match or approximate this aspect ratio.
The often misused and often laughed-at rule of thirds is a simple directive that creates dynamism while maintaining a measure of order in a painting.
He claims that the most effective place for the main theme is the intersection of lines dividing the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see example).
At this time in European history, the rich and powerful Catholic Church was at its zenith.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has bound the states of Europe together, despite differences in language and customs.
His all-encompassing power affected everyone from the king to the common man.
One of the main Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds should be specifically used for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has raised questions among many as to whether its basic doctrine is being fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, blocking vital military and civilian supplies, though the blockade has violated the universal international law enshrined in several international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain was mining international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire ocean areas, endangering even neutral shipping.
Since the response was limited to tactics, Germany expected a similar response to unlimited submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the dominant behavior of citizens and nations was pacifism and isolationism.
Having experienced the horrors and atrocities of war through World War I, the nations will avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a position in New York City with the Edison Corporation.
When he came to the United States, he had nothing but a book of poems and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison from Charles Batchelor (his old boss).
Ancient China had a way of representing the different eras: each era and each ruling family in Chinese history was a distinctive dynasty.
There were periods of uncertainty between the individual dynasties, the most famous of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, several nobles fighting for the throne fought each other in fierce battles.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in the battle for the highest seat in Xi'an Palace.
There are many social and political implications of the ten-point system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism and a belief in the country as the people and not as an independent ruler.
After the revolution, the professions were opened to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and successful to overtake.
The same is true of the military, since instead of the army's rank being determined by class, it is now based on fitness.
The French Revolution inspired many oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
"Mohamed showed a deep interest in things beyond the worldly life, and he regularly visited a cave on the Mount of Noor, which became known as the place of meditation, Hira".
It is the cave itself, which has survived the times and gives a very vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual tendencies.
Located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the outside world.
What's more, it's not easy to find even if you knew it existed.
Nothing else can be seen but the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, a world that is hardly seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the World still standing today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramids built to honor dead pharaohs.
"The Giza Plateau, or 'Necropolis of Giza' in Egypt's Valley of the Dead, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), as well as several small tombs, numerous temples, and the Great Sphinx".
The Great Pyramid was built by Pharaoh Khufu, and several smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The 'up' sign is V-shaped, and the 'down' sign looks like a pincap or a square with the bottom side missing.
Up means to start at the mountain and press the bow, down means to start at the crust (where the bow is held by the hand) and pull the bow.
"The 'up' pull usually produces a softer sound, while the 'down' pull is stronger and more definite".
Feel free to mark your comments with a pencil, but remember that printed punctuation is there for musical reasons and should generally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (Mary Theresa, aged 11, and Louis-Charles, aged 4) and the King's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced back to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market vendors on October 6, 1789.
They were driven back to Paris in a chariot, surrounded by a mob shouting threats against the king and queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriage.
Suddenly, in front of the frightened queen, a member of the crowd shook the head of a member of the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The cost of the US imperialist war to conquer the Philippines was paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They had to pay taxes to the American colonial government to cover most of the costs, and the bonds were flooded into Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits were derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people, which constituted the basic profit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the circumstances that led to the creation of the order.
The period of events is usually referred to as the Late Middle Ages in European history, during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 - 1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages, and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ends around 1500.
Technological determinism in practice encompasses a broad range of ideas, from technology imperative or technological imperative to strictly the sense that human destiny is governed by the underlying logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
"Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself largely follows a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology has ""impacts"" on societies, and these effects are contingent rather than socially conditioned".
For example, there is a view that motor vehicles necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, the countrywide road network is not economically viable with few cars, so new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Mass car-to-car traffic also leads to high traffic accident rates, which in turn encourages the development of new techniques in health care to heal damaged bodies.
A significant part of Romanticism was cultural determinism and was inspired by writers such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the Romantic context, geography shaped individuals, and over time, geographically-specific customs and cultures developed that were more consistent with the location of the community than arbitrary laws.
Just as Paris was known as the fashion capital of the world at the time, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until about 1100 AD.
Its position deteriorated in the 12th century, primarily because the crusader knights rejected such dubious gifts as silk and spices, which were valued above those offered by the Byzantine markets.
At this time, Paris won the title of fashion capital from Constantinople.
The Gothic style was at its height from the 10th to the 14th century.
The dress was initially heavily influenced by Byzantine Eastern culture.
However, because of the slow methods of communication, the styles may have been left behind in the West by 25 or 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style, and one of the major developments as a result of the Crusades was that people began to fasten their clothes with buttons.
Subsistence farming is farming only to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and his family.
Self-sustaining agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seeds and a seed rotator or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Throughout history, most farmers have been self-sufficient, and this is still the case in many developing lands.
Subcultures bring together like-minded people who feel neglected by social norms and allow for the development of self-esteem.
Subcultures may be characterized by age, ethnicity, social class, location and/or gender.
The defining characteristics of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical differences, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often indicate their membership with a recognizable style of symbolism, which includes fashion, behavior patterns, and the use of slang.
One of the most common ways of showing the importance of socialization is to draw attention to the plight of some unfortunate children who, through neglect, bad luck, or premeditated abuse, were not able to socialize with adults as they grew into adults.
Some wild children were separated from others (often their own parents) in some cases, the child's abandonment was parental rejection due to severe intellectual or physical weakness.
The runaway children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before they were abandoned or fled.
Others are said to have been raised among animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, a child in the wild and physically confined will almost completely adopt the animal's behavior patterns, such as fear or indifference to humans.
Whereas project-based learning is supposed to make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather a support that provides support to those who are engaged in a new learning experience, such as learning to use new software or embarking on a new project.
"The boards can be virtual and real, in other words, the teacher is a kind of 'boards', but also the little gem-shaped man in Microsoft Office".
The virtual stands were built into the software to question, question and explain the procedures that would have challenged the student to complete the task on their own.
Children are placed in orphanages for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse to bullying.
A child should never be allowed to grow up without nurturing, caring and education, but it does happen.
We consider foster care a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care goal is a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and a reliable health system.
Orphanages must provide all the needs that are lacking in the former home from which they were removed.
The Internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet lead to additional possibilities in terms of the usage and satisfaction model.
For example, learning and socialization are suggested as important motivations for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also new motivation considerations in Eighmey and McCord's (1998) study, which focused on audience responses to web sites.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-facial expressions, facial movements lasting a few milliseconds.
Especially if they claim that some people can correctly tell if someone is lying by certain facial expressions.
In his essay on the President's Speech, Oliver Sacks pointed out that people with brain damage who cannot interpret speech have a very good sense of honesty.
He also claims that the ability to interpret human behavior is found in animals, such as domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two variations of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation provides the opportunity for new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
A mixture of segregation and recombination, the back and forth variation between the two currencies in every generation.
In the savanna, primates with digestive systems similar to those of humans find it difficult to meet their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
What is more, failure to do so has serious consequences: growth depression, malnutrition, and eventual death.
The easiest plant resources available would have been proteins in leaves and pulses, but these are hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal foods (algae, crustaceans, eggs) are not only easy to digest but also provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
So, all things considered, it's not surprising that our ancestors would have solved the white man problem in the same way that chimpanzees do today in the savannah.
Sleep disruption is the deliberate waking up of a person from a regular sleep cycle and falling back asleep within a short period of time (10-60 minutes).
This can be done quite easily with a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring it to a state of alertness without waking it up completely.
If you're sleeping and you're resetting the clock, put it across the room, and you're going to get out of bed and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option is to drink plenty of fluids (especially water, tea, which is a common diuretic) before bedtime, which forces the person to urinate at night.
The degree of inner peace a person has is the opposite of the degree of tension in the body and the spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force, and the opportunity for each person to find perfect peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that can stop us from achieving it is our own stress and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded by the path of love through mahayana and many techniques derived from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle, it's a path of Kundalini yoga, meditation and all-embracing love.
With the help of Kundalini yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened by yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
The central focus of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga, where the visualization of multiple deities clears the energy channels, activates the chakras, and illuminates the consciousness.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, and at the end of the war, as a result of differences in systems, methods and cultures, the countries became entangled in conflict.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and proxy armies clashed in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By 17 September 1939, the Polish defences had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup through the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were declared obsolete almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts after invading eastern Poland, in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
The use of cargo ships is by far the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and large amounts of goods across oceans.
The Navy's job has traditionally been to ensure that the country is able to move people and goods, while hampering the enemy's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most memorable and recent examples of this is the North Atlantic Campaign of World War II, where the Americans tried to bring people and raw materials across the Atlantic to help the British.
However, the German navy tried, mainly with submarines, to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Britain, as it had the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them for their readily available milk supply, as well as for their fur, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were generally kept in herds that migrated to hills or other pastures, often under the care of child or adolescent goat herders, similar to the more widely known herders, and these grazing methods are still used today.
The first racetracks were built in England in the 16th century.
Although the tracks consisted of parallel tracks, they allowed horses to pull faster and carry more loads than the relatively few, winding roads of the era.
The connecting elements were used quickly enough to hold the track in place, but they also slowly realized that it would be more efficient to put a piece of iron on it.
This became a daily practice, but the iron made better use of the wagon's wooden wheels.
The wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first all-iron rails were introduced.
The first known mode of transportation was walking, and humans began walking on two feet about two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not yet aligned as usual.
The two-legged formations are found in the fossil of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way, join the environmental movement, and even become activists to reduce some of the future suffering.
It's like treating symptoms in many cases, but if we want to go beyond just a temporary solution, we have to find the root of the problem and we have to eliminate it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a great deal because of mankind's scientific and technological advances, and problems have become more acute because of humanity's overpopulation and luxurious lifestyle.
After its introduction to Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing press a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made during the night, which are now called the "Dunlap prints".
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap pages that are still in existence today are the oldest surviving copies of the document, and the original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived, and that group is birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Birds still look like dinosaurs in many ways.
They have pointy, scrawny legs, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs, like a T-Rex.
Virtually every computer in use today is based on the processing of information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, 0 or 1, which are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Symptoms such as vomiting are too general to allow an immediate diagnosis.
The most likely sign of internal poisoning is an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Check the label for first aid instructions for the particular toxin.
The term "bug" is used by entomologists in the official sense of this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient knowledge of bugs, which are insects that are well adapted to live on humans.
Both robber beetles and bed bugs are nesting insects, meaning they are able to nest or use the host.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely as men to have multiple sclerosis.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their children.
These couples may choose to make an adoption plan for their baby
In adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights to a different couple.
The main purpose of science is to find out how the world works by using scientific methods, and this method is essentially the basis for most scientific research.
But it's not just that, experimentation, and an experiment is a test to rule out one or more possible hypotheses, to ask questions, and to observe, which also helps with scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on the classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were adopted by all branches of science, including psychology.
With the decline of Greek language, the West cut itself off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
In physiology and human behaviour, the occurrence of endogenous cycles and their production in the course of the biological cycle are the major determinants of the rhythms of action that are felt in most cases.
In most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms are observed, which are not mere reactions to external periodic signals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that keeps running freely in cycles, even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most important pieces of evidence for the theory that DNA is genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
Two experiments were conducted in which the DNA of the tree was marked with radioactive phosphorus or the tree protein was marked with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the nature of the mutation, the significance of the genetic material, and whether the cells affected germinate.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in natural sites and enjoy the sights, including flora and fauna.
Field programs include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park visits, and the study of ecosystem information.
Like visiting and photographing and learning about the Bornean orangutans.
Every morning, people leave the small rural towns to go to work and pass those whose workplace is the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic commuting, everyone is connected to everyone in some way and supports the transport system based on the use of private cars.
Science suggests that this massive carbon dioxide release has severed the biosphere from the stable state that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is part of society and uses transportation systems, and almost everyone has complaints about them.
In developed countries, such complaints about water quality or dilapidated bridges are rare.
Why do transportation systems give rise to such complaints, why do they fail every day, are the transportation engineers simply incompetent, or is there something fundamentally wrong?
Traffic flow is the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions between them.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable range; thus traffic processes usually have a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent the traffic flow, three main characteristics were found to be related: (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed.
These contacts help in the planning, design and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take to the air, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back over their bodies.
It gives them more places to hide from predators.
Today only the jackals and the beggars can't close their hind wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolved around the earth, including the sun (and other stars).
That seems reasonable, because you don't feel that the Earth is spinning, do you?
The Amazon is the largest and second longest river on Earth, with a discharge of more than eight times the discharge of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, stretching for six miles in places.
Twenty percent of all the river water that flows into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 3,980 miles long, draining thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of the stone pyramids continued until the end of the Great Empire, they never surpassed the size and the excellence of the Giza pyramids.
Ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were fascinated by the monuments built by their ancestors, who were then well over a millennium old.
Vatican City has a population of about 800, making it the smallest and least populous independent country in the world.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by the majority of the state's employees, while Latin is used mostly in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known since ancient times about such basic chemical elements as gold, silver, and copper, since they are all found in nature in the form of raw materials and can be mined with relatively simple tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, thought that each element was made up of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
Rather, it was a matter of four stages (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous and plasma, although he thought that these would become new materials that we could see.
An alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals, and it is noteworthy that the periodic table contains many chemical elements.
Calcium, potassium and other elements are considered metals, but there are other metals, like silver and gold.
Some alloys may contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, and all matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that a trillion of them could fit in the end of a sentence.
So when the pencil came out, it did a lot of good for a lot of people.
Sadly, as new writing methods developed, the pencil was relegated to a lower status and used less.
People are now writing messages on their computer screens and never going near a scissors.
We can only guess what the keyboard will be like if they come up with something new.
The fission bomb works on the principle that the nucleus, with its many protons and neutrons, requires energy to collide.
It's like pushing a heavy truck up a mountain, and splitting the nucleus again releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that sometimes they're under little pressure or they split apart on their own.
The surface of the moon is made up of rocks and dust.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.
It's thinner under the tides, and thicker under the plateaus.
It's possible that there are more black rocks nearby because the crust is thinner, and the lava is easier to rise to the surface.
Content theory focuses on what drives people or what piques their interest.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that become internalized as they grow up.
These theories examine what makes certain people want the things they do, and what in their environment makes them do or not do those things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
"Generally speaking, there are two behaviors that can develop when leaders start leading their former peers. One end of the spectrum is when they try to stay one of the guys (or girls)".
Such a leader has difficulty making unpopular decisions, administering disciplinary procedures, conducting performance reviews, defining responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other end of the spectrum, someone becomes an unrecognizable individual who feels that everything created by the group must be changed and made his own.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success or failure of his team.
This behavior often creates conflict between the leaders and the rest of the group.
The excellence of virtual teams is measured by the same standards as traditional teams, but there are some minor differences.
Virtual team members often act as the contact persons for the physical group.
They often have more independence than traditional team members, because their teams can meet in different time zones, which local management may not be sure they understand.
The presence of a real 'invisible team' (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique characteristic of the virtual team.
"The 'invisible team' is the leadership team to which the members report. The invisible team sets the standard for the members".
Why would an organisation undertake the time-consuming process of becoming a learning organisation?
When all available resources in an organisation's functional departments are used efficiently, creativity and inventiveness can emerge.
As a result, the process of working together to overcome barriers creates a new innovative process within the organisation to meet customer needs.
Before an organisation can become innovative, management must create a culture of innovation and knowledge sharing and organisational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum principle as a method that can help organizations achieve greater performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, so it narrows the field of research and makes it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports the observations of scientists.
It has long been known that various brain injuries, trauma, injuries, and tumors can affect behavior and even produce changes in some mental abilities.
The rise of new technologies is allowing us to observe brain structures and processes that we've never seen before.
And this gives us a lot of information and material that we can use to build simulation models to understand what's going on in our minds.
Despite its strong science fiction overtones, AI is actually a very important branch of computing that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
Research in artificial intelligence involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
For example, control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, and handwriting, voice and face recognition.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on solving real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now widely used in business, medical, engineering, and military fields, as well as being incorporated into many home computer and video game software.
Class field trips are a big part of every classroom, and teachers often and gladly take their students to places where bus trips are not possible.
Technology allows for virtual excursions, where students can visit museum art, visit an aquarium, or admire any artwork while sitting in a classroom.
Virtual sharing of a class trip experience with others is also a great way to reflect back on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year, the students at North Carolina's Bennet School design a website about their visit to the state capital, and they revamp the website every year, but as a memorial, they keep the old versions online.
Blogging can also help students improve their writing skills, and while students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the advent of the audience usually changes that.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger considers it crucial to develop writing skills to avoid criticism.
At the same time, blogging forces students to better understand the world around them. Maintaining the interest of the public encourages students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Proper use of blogs can 'prepare students to become more analytical and critical'; active response to online material can help students to define their own position on the writing of others and their own view on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, and it is home to numerous art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south, Niagara Falls, and to the north, Muskoka, an area of unspoiled natural beauty.
These, along with many other things, make Ontario look unmistakably Canadian to foreigners.
Farther north, vast areas of sparsely populated land and sometimes almost completely uninhabited wilderness can be found.
A demographic that surprises many is that there are more African-Americans in the United States than Canadians.
The East African Rift Valley lies in the Indian Ocean near the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or are associated with France and are famous as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs brought Islam with them, and it gained a significant foothold in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bounded by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south.
Women: It is recommended that female travelers, regardless of marital status, refer to themselves as married.
It is also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks very expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to things that they may find harassing, and it's not uncommon for them to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and do not be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences here and there are not acceptable!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century B.C.E., and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids, all under the name Anfa.
It was destroyed by the Portuguese, rebuilt as Casa Branca, and then abandoned in 1755 after an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badya, and Spanish merchants named it Casablanca, establishing their trading base there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
In the vicinity of the old medina, it is easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as tazin, sherpas, leather goods, water pipes and all kinds of cutlery, but here everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava of the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, especially in the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, prior to visits outside Goma, one should be aware of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu Province.
The city is the starting point for climbing Mount Nyragongo, and it is also one of the cheapest places in Africa to observe mountain gorillas.
The cost of a shorter journey is usually (local) around 500 Congolese francs.
In combination with its relative isolation, Timbuktu is also used as a metaphor for exotic, remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is an impoverished city, though its reputation has given it a tourist attraction and an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage Sites because of the threatened desert sand.
It was one of the main stations of Henry Louis Gates PBS's "Wonders of the World in Africa" series.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, as it is more Arab than African in tone.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa and is bordered by Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Krokodil River to the south.
The park covers some 7,500 square miles [19,500 km2] and is divided into 14 distinct ecological zones, each one home to a different type of life.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is the flagship of the Republic of South Africa's national parks.
Like all South African national parks, the park has a day-use fee for entering and for conservation.
"It may also be useful to purchase a 'Wild Card' which allows you to enter either selected South African parks or all South African national parks".
Hong Kong is named after the island of Hong Kong, and it is the focus of many tourists.
The parade of buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline resembles a glittering column diagram, which is further enhanced by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront across the way.
The urban area of Hong Kong Island is largely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that was occupied by the English colonizers, so if you're looking for evidence of the area's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove belt in the world, stretching from the coast to 50 miles [80 km] inland in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the part of the forest in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just mangrove swamps - they are also the last remaining strongholds of the vast jungle that once covered the entire Gangetic plain.
The Sundarbans is a 3,850 km2 area, of which about one third is covered by water/marsh.
The Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (across the river) all day long, but most of them, especially those heading east and Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 06:30 and 07:30.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most of the districts are served by small, comfortable, and heavy-duty Japanese beach buses.
The taxi service is a quick and convenient way to visit nearby places, such as Paro (Number 150) and Punakha (Number 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that crosses the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, with the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, with a length of 378 meters and two traffic lanes of 3.5 meters wide.
The bridge has a vertical clearance of 15 metres (49 ft). Construction was completed in August 2011 but it was only opened to traffic in March 2017.
The bridge is expected to be fully operational in September 2017, by which time the Brazilian customs processing points are estimated to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as hunters, practicing a semi-nomadic lifestyle, as well as maintaining subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other indigenous tribal groups, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua tribes, who lived from hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Indian Province", was formed by the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous people.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its indigenous traits and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best water polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest event of the year is in December at the Las Cañitas horse racing track.
At other times of the year, less prestigious competitions and matches can be viewed here.
For news about the championships and to buy tickets for the T-shirt matches, visit the website of the Asociación Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands Pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can only be exchanged at the islands' only bank, located opposite the FIC West store in Stanley.
Pounds are generally accepted anywhere in and around the islands, and Stanley cards and US dollars are often used for payment.
On the outer islands, credit cards are unlikely to be accepted, although British and American currency may be accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange the Falklands currency outside the islands, so change some money before you leave the island.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer in the northern hemisphere and winter in the southern hemisphere.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cold, the temperature rarely going below freezing, but the wind and humidity combined make it colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rainfall is about the same throughout the year.
Although many animals have become accustomed to human encounters in the park, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
The park authority says to keep at least 100 yards away from bears and wolves and 25 yards away from any other wild animals.
As permissive as they may seem, buffalo, porcupines, deer, bears, and almost any other large animal can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they didn't keep their distance, and these animals are big, wild, and potentially dangerous, so you have to give them their space.
It is also important to know that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so be careful not to cook or bring food with a strong smell, and keep the camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in 1850 and became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
The harbor was the site of a notorious naval stalemate in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All ships were sunk except for one British battleship, with about 200 American and German casualties.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, the Grand Chief Lealofi III of Tupua Tamasese was assassinated in a peaceful meeting in the city.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is connected by two harbours, the most popular being located in three areas.
The north shore beaches (in the North Harbour district) are located on the Pacific coast, and extend from northern Long Bay all the way to southern Devonport.
Almost all sandy beaches are safe for swimming, and most provide shade from pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located at Waitemata Harbour, in the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, in central Auckland.
These are sometimes crowded family beaches, with all kinds of businesses lining the shoreline.
"The main local beer is 'Number One'. It's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called 'Manta'".
There's plenty of French wine to go around, but New Zealand and Australian wines are better for the trip.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
The concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians, with the short black called espresso, the cappuccino stacked with a lot of milk (not foam), and the tea served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards, the fruit juices are expensive, but of excellent quality.
The reef is visited by many visitors year-round, and injuries are rare.
Nevertheless, follow the advice of the authorities, follow the directions on the signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Since 1770, the cuckoo has been found near the beaches and river mouths between October and April, and occasionally elsewhere during these times.
Sharks do occur, but they rarely attack humans, and most sharks are afraid of humans and prefer to avoid them.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live in the ocean, their primary habitat is the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind that he will have a place to sleep when he arrives at his destination.
Travel agents often have special offers for certain hotels, although you may be able to book other types of accommodation through a travel agent, such as camping.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined airfare and accommodation packages.
They may even keep the reservation for you if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents (such as a visa) for the destination.
Any changes or requests should be sent to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
At some music festivals, a significant majority of attendees choose to camp on site, and most consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to arrive early to get to a campsite close to the music.
Remember, even though the concert is over on the main stage, there may be areas of the festival that continue playing late into the night.
Some festivals have separate camping areas for families with small children.
If you're sailing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, watch your cabin's position, because sailing through the ice can be a terrible noise to those who are too close.
The St Petersburg tours are part of the sightseeing tour, and passengers on the boats are exempted from the visa requirement (check conditions)
Casinos generally make numerous efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. There are generally no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and entertainment to keep the guests in a good mood and to keep them in the room.
Alcoholic beverages are offered at certain places on a house-to-house basis, but drunkenness impairs judgment, and any good gambler knows the importance of staying sober.
All drivers at high altitudes or on mountain slopes must take into account the possibility of snow, ice or sub-freezing temperatures.
Ice and snow roads have low friction and cannot be navigated as smoothly as bare asphalt.
During a blizzard, as much snow can fall in a very short period of time as can cause traffic jams.
The visibility may be limited by snow or snow blowing, steam leakage or ice on the windows of the vehicle.
On the other hand, ice and snow are common in many lands, and traffic is uninterrupted throughout the year.
African safaris are perhaps the most attractive tourist attractions and provide a remarkable experience for visitors.
The term safari is popularly used to refer to trips overland to see the fascinating wildlife of Africa, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as giraffes and elephants, venture close to cars, making them easy to observe with ordinary equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and they can be seen better with a telescope.
A walking safari (also called a "country safari", "wandering safari", or "walking safari") consists of hiking for a few hours or days.
The Paralympics will be held from 24 August to 5 September 2021, with some events being held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, after hosting the 1964 Games.
If you booked your flight and your accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, you may find yourself in a strange situation.
The cancellation terms vary, but since late March, most coronavirus-related cancellation terms do not extend to July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
It is expected that tickets will generally cost between ¥2500 and ¥130,000, with tickets typically priced at around ¥7000.
Ironing wet clothes helps dry them, and several hotels have ironing tables and iron tables that you can use even if you don't have one in your room.
If you don't have a cast iron or don't like wearing cast iron socks, you can try using a hair dryer if you have one.
Care should be taken not to allow the fabric to overheat (which may cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, fraying).
There are several ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling the water for one minute is sufficient, while in others it takes more time.
Filters vary in efficiency, and if you are concerned, consider buying water in sealed bottles from reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter pests that they may not have encountered in their homes before.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, and spread poisons or infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans are not generally considered to be pests.
Duty-free purchases are purchases of goods in certain locations free of duty and surcharges.
Travelers to countries with heavy tax burdens can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmont is the most challenging for driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which often passes through isolated, backwater areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, keep your eyes open. The road is marked by steep climbs, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The published speed limits are noticeably lower than the previous and subsequent stages  generally 3540 mph (5664 km/h)  and strict compliance with them is of paramount importance.
Interestingly, however, the signal is much stronger here than in other parts of the trail, such as the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakery is very good, and in Bavaria it's quite rich and varied, much like its southern neighbour, Austria.
Fruit cakes are common: apples are baked all year round, while cherries and plums are baked in summer.
Many German baked goods, however, contain almonds, walnuts, and other nuts, and the more popular pastries often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want some small but plump cakes, try what are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish of herbs and spices, made with meat or vegetables.
"A curry can be either 'dry' or 'juicy' depending on how much liquid it contains".
In the interior of northern India and Pakistan, yoghurt is often used, while in southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is generally used for curry.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is a catch-all term that covers the vast array of cuisines found in the country's landscapes.
However, when used without any other qualification, the term refers mostly to the food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is widely present throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simple spiced dishes, with Javanese flavors dominated by peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut) and various aromatic spices.
The saddle has two sleeves that hold the rider's legs.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but their use raises safety concerns, as the rider's foot may get caught in them.
If the horse throws the rider, but his foot gets caught in the bridle, the horse can pull him along if he is carried on.
First, most competitors wear flat, narrow-soled riding boots with hooks.
Then some saddles, especially the English saddles, are fitted with safety rods that allow the saddle to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls it back during a fall.
The Cochamo Valley is a prominent mountaineering destination in Chile, known as the South American Yosemite, with various large granite walls and fissures.
From the tops of the mountains, breathtaking views, climbers from all over the world continue to create new routes on the walls of infinite possibility.
Sliding snow sports, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports, including skating on snow-covered terrain with skis or snowboards attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity with a significant fan base, whose fans are sometimes called "ski lovers" and who plan entire vacations around skiing in a particular location.
The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings of skiers date back to as early as 5000 B.C.E.!
Skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backpack skiing: Also known as backcountry skiing, backpacking, or backcountry skiing.
It is associated with but not usually associated with alpine-style skiing or mountaineering, the latter taking place on steep terrain and with much tighter skis and boots.
You can interpret a ski trail as a hiking trail.
In good conditions, you can cover more distance than you can by walking - but you rarely reach the speed needed to ski without a heavy backpack on well-groomed tracks.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small but has many independent countries, and normally, crossing several countries would mean going through visa and passport checks several times.
However, the Schengen area operates somewhat like a country in this respect.
As long as you stay in this zone, you won't usually have to go through any more passport controls when you cross the border.
Similarly, a Schengen visa does not require the exchange of separate visas in each Schengen Member State, saving time, money and paperwork.
There is no general definition of which manufactured objects are antiques, but some tax authorities define antiques as objects that are more than 100 years old.
The definition varies by geographical location, with some places where this age limit is shorter than in Europe, such as North America.
Handmade products could be defined as antiques, although they are younger than similar products produced in series.
Reindeer husbandry was - and still is - an important source of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding the business sector is important for many people in other occupations.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi participated in large-scale reindeer herding, but lived off fishing, hunting, and the like, using reindeer mostly as pack animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern trades.
Although widely used, especially among non-Roma, the term "gypsy" is often considered offensive, as it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate judgments of Roma people.
If the country you are visiting is the subject of a travel warning, this may affect your travel medical insurance or cancellation insurance.
You can also ask other governments for advice, but these governments have tailored their advice to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be treated differently by Europeans and Arabs.
A briefing paper is a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The views presented are often short, general, and overly simplified compared with more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather is a catch-all term for all dangerous weather events that can cause damage, serious social disruption or even death.
Extreme weather can occur anywhere in the world and has many types depending on geography, topography and weather conditions.
High winds, hail, excessive rainfall and wildfires are manifestations and consequences of extreme weather, together with hurricanes, tornadoes, avalanches and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal extreme weather events include snowstorms, hailstorms and dust storms.
Travellers are strongly advised to be aware of severe weather risks affecting the area as these may affect their travel plans.
If you are planning to visit a war zone, you may want to take some training.
If you search the internet for the words "Hostile Environment Course", you'll probably come up with the address of a local company.
The course generally covers all the problems discussed in greater detail, in most cases combined with practical experience.
A course usually lasts 2-5 days and includes role-playing, lots of first aid and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines on survival in the wild are common, but publications on war zones are rare.
Passengers planning non-reversible operations abroad should ensure they have valid documents for the return journey.
Governments differ in their attitude toward the issue of passports without an X (gender) or a document that includes the new name and gender.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents is just as variable.
Security checkpoint scans became much more disruptive in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people who are about to undergo surgery can't expect their privacy and dignity to be protected when they go through the body scanner.
Recurrent currents are the returning currents of waves breaking away from the shore, often at a reef or similar.
The underwater topology means that the returning flow is condensed in some deeper sections, and a fast flow can be formed in the deep water there.
Most deaths are caused by fatigue when trying to swim against the current, which is almost impossible.
Once the current is out of the way, swimming back to shore is no more difficult than it was in the original.
Try to aim for a place where you won't be swept away again, or, depending on your abilities and whether you've been spotted, it's worth waiting for rescue.
Reverse culture shock is much earlier than culture shock (a smaller honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted easily to a new culture may at times find it particularly difficult to readjust to their original culture.
After a period abroad, they return home to adjust to a new culture and to abandon some of the customs of their home culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were likely patient and understanding, aware that travelers to an unknown land must adapt.
People probably don't think that returnees need patience and understanding.
The pyramid of sound and light is one of the most interesting sights for children in the area.
We can see the pyramids in the dark and silence before the show even begins.
The sound and light tell a story that is like a storybook.
The sphinx provides the backdrop and is the narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many countries and the area has the most bases, with sixteen active bases in 2020.
The island group lies 120 km north of the peninsula, the largest being King George Island, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others are Livingston and Deception Islands, the latter of which, still flooded by an active volcano, form a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the area south of the peninsula bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge with the plateau and then rise again, forming the 200-mile chain of Ellsworth Mountains, which is split in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The highest mountain in Antarctica is the Vinson Mountain, which is overlapped by Mount Vinston at 4,892 m (15,930 ft).
In remote areas where there's no cell service, satellite phones may be the only solution.
Satellite telephony is not a replacement for mobile phones, since it requires an outdoor location with unobstructed view of the satellite.
The service is often used for navigation, including recreational navigation, and expeditions requiring data and sound transmission.
Your local telephone company can provide you with more information about how to connect to the service.
An increasingly popular option is to use the so-called gap year for travel and study.
It is particularly popular among graduates, allowing them to skip a year before college without jeopardizing their studies.
In many cases, a course completed abroad during the missed year may actually increase the chances of returning home to pursue higher education.
Participation in these training programmes is usually tuition-based.
"Finland is a great destination for boating. The 'land of a thousand lakes' also has thousands of small islands in the lakes and offshore archipelagos".
In the world of islands and lakes, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are large enough for yachting, smaller boats and even kayaks are available for other experiences.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, and one in seven or eight people own a boat.
This is also the case for Norway, Sweden and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, the ratio is one in forty).
Most of the major Baltic Sea routes offer a long stop in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for a few days, spending the night on the ship.
If you only go ashore on boat trips, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Some cruise brochures include Berlin, Germany, as shown in the map above, but Berlin is not near the sea, and the cost of the cruise does not include a visit to the city.
Air travel can be frightening for people of any age and background, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
It's not something to be ashamed of, it's the same as having personal fears or disliking something - a lot of people have them.
For some, a partial understanding of the operation of aircraft and of the events that occur during flight may help to overcome the fear that is rooted in a lack of knowledge or control.
The courier companies pay good money for fast delivery, and time is key when it comes to business documents, goods, or urgent repairs for spare parts.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but on other routes and with smaller companies, there have been problems.
If goods were sent by air, some routes might have taken days to unpack and clear customs.
In order to speed up the process, we've put it on the baggage list, because the airline's rules don't allow you to send a package without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first or business class is to shell out a heap of bills for privilege (or, better yet, get your company to do it for you).
But this is not cheap: you can generally expect to pay four times the usual fare in business class and eleven times the usual fare in first class!
In general, there is no point in seeking discounts for business or first class seats between A and B.
Airlines know that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a large sum for the privilege of getting somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge a price for that.
The capital of Moldova is Kisinyov, and the local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic, which suffers from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the self-declaration of the Republic of Moldova in Eastern Moldova, with its own government and currency, but the country is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between the two parts of Moldova have been restored.
In Moldova, Orthodox Christianity is the dominant religion.
With a population of about 3.7 million, İzmir is the third largest city in Turkey, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The former city of Smyrna is now a modern, prosperous, and bustling commercial center, situated in a vast bay surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues, glass-walled buildings, and modern shopping malls are dotted with traditional red brick houses, an 18th-century marketplace, and old mosques and churches, though the city has a Mediterranean European air to it rather than a traditional Turkish one.
The village of Haldarsvík overlooks the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the temple garden, marble statues of interesting pigeons can be seen above some tombs.
It's worth a half-hour walk through this charming little village.
To the north, within easy reach, is Sintra, the romantic and fascinating city made famous to foreigners by Lord Byron's account of its splendour.
The 403 Scotturb bus frequently departs to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
To the north, visit the Basilica of Our Lady of Fatima, the site of a world-famous Marian apparition.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site that has almost priceless value to a part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived their time there, and there are many more who had loved ones who were murdered or worked to death there, whether they were Jews or not.
We ask that you treat this place with the dignity, the seriousness and the respect it deserves, and do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not distort the scene by drawing graffiti or scratching structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish.
However, most of the applications are in Catalan only, since by law it is the first official language.
Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
The system alerts in the metro are only heard in Catalan, but the unexpected disturbances can be heard through an automated system in several languages, e.g. Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.
Parisians are known to be self-centered, rude and arrogant.
While this is often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave as best you can, like a "bien élevé" (well-bred), which will make our job much easier.
The roughness of Parisian behaviour will quickly disappear if we adhere to a few basic forms of politeness.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is a very wooded area, mostly buckthorn, spruce and coniferous trees and a mixture of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly diverse plant community, owing to its microclimate range, different soil types and different altitude levels.
The area is also home to a remarkable variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna is found here, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, hippopotamus, wildcat and the deer, as well as many other more common species
During visits to monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover the knees and cover the shoulders.
Most convents provide scarves for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one of bright colours, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Following the same principle, men should wear trousers that cover the knee.
You can also borrow this from the store at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after each use, so you may not feel comfortable wearing these skirts.
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of the rest of the Mediterranean, uses bread, vegetables and meat (especially pork) with olive oil.
A simple dinner, especially popular in summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes and flavorings available, whether it be cheese, tuna or whatever.
All pronouns, besides the word Sie (the), always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
It's an important way to distinguish between individual verbs and their objects.
It is claimed that it makes reading easier, although writing becomes somewhat more complicated, since it is necessary to determine whether a verb or an adjective is used in the nominative case.
Italian pronunciation is relatively easy, since most words must be pronounced exactly as they are written
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation depends on the vowel that follows them.
Also, be careful to pronounce the r and rr differently: caro means expensive, while carro means cart.
Persian grammar is relatively easy and mostly regular.
Thus, by reading this grammar, we will learn much about Persian grammar and better understand expressions.
Needless to say, anyone who knows a neolatin language will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
Nevertheless, people who know a little Spanish will quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough to them that they don't need to learn it separately.
Pre-modern observatories are now obsolete and become museums or educational venues.
In their heyday, light pollution was not such a problem, so they are most often found in cities or on college campuses, where they are more easily accessible than their modern counterparts.
Most modern research telescopes are huge installations in an isolated area with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where plum blossoms were the most popular flowers.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom party was held by the emperor for himself and the aristocratic members of the imperial court.
Plants are the most beautiful in their natural habitat, so resist the temptation to remove just one specimen.
If you're caught in a landscaped garden, collecting specimens, you'll be thrown out without question.
Singapore is generally a very safe place, where it is easy to get information and where almost anything can be obtained upon arrival.
'However, since the area slightly north of the equator is in the 'very hot sky' zone, both heat (always) and strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, less often) should be taken into account.'
There are some buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the Biblical patriarchs - Abraham, Isaac, Jacob - and their wives.
Check to make sure the bus you're planning to travel on is actually going to Hebron and not the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways could be a good theme to base a vacation on.
For example, a visit to the castles of the Loire Valley or the Rhine Valley, or a walk along the Danube to the most interesting towns, or a boat ride along the Erie Canal.
They also define popular hiking and cycling routes.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, when Jesus' birth is celebrated.
Many of the customs associated with the holiday have been adopted by non-Christian groups and by non-Christian groups.
There is a tradition of spending the night of Easter awake in some open space to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it's likely a pre-Christian spring and fertility rite.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter rosary on the night of Holy Saturday, and at midnight congregations often break out in celebration to celebrate Christ's resurrection.
All the animals that originally came to the islands were brought here by swimming, flying or floating.
The distance from the mainland prevented mammals from making the journey, so the giant tortoise became the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the arrival of humans, a number of mammals have been introduced to the Galapagos Islands, including the goat, horse, cow, rat, cat, and dog.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the northern lights, since the sky will be dark for most of the day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is rarely a problem, you can also enjoy stargazing.
Japanese work culture is more formal and hierarchical than what Westerners are used to.
The suit is business attire, and co-workers call each other by their last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, so it is important to focus on team efforts rather than individual achievements.
Employees must seek the approval of their superiors before making any decision and are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
