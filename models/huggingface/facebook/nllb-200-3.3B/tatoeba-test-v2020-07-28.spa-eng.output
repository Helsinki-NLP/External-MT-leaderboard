When we are about to die, we shall be alone. Of all our earthly possessions we shall be about to part. Earthly friends - the friends who point out to us our position, our wealth or our social qualities - will leave us when we enter the dark valley. Of those bound to us by stronger ties - our relatives, our loved ones, children, brothers, sisters, and others no less dear to us who have been made our friends because they and we are friends of the same Savior - from them too we must part. Though not all will leave us. There is One who "abides closer than a brother" - One who having loved His own who are in the world, loves them to the end.

In a sunny place there was a pleasant old country house near a deep river, and from the house to the water's side grew large burdock leaves, so tall that under the tallest of them a child could stand. The place was as wild as the center of a thick forest.
