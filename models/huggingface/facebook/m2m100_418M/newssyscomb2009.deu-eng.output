Triumph of the right-wing populists in Austria, they reach 29 percent in total
A noticeable weakening of the two parties of the previous major coalition and a significant strengthening of the right-populist parties led to the first preliminary results of the previous parliamentary elections on Sunday in Austria.
In particular, the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) has suffered severe losses, where the position of former president Wilhelm Molterer is seriously on the scale.
On the contrary, the election leader of the Alliance for the Future of Austria (BZÖ), the Kärntner Landeshauptman Jörg Haider, is preparing for a triumphal return to federal politics.
The Social Democracy (SPÖ) remains the strongest power in the country with 29.8 percent of the votes, but it loses 5.5 percent of the votes compared to the last elections in 2006.
Even worse, the OVP declined, which lost almost nine percent of the votes with 25.6 percent.
These are the worst results of these two major parties in the Austrian post-war history, and especially in the People's Party, which had demanded the previous elections, this is a truly catastrophic result.
Even at the beginning of July, when the OVP had left the coalition, the People's Party had a clear advance before the SPÖ.
But the voters have probably punished the party for failing the government.
Even in the first responses to the results there were speculations about a possible resignation of the party chairman and former Vice Chancellor Wilhelm Molterer.
Observators believe that this could be the case on Monday at an extraordinary meeting of the party’s committee.
Such a development would probably lay the way to the most likely way out of the electoral debacle, i.e. to a renewal of the great coalition from SPÖ and ÖVP.
Given the strengthening of both right-populist parties – the Liberal Party (FPÖ) temporarily received 18 percent, the BZÖ 11 percent of the votes – the Social Democrats, however, simultaneously express their fear that the year 1999 could repeat when the People’s Party agreed with the populists (at that time the FPÖ was still united, in 2005 it separated from the BZÖ) regarding a joint government, which had even caused sanctions from the European Union.
Jörg Haider, who has already stated that he is willing to cooperate with any party and is hoping to return to Vienna into the Austrian federal policy.
In addition, the party of the Greens entered the parliament, which, however, suffered slight losses and dropped from third to fifth among the Austrian political parties.
No other party is likely to have dominated the four-percent burden and therefore did not enter the parliament.
Schwarzenberg: Relations with India May Be Cold
If it fails to solve the problem with the Czech scientists who were accused in India for the illegal collection of cows, the Czech Foreign Minister Karel Schwarzenberg believes that there could be a certain cooling of the Czech-India relations.
This was emphasized by the minister in New York after today’s meeting with his Indian counterpart Pranab Mukherdshi.
"If this is not clear, then sure, then there will be a certain cooling," he said after a meeting held on a Czech initiative.
Mukherdshi said after the talks, in judicial matters the executive could only be difficult to interfere.
Nevertheless, he pointed out that in the case of Petr Švácha, who was released from the charges and received a fine, the central government with the local government in Dardjiling would want the case to fall into its jurisprudence.
“His problem could be solved,” the minister said.
For Emil Kučera, who was sentenced to three years in prison, it would, according to Mukherdshis, be the best if he would appeal at a higher instance.
He could thus ask for release on deposit and freely wait for his judgment, the minister said.
Schwarzenberg confirmed that his partner said the same in negotiations.
"He recommends an appeal to a higher court, then a compassion is in question for him," the head of the Czech diplomacy said.
The only way the Czech side can interfere in the whole matter is to provide "competent legal assistance" to the convicted, the Indian minister said.
At the same time, he said that such assistance will already be provided to them through the Indian side.
“We have a great interest inining good contacts with India, which have a long-term tradition.
The Indians admit that too,” Schwarzenberg said.
At the same time, he confirmed, according to the Czech press agency ČTK, in front of his partner, that the Czech Republic contributes great importance to the problem of the Czech entomologists.
“We really think it’s a big mistake to arrest and accuse these Czech scientists,” he said.
A response to the question whether he has received the promise from the Indian side to deal with the matter, the minister went out.
“I’ve been promised a lot,” he said.
A Czech runs the ring around the sea ground
It comes to an electronic map on which Australia and the adjacent sea areas are depicted.
However, he is not interested in the continent, but a small point, lost in the blue of the ocean.
"The island belongs to Australia and, along with it, the border sea ground.
The area is as large as the continent itself,” said Italian lawyer Luigi Santosuosso, a member of the UN Division for Oceans and Seas Rights.
His chief, the division director, the Czech lawyer Václav Mikulka, follows the interpretation and adds it from time to time.
There is work and enthusiasm.
The sea ground has so far formed a little known world that is rich in natural sources.
Here you can find oil, more grain and other non-recurrent raw materials, but also unknown living organisms, which, for example, carry the key to the development of a drug against cancer.
A sea ground greater than the mainland
The sponsors today strongly announced their claim to the new sea areas.
According to a UN Convention, they use the rights they agreed to in 1982 in Montego Bay, Jamaica.
It is mainly the area of the so-called continental shelf, which often enters the sea up to a few hundred kilometers from the coast of a country.
This country, according to the Convention, has a exclusive right to all sources of continental grape.
Consistently expressed, as a continental shell is considered the part of the sea floor and its soils, which represents a natural continuation of the continent under the sea surface.
It exceeds the boundaries of the coastal sea, often the boundary of two hundred sea miles of the so-called exclusive economic zone,” Mikulka explains.
The application submitted by the relevant country to the Commission for the determination of the external borders of the continental shell must be documented by a comprehensive scientific and technical documentation, which is based on many cost-intensive investigations and measurements.
It is the result of many years of preparatory work.
“One of our tasks is to provide legal and technical assistance to the Commission.
So far, the Commission has negotiated over five applications from Russia, Brazil, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand.
Until now, only the last three countries have succeeded,” Mikulka added.
A international echo was recently hit by Australia’s success, which was the first country to significantly expand its sea areas.
But New Zealand is also a winner - the extension of the sea floor, which was approved to the country last week by the Commission, is about 1.6 million square kilometers, which is about six times the size of the actual state.
Both countries have invested millions of dollars in the investigation.
The profits that will flow to them in the future from the use of the sea floor will, as they promise, have an invaluable value.
Other countries will also gradually submit their applications.
You can do this for ten years from the moment you ratify the "Montego Bay Agreement".
Where the continental shell ends, the area of the ocean floor begins, which is referred to by the Convention as the "common heritage of mankind".
There is no more state in a special position.
The right to promote in this field is granted by an international institution established by the Convention.
“The sea floor is not a golden grape land,” says director Mikulka with a bit of exaggeration and adds, whose “individual areas are legally precisely defined and the system is contractually anchored.”
Czech in the Pacific
Today, a part of the sea floor belongs to the Czech Republic.
It shares it with other states of the former Eastern Block within the framework of the joint organization "Interoceanmetal".
In 1991, it was granted the status of a so-called “breaking investor” by the Convention, as well as the investors of some less other states.
The organization has the right to promote in the ClarionClipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean between Mexico, Hawaii and Kiribati.
The area to be examined by the investor is slightly greater than the former Czechoslovakia.
The sea floor is divided there, it is a type of Tatra on the sea floor.
“You can ask there on a area of a total of 75,000 square kilometers.
The area is a rich spot of polymetal concrete that contains nickel, copper, kobalt and manganese," said another lawyer, the Indian Pakshi Rajan.
The Macedonian employee of the division Rober Sandev brings such a specificity as a pattern.
It reminds of a little potato or, with some imagination, of the narrative scheme that the legend has brought to life after the golem.
German specialists were on the ground for captivity release
The Egyptian government had asked for help from Germany to solve the kidnapping crisis - the experts came.
When it became serious, the special units were ready, but they did not come to use.
About the circumstances of the release of 11 European tourists kidnapped in Egypt, more and more details are known.
According to the Ministry of Defense and the Interior, German special forces were also indirectly involved in the rescue operation.
According to this, both the specialists of the Bundeswehr and the officers of the GSG 9, the flight staff of the Federal Police, the Federal Criminal Department and the logistics experts of the Technical Assistance Factory were at the place of liberation.
According to the ministry's spokesman on Monday night, the German forces were not needed, however, because the captains allowed their prisoners to run and flee when they had recognized signs of violent liberation.
The Egyptian government has accepted the aid offered by Germany to integrate them as local support forces.
“Fortunately, this has not happened,” a spokesman for the Federal Interior Ministry said.
Attackers kidnapped the group of five Germans, five Italians, a Romanian woman and eight Egyptian companions on September 19 in southern Egypt.
After the kidnapping in a desert area in southern Egypt, the hostages were trapped and trapped in the border area between Egypt, Libya, Sudan and Chad.
The identity of the refugees remained unclear until the end, as well as the details of the release or possible losses.
The rescued have arrived in Cairo.
Steinmeier said the liberated hostages are in the custody of the German Embassy.
He did not comment on the details of the release.
In Berlin, there was no information when they would return to Germany.
According to the "Bild" newspaper, the five passengers and the special forces are scheduled to fly out with a Airbus of the Air Force and arrive in Germany on Tuesday.
U.S. House Rejects Rescue Package
The U.S. Congress's first Chamber has made the $700 billion-weight rescue package for the financial markets hardly fail.
The Dow Jones went into the depth.
With 206 to 227 votes, the House of Representatives rejected the government’s financial market rescue package.
Despite all the calls of U.S. President George W. Bush and the leading politicians of both parties, there was no majority for the program to mitigate the chaos in the financial markets.
In a dramatic action, the supporters had desperately tried to convince the critics of the $700 billion package.
Barney Frank, one of the democratic negotiators, had called on the MPs to agree, even though the plan is unpopular.
“It’s hard to get political recognition for avoiding something that has not yet happened,” he said.
In the course of the vote, Dow Jones fell by more than six percent or 600 points.
The reason was the concerns of the investors that the state rescue package could fail.
He recovered shortly before the vote ended, and then, after the failure was announced, he fell down again.
Experts are now expecting further severe turbulences on the international financial markets.
The entry into force of the programme requires the approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate.
Organizers report increasing number of reservations
It seems to be a good winter for the German travel organizers:
In travel bookings for the coming months, the revenue has increased significantly compared to the previous year, according to a study - for the winter season even more than 30 percent.
Despite weak connectivity prospects, the travel passion of the Germans remains untouched, according to a study.
In the bookings for the winter season, the travel agencies recorded a revenue plus of 31 percent compared to the previous year period, the German Travel Association (DRV) on Monday in Berlin.
According to the market research institution GfK, there are already increased bookings for the autumn months.
Thus, the sales plus of the travel agencies for October was around 11 percent compared to 2007, the DRV.
The basis for these results are GfK’s figures, which monthly evaluates booking data from 1200 German travel agencies and highlights for the overall market.
It contains the travel bookings made by the end of August 2008.
Due to the weak dollar rate, travel to the United States is demanded, the DRV.
This is about a third of the booking increase.
In addition, Spain, Turkey and Greece, as well as the hometown guests are sought by the Germans.
Particularly, fixed travel is high in the course, DRV President Klaus Laepple said.
In view of increasing costs for energy and food, the costs here are “better calculable for the customer than in the individual organized holidays.”
Money could save consumers, among other things, through early book robots or all-inclusive offers, Laepple said.
The summer months were also booked very well, so there will be a revenue plus compared to the previous year - although according to another study the number of Germans taking a trip fell compared to the previous year.
My first Oktoberfest
Ballermann-Apres ski hits in the endless slide, beer from liters and promis in Designer-Dirndln.
A Wiesn debut.
Susanne Kronzucker and I do not have much in common.
She is a blond, television moderator and wears a customized dirndl.
I have dark hair, I am a student and my dress is secondhand.
But one thing connects us: almost three minutes on the wire, the photographers are already falling on us and scratching the storage cards full - very smooth and that at my first wire visit.
This is how you make friends.
The cheap dirt seems to meet its purpose.
As a resident of Wiesn-Touri and actually north of the White Root Equator, the well-being in the trail so far remained in boundaries.
But once arrived on the Theresienwiese, everything was half so bad.
Almost everyone wears dirndl or leather hose; no one looks angry or shy touched - everything is completely normal.
A strange look at the chocolate banana stand only tightened my dirt.
One Munich woman makes me notice that I had wrongly bound the scratch: "Links hoast free, Middle Virgin, right forgiven, back witnessed."
At home, I freeze my slide from the back to the left.
“Go,” he said and laughed.
Others make less effort on subtle flirting techniques and wear simple folds on which "To drunk to get dressed!" stands and stretches the naked back to an unhappy.
The young man with the exhibitionist attitudes is named Bob, comes from England and also visits the Oktoberfest for the first time.
He finds it “gorgeous”, with a long-going “ooooo”.
He tells me this after he has dissolved his previously drunk measure.
Right next to one of these hydrants, of which everyone thinks he is a mole.
Bob is one of the famous Wildbiesers.
Others are not lucky to get rid of alcohol in this way.
Around eight in the evening, sanitaries in shares run over the festival, who have to take care of the poor sweaters.
The nurses always stand up in the roll - every four at a time throw a covered trail from tent to tent.
This works as with most Wiesn visitors: empty up, full back.
Whoever is in the Promille sarg under the plane, you can't see.
“There are those who goarnimmer pack,” one of the sanitaries called me on request and disappeared in the hole.
The victim's name was announced by the police
The name of a 63-year-old female pedestrian who died in the hospital after being attacked by a vehicle in Essex was revealed.
Carole Paulson, who lived on the Chelmsford Road in Brentwood, was involved in the incident on Friday afternoon on the Shenfield Road in the city center.
She was taken to Queen's Hospital in Romford, but died later.
A 51-year-old man was arrested after the accident for suspicion of driving.
In the meantime, he was released on deposit.
Turkey expands its diplomatic horizon
Long before Turkey sought to join the European Union, the European powers were interested in penetrating deep into the backland of Turkey.
On the east side of the Bosphorus, just 20 steps within Asia, is one of the finest relics of this failed, imperial attempt.
The Hydarpasha Railway Station was designed by the two German architects Otto Ritter and Helmut Conu in the Neo-Renaissance style.
At least this is what the guides tell you.
The building is sitting rittling at the end of the railroad with a tower on every corner of the front and looks like any provincial German council.
The rock is dirty.
The whole building is broken.
But once you’re within the wooled driving card shell, there’s no doubt about the excellence of the project, whose most western access this was.
The railway station was opened in August 1908 by a German consortium, the Anatolien-Bagdad Gesellschaft.
Germany, which was a spacecraft in the imperialist game, had to implement its ambitions to dominate the Middle East, through a train connection to Damascus, Baghdad, and beyond what is Saudi Arabia today.
However, German imperialist projects fell during the First World War.
His railways were attacked by Lawrence of Arabs and his Arabs.
The relative isolation of its surrounding region, generated by the unbeatable boundaries of the Cold War, has disappeared.
British forces withdrew from Egypt and pushed the Turks and their German allies from Palestine and Syria
And there were also bad news for the Hyderpasha Station.
In 1917, an ammunition flew into the air, destroying the artificial roof.
Turkish sources say it was sabotage.
Since then, it has slowly broken down, largely passed away from history.
Today, however, this railway line, at least symbolically, serves as a gateway to Anatolia and everything east of it to highlight the expansion of the diplomatic horizon of Tükei.
The ruling Justice and Development Party, the AKP, has introduced a whole new foreign policy for the country.
The relative isolation from the neighboring regions, generated by the borders of the Cold War, has disappeared.
Now there is a approach policy.
Importantly, the Turkish government has good relations with Israel and Syria, with the Palestinian divisions Hamas and Fatah, with Iran and Iraq and, of course, with the European Union and the United States.
To evaluate the core data of this new foreign policy, I took the night train to the Turkish capital Ankara to visit one of the leading foreign policy experts of the AKP, the Turkish deputy Suat Kiniklioglu.
The next morning, about ten and a half hours later, after a hard drive on trails that produced the equation of the old world in the well-known documentation “The Night Mail”, I arrived in the Turkish capital, which is seen as a new city, for the new worldwide state project, the Ottoman past to turn back.
However, the AKP, known for its Islamist roots, represents a paradigm change in Turkish unity.
This has caused a lot of suspicion in the West, especially in Washington.
A taxi brought me to the AKP’s headquarters, a special-made, ultramodern stone and steel construction, in a developing suburbs, surrounded by half-finished shopping centers and stores where middle managers, both men and women, met to complete the first business of the day.
Suat Kiniklioglu could be a mid-right politician from almost any other political party in Europe.
Clothes, cravates, I’m sure he’s even packed a Blackberry.
The goal of the party’s foreign policy is now to reintegrate Turkey with its immediate neighbors.
The Cold War was an exceptional phenomenon,” he told me.
Turkey was cut off from its backland.
Nowadays, they have to look to the east and the west at the same time.
There would not be either one or the other.
She must do both.
“But Turkey could one day,” I asked, “be forced to make a decision?”
“Turkey,” he said, “will not have to make that decision.”
He then highlighted a point that almost everyone with whom I was talking here almost routinely said: The relations of Turkey, not only to the Middle East but also to the Caucasus and around the Black Sea, are as beneficial for Europe and the United States as they are for Turkey.
With Turkey on board, the embassy seems to be, in the transmitted sense, Europe as a whole runs on the same railways east toward Asia and the Middle East.
Back at the Hydarpashas railway station, after another widespread sleepless night, I thought of these two German governments, Mr. Ritter and Mr. Conu, who had seen when they built this building 100 years ago.
How surprising they would have been to find out that Europe’s ambitions in the Middle East could now, largely, be in the hands of Turkey.
And when I was waiting for the ferry to bring me back over the Bosphorus, I remembered that Turkey was always called "the sick man of Europe" in those days.
At that time, at least, there seemed no much doubt about which continent should have a claim to this fascinating country.
In memory of Vernon Handley and William Woodruff.
Mark Brown writes: As Guildford's musical director since 1962, Vernon "Tod" Handley was responsible for the Guildford Philharmonic and Chor.
As part of his music program for the city, he founded in the following year his great youth chorus, Proteus.
It was intended for young people up to 21 years of age, but when the chorus last singed in 1979 some of us were already at the end of 20 - we simply refused to leave the chorus.
The name "Proteus" (the mythological shape change) was for the willingness and ability of the chore, any piece of music that was presented to him, whether it was a madrigal or from the Messiah, whether it was a capella or with a full orchestra.
The musical diversity of such a young chore was often surprising, always exciting and existed only and alone thanks to that man’s inspiration and his enthusiasm for the music that has never left behind over the years.
How often did death keep us about “to let the music speak for themselves.”
He continued to say, “The composer knows what he wants.”
It’s all in music.
So sing it!”
His way of guidance was absolutely clear and accurate, never herry but never overwhelming.
No matter how high the musical level was, he always demanded an even higher.
John Frayn Turner says:
If any director had to be hit by the Knight, it was Vernon Handley.
I knew him well during the last two decades, from 1962 to 1982, in which he led the Guildford Philharmonic.
Over the past 40 years, I’ve written criticisms for more than a hundred of his concerts and I can honestly say that I’ve never been disappointed by one – often I’ve been inspired by them.
Death Handley was that rare combination of size and personal humility.
He hated leaders who, according to his words, simply "go home with one or two known horses in the world."
So many of us will miss him.
by William Woodruff
Professor John Beckett says:
In your call for William Woodruff (September 25), you write that "he regained the teaching of economic history in Oxford in 1946 and received a Houblon Norman research scholarship in 1950 ... while at the same time he studied for a BSc, a MA and a PhD.
This is a conclusion from an author's note in Woodruff's book "Beyond Nab End", but it is not true.
From 1946 to 1953 he was a professor of economic history at the University of Nottingham and during this time he wrote a doctoral thesis on the British cabbage industry under the supervision of Professor J.D. Chambers, which was later published in 1958 as "The British cabbage industry".
He was 1950-1951 in the United States during a Houblon-Norman scholarship, and spent the summer of 1952 at the universities of Illinois, Harvard and New York.
In 1953, he left Nottingham and went to Illinois.
It is unknown why Woodruff wanted to hide this part of his career.
J. Vicente Resino at the Faculty of Philology.
'I recommend the exhibition of José Vicente Resino 'Flamenco and Life', because his photographs in black and white, in documentary style, are fantastic.
They made me attention to them because of their simplicity and because of the strength they radiate, as they always deal with the protagonists with respect.
An exhibition that shows many feelings.
Resino knows how to find the magical moments.
Second round of excellent sales at Honda.
In November, Honda will start the sale of the second generation of the Honda Jazz.
While his predecessor model had a large interior, this large room mouse offers a much larger one.
This includes the technical features that make it even more convenient to drive and save gasoline.
changes before the upcoming revolution.
This is the second generation of Honda Jazz.
Although, from an aesthetic point of view, the new jazz has a similar line to its predecessor, the changes that have been made with this big limousine are numerous.
Among other things, it is intended to emphasize the innovative design, the new space flexibility, the larger dimensions of the car and the new mechanics.
However, before we begin to analyze the new model, we must say that this new jazz appears six years later, after the first generation had appeared on the market.
According to the first observations, Honda, compared to the other manufacturers, managed to renew this model for a shorter time.
Although the Honda Jazz is less known in Europe, this model is a phenomenon that affects its sales on other markets.
This is a case in Japan, in the country where jazz is the most sold car of the year 2002 and also during this year 2008.
After the jazz appeared on the market, about a million models were sold in Japan alone.
The second market was the Old Continent, with about half a million cars sold in six years.
Nevertheless, Honda is trying to increase the sales of the new Jazz model within the segment.
Thus, while the Japanese company sold a total of 83,000 models of jazz in 2007, the expected estimates are 10,000 cars.
As for the Spanish market, Honda has sold a total of 8,000 Jazz models since 2002, accounting for 6.7% of the total sales of Honda in Spain.
As for the new generation of the model, the head of the branch in Spain expect to be able to sell 2,000 jazz models per year.
More closely, the appearance of the new Honda Jazz model enables to hide the sales cuts in Spain.
In fact, the brand leaders hope to finish the year with a total sales of 22 000 models. That is 4 000 cars less than in 2007, a decrease of 16%.
Despite this growth in sales, Honda has increased its market share in Spain compared to the previous year (1.6%) to 1.8%.
At the same time, the Japanese company hopes to reach the 2% in 2010.
To this share, Honda is relying on the appearance of a new model.
It’s Insight, a hybrid car with 5 doors and a compact size of 4.7 meters long, which Japanese companies hope to sell about 200,000 models per year around the world.
According to the market estimates of the Japanese manufacturer, 50% of Insight models are sold in the United States, while the remaining share is distributed on the Old Continent and Japan.
The appearance of the Insight on the market is scheduled for the first months of the year, for the first time its public presentation will take place in January in Valencia.
With regard to the first generation, the new jazz grows in all its sizes.
Its length is 3.90 meters (plus 5 centimeters ), its width is 1.69 meters (plus 2 centimeters) and the distance between the axes is 2.50 meters, which leads to the assumption that it has become 5 centimeters greater.
The height, on the contrary, does not change and remains 1.52 meters.
Along with the increase in dimensions, the interior is also enlarged.
This success is due, on the one hand, to the new space flexibility program and, on the other hand, to the central position of the fuel container, a solution that was also used in the predecessor model of jazz.
Also the capacity of the luggage space, which has a system of double charging area, reaches up to 339 liters, which is 19 liters greater than the capacity of the first generation luggage space.
It must be emphasized that these measures are present in the version with a 1.4 litre gasoline engine, as the capacity of the baggage space of the Honda Jazz with a 1.2 litre gasoline engine is 379 liters.
Among other improvements, in addition to the additional facilities such as led seats or the possibility of inserting panoramic windows, an improved access to the seats is offered.
The opening angle of the back doors is 80 degrees, with the first jazz only 67 degrees.
The engine of the second generation of jazz is also new.
At the beginning of its marketing, this small model has 2 performance of the gasoline engines: 1.2 and 1.4 liters.
Both variants have the i-VTEC system, which allows low fuel consumption and smaller CO2 emissions, with excellent technical performance and at the same time a row-minute performance for the entire engine runtime.
The first version with 1.2 liters achieves the power of 90 PS at 6 000 spins with a maximum spin point of 114 Nm at 4 900 min?1 .
This petrol engine - the predecessor model of Jazz reaches 78 hp - has 5.3 liters of fuel consumption and CO2 emissions of 125 grams.
With regard to the previous engine, which at the previous generation reached 83 hp, it is now able to get to 100 hp.
The Jazz 100 PS 1.4 has 5.4 liters of fuel consumption and 128 grams of CO2 emissions.
‘Auto-Biene’, which prevents collisions
To advance the development of accidents prevention technologies, this time Nissan was inspired by nature, more precisely by the bees.
The Japanese company has developed a robot whose flight goes back to the sharp behavior of bees and prevents accidents.
This robot is a bio-mimetic car robot drive or BR23C and represents the first step in the technologies for accident prevention.
The engineers from the Nissan Motor Co. Technical Development Center have developed this small robot in cooperation with the Research Center for Advanced Science and Technology of the renowned University of Tokyo (Japan).
According to Kazuhiro Doi, Head of Technology PR and R&D Brand Management, the BR23C represents an extension of the four-layer Nissan safety sheet.
This robot is designed to ensure that the cars of this brand are able to avoid the collisions.
During the flight, each bear builds its own oval-shaped airspace, which is very similar to the Nissan safety shell.
But the most important thing is the facet eyes of the bears, which can see over an angle of 300 degrees in all directions, allowing them to fly uninterrupted in their personal airspace without interruption.
In order to refurbish the surrounding perspective, the technicians developed the so-called Laser Range Finder (LRF).
He notices obstacles that are at a distance of up to two meters from the BR23C and at a radius of 180 degrees, calculates the distance to the object and sends a signal to a border-gen microprocessor, which is directly translated into a signal to prevent collision.
'At the moment the barrier is noticed, the little robot will imitate the bees flight and immediately change the direction by turning his wheels around 90o or even greater angles to avoid the collision.
The greatest difference from any other systems is that this escape maneuver takes place absolutely instinctively.
If not, the robot could not be able to react with sufficient speed to avoid obstacles,” explains Toshiyuki Andoh, the director of the Mobility Laboratory and the leading engineer of this project.
Unlike a bear, the robot can not vary up or down, but can not overlay; it can only move on two dimensions and in the direction that allows it to turn its wheels and not in the infinite directions and in the infinite way as it does the bears.
For this reason, Nissan has used the rotating function in addition to acceleration and freezing functions, so that the small robot avoids collisions.
This device only takes a couple of seconds to process the information and act according to this information.
It does not require the information or the intuitive logic of the maneuver made to be stored, so it can continuously work with only a couple of dozen KB of the storage space.
This sounds surprising, but it’s not about the GBs and not even about the MBs of the storage.
This is the first step in the development of technologies for immediate collision prevention, a technology that Nissan will introduce in the next ten years in the series cars.
The robot works with lithium polymer batteries that are lighter and hold longer than a variety of lithium-ion batteries.
Another possible application of this technology in the future could be the integration of the unit with a GPS navigation system by satellite to lead to the destination while driving and avoiding obstacles on the road.
She is in the shrink before she is charged with a mortgage.
It must be understood that the U.S. Department of Finance, except that it has sufficient liquidity to provide support, is not without skill.
Before the crisis and to avoid the U.S. citizens being involved in mortgage stories of allegedly payable banks, a fun and informative game for the Internet surfers was developed: ‘Bad Credit Hotel’, it says.
Or maybe, the 'hotel of bad loans' or the crackdown.
The third aspect of this accommodation and especially its receptionist is to think one, two and up to three times, whether it’s time to ask for no loan.
And above all, where you can do it, which is probably the goal of the game.
Certainly, it has useful information, but without details.
This is rather a site for the teen than a place for all the viewers.
What happens if the game is expanded?
Well, when a dream room appears in the hotel.
At least something because it’s not about buying a better house.
Morgan Stanley gives its capital to MUFG
Morgan Stanley announced the launch of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) into its company, making it the first bank in Japan to spend nine billion dollars and thus take over 21% of its capital, a innovation due to a strong fall of its stock exchange rate.
A week after a preliminary agreement was made public, the two banks declared that MUFG will buy 9.9% of Morgan Stanley's stock at a single price of $25.25, resulting in a total amount of $3 billion.
The estimated price is below 19% of the price value of the stock from 31 August.
MUFG will invest additional $6 billion in the acquisition of convertible shares, which will guarantee a 10% profit and can be sold at a price of $31.25.
Morgan Stanley said the global trade will be based on a single average price of $29, which is 28% above the current price value.
The Morgan Stanley stock, however, dropped from 17.00 GMT by 6.79% to $23,07.
“This strategic connection is an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of Morgan Stanley to the status of a holding bank,” said John Mack, CEO of the U.S. Group.
Morgan Stanley adopted this status last week, allowing him to expand his business to new areas, but under the supervision of the Federal Reserve.
Their connection with MUFG also confirms that the current financial crisis forces the greatest name of Wall Street to take a much more cautious attitude than before.
The modalities presented on Monday also show that the agreement has changed over the past days: Last Monday Morgan had simply stated that it would sell up to 20% of its shares to Japan for about $8.5 billion.
'A week ago,' said in Tokyo Toshihide Mizuno, CEO of MUFG, 'we thought that the participation would consist entirely of genetic shares.
But given the current economic and market situation, we wanted to reduce the risks and save ourselves.”
Based on a balanced average price, MUFG will pay 7% below its price value for its Morgan Stanley shares.
And the business will go with a profit decrease of about 20% per share.
The agreement provides that in a year, MUFG will be able to convert half of its preferential shares into primary shares if the latter within a given period is exchanged to more than 50% above the sales value, i.e. to approximately $47.
Morgan Stanley assures that the funds delivered by MUFG will enable him to take advantage of investment opportunities, strengthen his balance sheet and increase his sales.
However, a group spokesman refused to provide more detailed information about the strategic projects of the two new allies.
After the investment of MUFG, Morgan Stanley should be able to record a payability rate of about 15%, one of the best in this sector.
Morgan said his balance sheet has 'successfully' decreased since the end of August.
The last weeks were hard for the group who had to see how their stock exchange rate dropped by half, while the price for insurance against insolvency accelerated to the high.
This price dropped on Monday, but remained at a high level, at about 12%.
Goldman Sachs, the only survivor of the major investment banks on Wall Street after the bankruptcy of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers and the acquisition of Merrill Lynch, announced last week that he had withdrawn $15 billion, partly from Berkshire Hathaway, the Warren Buffett group.
Rafael Correa is on Monday in Quito.
The Republic around the socialism of the 21st century re-found.
This is the joint project of Venezuelan Hugo Chávez, Bolivian Evo Morales and Equatorian Rafael Correa.
The third was the one who this Sunday, following the example of his fellow minds and friends, made the plan of a new constitution to be elected.
The mission is fulfilled because according to the public results of 80% of voters, 64% voted ‘yes’ in the referendum.
According to these results, 28% voted ‘no’, 7% of the voting bills were invalid and 0.7% were empty.
In order to approve the draft constitution, a vote must be obtained by more than half of all votes.
On Sunday, two surveys conducted at the outputs of the elections and a census of a non-government organization announced a clear victory for 'Yes' and prophetized it by 63% to 70%.
In the night of Sunday to Monday, Rafael Correa had, by the way, demanded the victory of his constitutional project.
“The Constitution has triumphed overwhelmingly,” he had insured in Guayaquil, the government headquarters 280 kilometers southwest of Quito, and congratulated the Equatorians.
Of course, Rafael Correa was welcomed by Chávez and Morales, but also by his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet.
The election, which was held in silence in accordance with the Observatory Order of the Organization of American States (OAS), referred to a text of 444 points to safeguard the ‘new socialism’ for which the president is committed.
The constitutional draft transfers state power to the economy by leaving it the sole right to ‘development planning’ in a country that lives largely from the oil promotion by foreign companies and from the currencies that emigrants send to the country.
The project, which will be promoted by the 2006 elected Correa, will also confess a more comprehensive power to the head of state, who will be able to exercise up to two consecutive mandates of four years, and will have the opportunity to dissolve the National Assembly.
Correa has already announced that he will take advantage of this power and will seek a new mandate in February 2009.
The Constitution also guarantees the principle of free medical care and education that the President has already started to introduce in this country with 13.9 million inhabitants, in which 50% of the population lives below the poverty limit.
Finally, it also plans to ban the presence of foreign troops, which will end the agreement between Quito and Washington to use an Ecuadorian base as a starting point for U.S. drug use.
The 19 hostages were released in Chad.
A Egyptian command began the attack on the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight companions who had been captured ten days ago.
They are in Cairo.
The eleven European tourists and their eight Egyptian companions, who were held imprisoned in the desert for eleven days, were brought back to the Egyptian capital on Monday afternoon.
In the morning they were released by an Egyptian command in the Chad.
Apparently in good condition, the hostages arrived at 15:30 a.m. on board a special aircraft at the Al-Maza military base right next to the international airport in Cairo.
They were taken directly, without being able to talk to the press, on board a helicopter to the hospital of Maadi, a foreign district of Cairo, to be investigated there.
They enjoy all ‘best health’ and the kidnappers ‘no rescue was paid,’ said Egyptian tourism minister Zoheir Garanna on the roll field.
After being captured on September 19 at a land car safari at the foot of Mount Ouanat in the border area of Egypt, Sudan and Libya, the group of hostages was repeatedly brought to the next of 35 unknown kidnappers from one hostage.
There are eleven tourists — five Italians, five Germans and one Romanians — and eight Egyptians: two guides, four drivers, a border heater and the director of the Agency Egyptus, the organizer of the Safari.
A Egyptian security officer said 30 members of the special units, from the board of two helicopters, launched the attack at night, shortly before the morning.
“On both sides were shot and half of the kidnappers were killed, the rest fled,” said the man who wanted to remain anonymous.
He said a total of 150 members of the Egyptian special units had been sent to Sudan, where they received support from German and Italian commands.
The head of the Italian diplomats Franco Frattini from Belgrade, where he is currently, the role, the secret agents and elements of the Italian special units played.
“We must acknowledge that we have achieved this outcome thanks to the professionalism and performance of our men from the intelligence service and special units,” he said without further details.
He also claims that a rescue has been paid.
On the eve, the Sudanese army had claimed to have stopped at a patrol a ground vehicle in which the kidnappers were located, six of whom, including the Chad leader, killed and two arrested.
The army stated that they were linked to a rebellion group from Darfour, the Libération du Soudan-Unité (SLA-U), which, however, immediately opposed this movement.
The silent majority of culture
A debate on the financing of culture makes clues and is the central topic of the current election campaign.
The better.
But a part of our cultural life remains forgotten.
Who will stand up and raise the terrible sums that are given to the small museums, archives, archaeological excavations, or the national historical places that are sadly hungry?
Which politician will dare to remind the federal government that it neglected its monuments and its culturally important buildings?
That there are no right laws in Quebec as well as in Canada that effectively protect our cultural heritage?
Did you know that the French government provides €3.5 million solely for the restoration of the castle of Chinon in the Loiretal?
For our American neighbors, in the Constitution of their country it is written that the protection of the cultural heritage belongs to the culture of the Americans, and that this cultural heritage must be protected by all citizens, all members of the parliament and all governments, in mutual vote.
In Quebec, the Quebec Association of Historical Societies, at least 40,000 volunteers, gathered in 211 Historical Societies, strive to engage intensely with history, to save the numerous private archives, and to preserve the archaeological remains.
They are also often the guard dogs of our cultural heritage who protest with the power of despair when sponsors and decision makers leave their bulldozer on our old stones and forgotten cemetery.
When will there be a scene for history and cultural heritage?
Benelux governments national parts of Fortis Bank
With a partial nationalization, the Benelux states want to take back the Belgian-Dutch Fortis Bank in turbulence due to the U.S. financial crisis: the three states provide the banking and insurance institution, which in turn also has offices in Hungary, with a total of EUR 11.2 billion.
The governments of Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands will consult at the highest level this weekend, together with the President of the European Central Bank and the Commission Commissioner for Competition.
In the Eurozone, the Fortis is the first victim of the international financial market crisis that has lasted for a year, so the decisions that are now made in relation to the bank may have a precedence.
In the sense of the decision taken on Sunday night, all three states buy the bank’s respective shares by about 49 percent.
The bank is likely to sell a part of its shares, especially the insurance activities purchased by the Dutch ABN Amro last year.
Fortis’ shares began a steady rally last week, in the second half of the week already recorded serious crisis scenarios.
However, analysts agree that the bank with its 85,000 employees is too big for a dispute.
The institute’s securities fell by 12% on Friday to a 14-year thickness.
Since January, the value of the shares has dropped by more than two-thirds.
Given the current stock rates, the group’s market value is EUR 14 billion, which, according to the management, is unrealistic.
According to the management, the $700 billion expensive U.S. rescue package and the market uncertainty resulting in it is the fault of Fortis’ shares.
On Monday, the rates increased slightly.
On Friday, Filip Dierckx was appointed the new chief executive of the bank.
The money institution was also looking for a private buyer, but it did not find any interested with a real offer.
The Belgian government, however, was trying to calm - no investor should grieve for his money, it said.
There has not been a panic among the customers so far, the bank’s branches have not been stumbled.
In Hungary, Fortis has independent branches, but it also calls leasing firms their own.
Fuchs in Chicken Stall
Due to the drug consumption of a person, in America life and health insurance often refuse to conclude a contract with a customer.
Data protection experts fear that the data market could become uncontrollable.
“There are data protection programs that link the use of the drug data in any case to the consent of the person concerned.
These should be in independent hands, otherwise we trust the chickens to the fuchs," said Richard Dick, the developer of the prescription tracking program.
Insurance will determine the fees as well as the payments in case of damage depending on the health status of the customer, and if the risk is assessed too high, the insurance will not be completed at all.
Previously, the customer was sent for a medical examination, and the contract was concluded only with the knowledge of the examination results.
Ten years ago, Dick invented a much more affordable method: using the customer’s identification number, he takes the data of the last one and a half years from the pharmacies, i.e. what preparations were purchased, and the program calculates from which disease the customer suffers and how his health is.
For example, if he regularly purchases large amounts of cholesterol-lowering drugs, it can be shown that his blood fat levels are untreatably high, which would automatically arrange him into a higher risk group.
There are several versions of the program in circulation - some even define a risk multiplier, so insurance companies just have to do the paper cram more, but there are smaller difficulties.
One of the disadvantages is that many medications can be taken for different purposes, such as against migraine and heat waves, but also against depression.
The latter is a high risk factor from the point of view of the insurers, while the aforementioned are not.
For the request and processing of the data, their own companies have been formed, which, before receiving the data, ask the patient for their consent.
In the meantime, they have to do this by law, although negligence has not yet been penalized.
Some companies even process the results of laboratory trials and link them to the data about the drug consumption.
More and more companies have access to the data, and the control of their use is becoming more difficult at the same time.
Although there is a private data protection law for health data, its effect is only extended to service providers in the health and insurance sector.
The draft law has already been submitted to Congress, according to which authorities could also control the data processing companies.
Dick Richard realizes that this is too little, so he wants to further develop his program so that the data can only be disclosed with the consent of the person concerned.
Another question, of course, is that the person concerned can hardly prohibit access to his data, since otherwise the insurance companies do not conclude a contract with him.
And so the chickens are just somehow left to the grace of the fuchs.
Global Food Plan from Marseille
India and the European Union double trade
Since the European Union and India, on the one hand, are the leading trade partners of each other, this was the main topic alongside other global issues at the ninth summit.
Today, the French-India Summit will also take place, which will focus on cooperation in the nuclear sector.
Although the European Union acknowledges that India is a emerging, democratic great power that should be given more votes and co-voice in international concerns, the Member States have not yet been able to agree whether to support the permanent membership of New Delhi in the UN Security Council or not.
This issue was not discussed at the ninth summit in Marseille yesterday.
The French President and current EU Council President Nicolas Sarkozy, as well as Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Chief Diplomat Javier Solana welcome the Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh.
Given the fact that the exchange of goods increased from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007, this goal is not even so ambitious.
In this sense, the 26 existing civil aviation agreements with India have also been legally summarized into an agreement, so that in the future air traffic will also be interfered.
By 2009, India wants to sign the free trade agreement with the EU.
Sarkozy promised to accelerate the pact.
The goal is to make a balance in the current unbalanced relationship between the EU and India: while the Union is India’s number one partner, New Delhi is only on the ninth among the EU partners.
The summit was dedicated to global concerns.
This included the situation in Afghanistan and Pakistan, as well as the terrorism, which both sides condemned strongly.
The Doha round should also be completed, and both sides are guilty of failure.
The EU emphasized that it adheres to its energy and climate program, which means that emissions will be reduced by at least 20 percent by 2020.
India also agreed, as well as the proposal to conclude a kind of global compromise at the upcoming Climate Summit and reduce greenhouse gas production by 50 percent by 2050.
The increase in food prices should also be combated, so both support the convocation of an international conference on the issue of the financial crisis.
The Prime Minister of India is visiting the French capital today, where he will sign an agreement on the peaceful use of nuclear energy at a bilateral meeting.
In Paris, however, an order is expected to be made to French companies worth EUR 20 billion for the construction of nuclear reactors in India.
According to the agency, the agreement is expected to be concluded for 15 years.
More than 300 Italian publishers in Frankfurt
Strong presence of Italian publishers at the Frankfurt International Book Fair.
More than 300 Italian publishers will be present at the 60th Book Fair, the most important international event for the acquisition of rights.
The international Frankfurt Book Fair awaits for the current event more than 7,000 exhibitors from 101 countries. They will spread over the 171,790 square meters of the fair and present over 403,000 titles.
Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of Cultural Property and Cultural Activities Maria Giro will represent the Italian government during the opening ceremony in the exhibition hall: Italy will be represented in the 264 square meters exhibition area “Punto Italia”.
A press conference near the Room Structure will be followed in the Book Fair Exhibition Hall 5.0: this occasion will discuss figures, trends and perspectives around the publishing industry in Italy.
According to the data, the importance of the books of foreign writers decreases in the whole, but in particular in the adult and youth section.
Billionaire Steve Fossett's missing plane found a year ago
The small plane of Steve Fossett, the billionaire missing on a flight over the desert of Nevada on September 3, 2007, was discovered.
The particles were found on a 3000 m high plateau, in the Sierra Nevada Mammoth Lakes area between the states of California and Nevada.
But no human remains were found inside the plane.
The Sheriff of Madera County, John Anderson, completely disconnected the last doubts during a press conference: "The aircraft has been localized, for which a troop was sent. Now we have the certainty that it is the aircraft that Steve Fossett flown on the day of his disappearance."
Mr. Anderson also confirmed that no human remains were found in the plane or nearby.
The 63-year-old billionaire was declared dead in February.
The U.S. Traffic Safety Authority (NTSB) that a crew was sent to identify the plane just a few hours after the aircraft was seen: the Bellanca 8kcab, which was lost on September 3, 2007 after Fossett launched a 3-hour flight in Yerington, Nevada.
Yesterday, some of the personal objects of Fossett were eventually found in California, near the border with Nevada, from a couple near their house on the Mammoth Lakes.
These are two certificates named Fossetts, both issued by the Federal Aviation Administration of Illinois, cash and a jacket.
The search for Fossett was abandoned a month after his disappearance.
The billionaire had gained a place in history through a long sequence of records.
In 2002, he managed in the sixth round, as the first person to turn the world ball in a heating air balloon: a two-week, lonely flight.
Three years later, he flew around the world in a single flight without intermediate landing with a plane.
Among its many records is also a height flight of 15445 meters over the Andes, this with a co-pilot.
Glk, the advertising you don’t expect
A Suv that falls from the traditional schemes due to its original design and the special line guidance, the loading surface and its clear angles.
Mercedes-Benz has tried to bring a new breath to the sector with this offroader.
Especially due to its exceptional characteristics, the performance of the Suv Glk will also be unconventional, which will be seen from October 17 in the Mercedes-Benz showroom.
Thus, the advertising boom that will accompany the new model’s appearance will also appear in new clothes, namely in the form of a 3D campaign – a novelty in the automotive sector in the backward Italy.
A project with a maximum effort, which is planned to be carried out in various phases that will take over the central shopping mile of Milan, the Corso Como, until 15 November.
The first phase will consist of the presentation of the car in shape, with 3D glasses distributed near the Corso Como to give the whole a special view: the new SUV will appear in its almost real dimensions as a three-dimensional model.
In fact, the car will appear so apparently from the poster on which it is depicted.
After that, using the Elumina8 technology, the new glk is illuminated at different moments in all its details, to reassemble itself as a whole.
It is undoubtedly the concern of Mercedes with this advertisement to introduce a new kind of authorship in this rather stereotype field.
But will it succeed in reaching the interests of future buyers?
Now it’s clear who the Italian Hooligans are.
They come from the Triveneto – now they risk the stadium ban
They are part of the group "Ultras Italia", which has been traveling behind the Italian national team for years and which, honestly, has not caused any serious problems until recently.
There has never been any clashes with opponent fans.
The origin of the group is in the right environment.
The sponsors come from the Triveneto.
From Verona, Padova, Trieste and Udine.
In Sofia there were other smaller groups from Campania and Apulia.
They wear the tricolori on which the cities of the militants appear: but these were removed on Saturday to avoid identification.
Their models are the English fans.
In Bulgaria, there was now a collision with a truly right-radical fan scene, that of Levski.
From the Figc the Italian fans were provided with 144 cards for the game: all were exhibited on names and thus easy to control.
In fact, they were also all controlled by the Viminal: among the travelers to Sofia, no one was with an ongoing stadium prohibition procedure.
Four fans of the Italian team, who were already overloaded in this regard, were also denied the ticket and the trip to Bulgaria.
Now the Viminal is waiting for the reports of the Bulgarian police to take further steps: in this case the detained or identified Tifosi may expect a stadium ban of at least five years.
This is an international ban that prevents access to the stadiums throughout Europe.
So our hooligans will no longer put a foot into a stadium.
Fortunately .
But now, of course, there is fear of reminder cities, which could follow this little more than 150.
“This fire needs to be stopped immediately, and that such behavior will not be justified in any case,” the Viminal said.
That's why, "Look up above all also looking at the national team's game on Wednesday in Lecce."
In fact, there is a small core of the Italian Ultras in Apulia.
Tomorrow the Osservatorio (Sports Surveillance) gathers, on Tuesday the Casms, which can count on a part of the Aise, i.e. the intelligence services that deal with the problem of the stadium violence.
"Duce-Duce calls and the raised right arm during the hymn of Mameli? in Bulgaria this is not a crime..."
This is the thought of Domenico Mazzilli (probably expressed in no joy), who has been the director of the Osservatorio on the Viminal for a few weeks (he took over the post of Francensco Tagliente and then Felice Ferlizzi).
Previously, Mazzilli was the police chairman of Trieste, where now a core of the supporters of Ultras Italia founded in 2002.
It is true, Mazzilli says, that it is not against the law in Bulgaria to praise the Duce, but without a doubt the behavior of these 150-200 people was a shame.
“I’m not a sociologist – adds the Observatory’s No. 1 – Crimes are condemned in the country of their act.
So far, this group had kept in mind, but now it is necessary to overthink what has happened and will happen.
But let’s also talk about the pifes during the hymn of Mamelis: this is not a crime, but let me, there is no education.”
