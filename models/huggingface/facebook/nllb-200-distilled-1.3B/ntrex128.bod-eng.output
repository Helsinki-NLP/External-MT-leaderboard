Welsh AMs are worried that they will be seen as 'ugly' and 'unfit'.
The AMs were proposed to be renamed MWPs by the Welsh Assembly Councillors to become MWPs (the Welsh Assembly Members).
This resulted in the Welsh Assembly Bill, known as the Welsh Assembly.
All the rulers of the earth are mocking and mocking at this.
The Labour Party's opinion suggests that his party is concerned about it and the Twp and Pwp sound.
For a reader outside of Wales, the content of Welshtwp is a fool's sign, and the content of pwp is a gray.
A rat has devised a plan to replace a weed that is a public nuisance.
A traditional Welsh politician, his roots seem to have opened the door to a name change, but the transition from MWP to Muppet is a brief one.
So the sound of the Welsh w is the same as the sound of the English u in English y.
The House of Representatives is in the process of drafting a bill that would allow for the name change, and the House of Commons has said that the final decision on what to call the members of the House of Representatives should be made by the members themselves.
In 2017, the Government of Wales Act granted the Welsh Parliament the power to change the name.
In June this year, the House of Commons announced the results of a referendum on the proposal, which received overwhelming support and was expected to dissolve the Welsh Parliament.
On the issue of rights for AMs, the Union Cabinet has been biased towards the Welsh Assembly Government or wealth management products, although the MWP has received the most support in a single referendum.
The health care industry has made other options, but it's hard to agree on one, and presumably the chairman of the board, Eileen Young, will be proposing a ban on drugs in a few weeks.
The relevant amendments included other changes to the functioning of the Assembly, the enactment of the disqualification of AMs and the drafting of the Union Cabinet Rules.
The medical examiner will decide the final choice and how they will be called when they go to trial.
Macedonian Republic votes to change the name of the country
The people voted on Thursday to decide whether to change the name to the Republic of North Macedonia.
This time, the vote is to settle a decades-old dispute with the neighboring country of Greece, which has its own Macedonian land.
Athens was long a strong ally of its northern neighbour, whose name often contradicted its territorial ambitions and hopes of European integration and participation in the Northern Hemisphere.
The Macedonian president, Gjorge Ivanov, who opposes the name change, said he would not vote this time.
However, the Democrats see it as a price for Prime Minister Zoran Zaev to change his name to European engagement and to participate in the Northern Alliance.
As the Harlem Struggle was playing in the church, the thundering of St. Martin's Church subsided.
Looking back on the history, the elder I spoke to said, "There are churches and synagogues everywhere".
Today, it's not.
He said it was understandable that the bar was gone.
He says that the way people interact socially has changed.
The wedding hall is no longer the neighborhood hotel where people come to stay all the time.
As for the temple, he said he was worried that the money from the sale of the property would not last as long as the managers had expected, and he said they would go back to where they started.
He said that the rooftop could still be used as a synagogue, but that it was occupied by people who did not want to cooperate with the extra security guards in the area.
The majority of the people who buy the building materials are white, so he's going to have to shut down the churches early, because there are so many people in the Shena government that can't be part of the churches.
Both churches were built in the Harlem area in the 1870s by white congregations before the city became a black colony. St. Martin's Church was built a decade later.
The first black health care union moved there in 1930.
A group of black people who were sitting next to me, they took over the building.
St. Martin's was taken over by a black congregation led by Rev. John Howard Johnson, who led a campaign to ban the sale of black people at 125 Main Street in the Harlem shopping district.
A major fire in 1939 severely damaged the structure, but when the villagers in the area of the Goto Hanshun Monastery planned to rebuild it, they commissioned the construction.
The Rev. David Johnson, heir to St. Marti's Church, proudly called the tea a poor man's drink.
To celebrate the seventh month, the sages used another story, a song of wisdom and a story that no one else could replace.
Tiffany Ng, a University of Michigan musicologist, continues to show that it was the first Chinese concert in the world to be staged by the great black musician Dionisio A. Lind, who 18 years ago moved the Lindi River Church to the largest Chinese concert hall.
Merriweather did not have St. Martin's Hospital as his place of residence.
In recent months, the concert at the Hong Kong Church has been the subject of a controversial story involving the producer and the contractor, some of which came from non-ecclesiastical officials, and some from within the Hong Kong church.
The regional synagogue union, the regional church administration, was asked to give up residence in July to the regional synagogue union leader, who was worried about the regional church in July.
Some of the people in the synagogue were shouting, "This is not the place to talk about the law.
In California, a 13-year-old boy was attacked by a giant squid while diving in to look for snakes.
Officials said a 13-year-old boy was injured on Friday when a giant fish attacked him while hunting for a snake.
The attack happened before 7 a.m. in the Encinitas lighthouse on the beach.
Chad Hammel told Santiago TV's KSwb that he and some friends went into the water for about half an hour on a Friday morning when he heard the boy's life-saving scream and pulled him out with a stranger.
And he thought that it was a sinful thing, and that he was merry; but when he heard that he was shouting, he bit me.
I was struck.
And when he came to the child, and saw him, he broke his bones.
And I cried to them, and said, Let them be removed from the water. And he said, Behold, there is a serpent in the water.
The baby was taken from the airport to the Children's Hospital in Leti, Hintakiya, in critical condition.
The species of the attack is still unknown.
The rescue team's commander, Lakhas, told a press conference: "We found a snake in this area a couple of weeks ago, but we decided it wasn't a dangerous snake.
Giles added that he had made a cut on the victim's stomach.
For safety and security reasons, the government closed the Swami Lake Road from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Ecinitas for 48 hours.
Giles has over 135 species of large mammals in the area, but most are considered to be not endangered.
Sennapoli has plans to take her to the British beauty market.
Sainsbury's competes with rats and water-dancing green puntae hunmu, and has arranged a multi-store style beauty routine with a team of expert assistants.
The Danish cosmetics market is worth $28 billion and despite the decline in traditional and domestic exports, the cosmetics market is still growing, as part of a larger push to expand the market. The large cosmetics kit will be tested in 11 markets in the Netherlands and, if successful, will be launched in many stores next year.
While the beauty store was looking for ways to use the space in the cartons, the space used to be used to sell televisions, windshields and furniture.
Sainsbury's is going to double its cosmetics base to 3,000 products, including a million-plus loose-leaf burgers and a billion-plus cider oils, and eat figs for the first time.
L'Orea, Maybelline, Burt's Bees, international brands like that, and shoe stores, they need more space.
The accounting market is still largely white-collar, and that's what a lot of younger consumers want.
In addition, the perfume company has been testing exclusive management rights from two stores in São Paulo, the first one opening in the upper floors of the Kelloe Tower in South London, and the second one opening this evening in the family-owned Cellia Oaks in Pomenhan.
The shift from shopping online to buying a few items at a local grocery store every day made it impossible for the grocery store to do much of the work.
The chief executive of Senapoli, Mike Cube, explained that the stores were like a box of goods because the direct accounting company was trying to counter the art and liter stores with products other than services and food.
Since the acquisition of the two stores two years ago, Sainsbury's has opened a few hundred stores in Acosymone and has expanded its presence in a number of markets, increasing its exports of raw food products and making it more profitable to buy.
All the cosmetic and chemical changes in front of this flea market are going to end in failure.
In the late 2000s, Sainsbury's had previously experimented with a salt and pepper mix, but the two ended their partnership after a dispute over how to divide the pharmaceutical company's accounting income.
Three years ago, Sainsbury's sold its 281-storey pharmacy business to Ten Hong, owner of the Lao-Ethiopian pharmaceutical company, for £125 million.
The company said it would leverage Lloyds' plans to expand its range of premium skincare products to four markets, including Louis-Paix and WWE.
Paulão Mircea Scaeges, chief business analyst for São Paulo, said: "We've changed the look and feel of the beauty industry to make it a better experience for our customers".
The people we're still training for will always be thinking.
Our brands are known for their unique, customized design, unpretentious atmosphere and convenience, and we are a beauty destination that attracts attention and competes with traditional shopping.
Peter Jones's speed and enthusiasm are stunned after Holly Willoughby pulls out of a £11 million sale
Hollywood's head of advertising, Holly Willoughby, has given up her lifestyle brand and £11 million contract with Marks and Spencer, a range of brands and a new ITV contract, and is furious at the small business in the city.
Willoughby doesn't have time to go to the actual showcase of his furniture and jewelry.
The business of these partners is modeled on Kevune's Goop brand.
On her 37th birthday this morning, her editor posted a picture on her wall announcing her retirement.
Holly Willoughby finally appears to have walked away from their lucrative lifestyle brand, and the angry Little Dragon star, Pete Jones, is now committed to a new risk-taking contract with the multi-brand ITV.
However, on Sunday, his business tycoon Mayor Pu'er was at a press conference where he was given the lead role of a television presenter named Golden Girl, and his new contract worth £1.5 million was signed, so he felt he had no time to attend their home dress and jewelry show.
The Cuns is modeled after Kevin Gunsfethelo's Goop brand, which is worth twice as much as Willow's £11 million fortune.
37-year-old Willoughby, who had her photo on the wall announcing that she was going to divorce, got on a small plane, gave up her English, and went to a restaurant.
Sources say this was something Holly had planned ahead of time.
That was his vision for the next few decades.
And she was cast out, and all that saw her were astonished.
No one believes what happened on Red Friday, and the announcement is so close.
Marlow has a warehouse full of ready-to-export goods.
Experts believe that the departure of the CEO of the newspaper this morning, one of the most influential bankers in Britain, could cost the company several hundred thousand dollars because the company spent a lot of money on furniture, lamps, clothing and furniture, and the leasing was still delayed.
This could be the end of a long-term romance.
Willoughby, a mother of three, and her husband Dan Baldwin, have been in a relationship with Tara Capp for about a decade.
Willoughby and Capp founded Shinli in 2016 and Ms. C, who turned 52, took over in March of this year.
The two families jointly own the company, and the younger one owns 40% of the television production company Potae Chun.
Willoughby became the flagship angel of the floral heraldry and replaced the British editor with ITV's I'm a Celebrity.
A reporter who spoke to Jones said that we don't comment on his business dealings.
A beautiful song and then we fell in love.
He's been working so hard to get the North Korean leader to accept that he's not the president because he's afraid that he's going to be criticized in the media for being a hypocrite.
Why is President Trump dropping so many of these?
Trump shouted, "The Lord is a mocking newscaster".
I didn't stop anything.
He wants to meet Kim again, and when they first met in Singapore, Trump took a big step toward denuclearizing North Korea.
But the sound counsel is turned into a false counsel.
More than three months after the Singapore summit ended in June, North Korea's top foreign minister, Ri Yong Ho, told world leaders at the United Nations on Friday that North Korea had not seen the same response to the US' previous military crackdown.
Instead, he keeps repressing and he keeps releasing.
Trump was more optimistic during his speech.
He said, "We have very good relations with North Korea".
We want to go to war with North Korea.
Millions of people may have been killed.
We have a good relationship now.
He said he had a very positive outcome in his efforts to improve relations with Kim, to finish the test of the flying saucer and help save lives, to bring the American troops back to the United States.
He still avoided the unusual way he talked about Kim.
Trump could easily be president by pointing fingers at the crowd in front of him, but instead of having all 10,000 people outside walk into the crowded pool, there were only 200 people standing there.
An island in the Indo-Pacific has been devastated by a tsunami, killing hundreds.
For example, after the earthquake in Lombok, the NGO said that foreign governments don't need them.
Lombok, which has a population of over 10 percent, has been left homeless, but has not been declared a national natural disaster, prompting international aid.
Sumbung has a very bad case, because they've been very clear that they don't expect international help, so this is a pretty good case.
A child support group has been formed and is on its way to Palu, but it is not yet clear if foreign workers will be allowed to work there.
The UN High Commissioner for Disaster Management, Mr. Sutopo, said that the authorities in Indonesia were evaluating the situation in Palu and were considering whether to allow him to participate in international aid operations.
Given the continuous earthquakes that have hit the country, the country has not been prepared for the great upheavals of its history.
Even though the Japanese built a dam on the river, it will not be seen for a long time on any other coast.
Despite the fact that the tsunami warning was effective, the lack of tsunami warning in Palu was a major cause of death and injury.
Under favorable conditions, there is a very strong competition for land between many of the Indo-Pacific islands.
Natural disasters have made transportation more complicated than ever.
A medical ship from Lombok Island is on its way to Palu, and there will be another one in three days.
The president of Indonesia, Joko Widodo, has said that improving the country's infrastructure will be a priority of his campaign and has invested heavily in roads and railways.
But the lack of funding is a problem for the government because he will continue to be in office next year.
President Joko is still under pressure from the era of increasingly violent Hinduism, with the Muslim majority of the population adopting a more conservative religion.
The Jesus of Moscow and the Mussolini papers, with their knives, bows and other non-lethal weapons, killed over 1,000 people in the streets and left tens of thousands homeless.

And the net turned toward the right side of the net, and the net fell upon the boards.
Finally, the shark, which was floating on the water, fell off the body and into the net.

A murder investigation has been launched after a woman's body was found in Birkenhead, Merseyside, this morning.

And the watchmen of the land shall come out, and the watchmen shall go out from the land, and shall say, What is this that ye have seen? and what is this that ye have heard?
Investigator Brian O'Hagan said that while the trial is still in its early stages, I hope anyone who has seen or heard anything suspicious near John Street in Birkenhead will contact us.
I'm for everyone, especially the gas engine buyer, and if they can get any information on the gas engine's inventory, contact us because they can get some important information on our test.
The body of the woman was found in a house in Ken Hatee, according to security officials.
Friends who knew her this evening thought she had left town and asked if she had been here all morning.
The tests are still going on, and the alarm is going to signal to the next of kin of the victim to talk.
Grayson Mew, a taxi driver in a cabin, was considered his workplace, but security told him no one was allowed on the roof.
When he realized what had happened, he could not keep quiet.

The statue of the Cromwell Council in Clonver is the latest piece of material in the process of rewriting history.
His purge followers, like the Taliban, destroyed much of British intellectual and religious knowledge. His poetic excess is justice.
The Cromwell coalition is a foolish attempt to rewrite history.
John Goldsmith, the head of the Cromwell Association, said that the statue of Oliver Cromwell, which was removed from Westminster Palace amid the debate over the statue's removal, could inevitably become a target of attack.
The act of destroying statues during the Civil War was neither ordered nor carried out by Cromwell.
Unfortunately, Cromwell may have died for his ancestor Thomas's actions centuries earlier.
William Hamo's dramatic performance of Cromwell is a testament to the 19th century vision that many still consider part of the historical legacy of Clonver.
Goldsmith told the Telegraph on Tuesday that if Cromwell had a lot of people, at the end of the 19th century, most people would have considered him the protector of the realm against outside pressure.
Is this an innocent conversation, or is this the subject of an ongoing historical debate?
One conclusion is that the mid-17th century breakdowns that shaped our civilization are the ones that made our country prosper again, and Clunvier is a man of character who is the opposite.
He deserves to be celebrated and remembered for his achievements in the Royal Guard.
A pig killer beat a Chinese farmer to death.
According to local news reports, a farmer was attacked and killed by a pig in a public square in southwest Taipei.
According to the South China Morning Post on Thursday, the man was found dead near the Liufanghui Square in Quzhou, where he was found dead, and his body was covered in blood.

And it came to pass when the word of the king's house was spread abroad, that the people of the city and the elders of the city took counsel together to avenge his life.
Although rare, there are many examples of pigs attacking humans.
In 2016, a pig from a farm in Masatsue-Siteu attacked a woman and her husband, seriously injuring them.
Ten years ago, a 650-pound pig got on a trailer of a farmer from Verhill, and his wife had to let it go.
In 2012, a farmer in Olektuwu whose pig ate his next 20th farm could be a catalyst for a Canadian radio news story about pigs that taste blood despite their constant hostility.
They're just playing a game.
They are small and feeble, and wonderfully small, and they do not touch thee.

On Friday, more than 20 million people watched on six television networks the remarkable testimony of Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh and his rape claimant Christine Blasey Ford, who claimed Kavanaugh had raped her in the 1980s.

It's more obvious than ever that the idea of a moderate is intolerable and that each view is acceptable to the leadership.
This started shortly after Chelimus took over, because my colleagues expected me to set a 180-degree line and take a position that I would not necessarily agree with on issues of national security or the European wedding market, which I had the same political views as they had before me.
When I speak publicly, I say, "It doesn't matter what I say, I'm going to say a lot of things that are ridiculous about the social fabric of the country, that will destroy the candidate, that will destroy the middle class, that will not be part of my decision-making process".
And this is not just my experience.
Indeed, I boast more than the majority of my countrymen - though I am counted among them by no means.
I pray for the courage and perseverance of my colleagues on the front lines who are daily dealing with discrimination against women and racism.
Perhaps the most compelling aspect of this era is how commonplace the rate of torture has become.
Chely McCorpin said that the upper-class design should foster a sense of forgiveness.
The fact is that every time we have a memory that we don't believe in the great church or that our voting system changes, our political will weakens.
I've had a lot of thoughts in the last two years that have encouraged me to be humble, and don't get too proud, but I'm okay with that.
But that's not my intention in politics.
32 years ago, I was still a junior in high school, and I was in the middle of a construction project, and my school collapsed because the government ignored me, and that really pissed me off, and ever since then, I've been trying to do the best job I can for the three most vulnerable public servants, whether they're local councillors or public servants.
I have not hidden my political views, including my first election.
No one in Nottingham East has ever been caught in the crossfire between my political opposition and the current leadership.
To the man who proposed this proposal on Thursday, I want to say that I don't see why I should waste time and energy on my president's confidence in trying to get the Dutch out of Europe, which could be harmful to our families and our communities and our jobs.
The message I have to deliver is that I am proud to serve you, my constituents, whether they are forced or not, whether they are part of the fabric of the Nottinghams, and I will not be deterred from doing what is in your best interest and in the best way possible, no matter how hard I try to do it in the face of the threats and the risks of the election.

The final two attempts had a certain impact on the outcome, but Ayr was not in any doubt that he would win this race.
They're now at the top of the list of the top 10 teams in the world, the only team that hasn't lost a game in the last decade.
Finally, the guard of their glory and the best opportunity to win the main squad, the leader of the fight Festus deserves to be proud.
I said, I will rejoice, I will be glad; I will be tested, I will be ashamed, I will not be ashamed.
And the thing that's really commendable about them is that they're able to take chances better than we can.
Antisense entered the 14th star trophy with the help of Chloë-Alexandria, who gave him the lead, but the yellow ribbon won by Louis Louis, the commander of the squadron at Suikhlain, gave Merle a chance to win, but Chloë-Cathé missed the podium.
Kleo said that he had the advantage of a year ahead of Er, so he entered the year before the first lap ended, and then went 17-5 at the halftime break.
But in the next round, Mayerlows was better, and Pat Keith changed the test of Telik Antennes to reduce the height to five stars.
Afterwards, Luiz Roteiro Notte was seriously injured and was able to take the lead with the help of Celico, who had been tested by the race leader Eure Stéphane-Houghté-Michelot.
Under the pressure of the Polish army commander, Eyr, who later became a yellow vassal, Merlos again expanded his forces by attempting to convert Paul Corvo.
However, the main force was defeated and Sithyudhu Hachinsing stopped off the line of scrimmage outside the line of scrimmage and gave a yellow flag, while Mikhi Hosing fell to the ground behind Earamore, who was pushing forward.
And he turned, and took the staff of Taveh-Amuzoth, from Keiar-Lo, and brought it back five times, and smote it against the door, and smote it upon the door.

The flag of the city is blue.
From the mouth of the ancient sea, to all the ports of the river of Yamuna, the sea is our master.
It's a responsibility to find it.
Just as the arid central country of Bolivia in the 19th century, faced with a source of blood, Chile has lost its sense of the sea, and its desire to find peace in the great ocean.
The hopes are probably the highest in decades, as Sheena Boliviana is awaiting a verdict on October 1st after five years of proceedings at the International Criminal Court.
Let the Bolivian Foreign Minister, Lufo Taratati, take a look at the Bolivian progress, the unity, the strength, the courage and the hope, and let it be fruitful.
Bolivia is watching the International Tribunal's verdict on a large screen in the national capital, where the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea has been trying to find Bolivia's interest after decades of intermittent negotiations, and finally a negotiation that has the right to give up control of Bolivia.
The fate of Bolivia's most glamorous region could be further complicated by a ruling on Thursday that will see his former prisoner, Evo Morales, play a role in the controversial election campaign.
And he said, In the eighth month, at the end of the month, when we are at the end of the sea,
But the International Criminal Court, based on its own judgement, cannot decide whether or not it is in the best interest of Bolivar, and even if it did, it would not change anything.
The governor-general was not authorized to grant land to Chile under the United Nations Charter in the Netherlands and was not allowed to decide the outcome of the negotiations.
The Chilean expert in international law Fajesa Salata points out that the International Court's decision came six months after the final hearing, which means the case is not complicated.
And it's not just about pushing the boundaries of what Levi's has done over the past year, it's about making it more and more interesting.
The issue of access to the sea is being taken over by the current government of Libya.
He had softened her remaining spirits with his enthusiastic remarks about the Lacey battle.
Bolivia and Chile will continue to negotiate for a while, but after that, it's very difficult to negotiate.
No ambassadors have been sent between the two countries since 1962.
The Bolivian deputy of the Haia, Aite Hatoatoato, has denied that the court has decided the case too quickly.
He will give Bolivar an extraordinary opportunity to usher in a new era of Chilean relations by January, ending the 139 years of hostility between the two countries.
From Carty's point of view, Ms. Lacy was not only one of the most popular prisoners in the island of Tinguely, but also a potential solution to the maritime issue.
Bolivia vowed never to give up its right to lead peace on the oceans.
For the day of vengeance is come, let us lift up our hand against the wicked.
North Korea can only be nuclear-weapon-free if it can trust the United States.
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho said that if North Korea did not believe in Gaeta Wongton, it would not have destroyed its nuclear arsenal first.
Ri was speaking at the United Nations General Assembly on Friday.
He called on the United States to implement the commitments made at the summit of the two leaders in Singapore.
His comments came from the United States, where Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Singapore and North Korea are beginning to resume a self-imposed bilateral relationship after more than three months of contacts with Kim Jong Un.
Ri said it was a nightmare that continued trade sanctions and US propaganda against ending the North Korean war could lead to North Korea's collapse.
Washington should take this message seriously before the North Korean capital Pyongyang takes any significant steps to reduce its troops.
Kim Jong-un and the United States, both in the US, hope that Trump will win a second term
Outside, the castle was a general fear of the arsenal of weapons and the public saw it as a way to ensure their safety.
Pompeo is scheduled to travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second Kim-Trump summit.
The Paris Fashion Show is showing off the latest in a series of massive headbands and styles that are taking over the business streets near you.
If thou say, I would that thy skin were warm, and that the sun should shine upon thee, look not after it.
Fashion designers Valentino and Tom Browne unveiled a unique SS19 headpiece on a T-shirt, which surprised fashion industry figures on the Parisian fashion show.
In the summer, they're covered in a stack of unreal images, and these designers show them on a T-shirt, and they make people see the amazing innovation.
One of Valentino's most notable works is a white-and-white-blue painted rose with a bird-like shape, a wide-brimmed hat, and a body-like head.
And in the midst of the great ornament are the jewels of the pearl, and the bracelets of the calf, and the bowls of the ram; but they are not for warmth.
Thom Browne still has a very interesting face that he's showing up for Halloween.
And the face of the man was covered with a veil, and his face was like a sackcloth, and his face was like a garment.
It's a piece that's like a waterproofing device with a windshield and glasses, and it's like a sweet, fresh ice cream after another piece.
If you keep up this great tradition, you're very lucky.
As the weather forecasts suggest, these large bumps can happen in the street near you.
After the oversized hair became popular, Rihanna saw Emily Ratajkowski and previously two other oversized haircuts.
The disposable diaper has become a social media phenomenon, and the logo on the back of the diaper has been so popular that it's gotten another big diaper on the T-shirt, not a swimsuit like a snowmobile.
The green lacquered lace, with the ornamentation of lacquered silk and the base of white leather wool, was the most popular item on the Levi's SS19 line of luxury clothing in the spring and early summer of 1919.
The ice sculptor, Luc Ameitich, is still working on his daily snowmobile, but next summer he will be able to see the desert roads that are so wet and wet because of the pressure of the ice, that it is difficult to ignore the need for rain gloves.
John Edward: Language skills are incredibly important to a comprehensive democracy.
The independent schools of Sugan have a record of academic achievement, which was maintained in 2018 and has been achieved with a number of first and second place results, individual and collective achievements in physical education, artistic activities and community activities.
The schools, which are regulated by the Scottish Independent Schools Authority (SCIS), have over 30,000 pupils in their schools in the Suffolk area and are committed to providing the best possible service to students and their families.
The purpose of private schools is to prepare students for higher education, relevant professions, and full-fledged civil service.
As a classroom that can design and implement the school curriculum, we see that modern language continues to be the primary and the preferred subject of the school curriculum.
Nelson Mandela once said, "If you talk to someone in a language they can understand, they will listen".
If thou make signs to him with thy tongue, and make him to be moved,
This is a powerful reminder that we should not rely on English alone to build relationships and trust with people in other countries.
And among the most recent survey results this year, we see that language is the most common language in schools, and it's ranked number one.
Among the foreign language courses, 68% of the graduates received A grades.
The data collected from 74 schools showed that 72% of students achieved A's in English, and A's in German, French and Spanish, with 72% and 69% respectively.
This Scottish private school is supporting foreign languages as a key skill for future children and young people.
Language is now a subject in private schools and other places, and STEM science and technology, schools and maths are treated equally.
A 2014 study by the Danish Ministry of Labour and Technology found that 17% of the reasons for the difficulty of filling a job vacancy given by employers was a lack of language skills.
So language skills are becoming a necessary condition for young people to prepare for their future careers.
And as more and more people engage in the conversation, these skills are becoming increasingly important in a more inclusive world.
Whatever profession people choose, if they know a foreign language, they have a real advantage in the future because they have this life skill.
Whatever a person chooses to do for a career, if they know a second language, it can be a real asset to have this lifelong skill in the future.
A 2013 YouGov survey of more than 4,000 Germans found that 75% of Germans spoke no foreign language, were unable to communicate, and French was the second most common monolingual language, compared to 15%.
This is why it's so important to stop teaching languages to kids today.
If he learns many languages, especially the languages of a developing country, he will find a lot more meaningful work.
In Scotland, language instruction varies from school to school.
Some schools are more focused on modern languages than ever before, while other schools are looking to English as the top language by 2020, such as Mandarin or Urdu.
No matter what your child's interests are, there are many languages to choose from in their home school, and all kinds of teachers are experts in this field.
We are working to create a learning environment in private schools in Scotland that will not only make the future better for the children but also give them the skills to prepare them for success.
In the current globalized business environment, languages are as important to the future of a nation as they have ever been, and they should be taught.
In fact, modern languages really need to be considered as a global expansion skill.
Independent schools in Scotland continue to offer young people a choice that is naturally diverse and inclusive.
And thou shalt do it, and it shall be very good.
John Edward is the headmaster of a private school in Scotland.

When is Trump's rally tonight in Chiang Mai? How to watch online
Trump's Wheeling meeting is scheduled for 7:00 p.m. this evening, Friday, September 29, 2018.
You can watch the rally of Theron Fuchai Ho Chien Yat-Tao live on YouTube.
Trump may address the Supreme Court hearing this week, but the rigorous national security review predicts that the Senate vote will be delayed by a week and the hearing will be delayed by the impeachment hearing, which is being overshadowed by the impeachment proceedings.
The main purpose of these meetings is to help build momentum in the November general election leading up to the federal election.
So according to a report by the Lutu News Agency, the short-term Trump campaign aims to hold five meetings next Friday to target and target supporters because the coalition is trying to maintain and expand its majority in the upper and lower houses.
A spokesman for the Trump campaign, who declined to be named, said the administration needed to control the process and that it would try to make as many short cuts as possible during the hectic election cycle.
The news spread throughout the city of Chiang Mai, China. The evening event was scheduled for the Wuling West Spanish Rally, and there were supporters from Uheyuan and Pinhai Huang Qiaoyu, who may have been the news anchors for the Fishio-Manga.
Theronfu said he had met with Chiang Kai-shek for the second time in the past month, after he won the title in 2016 with a score of more than 40 percent.
Deng Xiaoping was supposed to help his father Telique-Molissi, who was a candidate for the Democratic Party nomination in the Sichuan Province, in the presidential election.

When Sophists made the deal that day, they had six stars and now they have four, so I think this is a little bit of a stretch.
Europe has a good lead, but they're still four minutes ahead of the 12th place.
Arius wants them to make some progress, and they have a lot of encouragement, especially Sphinx and Chastim Thomas, who have been fighting all day and everybody is so proud of their three-star results.
From the lamp-stand to the goliath, she met life, and she showed other examples.
As the match progressed, the rivalry grew stronger and stronger, and under the circumstances of his and Thomas's defeat, he tied the fourth game with a shot from a rebound.
He shouted the same thing at them on the day of the race, the day he won, and he said, "I'm going to tell you that I'm totally confident in the United States".
Syphys, you really need to cry deeply and worry about your competition.
The former days are past, they are past.
And the shepherds of the people were eighteen asses, that kept watch over the people.
In the last two days, the only stars to pass Siphis and Thomas are Molina Lee and Juliette Vouet, and this is an undeniable story for Lightfoot.

The only thing that comes out of the hole is the moolivute on Friday night, but they have to put the hole in the bottom nine holes on Friday morning, and on Thursday night, and on Thursday morning.
Their appearance, their strength melted in the midst of the crowd, and they proved to be the heroes who defeated the sun. When the sun set on the plains of Corfu, the heroes of the Kingdom of Corfu, who were welcomed by Huguelete Teute or Molinae, secured the invisible victory of Europe.

So far, it's been great to see the European teams come out as a team, and they've had a great lead going into the final day of the race, but this time, even in a four-man event, the Americans have some guys, and especially the Americans, who are in the top three, they have a very strong defensive position.

Li Yong-ho urged the UN General Assembly to take the important positive steps that China has taken in the past year, such as halting nuclear testing and missile launches, dismantling nuclear testing facilities, and halting the spread of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology.
He said, "But we're not seeing any response from the United States".
If America doesn't have confidence, we can't have confidence in our national security, and we can't get ahead of ourselves in eliminating violence.
Felien re-announces the known method of de-cloaking the time-series that Chao-Chang had blocked in Hong Kong. Although this method was rewarded for Chao-Chang's gradual progress, his statement seems to be significant because it refuses to change the determination to de-cloak the time-series as it had been in the past.
On June 12, during a joint statement by Qin Shi Huang and Theron Phuc at a meeting of the Chinese and Chinese leaders in Singapore, Qin Shi Huang pledged to work towards denuclearization of the Chao Phraya Peninsula and pledged to take full responsibility for the security of the Chao Phraya Peninsula.

The idea that the ban can make us fail is the idea of a thousand people we don't know.
North Korea has not announced any plans for a second North Korean-Maldivian-Tunisian summit, and the US leader insisted on the plan at the United Nations this week.
Putin, on the other hand, insisted that Kim Jong Un and Hong Kong leader Wenceslas Dumas had held three meetings in the past five months, and that if the issue of denuclearization had been about Hong Kong and not the United States, it would not have been a case of halving the number of nuclear weapons in the Korean Peninsula.
However, the tone of Yongho's pro-international speech was very different from Naning's speech at the United Nations. When the UN's most harsh commentator, Theron Fu, called Qing Ying a suicide bomber, it was impossible for the US to be targeted by the Chinese bomber.
This year, the United Nations is praising the courage of Theron Fuyi Qinchangir, who has threatened to destroy Nanjing Chao, for taking steps to make it less violent, but he still has a lot of work to do and he must be stopped and the Chao-Changin must be stopped without weapons.
And, in particular, Theronphus says that he doesn't have a time frame, so it doesn't matter if he needs two years or three years or five months.
The United Nations and the Security Council should give credit to the actions of the Congolese people.
But US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told the United Nations that the Security Council's announcement on Friday was that we must continue to enforce the Security Council's sanctions vigorously to ensure that we are fully and ultimately nuclear-free, that we are fully and ultimately investigative.
Since 2006, the security agencies have tightened their controls on the use of the rocket and have banned the production of and funding of the rocket-propelled grenade.
Pompeo met with Li Yonghao while in the United Nations, and said he would meet again in Beijing next month to plan a second summit.

Professor Hajo has introduced a new course this year that will give physics students more sleep than they ever had before, and it's based on the bravery of the men who spend all night studying to push through the cocktail.
When a scientist talks about how to take care of yourself in the most important school in the world, it's not usually a big deal.
Dr. Charles S. Snell, a professor of sleep pathology at the Haas School of Medicine and a clinical associate at the Poole Lake Women's Hospital, said the study was the first of its kind in the United States.
He talked about the impact of sleep deprivation on learning, and the class was open.
And at the end of the class, one girl came up to me and said, "Why did I have to do this when I was in fourth grade?"
He told me that he would write to me every day in his e-mail, and she would tell me that she never told him how important sleep was, which was a little bit surprising.
This study was first published this year, and it showed students how a good sleep schedule can improve their academic and physical performance, and also improve their overall health.
The school's health service administrator, Turenne Paulou-Palle, a professor of psychiatry at the Haute-Technologie Institute, said that after learning of a student's sleeping disorder, the school decided to make the class more popular.
This one-hour class is about the complex and progressive role of collaboration.
It was part of a bedroom design where students would tap on a glass cup, a sheet of glass, exercise equipment, books, and feel the effects of the sun, the effects of light, the effects of sleep and movement, and the importance of the routine before the day.
Participants in the other group reported a higher risk of prolonged sleep deprivation, heart disease, colds, diarrhea, and hair loss.
And then a school map with a pattern of patterns encouraged them to think about their daily routines.
We know that this isn't going to change behavior overnight.
The elderly Moab Sele will keep quiet, but we believe she has the right to know, and to choose, just as the forces of goodness do.
He said that the wisdom of the glorious night is still there, and that the pressures of modern technology and the ever-increasing demands of students make it harder to sleep every day.
He says that lack of quality sleep is the secret weapon against school stress, fatigue, and stress, and to prevent weight gain, because sleep deprivation is a constant hunger-thirst effect that makes people feel thirsty.
At the age of 19, Lemong Teso was a student of Château's work on evolution and physical physics, and he took a class at the University of Haikou with the great professor Sleigh, who helped him design the class.
He said that this class has broadened its vision and has a greater enthusiasm to encourage the classroom in all schools.
He hopes that in the next step, all of his research students will have the same quality of education as before they went to the most competitive schools.
The teacher, Mobsley, advises students to be alert when to fall asleep and when to wake up, to be aware of the negative effects of the light from the mirrors and LEDs that can disrupt your day and night.
Levenstoun 1-0 in the first round, and the A's entered the championship and defeated the Celtics in the semifinals.
The teams met again in a friendly match in the spring, and Tuolumne Muncha entered the season as champions, defeating Levenston 1-0 in the final.
The Puckers were hoping to win their first race since the February 4-1 loss to the Yankees, but the Chalkehorst team lost their second race of 18 races to the lead, eight points behind the Rams.
Seven stars before the first step, I'm entering a new year and I'm not strong enough to learn the muscles of the crowd.
The sixth division is now down, and the third from Levenstown is like the men from Sippoli.
The muscles in the back may have been more involved because Chameleon suffered a head injury that was not treatable because something was obviously moving from the front.
Chelatte improved eight times in the league and helped the team to secure a place in the final against Pepe Puleteta.
Holt, on the other hand, said that the bronze-eleven Levi was happy that he had lost a star in the top flight and that he was able to hold his breath in the bronze he had trained him to do.
The big ones may be able to control the flies, but Levenstown is more than that.
They were to sail to the island two days later, because Minko had forgotten to let Phytymna into the island of Michiellekis, but she missed this opportunity.
Keaghan Jacobs passed it to captain Craig Halkett last year, but his assistant goalkeeper Alan Lithgow threw it back to the goal last year.
The Rangers are able to take over the overall situation, but they're more hopeful about playing in the three-point contest.
Alfredo Morelos wanted him to get a quarter of an hour because he and Steven Lawless had met in the pit, but the score was tied by Steven Thomson to the Colombian's price.
The Rangers had only two shots in the first round, but it looked like the previous year's starting goalie Liam Kelly and Ovie Ejaria hadn't had any regular-season blocking shots.
Livi's opening 34-star record was a huge boost to the competition, but no one could deny it, and they deserved it.
The Rangers were once again unable to match Jacobs' deep game.
When Declan Gallagher gave the lead to Scott Robinson, Scott Arfield nodded, and he was so excited that he gave the lead to Menga to finish.
Gerrard's performance was perhaps enhanced during the halftime break when Coulibaly replaced Ryan Kent, who was stopped by Kelly, who had been running from the finish line, after a scratch in the Morelos line.
But Livingston continued to bring the visitors into the contest, and Lithgow and Halkett passed the ball one by one.
Holt was able to extend his lead in the final seconds before Lithgow scored a late penalty, and McGregor stood up and successfully stopped Jacobs' attack.
Rangers' outfielder Glenn Middleton fought Jacobs in the final minute, raising the prospect of another penalty, but Thomson fired another eyeball.
He invented the Geiger counter.
Today in our calendar, a Thursday morning, September 30, 1882, 136 years ago today, the futurist realist Johannes Wilhelm "Hans" Geige was born in Germany.
Geiger invented a method of measuring the delay, and this innovation eventually led to the invention of a device called the Geiger counter.
Computers have since become a mainstay of science, and a lifeblood of popular science, as seen in the 1950 film "The Sound of the Coronado", starring the unlikely scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans.
Where is the man?
Rogers: This is a Geiger counter that can detect the presence of fragile minerals, like iron ore.
When you put these on, you can actually hear the vibration of the particles in the jewelry.
Evans: "It's really burning now".
Hans "Hans" Geiger died in 1945, not quite a day after his 63rd birthday.
But the invention that bears his name became famous.
A new influenza vaccine shows that the body's immune system can detect body changes by moving its finger to the palm of the hand.
The new polio vaccine will allow your immune system to detect and kill your parasites by pointing your finger at your hand.
As part of treatment, the use of vaccines to isolate the antibodies from the vaccine can be used to isolate the antibodies.
It's about taking antibodies from a patient's body and making them in the lab.
Then they can get a lot of fruit from the white clouds that are in the clouds and then they can get vaccinated again.
An experimental vaccine has shown positive results in patients with high levels of hair loss.
If a woman who has been receiving treatment with an antibody is unable to produce hair for more than 18 months, the vaccine can help her identify abnormal antibodies.
This involves taking antibodies from a patient's body, converting them in the laboratory, and then making a white speck called HER2 visible to the patient, and then putting them back into the body.
Jay Berzofsk, a professor at the National Anemia Research Center in Bethesda, Maryland, said, "Our results show that we have a vaccine that is very promising".
As explained by Berzofsky, HER2 induces certain types of fruit production, including breast, egg, and egg production.
The same techniques that teach people how to take antibodies from the patient's body and throw them at the fruit cells have been shown to be effective in treating leukemia.
Kanye West came out of the closet on Friday night and punched a Trump supporter in a MAGA mask.
Do not do things in a hurry.
After a performance in praise of America, Kanye West was told on a showcase call on Friday night that he did not want to be on the show, and President Donald Trump said he would run for president in 2020.
After performing the third song of the night, he wore a top hat from one of America's greatest pantyhose makers and kept shouting at the Democratic Congress, reiterating his support for Trump.
I've talked to white people a lot, and they've said, "How do you like Trump?"
He said, "Well, if I'm worried about racism, I've already moved out of the United States".
"Friday Night Live" opens with a short drama directed by Matt Damon in which a Hollywood celebrity mocks Brett Kavanaugh's testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee's sexual harassment complaint against Christine Blasey.
Although it was not broadcast, the clip of West's scream was posted on the social networking site by comedian Chris Rock.
At first glance, it is unknown if Lokku intended to use this invitation to mock West.
West, however, still frowned, and he leaned back, his head hurting.
They're mocking me in the back.
They told me to wear the veil and not go out.
They did everything they could for me.
According to the Washington Observer, he said that they were at a point where I was going to sink.
West goes on to say, "Would you like to go see where you're going to go?" He says, "He's going to wear my moonshine because you won't listen to me tell you what to do".
Be joyful in your daily life.
And look at this guy, he's got a story to tell the media, he's got a story to tell in the art magazine, and at the end of his speech, the audience screams twice, and it's like, "Friday Night Live" is a real show, and it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very
West is the heir of singer Ariana Grande, whose former partner Mac Miller died a few days before her.
West took the song "I Love It When I Spilled Water on a Sand Pebble" and it really got a lot of people hooked.
Candace Turner wrote on Twitter that the TPUSA was supported by the armed forces and thanked a proud spirit for courageously committing to the people.
But Karen Hunter, the talk show host, tweeted that West was doing what he was doing, and it was great.
But I don't pay them, and I see that by wearing a bra and a bow (supporting her art through her singing and buying drums) I'm undermining the social order.
He is freedom.
"We're all the same", she whispers.
Before the show started, the singer announced on Twitter that he had changed his name to Kanye West.
He was not the first artist to change his name, following in the footsteps of Diddy, who was known as Puff Daddy, Puffy and P Diddy.
Other musicians have used the name Snoop Dogg before Snoop Lion, and the name Prince has been changed to a trademark for the artist.
The Belfast restaurant shooting was a conviction for attempted murder.
On Thursday, a 45-year-old man was charged with attempted murder after he stabbed a man in a restaurant in east Belfast.
Security officials say the incident originated in Ballyhackamore.
The application is expected to be heard at Belfast County Court in February.
These accusations will be investigated by the investigation laboratory.
Game of Thrones star Kit Harington slaps the courage of a man who was poisoned
Kit Harington is best known for his role as Jon Snow in the medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones.
But the 31-year-old actor has struck a chord with the heroic masculinity of the characters, saying that they are the kind of characters that the young boys of youth always hope to see on the screen, that they will be respected if they are violent.
Kit told The Sunday Times Culture that he is concerned about how to deal with the effects of #MeToo on toxic male decline in the 21st century.
Kit also recently announced his engagement to Rose Leslie, the actress of Game of Thrones, who recently turned 31, and said he was very excited to have the decision made.
He said, "I was very upset, what happened to our man's courage?"
Now, in terms of what we're seeing, what have we taught them in the process of growing up?
Kit felt that, as a very masculine character in the industry, television must play a role in encouraging toxic masculinity.
And he said, What is the matter with thee? and what is the matter with thee?
What is it that is taught in the advertisements and on the streets that young people should grow up?
I think this is the biggest issue of our time, how do we change?
Because it's pretty obvious. It's the young people that matter.
He said in an interview that when Game of Thrones ends next summer, he's probably not going to direct any more books before the end of Game of Thrones, and he said he's lost his footing on the field and his horse.
Starting in November, Kit will star in Sam Shepard's new film True West, which tells the story of a filmmaker and his cousin.
The actor recently said that meeting his wife Rose was the best thing that happened to him on Game of Thrones.
So he said, "It was in this class that I met my wife, and that this would give me a future family and a better life".
The Emmy Award-winning dramedy, starring Rose as Ygritte and Kit as Jon Snow, begins their romance.
The couple married in June 2018 at Leslie's family estate in Scotland.
HIV/Aids: 14% increase in new cases reported in KONGO
The report also reported a 14% increase in rat poisoning and rat poisoning.
One health official said that more than 820,000 people nationwide were affected.
In the first quarter of 2018, there were 40,000 new cases reported.
Most of the new cases of STDs start with sexual activity, so that's a change from what we had before.
The normal, toxic rat poison quickly spread through the bloodstream to parts of Taipei.
But a health official in Taiwan told a conference on a farm in Yunnan that the number of cases of E. coli in the family had dropped to a record low.
But there were 100,000 more cases of rat poisoning in Taipei and 100,000 more cases of rat poisoning in Nanjing compared to the same period last year.
In the Klang community, the transmission of HIV through the bloodstream is a major problem.
In 1997, he was convicted of unlawful sexual intercourse in China, but said he had too much contempt for homosexuals.
Because of their self-righteous values, studies estimate that 70% to 90% of men who have sex with men end up marrying a woman.
Many diseases are caused by good people who maintain the natural balance between these relationships.
Since 2003, the Taipei government has been promoting the spread of rat poisoning and has vowed to address the issue.
Maxine Waters denies the leak of her staff's Senate files, including a series of horrific lies and cover stories.
U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Maxine Waters on Friday criticized a person in her office for leaking the personal information of three U.S. Senate members to Wikipedia.
The Democratic candidate from Los Angeles called these comments "right-wing, clever, and online".
Waters tweeted that the most common lies to be told are lies, lies, and even more lies.
According to the press release, the family residence and address of the US government officials are Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and Sen. Mike Lee and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.
These messages came online on Friday, and were made public by a low-profile person during a impeachment hearing when evidence was released by a Senate committee complaining of improper behavior by Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh.
This was dropped after three consultants questioned Kavanaugh.
According to a report by the Hill, some of the most popular websites, such as GatewayPundit and RedState, have reported that the IP addresses used to identify the source of the data are associated with the WHSR government, and a WHSR official has also published a statement.
Waters goes on to say that the accusation, which has no basis in fact, is a false claim and a lie.
He said that my work, my human rights, my privacy, were all compromised by the fraudulent and false claims that they made, and they have no responsibility to publish these messages.
To accuse someone without any basis is to accuse him of being wrong and untruthful.
Wrote's announcement was quickly criticized online, including by former White House press secretary Ali Khullah.
Fleischer's refusal to accept the offer provoked outrage.
This was not enough to make her a national hero.
Let him not be angry, because of the man that murmureth against his own cause.
Let no man be in their paths; let no man be in their paths.
Let them not be afraid of the voice of the mighty.
And thou shalt make thy heart to bow down, and thy neck to bow down.
Fleischer compared Hallam Waters's position to the Democratic criticism of Kavanaugh, who was accused of expressing anger at the Friday hearing.
Omar Navarro, the Communist Party's presidential candidate, also shared his thoughts on Twitter.
"That's right", he tweeted.
In a statement, Waters' office urged relevant authorities and law enforcement to address these inherent challenges to fraud.
He said that we will take responsibility for bringing the perpetrators to justice, and they will take responsibility for their actions, and that these actions, if they speak for me or for the whole of society, are destructive and dangerous.
Johnny English Strikes Again: Rowan Atkinson's violent response to underestimating his own strength
It's a traditional way to get out of the job market in the midst of a new movie that's coming to Japan, and it's a process that started in 2003 when Johnny English was born and then again in 2011 when Johnny English was born.
Shall we be driven out of the land, when we have mocked the Lord, and have made ourselves a reproach, by our open talk?
It's as if Johnny English, with his spectacular glasses and his uncanny face, had a second signature on his driver's license, and his name, more than anything else, was a portrait of him, painted by a fan of non-English films.
He's a stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid,
He was the first to portray Atkinson's once-forgotten Barclaycard advertising campaign as a serious and international mystery, with its violent imagery.
In this new version, one or two lines are good.
I was wearing a Johnny English medieval dance costume and I flew right by a plane and I loved the way the wings hit his head in a short time.
Atkinson has shown a great deal of masculine intelligence, but his sense of wonder is weak and overblown, especially in the context of his belief in the supernatural, which he has used to create his own entertainment, such as 007 and the Secret Agent.
As if this sense of humor were intended for children rather than drama, I think the wonder of Johnny English is that he's not as innovative or as important as the trickster character that Atkins played in the silent film.
The topic of current debate is the current crisis in the Internet.
A black web host hacks into a British spy network, exposes the rights of all British spies abroad, and is disillusioned by what he does. This is a small person who should be disillusioned, as Kevin Eldon himself says.
In a reference to a shaky, desperate head of state, this is his final outcome, and his political career has been a disaster. Emma Thompson says that Theresa May's character has done her best, but she doesn't use much of the material in the play.
And when she asked him a secret, he told her; and she could not rest till the secret was discovered.
This is the idiotic Johnny English himself, who invites the headmaster of a now-thriving agency to give a public lecture on how to be a shrewd person. Johnny English has a shrewd school of shrewdness.
English is back in Whitehall for a publicity stunt, and a reunion of a longtime childhood friend, Bough, hosted by Ben Mille.
Bough is a guy who's married now to a submarine designer, and this is a funny character that Vicki has kind of thrown out of the picture.
So Batman and Robin, who are entangled in the Queen's special mission, start moving again, and Olga Kurylenko meets the beautiful mother of the serpent Ohia Hyoyo-pletova.
And at the same time, the Prime Minister is being controlled by a wealthy, fascinating scientist who can take control of British computer affairs at a dangerously high cost, and that's the villain Jason Volta played by Jake Lacy.
The Dutch, who had set out on their own ill-fated and arduous expedition, set fire to a French restaurant near the glacier, set a riot, and then boarded a Dutch luxury ship, using a real mask designed by the Dutch to gain access to the interior of the Huta House, a form of anarchy.
And finally, it's a whole body of energy, but it's a soft, visceral, but also a full-on, childish television taste.
It's a very peaceful thing.
Like many of John's English films, I don't think the Dutch film industry should allow Lowan Athenchen to play a role that shows his true potential.
Don't deny that the worker has a plan. How many days a week do you work, but you get paid five days a week?
The Labour Party, led by Jeremy Corbyn, is considering a plan to strike in Britain, where a car is forced to work four days for five days' pay.
According to the announcement, the government hopes to provide the Qinghai masters with AI innovation through low-cost investments, allowing them to rest for a day.
And to give three days' rest, and three days' rest, and the same hire, and the same wages,
It is reported that the idea is consistent with the Thai economic policy and is aimed at the benefit of the country's manufacturing sector.
The British Council of Industry has been supporting the shift from a Thursday to a Thursday work week as a way for manufacturers to take advantage of the economic shift.
A senior Labour Party official told The Sunday Times that he predicted a presidential election would be announced by the end of the year.
He said it's not something that happens in a day, but that working four days a week is a hope and it's in line with the organization's commitment to rebuilding the economy and the organization's commitment to the whole-of-work movement.
Labour did not want to be the Labour Party that supported the idea, and the Labour Party committed to four working days a week on Fridays during the 2017 election.
However, this hope was not initially supported by the entire Labour Party.
The representatives of the trade union movement said that working four days a week was not the policy of the party, and the party itself did not consider it.
Prime Minister John McDonnell, through the Labour Party Congress of the previous week, made his attempt to reform the economy into a socialist one a detailed one.
Mr. McDonnell said he was determined to take the power of the Public Works Commission away from the anonymous executives and tax collectors.
The Prime Minister's plan was to remove all the legs of the original bronze footwear because the government could be stripped of them based on obvious dishonesty.
He also testified that he had joined the board of directors of the British company, which had been planning to set up a trust fund to pay for the 10% of the British company's copper production, with a maximum annual profit of £500.
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about 60 minutes of the United Nations testing, and can it change their minds about the coronavirus test?
A joint investigation found that the impeachment of Judge Brett Kavanaugh and his final nomination to the Supreme Court were delayed at least one hour because the investigation raised the question of whether any federal counsel would be forced to withdraw their endorsement.
In an interview shown on Thursday, "60 Stars" reporter Scott Pelley asked the Federalist candidate, John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham, if the FBI had found anything that would change their minds.
Kennedy was a lot more conservative than his colleague from South Carolina.
Kennedy said, "I'm talking about the year".
I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh at the hearing.
And it came to pass when these things were done, that I called to him, and said, What doest thou?
He was determined, and he was determined, not just to pay the tax.
But it's like Graham's ball was thrown.
He said, "I've decided that I want to appeal Brett Kavanaugh's decision to the Supreme Court".
"Billionaire Ford, I don't know what happened, but I know this: Brett was very upset with Christine Blasey Ford".
But not all the people she spoke to could afford to pay this.
He's 36 years old.
I didn't see anything new.
What is the global democracy day and how does it help to reduce poverty?
This Friday, I'm going to host the World Democracy Day, a yearly concert, a popular concert to get people excited about ending global poverty.
As the World Democratic Festival enters its seventh year, tens of thousands of people will gather in the capital of Taiwan to enjoy concerts like the Ceng Tai Che Che Cheung Chun and the Chi Biao En Monthesis, and to raise awareness of the real goal of ending poverty by 2030.
The Global Day for Inclusive Democracy in 2012 was a result of the Global Poor Initiative, a global campaign to end poverty by increasing the number of people who work to fight poverty.
To gain access to the action, the audience at the music night must fulfill a specific and meaningful role, such as volunteering, sending emails to world leaders, chatting, or doing anything else that has meaning to help increase recognition of their aspirations.
But in just over 12 years, what has the fully clothed democracy achieved?
Is the idea of a group of unwanted musicians rewarding people a real form of bullying or a form of bullying that makes people think that signing a petition online or sending a message can actually change the world?
Since 2011, the Democratic Party of the Right has registered 19 million supporters and has campaigned for a variety of causes.
Fortunately, these actions have prompted world leaders to make promises and politicians to declare that they've already spent more than $37 trillion, and will impact the lives of 2.25 billion people by 2030.
In 2018, the foundation compiled 390 publications and promises that were either paid or received at least $10 billion in funding.
The foundation estimates that 649 million people worldwide have been directly impacted by the money generated by greed.
Some of the key commitments include the Power of Survival, a partnership between non-residents and practitioners in the UK to help children grow up to be better. After more than 4,700 publications from around the world, we have awarded Rwandans $35 million to end the life-saving campaign.
In April 2018, the great ambassador for the right to life, Tracy Ullma, told the audience at a London concert on the ground floor that the British government, the governments of the donor countries, and the support of people like you, including the whole of democracy, should allow the social injustice that we have been living with to become a historical shame.
The foundation has already launched more than 5,000 initiatives in Germany to improve the lives of mothers and babies, and the government has announced a new free-of-charge model called Lifeforce, which will save the lives of 5 million women and children.
And his response to one of the most common themes on his website is that you think we can get rid of extreme poverty.
People around the world are saying that this is a long, hard road, and sometimes we fall and we fail.
But like the great democratic movement that lies ahead of us and the movement against apartheid, we will succeed because we will be stronger if we unite.
Janet Jackson and the Weeknd, Shawn Mendes, Cardi B, Janelle Monáe are among the performers in this year's New York office space event, directed by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman.
In the United States, President Putin said that the US could use the Navy to block the Russian sanctions.
The Washington Examiner quoted US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke as saying that Washington could use Russian naval capabilities to block attacks on markets in the Middle East when necessary.
Xinjiang said that Russia's involvement in Syria, especially at the invitation of the legitimate Syrian government, was a pretext for Russia to develop new capabilities.
He said they were in the Middle East because they wanted to make money, and they did that in Central and Eastern Europe.
And there are many ways, and there are many ways, that this gentleman says that this issue can be resolved.
He has the ability to get the United States to use our navy to build a sea route to the east, and if necessary, to block it, to stop their energy from flowing to the commercial sector.
Zinke was speaking at a meeting of the Office of the Commissioner for Abuse of Power, a nonprofit organization that describes itself as the "voice of American abuse".
He said that Washington's approach to the Iran issue and the U.S. approach to Iran are fundamentally different, but they are not identical.
He said that "the economy of Tyre and Russia is borrowing money in large amounts and paying for it with oil", but he also said that Russia is still an ignorant animal that relies solely on fossil fuels.
When these announcements were made, the Trump administration was trying to push back against the export of its own natural gas to Europe, and instead of doing so, it was representing a very low-level, if not a very low-level, European failure.
So President Trump himself and other senior U.S. officials are trying to convince Germany to withdraw from the Nord Stream pipeline, and Trump says that the pipeline has turned Berlin into a military base for his capture.
Moses has repeatedly insisted that the $11 billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline is economically sound and will take 110 billion cubic meters of gas, twice the size of the existing pipeline.
The Kremlin says that Washington's opposition to the project is not only motivated by economic reasons but also an example of unequal competition.
After meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September, the Russian Energy Minister, Aleksandr Novak, said that "we are confident that energy cannot be used as a leverage tool, and that it will be used to choose suppliers".
The German resistance to the American revolt was fierce and the Germans reiterated that the end of the war was certain.
The head of the German Construction Industry Association, the German Construction Industry Association (BDI), has expressed hope that the US will not come close to a possible European alliance and a bilateral agreement between Berlin and Moscow.
Dieter Kempf, head of the German Industrial Union (BDI), said after meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin: "I am not happy when a third country is hesitant to supply our capabilities".
Elizabeth Warren's "Hard Look" is "seriously considering" the 2020 presidential election, says Massachusetts congressman
Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Friday that she would "consider" the presidential election after the midterm elections.
In the Holyoke, Massachusetts town hall, Warren confirmed that she was considering running.
She was quoted by The Hill as saying, "It's time to take women to Washington and rebuild our broken government, with a woman at the top of the political ladder".
On November 6, I said that I would definitely consider running for president.
Warren was at the city hall, and he was commenting on President Donald Trump, saying, "He's taking this district in the wrong direction".
She said, "I'm deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to our democracy".
Warren is out in the open, blatantly accusing Trump and his nominee for Supreme Court Justice, Brett Kavanaugh.
On Twitter on Tuesday, Warren wrote, "Why do we have to have an FBI audit before we vote?"
But a poll released on Friday showed that Warren's own party is overwhelmingly unlikely to run in 2020.
According to a Suffolk University-Boston Center for Policy Studies poll, 58% of Massachusetts voters "estimatedly" would not vote for the Senate.
Two percent of the people would support this kind of vote.
Opinion polls showed that Vice President Deval Patrick was the most likely candidate to run, with 38% likely to support running and 48% opposed.
Several other top Democratic names have discussed running for the 2020 nomination, including former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders.
According to Associated Press, Biden said he would be inaugurated in person before January.
Sarah Palin speaks at the Donald Trump campaign rally about her former heart condition
This is Track Palin, who turned 26 on September 9th, and he joined the Army and served a year in Iraq.
He was arrested on Thursday night and charged with domestic violence.
"She told a crowd at a Donald Trump rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, "I can relate to the stories of my son's experiences and the stories of his return, and I can relate to the families who have experienced the emotional trauma of returning soldiers wounded.
Palin called her capture the "big bull in the room", and when she spoke of her son and the other soldiers returning from the war, she said that they had changed a little bit, they had become more courageous, and when they returned, they were surprised to find out how much respect they had been given by the other soldiers and the other soldiers".
He was arrested in Wasilla, Alaska, on Friday and charged with domestic violence, interfering with domestic abuse records and being drunk and carrying a gun, said Dan Bennett, a spokesman for Wasilla Police.
18 states and D.C. support new refugee policies.
Eighteen states and the District of Columbia have supported legal challenges to a new policy that would prohibit the granting of asylum to African American refugees and survivors of domestic violence.
According to NBC News, 18 states and territories representatives held a news conference in Washington on Tuesday to advocate for the policy that makes it harder for asylum seekers to find work.
The full text of the ruling in Grace v. United States of America, Republic of Free Marriage, in August of this year, has not yet been published in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.
She told her husband that she had been treated with contempt by a black man in her community, and that the US authorities had asked her to apply for asylum on July 20.
She's locked up in Texas.
States have filed lawsuits in favor of Grace, with El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala having the highest refugee admissions rates in the United States, because they face serious problems in these countries, such as black people and domestic violence.
The new U.S. immigration policy has changed the Immigration and Naturalization Service's policy of allowing undocumented immigrants who have fled domestic violence to seek asylum in 2014.
Karl Racine, the District Attorney for the District of Columbia, said in a statement on Friday that the new president had been "disrespecting state and federal laws and international law for decades".
The government's law requires that all asylum applications be assessed on the basis of the facts and circumstances of each case, and the friend-of-the-court brief summarizes the decision on whether the ban violates this principle.
Lawyers have argued in the press brief that the policy of not allowing immigrants into the country is damaging the U.S. economy and will lead to a shortage of labor that will be needed to make them more productive and successful.
Chief Justice Jeff Sessions issued an injunction in June that effectively banned immigration judges from granting asylum to victims of domestic violence and societal abuse.
When Sessions announced his resignation on June 11, he said that people of any race, religion, social group, or creed who have been persecuted for their human rights or political views or who have been forcibly displaced due to fear of persecution can now seek asylum.
The right to refuge is not a solution to the problems that people around the world face in their daily lives, no matter how big the problems.
There's a lot of speeding going on in Palu, and there's twice as many people running as there are running.
And the remnant that remained, that were escaped, were in a very grievous condition, and were in a very grievous condition.
"It was so scary", said 35-year-old mother Risa Kusuma, who cared for her own hot dog in a disaster shelter in the devastated city of Palu.
"Every star, there are bodies coming in from the emergency trains.
Clean water is scarce".
The neighbors see their homes torn apart, and they go back to their homes, searching for things that have been submerged in the water.
The 7.5 magnitude quake created a terrible situation, injuring hundreds and destroying hospitals.
Some of the injured, including Dwi Haris, are being treated for broken backs and shoulders at the Palo military hospital, as the strong waves continue to weigh heavily.
And he sat with his wife and his daughter, and his wife and his daughter, in the chamber of the house, on the fifth floor, and wept, for he remembered the greatness of the earthquake.
"This is no time to defend ourselves.
"I felt like I was stuck in a wall", Harris told The Associated Press, adding that his family was at a wedding in the town hall.
My wife kept silence, and cried out at my ears.
I didn't know what was happening to her or to my baby.
And I have put my trust in them, and I hope that they will be well.
The US embassy has accused China of using propaganda and propaganda to insult the president.
A week earlier, a Chinese state-run newspaper had written a four-page ad in an American daily newspaper that exposed the double-digit trade, accusing Beijing of exposing the US media by the US ambassador to China.
The United States claimed that China had interfered with the November 6 vote in the US Congress, a charge China denies, and the Taiwanese daily newspaper, which was launched by President Donald Trump on Thursday, reported that the news had been widely reported in the Des Moines Register - the largest newspaper in Iowa.
Trump accused Beijing of trying to influence the US election, a US official told Reuters, and the move was seen as a new lever to pressure China into a deal.
It is common for foreign governments to promote propaganda and encourage trade, but Beijing and Washington are locked in a constantly-changing trade war, with both sides increasing tariffs on each other's imports.
Analysts for China and the United States say that China may have been planning a major trade war in the early days of the trade war, like the one in Iowa that supported President Trump's Republican Party.
Former US ambassador to China and longtime governor of Iowa Terry Branstad says that US agricultural exports are going to China and that Beijing is hurting American workers, farmers and businesses.
Branstad wrote an op-ed column in the Des Moines Register on Thursday that said, "China is now mocking us with its own propaganda and its own media freedom".
"Branstad writes in the Des Moines Register that the Chinese government has, by issuing a notice of payment, "abused the free speech and press freedoms that the United States respects".
"On the other hand, the restrictive views on the Beijing square will not be reflected in the genuine differences in opinion among the Chinese people on economic stimulus, which is that the newspapers are firmly under the finger of the Chinese Communist Party.
He said, "One of the most famous writers in the Thai language has promised to publish his paper, but it's a blank page", but he didn't say what it was.
Analysts warned that during the midterm elections, the Republican Party was planning to exclude eligible women after Kavanaugh's defeat.
Several senior Communist Party officials have said that while Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh is not charged with sexual harassment, he will continue to defend the nomination, as his campaign warned that he would face a major blow in the midterm elections.
Now there is a lot of emotion in the neighborhood and a lot of communists are saying they are ready to throw a ballot.
Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, wrote in an article published on Friday in The Hill that these definitions are "irrefutable", Maxwell said.
Reeeher said that I fear that Senator Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) will eventually step up the FBI investigation to help temper the angry voters.
According to a Washington Post report, the rise of the social networking site MomeOn, and a top national guest commentator, Karine Jean-Pierre, said on the first flight on Friday that the women "may not forget what happened yesterday, they may not forget tomorrow, and they may not forget it in November".
On Tuesday morning, the protesters shouted "November 11th is here!" and they were protesting in the Senate and the Federal Reserve kept voting despite the fact that the Federal Reserve took over the Justice Department and had to go through a medical examination of Kavanaugh.
"The nonpartisan political analyst Stu Rothenberg told the news site that there was a dramatic increase in interest and motivation in the Democratic Party".
And I said to the people, The report that ye have heard is very great;
And it could be higher, especially for the uncertain women in the suburbs and the young men between 18 and 29 who are not always so supportive of the president".
Even before the public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the Ford Supreme Court nomination, it is thought that if the Labor Party were to decide to move forward, it would likely be met with criticism.
According to NBC News, Michael Steele, former head of the National Union of Communist Party Secretaries, said on Friday that the Communist Party had become a disorderly society.
Guy Cecil, the chairman of the Democratic nominating committee for Properties USA, pointed out in a press conference that the issue had nothing to do with whether the House voted or ultimately voted, and it had nothing to do with whether Kavanaugh was represented, but rather with how the federal government handled the issue and how it treated him.
After the Ford-Kavanaugh investigation, it seems that Americans are split on who to believe, and the latter has more supporters.
A recent YouGov poll revealed that 41% of respondents said they agreed or believed Ford's testimony, and 35% of those interviewed said they agreed or believed Kavanaugh.
Another 38 percent believed that Kavanaugh either lied or actually lied during the investigation, and 30 percent believed that Ford lied during his testimony.
The Guardian reported that after Flake's removal, the FBI was investigating allegations of harassment against Ford and at least one other plaintiff, Deborah Ramirez.
Ford testified earlier this week in a Senate impeachment hearing that he had been drunk and abusive when he was 17.
Ramirez said that in 1980, when she was a student at Yale University, she attended a party at which the Supreme Court nominee revealed her gender.
The inventor of the World Wide Web said he planned to start a new web and beat Google and Facebook.
Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, is talking about starting a new company that will be a partnership between Facebook, Amazon and Google.
The latest project involving technology, Inrupt, has developed a set of general-purpose Berners-Lee computer languages called Solid.
Solid allows users to choose where they want to store their files and to voluntarily restrict others' access to their content.
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company, Berners-Lee said that Inrupt was "changing the world".
"We need to do it now", he says, starting a new business.
"It was a historic moment".
The software uses Solid technology to allow users to create their own "online storage container" or POD.
It includes a list of links to programs, lists of personal and professional equipment, and lists of musical instruments.
It's like Google Drive and Microsoft Outlook and Slack and Spotify all at once on a gaming software.
What's so special about a private archive is that the user is free to see what they want to see.
Businesses call it "personal empowerment through documentation".
Inrupt is a project that John Bruce, CEO of Inrupt, describes as a company that creates resources and uses technology to make Solid Access available to the masses.
Now, the people on the board are Berners-Lee and Bruce, and a couple of them were bought by IBM, and there are a few software developers working on the project under contract, and there are members of the Computer Language Society.
Starting this week, software developers around the world will use tools available on the Inrupt Web to create software that is decentralized.
Berners-Lee said that he and his team "didn't say anything about whether Facebook or Google needed to be radically reformed or whether they were going to disrupt the entire business model overnight".
"We're not asking for permission".
As reported on Medium on Friday, Berners-Lee wrote, "The idea behind Inrupt is to provide market power and automated business infrastructure to ensure the overall security and integrity of networks built on Solid".
In 1994, while at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web, which revolutionized the world wide web.
In recent months, Berners-Lee has been a prominent speaker in the debate over gender equality online.
Despite the re-launch of Inrupt, Berners-Lee continued to be the co-founder and independent director of the World Wide Web Consortium, as well as the co-founder and director of the Web Foundation and the Universal Database.
Berners-Lee added, "I have high hopes for the next era of the Web".
Bernard Vann: World War I cleric awarded the Victoria Cross
The parish church of St. John the Baptist, which is the only church in the village to have served in the First World War and was awarded the Victoria Cross, is commemorating the centenary of his birth.
The prize was awarded to Bernard Vann, who preached the gospel of Jesus during the riots of Bellenglise and Lehucourt on 29 September 1918.
But four days later he was shot dead in a raid, unaware that he had been awarded the highest British military title.
Last Friday, two of his grandsons unveiled a memorial in the middle of Rushden Square in Northamptonshire.
One of his nephews, Michael Vann, said that the stone was a symbol of great significance, and that it was only 100 years after he was honored that he realized why.
The London Gazette explained that on 29 September 1918, Lieutenant-Colonel Vann led an army across the river de Saint-Quentin "in the midst of a thick cloud and under a hail of cannon".
And then he went into the battlefield, and he led the brave Poles into the battlefield and he split the division into three parts with a single shot of field fire.
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by German sniper fire on 4 October 1918, more than a month before the end of the war.
Michael Vann, 72, says that his boss's actions "have never been a match for me and that never encouraged me to be honest".
He and his half-brother James Vann also finished the tour with a candlelight vigil, and the tour was led by the Brentwood Rebellion Youth Orchestra.
Michael Vann said he was "very excited to be part of the parade", adding that the true hero of the parade is shown by the support of so many people.
MMA fans who stay up all night watching Bellator 206 have Peppa Pig instead.
You're looking at the picture frame and you've been watching the entire night of "Belelator 206" and you're not looking at the main event.
This bill from San Jose has 13 attacks, six of which are on the front page, and it's going to be broadcast live on Channel 5.
At 6am, Gerard Mousi and Rory MacDonald were about to face off, and to the surprise of the British audience, the news was reversed to Peppa Pig.
He that tarries until the morning, and tarries till the morning, is a man of strife.
One fan on Twitter explained why he started watching children's cartoons: "To see the absurd".
"Dave Schwartz, Bellator's youngest director of marketing and publicity, said in an interview with the station that the government had a policy that they couldn't air this at 6 a.m. and they had to switch to a children's show.
"Peppa the pig, yes".
Scott Coker, CEO of Bellator, said they would be joining the British audience in the upcoming series.
"I've been thinking about re-enactments and I think we can do that", Coker said.
And they said, It is the sixth hour of the day, and it is the sixth hour; and it is not day, nor is it day.
But we're working on it.
And believe me, when I say that, there's a lot of messages that go back and forth, and they don't all agree.
It's a technical flaw, but we tried to fix it.
But that's not it. It's a government issue.
I can assure you that this will not happen again.
We've reduced the number of fights from six to five, as usual, and we've been successful in getting people to get out of the way.
It's a very unfortunate situation.
Desert Island Discs radio host Tom Daley feels "deficient" in his sexual behavior.
Tom Daley, a champion swimmer, said that from a young age, he felt that his sexual behavior was not dependent on anyone else, and that it gave him the drive to succeed.
He said, "I didn't realize until I was in high school that I was not like everyone else".
On Desert Island Discs 4, the station's news director Lauren Laverne said that he spoke openly about his homosexuality to give others "hope".
He went on to say that becoming a father had changed him from a man who had little to do with the taking of the kingdom of Ogoth.
The longtime head of the label Kirsty Young took a month off due to illness.
Laverne's first letter reveals that he was lonely and felt inferior in the social circles he had grown up in because he was just as likely to be accepted by society as any other boy or girl.
He said, "To this day, feeling inferior and feeling different is the main reason I've been able to achieve these three things".
He says he wants to show that he's gay so that people won't be upset when they find out he's gay.
The Olympic bronze medalist has become a popular LGBT icon and her appearance at this year's Commonwealth Games in Australia has raised hopes that more countries will end sexism.
He says he's lucky to be free even after he's been hidden away, and he wants to give others that same "hope".
The three-time world number one is in love with a man who likes American filmmaker Dustin Lance Black, whom she met in 2013 and who she met in a happy reunion.
Daley said that she was married to an Oscar winner 20 years her senior, but that age was never an issue.
"You've had to go through so much at a young age", he says. He entered his first professional league at age 14, and three years later his father died of a stroke, saying that he had seen so many highs and lows.
In June, the couple became parents, and Daley said that the birth of a son, Robert Ray Black-Daley, marked a complete change in his views.
And he said, If thou hadst asked me, I would have given thee a piece of gold.
More is understanding than gold and gold-gilt, and than the finest of all the fine things.
My real Olympic gold medal is Robbie".
His son and father Robert shared the same name, and Robert died of a stroke in 2011 at the age of 40 after suffering from hair cancer.
Daley said that his father did not accept that he was going to die, and that he finally told them that he wanted to be in the front row when he asked them if he would be a contender for the 2012 London Olympics.
He said, "I couldn't tell him, 'Daddy, you're right next to the front row, right?'
And it came to pass when his breath was departed from him, that I took him by the hand, and his breath departed from him, and he died; he shall not surely die.
Later that year, Daley competed in the 2012 Olympics and won a bronze medal.
And he said, This is the thing that I have desired all my life, and I knew it not: Is there any more joy than to leap before the Lord in the court of the courts?
He chose the first song, "Pride" by Heather Small, which he said was about the prospect of a contest, and that it made his hair stand on end.
Desert Island Discs is on BBC Radio 4 on Thursday at 11:15 BST.
On Monday, Mickelson withdrew from the Ryder Cup due to a disability.
US champion Phil Mickelson will set a new record on Thursday for his 47th Ryder Cup, but he can't help but change his look and make it a long, uncomfortable journey.
Mickelson took part in 12 events in his two years on the tour, with captain Jim Furyk on the bench for the fourth and final race on Friday.
The fifth-seeded No. 1 pick from the United States will not be the center of attention as he has been, but we hope that we can get him to play one day at a time with one of our own guys and get his headaches under control.
And at the peak of his career, the 48-year-old president was not exactly a president, he was not a very good man, and he was a very tough guy to punish for long-term failure.
If the race itself doesn't become a scary place to be in the public eye, Mickelson will win his ninth race on Thursday, along with top British rider Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood, who have won their fourth race overall this year.
If the United States is four minutes behind in the last 12 World Championships, Mickelson's head start is very good, and the race is very important.
If Fury is sure of his men, he must say no more.
Furyk said, "He can see the dance today and he breaks my cheek and he says, 'I'm gonna hug him and I'm gonna be ready tomorrow.'"
"He's too proud of himself.
He is a man of great reputation and he has brought great success to this camp this week.
I don't think I remember him competing twice.
I was hoping for more, but this is the way it's happening, and we think this is the way we should go.
She wants out, just like everyone else".
In the Ryder Cup game on Thursday, Mickelson beat the record set by Nick Faldo.
The Ryder Cup was the end of his career, and his personal best was never that high.
Mickelson won 18, lost 20, and drew seven times, but Furyk said he was a great asset to the team during his time as a coach.
"He was warm, funny, thoughtful, and very helpful, and it was a great feeling to have someone who looked like him", he explained.
"I think he was able to go and the young players were so happy, and I think it was really nice to see him this week.
He's learning more about relationships than he is about games.
European leader Thomas Bjorn knew that a major disaster was coming soon.
Thomas Bjorn is the European leader and experience has shown that on the final day of a Ryder Cup event, a crash is easily overcome and becomes unsafe.
The Dane first played in Valderrama in 1997, when Seve Ballesteros led from the sidelines and the Americans had a five-point lead, but they were 141⁄2-131⁄2.
"We had a big accident in Valderrama, we had a big accident in Brookline, and we lost, we won in Valderrama, but that's it", Bjorn said after the 2018 school year, which ended with a 5-3 win on Tuesday and a 10-6 win over Le Golf National yesterday.
And the words were made known to me, and to the rest of the camp, and to the sons of the captivity.
Tomorrow you'll be full of shit.
Go forth, and do it; and if thou hast strength, do it.
It's not over until we get the patents on the patch.
We have a goal, and the goal is to get attention.
I've said it all, and I'm paying attention to the 12 players on our side, but what's on the other side is that we all know very clearly, this is the greatest player in the world".
"I think it's amazing how his players have been able to go through the tough times on the golf course", Bjorn added.
Tomorrow will be a different snow day.
Tomorrow, everyone's performance comes out and they can do something different.
It's great to be with a friend when things are going well, but when you're alone, you're just trying to be a golfer.
All athletes should be taught to do their best tomorrow.
And now send thy servant away empty; let him go and bring his best.
In contrast to Bjorn, Jim Furyk, who looked at the opposite numbers, and saw that his teammates, including Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas, were better at their individual tasks, scored only three of the four points.
Furyk found himself on both ends of the final day before joining the victorious Brooklyn squads and pulling through the European defeat, "Medinah was amazing".
"I remember every word of it", he replied in 1999, when asked how Ben Crenshaw had beaten his opponent on the final day.
"We have 12 important games tomorrow, but we want to start as soon as we see in Brookline, or as soon as we see in Medinah.
When it was moving in one direction, it was releasing a lot of pressure in the middle of the game.
And it came to pass, when we had made the report, and the men were in our heart, that they did according to the tradition of the men, that we did this thing in the morning.
To win, Thomas was given the job of managing the team and faced Rory McIlroy in the match alongside Paul Casey, Justin Rose, Jon Rahm, Tommy Fleetwood and the top European manager Ian Poulter.
"I have brought this group of men into this administration because it will spread everywhere", Bjorn said of himself during the election campaign.
The German Navy has been delayed again.
A small German Navy ship was commissioned in 2014 to replace the old Cold War warship, but it won't be ready for next year due to faulty systems and icebergs, local media reported.
The task of "Rheinland-Pfalz", the most important battleship in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class, was postponed until 2019, according to an editorial in Die Zeit.
In 2014, the ship was scheduled to join the Navy, but had difficulty getting it to the designated operator.
The four Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleships were ordered in 2007 to replace the older Bremen-class battleships.
It's understandable, because they have the special features of a powerful fire suppression system, but they also have a series of anti-aircraft missiles and some anti-ship anti-tank systems, some radar, infrared and sonic seals.
Another feature that I like is the longevity, which is when a warship can be built two years after it landed.
However, continuing to withdraw was like stealing a battleship's corner, acknowledging the power of remote control from Germany, and that even before they were in the dark, it was too late, Die Zeit wrote.
The ill-fated F125 made headlines last year when the German government was unable to stop the warship from being built and it was returned to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg.
This was the first time that the Navy had returned a ship to commercial shipbuilding after delivery.
There was some information about the reason for the return, but the German media reported that there were many serious problems with the software and hardware that had been disabled if it was designed for combat.
The weakness of the armament was particularly significant, because the Schöne Baden-Wuerttemberg was operating 120 armored cruisers, which was half the size of the old Bremen convoy.
It also proved to be overweight, which reduced its characteristics and increased its naval capabilities in the future.
The iconic 7,000-ton "Rheinland-Pfalz" was twice the size of the battleship used by the Germans in World War II.
The whole cost of the whole number of components of the machine - including the cost of training the workers - is a problem.
The first European lock-up, reportedly, went from €2.2 billion to €3.1 billion ($3.6 billion) in the freeze-thaw cycle.
He recently made a statement saying that the German Navy is getting weaker and the issue of the newest patrol boats has become a very big issue.
A few years ago, Hans-Peter Bartels, head of the German Ministry of Defence, admitted that the navy was now actually "getting out of warship capacity".
Economists say that the effect of this is increasing as time goes on, like a snowball, because old ships are going out of service, but no new ships are being built.
He was very upset and said that not a single Baden-Wuerttemberg-class battleship would ever be able to re-enter the Navy.
The nationalist party is listening to the pigs on the secret life of the father
There's a new study going on in a highland village in Scotland that aims to explore how the ferns use this land to feed.
The new findings suggest that these insights may provide new evidence for the distinctive behavior of flying mammals and may help guide future conservation efforts.
Scientists from the National Trust for Scotland will be chasing the medium-sized fiddle and soprano pipistrelles, as well as the blue-green fiddle, at the Daubenton Fiddle and the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross.
The company keeps a dedicated logger at the controls around the site and keeps track of the movements of the father during the entire time.
NHS staff and volunteers will still be carrying diagnostic equipment to test the lungs.
The engineer then analyzes the sound of the strings to determine what the strings sound like and what other things are doing.
And thou shalt take their habitation, and describe their habitation, and describe their habitation, according to their habitations.
The NTS's conservation consultant Rob Dewar found that the findings of the study could reveal what land was most important to the Wampans as their primary habitat and how the Wampans used it.
This information can help us understand the benefits of replanting and managing the forest and how best to conserve the forest for the benefit of the wildlife and other related animals.
In the last century, there have been significant numbers of deaths of bats across Scotland and the rest of England.
They are being forced and threatened to live, to build, to innovate.
Wind shear and lightning can also be hazards, and can cause damage to the building material used to catch blackflies, such as damage to the roof.
The eyes of the blind are not blind.
And his ear is more than his eyes, when he taketh a prey; for he eateth in the night, and his mouth is open.
They used a sophisticated technique of rock-fixing to fix bugs and obstacles on the runway by hitting the ground.
The NTS has been granted the responsibility of 270 National Historic Landmarks, 38 National Botanic Gardens, and 76,000 hectares of land.
There were ten trained experts who were continuing to explore and investigate the settlements, and they were also helping for a while.
The first Scottish herding society was the Threave Estate in Dumfries and Galloway, home to eight of Scotland's ten breeding stallions.
David Thompson, the property manager, says that land is the domain of their mind.
And he said, "Three-hole golf course is a good place to live".
And they said to the people of Israel, Behold, our houses are old, and old timber is in abundance, and the land is in our hand.
But there's so much more we don't know about the flu that we, who work here and abroad, can learn more about how we can all grow up healthy".
He insisted that a house must be inspected before it can be repaired, because if a house is damaged, it could result in the death of 400 of her family and children, and the entire population of the area could be wiped out.
Killing, harming, or destroying habitat for those who protect our rivers is a crime.
Elisabeth Ferrell, the leader of the Scottish Water Conservation Trust, urged people to get involved in helping.
She said, "We have so much to learn about the flies, and we don't know how they multiply".
Ronaldo's lawsuit over allegations of sexual abuse will cause German newspapers to be burned
Cristiano Ronaldo called the sexual assault allegations against him "fake news" and said people were using his name to "promote themselves".
His lawyers are expected to sue the German news magazine Der Spiege for evidence.
The Portuguese and Juventus representatives are charged with the 2009 Las Vegas hotel rape of American actress Kathryn Mayorga.
According to Der Spiegel on Tuesday, he offered her $375,000 to keep her from talking about the case.
Ronaldo, 33, said in an Instagram video to his 142 million followers, "That's not true news".
"No, no, no, no, no. This is not a wedding.
"They're telling us today is fake news". The five-time Golden Globe winner says in front of the camera.
"They want to use my name to make a name for themselves.
This is common.
They call my name and they want to get away with it, but that's part of the job.
I'm a happy man, and I'm all right".
Ronaldo's lawyers have said they will not accept a request for evidence from Der Spiegel, and according to Reuters, they will not accept a request for evidence based on their allegedly highly classified sources.
Attorney Christian Schertz is seeking compensation for the damage that the players believe may be associated with the large amounts of money and the complex nature of the abuse that has affected the private sector in recent years".
The incident happened in June 2009 at the Palms Hotel in Las Vegas.
According to documents provided by the District Court of Clark County, Nevada, Ronaldo and Mayorga met at a nightclub after he claimed to be her and raped her through a bar.
Mayorga said that after Ronaldo's incident, she got down on one knee and told herself that he was 99% good, but that only 1% convinced her.
According to the documents, Ronaldo's sexual relationship with his partner was confidential, but was voluntary.
Mayorga said she still had to go to the emergency room and have her injuries photographed in the hospital, but later agreed to reconcile outside the courtroom because she was afraid of publicity and humiliation for her fear of retaliation.
The 34-year-old woman says she is now looking for a reconciliation agreement because she still has the wounds from the incident.
Ronaldo was reportedly planning to move to Real Madrid from Manchester United when the sexual assault allegations came to light, but was sold to Italian giants Juve for €100 this summer.
It's always a shame that the Netherlands, which left the EU, has no motorcycle manufacturers.
The UK's trade secretary Greg Clark said that it was "likely that the UK will never be able to recover from the loss of its position as the global leader in the steam car industry after the UK's exit from the EU".
He added that the concern was that Toyota in the Netherlands would stop production at the Burnaston plant near Derby if it agreed to a possible UK-European alliance.
"We need a buyer", Mr. Clark said.
The Chinese motorcycle manufacturers are less likely to be affected by Brexit under the uncertainties of a deal and the delay in the deadline.
The Burnaston plant produced 150,000 units of Toyota's Auris and Avensis engines, of which 90% were exported to other European countries.
"In my view, the UK will leave the European Union at the end of March and we will see our factories shut down", said Marvin Cooke, Toyota's head of sales at Burnaston.
Other German motorcycle manufacturers were concerned about the European alliance being broken up after a lack of agreement on cross-border sales, including Honda, BMW and Jaguar Land Rover.
For example, BMW says they're going to close down all their small factories in Oxford for a month and then leave after Brexit.
The main concern for the motor manufacturers is the risk of supply chains in the event of a no-deal Brexit and a Brexit.
Toyota's production lines are based on the Toyota time scale, with passengers and parts arriving in 37 minutes via couriers in the Netherlands and Europe to order the motorcycle.
If the UK were to leave the EU on March 29th, there would be a problem at the border, a problem of the hardware failure and the delay caused by this.
Toyota said that the Derbyshire factory would only be there for a day, so production could be stopped.
Mr. Clark said that Theresa May's Chequers' future financial plan for dealing with Europe should be well-organized and avoid such final scrutiny.
"We need to trade", he said on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, "and hopefully we can get the best deal we can, so that we can enjoy the results of our vision and we can seize this opportunity".
"This is a testament to Toyota and other manufacturers that we can continue to build on our very successful supply chain".
It's impossible to predict how long Toyota will be shutting down production in the near term, but if it stays too high over the long term, it will reduce the competitiveness of the company and ultimately reduce its chances of going out of business.
Peter Tsouvallaris, who has worked at Burnaston for 24 years and is chairman of the board of the industry's trade association, says that people are becoming increasingly concerned about the data: "In my experience, they don't come back after doing these jobs for a while.
A government spokesman said: "We are planning a future Europe that is both credible and reliable".
Trump and Rosenstein meeting may be delayed again, White House says
The White House continues to fight for the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday, and a potentially dangerous meeting between Donald Trump and Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could lead to another delay.
Rosenstein was tasked with advising special counsel Robert Mueller, 55, who was investigating the alleged US nomination of Robert Mueller, about Trump's ties to Russian officials and Trump's potential threats to the integrity of the administration.
Could Trump fire the younger judge and threaten Mueller's independence, or has Washington been making a lot of nonsense in the last three months?
Earlier this month, the New York Times reported that Rosenstein was consulting with the CIA on wiretaps, Trump talks, and the proposed No. 25 deal, which could lead to his resignation as president.
Rosenstein doesn't want to take any reports.
But he went to the White House last Friday and it was reported that he was going to take a leave of absence until further notice.
On Friday, he announced that he would meet with Trump at the United Nations in New York.
Trump had hoped to remove Rosenstein, but was told he was postponing the meeting to avoid facing the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is now taking him to court along with a woman who has been critical of his actions, Dr. Christine Blasey Ford.
On Tuesday, the Trump administration announced that the FBI had been investigating Kavanaugh's application for a week, which was too late to delay the vote.
Trump's press secretary Sarah Sanders appeared on Fox News on Thursday.
Asked about the Rosenstein meeting, she said, "The timing is not yet set, and given all the other things the Supreme Court is doing this week, I'm going to postpone it by one night.
But I always like to keep up with the news so we can watch.
Some journalists have responded to the allegations, but since September 10, Sanders has not been in the top three in the White House press conference.
And Chris Wallace, the CEO, said, "Why?"
Sanders said that the decline in press conferences was not because of the lack of compassion for people by TV journalists, and she added: "I don't like the fact that they are trying to impress people by their talent".
She's gotten more and more involved with Trump and the press since then.
She said, "The current president has asked more questions than any other president", and that she has no evidence to back up that, adding, "We've looked at those numbers".
Sanders said that it would be a good thing, but if the Bengal press had a chance to ask the president of the United States a question directly, it would be better than talking to me.
We've worked hard on it, and we've seen that we've done a lot last night, and that kind of statement could come when the president of the United States is talking".
Trump left the White House to continue to ask questions, to attend a public briefing, or to hold press conferences with current governors.
There is very little private press advertising.
This week, in New York, standing before the press at a presidential conference was a very, very, very strange and sometimes even bizarre thing to do.
The Minister of Health wrote to the European staff at NHS Scotland, saying they were afraid of Brexit.
The Secretary of State for Health sent a letter to the European officials at Scotland's NHS thanking the country for continuing to work together post-Brexit.
Jeane Freeman MSP wrote that there are less than six months before the UK leaves the EU.
The Scottish government has promised to pay for the European migrant workers who work in its most prosperous public service sectors to apply for permanent residency.
Ms. Freeman wrote in her letter, "This summer, British and European withdrawal talks continued, hopefully with a result in time for the revolution.
But the British government has already prepared for the potential trade disruption.
For I know that ye are in an evil time.
Whatever their domain, why should I re-declare it now after all the disrespect I have shown for each and every one of them?
I hope that all European collaborators will do what they can to develop and strengthen the arts and medical services that we have to offer to society and to disease.
Scotland will be our home, and we hope to make it our home".
Christion Abercrombie suffered a severe head injury and had to undergo emergency surgery.
Tennessee State quarterback Christion Abercrombie has been hospitalized after suffering a head injury in a game against the Vanderbilt Commodores on Friday, March 31-27, according to Mike Organ of Tennessee.
Tennessee State head coach Rod Reed was injured just before the news broke.
Reed says, "He came to the corner and pretended to fall".
The coach and the medical staff kept Abercrombie in bed and oxygenated him on the side of the field before taking him for further testing.
A Tennessee state official told Chris Harris of WSMV in Nashville that Abercrombie had been operated on at Vanderbilt Medical Center.
Harris added that the Tennessee state government is working to determine the exact time of the injury by collecting data on the type and size of the previous eye injury.
Abercrombie, redshirt, sophomore in high school, played his first game in Tennessee before moving to Illinois.
He had five interceptions before leaving the game, which is 18 interceptions in a single game.
Foreign buyers have to pay high prices for domestic products
Tory's new plan would require foreign buyers to pay extra for excessive amounts of British equipment, and use the money to help repair the homeless.
This was the result of Corbyn's efforts to impress young voters.
In Denmark, people who don't pay taxes are taxed and collected.
The Prime Minister has predicted that £120 million a year will be allocated to help homeless people.
Theresa May will announce today that foreign buyers will have to pay extra for excessive purchases of British equipment and that the money will be used to help repair the homeless.
This is seen as a reversal of Jeremy Corbyn's promise to deliver more, affordable housing and higher incomes, and to target the younger electorate.
The taxation of taxpayers and corporations in Denmark, and the additional money that comes with it, will encourage the government to do more to encourage people to sleep.
A corner fee is a tax credit that is a tax credit of up to 3% for a newly purchased or leased home that has been in the lease for at least two years.
The Nordic Council has estimated that £120 million a year will be allocated to help homeless people.
It is estimated that 13% of the press equipment in London is bought by non-British residents, and the high prices are a major problem for the first buyers.
Many of the wealthiest parts of the country have their capital in the desert, which is a ghost town because foreign buyers spend a lot of time outside the country.
A few weeks before the new policy was released, Boris Johnson called for a reduction in the number of young people who should be helped first.
He accused the developers of buying land for free and not using it to buy expensive houses, and he urged May to restore the disgrace of the British slum by eliminating the supply of clothing and increasing the affordability of housing.
Mr. Corbyn announced the first and most important housing reform package that people will be interested in, including budget controls, stopping the abuse and making sure that there are no mistakes.
He also wanted to give the council more power and create new structures.
May said, "Now I'm young enough to rebuild the British culture and make every generation's life more beautiful".
This is a street where we're rebuilding our old homes.
The gifts will always be for the people who want to live here, to build a life here, to work here.
However, for individuals living in the UK and for foreigners, buying a house is as easy as buying a house in the UK.
A lot of people say that the dream of a home is becoming a long way away and that the shame of sleeping on the couch is not as real as it used to be".
Jack Ross: Well, my ultimate goal is to take control of Scotland.
Sunderland manager Jack Ross has stated that his ultimate goal is to manage Scotland.
The 42-year-old Scot is currently re-entering the Northeast League, where they have been ranked as high as No. 3 in the world and No. 1 in the world.
He left after guiding St Mirren to the Scottish Premiership in the light of the pitch.
"I want to play against my national team.
Ross told BBC Scotland's Sportsound, "I got a B and that's it".
"But I remember as a kid watching the Scottish Grand Prix with my dad in Hampden.
This opportunity will come when I'm successful as a nightclub manager".
Ross' previous managers at Sunderland included Dick Advocaat, David Moyes, Sam Allardyce, Martin O'Neill, Roy Keane, Gus Poyet and Paulo Di Canio.
Alloa's main rival is not afraid of such a club because he has refused to be offered a previous deal at Barnsley and Ipswich Town.
"Now, my conclusion is, can I get this team back to the Premier League?
Because the structure and the infrastructure of these teams, he says, is what defines the Premier League.
"It's not an easy task, but if I can get these guys back in the game, I'll see myself win".
Ross's career as a manager lasted only three years, and he was a part-time assistant manager at Dumbarton and a teacher at the Red Rooster Inn for 15 months.
He then helped Alloa back to third place in the relegation table and was a late substitute in the St Mirren relegation play-offs to become the winner.
Ross told him that he had enjoyed his working life at the universities of Clyde and Hartlepool, Falkirk, St Mirren, Hamilton.
And he said, This is the true way, and this is the right way.
"I'm really good at managing myself, and I like it better than playing games.
And I heard a strange thing: I ate and did good, and I did good in my own time.
But it was a little bit of a struggle.
I'm still going through the same work pressure and pressure, but the control is still there.
I always wanted to be in control, and now I'm doing it, and it's one of the most enjoyable feelings of my entire adult life.

The choice of a difficult password 2.7 is required, and the password will vary from software to software and device to device. However, the option of automatically saving the password 4.8 is not selected.
Peter Martin of the Business Intelligence Group, which compiled the figures, said that the continuous sunshine and the longer-than-expected time to the World Cup in England meant that July was similar to June, when the restaurant industry was up 2.8 percent and hit hard.
The food and beverage sector's sales fell by 1.8 percent in June, and were even worse in July.
The strongest indicators are alcohol-driven restaurants and bars, and the growth in the number of single-family homes outpaces the decline in restaurants.

"The exports of alcoholic beverages and alcoholic beverages increased by 6.6% and food exports fell by 3% this month".
According to Paul Newman, an entertainment and museum analyst at RSM, these results continued to improve through the end of April.
Climate, social interactions, or strong sporting competition are the main factors that influence export to foreign markets.
It's no surprise that the food industry continues to crash, because the total market has dropped 4.8% over the same period, and people are going to suffer even more if the initial pressure continues.
For the food-manager, it's not just the long, hot summers that can tell us whether time will give us the much-needed rest we need in the cooler months of August.
This is why the number of retail stores and restaurants grew by 2.7 percent in July, which shows that the expansion of brands is slowing.

Eilidh Doyle is going to be the host of the Scottish Sports Council.
Eilidh Doyle was elected as a non-executive director of the South Kelowna Triple Jump Board of Directors at the annual meeting.
Doyle is Scotland's most famous triple jumper, and the sport's chairman and president, Ian Beattie, said it was a great opportunity and that those who have led the project have benefited from his extensive international experience over the past decade.
Beattie said, "Eilidh is highly respected in the Suqualand and Dutch Triple Jump world championships, and we are confident that she will be a part of this and will greatly benefit the Suqualand Triple Jump championship".
Doyle said, "My hope is that the athletes will be welcome, and my hope is that I will actually lead the Suquak Island gymnastics program".

Thank you for all the inspiring love".
It got her mother into a fight over a modeling commercial.
If a breastfeeding company posted a message online about a breastfeeding mother breastfeeding, it would be a very negative message.
To commemorate the world's first voiceless breast, behavioral scientist Elvis Presley uses musical imagery to spread a message of kuroshi, demonstrating this new baby and the freedom that a loving mother brings.
A real mother dances in a cow covered in dry grass, and the lyrics go like this: "Oh, I'm sucking, but you can't see the camel, or if you don't suck this, it's my breast".
And the song goes, "Remove, remove, I have taken away their breast, I have taken away their breast, I have made my wife breastfeed".
But the ad that Kunsi posted on Facebook was controversial online.
The video has received 77,000 hits and over 100 comments, and the reaction has been mixed, with many considering it a dismissive of the dangers of white goods.
"One of the most shocking decisions was that he used cows to talk about his product.
"They're like us, they're pregnant, they're breastfeeding, they're not breastfeeding, their babies are born, and then a few days later, they're stolen", wrote a friend.

Another article: "A cataract is a common wound in mothers and babies.
Why doth not the suckling spread forth the milk of her suckling?
And he saith to me, Keep up the foolishness!
Others excused the ad, with one woman vowing that she thought the song was "too funny".
"I think that's really a vision.
I'm still breastfeeding, so I'm fine with having one.
The engraver hath made me to understand, and I am like a cow.
The message was a little crazy, but I kept it to myself.
Another wrote: "It's a clean sale.
Another commented: "It's a happy ending message, the goal is to get down to (always work and work) and look like a 'cow.'"
It is not a good or useful advertisement for a product or service.
At the end of the video, these women tell us that they were hiding their breasts in their bra, wearing high heels, and dancing.
This is the common view behind this movement that many women who breastfeed say they feel like cows.
Elvie's silent, silent, and carefully placed nipple in a light bulb or a nozzle, encouraged women to free themselves, to hold their babies in their arms, and to kiss the door from Thana's lips.
ECD's co-developer Ana Balarin comments on the mother: "Elvie is a product with a revolutionary nature, and its release is both confident and controversial.
By studying women and their behavior, we try to capture the beauty of the breasts and the excitement of the light that comes from them, while at the same time being joyful and engaging about the incredible freedom that this new breast enhancement device brings.
It's not the first time that Elvie Nugib has made headlines.
A London clothing plane with a mother of two children was used to test the product on the back seat of the assailant, Marta Jakubowski.
A few hundred of the native children moved to a campsite on the Texas border.
The number of indigenous children crossing the border every month is unchanged, but one of the reasons for the huge increase in the number of detained indigenous children is the strict policies of the Trujillo government, which makes it difficult to find children who are particularly vulnerable.
Historically, most of the victims are violent immigrants who are worried about standing up and risking their children's ability to stay in the United States.
In June of this year, the risk was so high that the Commonwealth Islands Authority announced that anyone who was in an unidentified location or had a family member who was in an unidentified location would be required to provide fingerprints and that the data would be shared with the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
Earlier Sunday, when senior Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, including Orpins, testified before Congress, the agency arrested dozens of people who had been seeking help for minors.
The agency then gave 70% of the people who had been arrested no criminal record.
"He also found that about 80% of the family members who helped him or who never helped him were illegally in the United States, and most of them were foreign offenders.
Mr. Albence said we will continue to prosecute these people.
To speed up the process, the authorities issued a new decree, ordering some of the detainees to appear in court within a month, not earlier than 60 days, according to the archives.
Many people are sitting in front of the TV without being seen, asking the immigrant judge for justice.
Those who wanted to take away the rights of the poor were quickly driven out of the kingdom.
Reports from detention workers in recent months have shown that the longer the detention period, the more anxious and frustrated the children are, and the more likely they are to become violent and run away.
The security official said that in a prison like Tornillo, the stress is even greater.
They don't give them enough time to be in the tent, and they don't give them enough time to be mentally ready or to be comfortable with their friends, and they don't let them go into the tent, and many of them get hurt and they get hurt.
Syria demands the US to withdraw the troops captured by France and Turkey
Foreign Minister Pulitzer Muammar Gaddafi is speaking at the UN General Assembly, calling for Syrian refugees to return home despite the war in the country entering its eighth year.
At the same time, the younger Mu Ali Mu'awiya has shown that the foreign forces that have invaded Syria in order to crack down on terrorism will be punished for their unlawful invasion".
He told the audience, "They should cancel the lease without any reason".
Mou Alimouchand said that the war on terror in Syria is almost over, and that more than 360,000 Syrians have been killed and hundreds of thousands displaced since 2011.
He said, "We will continue to attack Damascus, and we will continue to attack the Syrian people, and we will continue to destroy all the places abroad".
There are about 2,000 Syrian Arab troops in the United States who are the leaders, who train, who lead, who are the leaders of the Syrian Arab army that is fighting against President Bashar al-Assad.
There are over 1,000 French troops on the ground in this country that has been so despised by war.
In terms of the refugee crisis, Mu Ali Mu's response to the refugee return was very positive, and he also sent a very unfair warning to the West that the refugee crisis was over and the refugee community had to leave.
"We call on the international community to establish social and humanitarian institutions to facilitate the return of these refugees", he said.
"They're turning a harmless aspect of humanism into a political one".
The US and European alliances will only help Syria's reconstruction if there is a political settlement between Assad and the opposition to end the war.
The UN chief recently signed a deal with Turkey to mediate a border with the last major rebel base in the country, the Diyarbakir Province, which has opened the door to a political dialogue.
The Urso-Turkish pact has prevented the Syrian army, which supports Urso, from launching a major offensive in the region, which has a population of three million.
But Moualem explained that the negotiations had a clear deadline and that the military actions involved a violent attack on Nusra, which was aimed at the militant and ideologically connected group, and that these people were eliminated".
UN envoy Sitta Hanthey M. Vistula summoned the first assembly of the new UN Security Council, made up of government and opposition members, to draft a new constitution for Syria after the war and to prepare for elections.
Mou Alimoui has stated that the Syrian government should be allowed to join the UN Security Council, which is supposed to review the current constitutional provisions and should make a non-binding statement.

Participate in the midterm elections in times of high foreign investment
With the reapportionment of congressional districts, it's no surprise that the two incumbents are now vying for a seat in Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district, which has a huge amount of funding.
The recent redistricting of Pittsburgh's city council area has faced challenges in the Democratic primary, and he won another special election in the spring.
Lamb is running against Republican Keith Rothfus, who currently represents Pennsylvania's old 12th district, which is being redistricted into 17 new districts.
In January of this year, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the first electoral district was unconstitutional and was in favor of federalism, and then re-mapped these districts.
The 17th presidential election was a major political and financial battle between the main opposition party, the Democratic National Committee (DCCC) and the National Republican Congress (NRCC).
In March, Lan Mu won a special election in Pennsylvania's heavily-populated 18th Congressional District, and Lamb has since become a household name in the district.
The federal government has held on to the award for more than a decade, and President Donald Trump won the district with a 20 percent majority.

Earthquakes and lakes in the Hindu world
The government said at least 384 people were killed in the massive earthquake and tsunami that hit the city of Palu, Indochina, on Tuesday, and that the death toll was expected to rise.
Due to the disruption of the communication, the officials were unable to get any information from Donggala province, which is located north of Palu and is closing in on the epicenter of the 7.5 magnitude quake.
More than 16,000 people were evacuated immediately after reaching the top of Palu.
Below are some of the main facts about the islands of Pulau Pulau and Pulau Donggala.
Palu is the capital of Central Sulawesi, and is located on the shores of the Bay of Bengkulu, on the west coast of Sulawesi Island. According to the 2017 census, it has a population of 379,800.
And it came to pass in the fortieth year that the city was founded, that the earthquake and the flood of the sea destroyed the city.
Donggala is an administrative region in the northwest of Sulawesi island, bounded by a 180-mile long lake.
The administrative region is a single administrative region with a population of 299,200 as of 2017.
Fishing and agriculture are the lifeblood of the economy in Central Sulawesi, especially in the Donggala Lake basin.
Although the white grape is important to the region, the Morowali deposits of the Sulawesi Lake District are also important.
According to the Indo-China Center for Disaster Reduction, Palu and Donggala have experienced several major eruptions in the last 100 years.
In 1938, a tsunami in Donggala killed over 200 people and destroyed hundreds of homes.
In 1996, a similar landslide in Donggala West killed nine people.
Indo-China is a seismically active ocean of peace, and it's constantly under attack.
Below are some of the major earthquakes and tsunami events that have occurred in recent years.
2004: On December 26, a massive earthquake struck the southwest Asian island of Aceh in North Sumatra, Indonesia, causing flooding and disaster in 14 countries, killing 226,000 people in the Indian Ocean, half of whom were from Aceh.
2005: In late March and early April, a series of powerful earthquakes hit the coast of Sumatra.
More than 100 people died on the island of Nias off Sumatra.
2006: A magnitude 6.8 earthquake hits the southern island of Java, the most populous island in Indochina, and hits the southern shore, killing at least 700 people.
2009: A magnitude 7.6 earthquake struck near the capital city of Padang, North Sumatra.
More than 1,100 people lost their lives.
2010: A 7.5-magnitude earthquake hits the island of Mentawai off Sumatra, causing a 10-meter-high lake to erupt, destroying dozens of villages and killing at least 300 people.
2016: A shallow earthquake in Aceh's Pidieya province causes devastation and fear, but it is a reminder of the devastation caused by the deadly 2004 earthquake and tsunami.
This time, the tide turned, and more than 100 people came back and lost their lives.
2018: A major earthquake hits the Indo-Guinean island of Lombok, killing more than 500 people, mostly in the north of the island.
The earthquake destroyed thousands of buildings and left thousands of immigrants stranded.
Sarah Palin's eldest son arrested on suspicion of domestic violence
Track Palin, the eldest son of Alaska's vice governor and presidential candidate Sarah Palin, was arrested for sedition.
According to a report released Friday by Alaska Security, Palin, 29, of Wasilla, Alaska, has a history of domestic abuse and has been a fugitive from arrest.
And it came to pass, as it were, in the presence of a woman, that he was about to speak, and he tore his mouth out of her hand, because of the woman's acquaintance.
According to KTUU reports, Palin was previously placed on probation pending Mat-Su's investigation and was also fined $500 without charge.
According to the social media, when asked to defend himself in court on Friday, he said he was "not guilty".
Palin was charged with three counts of Class A felony, which carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a $250,000 fine.
He is also charged with second-degree murder, which carries a maximum penalty of one day in jail and a $2,000 fine.
This is not the first time Palin has been charged with a crime.
In December 2017, he was charged with assaulting his father Todd Palin.
Then she called his mother and warned her about the raid.
This case is in front of the Alaska Military Courthouse.
In January 2016, he was charged with domestic violence and incitement to domestic violence, and possession of a firearm while intoxicated in connection with the incident.
His friend told him that he had a smile on his face.
In 2016, Sarah Palin was accused by a group of returning soldiers of sexually abusing her son and of assaulting him after he was injured in Iraq.
Hindu-Pasiatic earthquake and tsunami: Hundreds of thousands are still alive
At least 384 people were killed in a massive earthquake that struck the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia on Monday.
Today's 7.5 earthquake caused a flood that destroyed thousands of homes.
If we cut power and we cut the telecommunications network, and we forecast that the death toll will be even higher in the next few days.
The quake struck the central part of the island of Sulawesi, northeast of the Indonesian capital Jakarta.
Images of the incident were widely circulated on social media.
When the waves hit the beach, it was reported that over a hundred people had gathered in the city of Palu to celebrate the beach.
Federal investigators are hoping to get the death penalty for the most notorious terrorist attack in NYC.
New York prosecutors and investigators are hoping to hand down the death penalty to Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the terrorist attack that killed eight people, the rarest sentence for a federal criminal since 1953.
Saipo, 30, was driving a heavy truck that Taipo had shared on a highway in Manhattan on October 30 when he attacked pedestrians and cyclists on a cycle path.
In order to establish the legality of the murder, the investigator must testify that Saipov killed eight victims by kicking and injured them more severely than by kicking.
And the law deals with them, that they both shall be put to death.
A few weeks after the attack, the Inter-Russian Investigation Committee issued 22 requests to Saipov, including one for bribery (which the Inter-Russian Investigation Directorate regularly uses in its list of organized crime) and one for violence and destruction of vehicles.
This time, the attack required a lot of planning and planning, and the investigator said that Saipov's attack was a violent and ruthless attack on the people.
"Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov has injured and injured Diego Enrique Angelini, and has lost the lives of family and friends: Nicholas Cleves, Ann-Laure Decadt, Darren Drake, Ariel Erlij, Hernan Ferruchi, Hernan Diego Mendoza, and Alejandro Damian Pagnucco", the statement said.
Five of the people who died in the accident were tourists from Argentina.
It's been 10 years since the Southern District of New York filed a death penalty appeal.
In a subsequent appeal, Khalid Barnes was convicted of murdering two drug dealers, but was eventually sentenced to life in prison in September 2009.
The first execution in the Commonwealth of the Channel Islands was carried out in 1953 by Julius Louis-Senzongke and Yser Louis-Senzongke, who had been trying to break up the secret secret service of the Sultan during the insurgency two years earlier.
Rosenberg and Rosenberg were executed by electrocution on June 19, 1953.
According to court documents, Saipov was a resident of Uzbekistan and had little remorse in the days and months after the attack.
The prudent man will say, I am well; and he that is in the way, he will say, I am well.
According to the petition, Saipov told authorities that he had been distracted by ISIS videos on his mobile phone and was attacked again.
The security guard said he still hoped to display the ISIS flag in his hospital.
He has pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges.
David Patton, one of Saipov's replacements in the federal prosecution, said he was "deeply disappointed" by the investigation's findings.
We, Patton, recognize that the death penalty is not a conditional sentence of life without parole, but a conditional confession of guilt, and that these events are likely to cause injury to all involved.
Saipov's defense team has issued a statement saying that the investigation will not seek the death penalty.
The TTC asked Nichiren to take on the role of negotiator for the withdrawal of the European Union.
Nigel Farage vows to 'incite the people's war' against the Tory party today
The former UKIP leader said politicians should be able to 'feel the fear of European allies' and that Theresa May should be responsible for negotiating with Europe, as suggested by one of her advisers.
Conservative backbencher Peter Bone said during a public rally in Birmingham that perhaps Farage was the first British minister to be sacked when he was a divorced man.
But when the old-timers who supported the European side entered the London Silver City and protested another act of resistance to the British dissolution of the union, the rivalry between the two was exposed by the most hostile forces inside the United States.
Against the backdrop of the European engagement and the European engagement, the young ruler continues to pursue his plan to disqualify his financier.
Despite the fierce opposition of her daughter-in-law, she said that she would try to restore the marriage and the agreement as before, and that the marriage papers and the marriage papers would make it impossible for her to choose between her plot and the violence.
Mr. Bone said that the Leave Means Leave rally was organized by Solihull and that he was against Chequers.
He suggested that Mr. Farage be a member of the family and that he be allowed to carry the burden of negotiating with the government.
And he said, If the word of Jehovah be in his mouth, then we will be put out of the land.
The Wellingborough MP laughed, "I support Britain leaving the EU, but we have to save money".
Speaking of the European resistance against the marriage, he said, "We're not going to fight a world war to surrender.
We hope to have our own laws in our country.'
Mr Bone refused to comment on the change in the Democratic Party's opinion in the run-up to the 2016 election, saying: "The British public seems to have changed their minds and the idea of wanting to stay in Britain is completely unrealistic".
Tory Brexiteer Andrea Jenkyns is on the ground, the press says, and I'm just saying, Minister, listen to the people.
'Chequers are not popular, they don't vote for the opposition, they don't vote for us, they don't vote for our people, and the fact that they're running in the streets is why we got elected in the first place.
"You know, checkers, listen to me".
She also blamed May for the message, saying that 'the prime minister can continue in office as long as she keeps her promise.'
Mr. Farage said at the conference that he was sure that businessmen would be pressured to back the 2016 Democratic vote.
'He said it was a matter of trust between our people and our political system.'
'They are trying to get the Dutch out of Europe, so we will tell them today whether we will let you escape justice.'
He joked in the messages of the enthusiastic crowd, 'I hope you've put pressure on our political system so that they're on the verge of breaking off the British alliance.
And they said, We have stirred up the people of this land, and have prevailed in our expulsion from the land of Egypt; and we will not rest till we have become a kingdom, a kingdom of our own, and a kingdom of our own, and a kingdom of our own, and a kingdom of our own.
The rest of them walked from Birmingham to the city center, about two hours away.
After the foundation was laid this weekend, a few activists were waving signs protesting the expulsion of the Dutch from the job market.
At the beginning of the meeting, Thai adviser Attu, Sissy Chunyui, mocked the security concerns caused by the Thai regime's use of the system.
'He still tells us that these people can provide all the IT equipment and technology to do business without competition from Canada and the Irish border.
'That was a really funny month.
He said, 'There's nothing better to do than leave the EU.'
Warren is planning to focus on his presidential campaign.
US Senator Elizabeth Warren said that the US should be very careful about the presidential election after the November general election.
According to a report in the Boston Globe, the Massachusetts House of Representatives discussed his fate at a town hall in western Massachusetts on Friday.
Warren has been critical of President Donald Trump for his continued candidacy in the November election, and his deal with former Republican congressman Geoff Diehl, who was Theron's 2016 Massachusetts nominee.
She was at the center of the Trump debacle in 2020.
The event, held in Holyoke on Monday afternoon, was Trump's 36th meeting with the city's Democratic-controlled electorate since taking office.
A man in the audience asked her, "Are you going to run for president?"
Warren said, "Now we're going to bring women to Washington and restore our broken government, and we're going to put a woman in the top job".

Grand Prix of Russia: Lewis Hamilton, driving a steam car, closes the gap to world number one by defeating Sebastian Vettel
It was clear from the moment Valtteri Bottas won the race Friday ahead of Lewis Hamilton that the Mercedes-Benz car package would be a major factor in the race.
On the road from the stand, Bottas had a good chance to drive the car, and the two men held their ground, while Vettel was in the middle of a rally to call the attackers, and he almost stopped Hamilton.
Vettel has a repair on the first lap and Hamilton has a reverse throttle on the tail of the cars, so it should be a natural decision.
The Mercedes slid into the slope after one lap, standing behind Vettel, Hamilton continued to drive with some of the cars moving, while the Ferrari driver made two unintentional deflections at the third corner to avoid the risk of slipping.
Max Verstappen started on a diesel engine and finished seventh in his first round at the age of 21.
After that, he was ahead for most of the race because he had lost his bike, but he was quick to make a good race and finished fourth behind Kimi Raikkonen.
He entered the final lap 44 on the grid, but he was unable to accelerate in the remaining eight laps, and Lechkin finished fourth.
This is a really hard day because Verteele has been great all weekend, he's a real bully let me go.
Hamilton said, "Well, the motorcycle did a good job".
It's actually a very bad form of body.
During a Friday meeting of the US Senate, Donald Trump mocked House Speaker Dianne Feinstein, and he himself admitted that Christine Blasey Ford did not respond to a letter from Supreme Court Chief Justice Brett Kavanaugh.
When the president addressed a rally in West Virginia, Ford did not directly respond to testimony from the Senate Judiciary Committee, and as the quote goes, what happens in the Senate means that people are rich and rich and rich.
He said, "One good thing that has happened in the Senate recently is that you see angry people, angry people, angry people, and there is no justice".
"When they see you throwing away the key, they're like, 'Oh, I didn't do that.'
I didn't do that".
Do you remember?
Dianne Feinstein, did you lose your secret?
Remember her response: "Did you lose your encryption?" Oh, oh, what?
Oh, not now.
I didn't tell anyone".
I'm going to go. Wait a minute.
"He added, "The attitude of a senator is, 'Did we lose the secret?' No, we didn't.
Feinstein had been sued by Ford since July, and the letter was postponed until September. Feinstein denied that the letter had been forwarded to her administration.
"I didn't hide the doctor, I didn't cover the story because The Hill criticized Ford", Feinstein told the audience.
"She asked me to keep it a secret, and I kept it a secret, as she said".
But she's not going to deny that it's not a matter of getting along with the president, and he said that at the meeting on Friday night.
She might not have done it, but she's the worst person I've ever seen".
The president continued to defend the Supreme Court nominee, accusing him of attempting to sexually assault three women, which he claimed was an innocent crime committed by the democratic party for its own benefit.
"They are determined to seize power by any means necessary.
You see their aggressive behavior and their aggressive behavior, especially when they see someone who is being bullied and harassed to gain power and control", the president was quoted as saying by Mediaite.
Dundee 5-3 Belfast strong
Patrick Dwyer, a strong contender, has been outplaying Dundee for the past two years.
Dundee Stars were defeated by Belfast in the play-offs on Friday, and Dundee won the replay on Friday, 5-3, under the guidance of the home side.
He's spent the last two years fighting off the previously dominant teams of Patrick Dwyer and Francis Beauvillie.
Before Dwyer rebuilt the mighty, Mike Sullivan and Jordan Cownie brought the home teams up to the level of the home teams.
Lukas Lundvald Nielsen spent the last two years trying to secure the victory, and François Bouchard tied Dundee.
It was the result of a 2-1 defeat to Dundee in Belfast on Tuesday night, and Adam Keefe's third Elite League defeat of his career.
This was the fourth time that the two sides had met, and the two teams had won the first two matches.
Dwyer's first record was 4 stars, 3 stars, 35 stars, and Kendall McFaull's counterweighted, David Rutherford's counterweighted, and Beauvillier's lead was doubled after 4 stars.
At the start of the race, Sullivan led the race in 13:10, and Matt Marquard led the race in 15:16.
Dwyer, just as he was finishing the first lap, threw the second pitch last night, and with a strong punch, he was close to taking the lead for the first time at the break.
The riverboats also drove again, and Bouchard threw a ball into the water at 27:37 to tie the score again.
Cownie and Charles Corcoran combined to give Thierssen the lead late in the second quarter, and he was almost halfway through the final quarter to secure his fifth World Series victory.

Micronesia plane crashes Niugini Airlines says man missing after plane crashes in sea
A plane that crashed over the Pacific Ocean in the Gulf of Corsica has been evacuated safely, with all 47 passengers and crew on board, and the airline says one person is missing.
In a news article, Niugini Airport said that as of Friday evening, the airport was unable to confirm the identity of a male passenger.
The airline said it was working with local authorities and medical examiners to locate the man.
The airline does not respond immediately to many of the details of the traveler, such as age or country of origin.
After rescuers rescued passengers and other crew members, the plane crashed into the water as it was about to land at Chuuk Island Airport.
The ministry said seven people were hospitalized on Tuesday.
The airline said on Friday that six passengers were still in the hospital and all were safe.
The exact cause of the crash and the sequence of events are still unclear.
Both the airline and the US Navy reported that the plane had crashed into the sea near the runway.
Eyewitnesses said the plane flew overhead and thought it was going to crash.
American aviator Bill Jaynes said that planes come down from too low.
"That was a really good situation", says Jaynes.
Jaynes claims that he and the others were able to escape the submerged aircraft through a waterhole in water up to their waists.
And he said to the man that was with him, Behold, the men were afraid, and cried out; and there was a slight wound in his head.

U.S. Department of Justice investigator Paul Rowlett spent hours examining the security personnel of the real estate and interviewing eyewitnesses himself.
He told the jury how he used his cell phone records to make a subsequent complaint about 29-year-old Quinton Tellis and the night of the accident that killed 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers.
According to a report on the Clarion Ledger, Rowlett claimed that he had a cell phone that contained a local phone log that Tellis and Chambers had been with the night she died, which contradicts his earlier claims.
The documents show that at the time, he was with Chambers, and he was talking to his friend Michael Sanford, who was supposed to be there.
Sanford appeared in court on Friday and testified that he was not in town that day.
When the investigator asked Tellis that evening if it was true that he was in the Sanford heavy truck, Sanford replied that he lied because my heavy truck was in Nashville.
Another contrary claim was that when Chambers died, Tellis had recognized her and had only been gone two nights.
The logs show that they've known each other for a week.
Rowlett claims that Tellis found Chambers's emails, correspondence, and contact information from his phone shortly after Chambers died.
"He kissed her out of his life", Hale said.
The verdict was announced on Thursday.
The judge said he expected the hearing to go to the hearing that evening.

Another black man again?!
A New York shepherdess was sued by two men for firing her for sending racist messages.
A New York pastor is suing the couple for dismissal for obscenity after she claims that another black man was involved in the disappearance of the couple's mother.
These two men not only denied that they were racist, but they also took away that stigma.
Lynseyplasc-flaxman, a mother of two, said that her new baby-sitter, Giselle Maurice, a black woman, was frustrated on her first day at work in 2016.
"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. no, no, no. no, no, no. no. no, no. no. no, no, no. no
But she didn't send him the text, and she sent Maurice the text twice.
The New York Post reported that when she realized she had made a mistake, the nervous Plasco-Flaxman took her away from Maurice, saying that their previous shepherd was a black American and that she had not done a good job, so she was waiting for a Filipino.
She also gave Maurice her day's pay and hired an Uber to take her home.
Now Maurice is suing the husbands for compensation for her dismissal, and she's demanding a six-month salary of $350 a day, which she was paid for, despite the fact that her contract was not renewed.
"I want them to see, look, you don't do that", she told the Post on Tuesday, adding, "I know it's discriminatory".
The husbands countered that they were being racist, saying that Maurice's firing was justified, and that they could not trust her after she was angry.
My wife sent her a text that said something very strange.
She's not racist.
We're not racist", her husband, Joel Plasco, told the Post.
Is it wrong for thee to give thy son, or thy daughter, to be delivered to a strange man? Is it not right for thee to give thy son to be delivered to a strange man?
Shall a woman deliver her unborn child?
Tell me about it.
In the same way, Plasco accused his wife of "rape" and said that she was only two months pregnant and was going through "a very difficult time".
"Is that what you want to do?
That's not good", the banker added.
The case was still pending, but people felt the court was quick to take to social media to criticize the couple and their actions and motives.
Paddington Publishing fears that readers will associate the new message with a talking bear.
Bond's daughter Karen Jankel, who was a grown woman shortly after receiving the book, said in a message that it was hard to put yourself in someone else's shoes when she first read it before it was published.
It's funny now that we know about Paddington's great achievement".
Her father, who was a photographer for the BBC, who later opened his heart to a little teddy bear and started writing this children's book, said that he continued to be confident and enthusiastic even though his other works were rejected, and that the 60th anniversary of the publication of his book was a very, very sad reflection.
As for Paddington, she said that he was "an important member of our family", adding that her father was still proud of his final accomplishment.
And she said, Behold, he is a stiff-necked man, and not a boastful man.
"And yet Paddington is so real to him that you have a child and he achieves things, and you feel proud of them, even though you didn't do it yourself.
I think he's got the same attitude about Paddington's victory.
This is his new novel, and he always gives Paddington everything he has.
My daughter was dying, and I called her and I said, "Why don't you come over?"
Her daughter was immediately taken to the Hôpital Louis Pasteur Hospital 2, where doctors tried to save her life but were unsuccessful.
"Nad kept calling me and saying she was a very good person and she didn't think she was going to live", said Ms. Ednan-Laperouse.
"Then I got a call from Nad and she said she was going to die in two years, so I had to call her and tell her to come.
And I said to the king of Israel,
I said, "Thanks, I love you so much, my love.
I hope to come to you soon.
And behold, I am coming to thee.
The medication she was given was slowing her heart rate and making her body stop beating.
She had just died, and they were all gone.
I sat and waited, and I knew that all things were coming to an end.
My neighbours and strangers are round about me: why should I cry? why should I weep?
I had to keep my mouth shut.
Mrs. Ednan-Laperouse boarded the plane with other passengers in mourning over the death of her daughter - she was obviously going through a lot of grief.
She said, "No one knows".
I will pour out tears, and not cease, and I will cover my head with my face.
It's hard to describe, but on the plane, I felt really bad for Nad.
It was about him and my love and my affection.
I know how much he loves her".

They say that his colorful face fills the house with light, no matter what the color".
But he's not working from death because he believes he's in a dark place.
In 2014, Tyler was 11 years old when he witnessed his brother's suicide.
"I was always worried that it would continue to cause damage", says Davis.
And to make those papers, you have to know that you have people to talk to, and to talk to them, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay.
Speak, and be not silent; speak, and be silent.
The Humphreys and Mrs. Davies were longtime friends and recently lost their mother, Mark, their husband of 15 years.
"He didn't say anything about being unhappy or depressed", she says.
"Two days before Christmas, we noticed a change in his behavior.
It was his birthday, and he was very sad, and when the children were born, he didn't even look at them".
She just goes on to say that they have a long-standing heart condition that they can't get over: "It's a family hole.
It's what separates us.
But we must keep fighting".

The FBI investigation began, and Brett Kaugh's future was uncertain.
Mr. Flake said on Friday, "If we can actually get what he wants, if we can test in a limited time and a limited scope, we can bring some kind of unity", and he joked that he feared that the rally would "disintegrate" if he pulled the line of scrimmage.
Why would you want an FBI investigation with Mr. Kavanaugh and his coalition?
It's just a matter of time before they don't like it.
With only five days to go until the November 6 midterm elections, if the federal government doesn't succeed as predicted, they will be very unable to put pressure on the candidate for the highest court on earth.
George W. Bush called the Senate from the third floor, telling them that they were supporting Kavanaugh, who had worked in the White House under Bush and through whom he knew his wife Ashley, who was a former private secretary to Bush.
What happens when the FBI releases the report?
The Senate then votes, and the Senate is made up of 51 Socialists and 49 Democrats.
The uncertainty that Mr. Kavanaugh still has at least 50 Senate seats has led to the young President Mike Pence deciding to cut ties with the opportunity to take the case to the Supreme Court.
Under Kim, there has been a "decline" in North Korean refugees.
South Korean lawmakers say the number of North Korean refugees to South Korea has been declining since Kim Jong-un took power seven years ago.
Park Byeong-seug, who is a member of the South Korean Unification Council, reported that 1,127 North Koreans have been granted political asylum, up from 2,706 in 2011.
Mr. Park said that the border between North Korea and China is more tightly sealed and the smugglers are more likely to charge higher prices.
Pyongyang has not made any public comments.
Many of the North Korean defectors eventually became South Korean citizens.
Seoul claims that by the end of the Korean War in 1953, more than 30,000 North Koreans had violently crossed the border into South Korea.
The longest border between China and North Korea, the DMZ, is the most easily crossed border between the two Koreas.
China treats North Korean defectors as illegal immigrants, and they are often forcibly returned, not as refugees.
In the technical sphere, the two Koreas, which had previously been at war, have had a very positive relationship in recent months.
The leaders of the two countries met in Pyongyang earlier this month to renegotiate talks on the elimination of their remaining nuclear weapons.
It came after the historic meeting between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Singapore in June, when the two expanded their commitment to denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
But on Friday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho blamed the delay on U.S. sanctions on North Korea.
"In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly in New York, Mr. Ri said, "When America is not trusted, when our national security is at risk, we cannot make room for our own violence in the past".
Nancy Pelosi called Brett Kavanaugh "a hothead" and unfit to serve on the Supreme Court.
Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh "hot-headed" and said that his behavior was unqualifying for a Supreme Court justice.
Pelosi made the same comment during an interview at a Texas rally in Austin on Friday.
Pelosi said, "As Kavanaugh was testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday, I have a very vague memory that if a woman had done something like that, they would have called her 'hot.'"
Kvanaugh has vehemently denied that he sexually abused a doctor, Christine Blasey Ford, when they were teenagers.
In his opening remarks, Kavanaugh spoke with great emotion about his family and his school years, and he almost choked.
He continued to criticize the House of Representatives, including the Democratic Party, calling his criticism "a vicious, organized assassination" and a "foundation for the liberal party" after Hillary Clinton's 2016 defeat in the presidential election.
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh's testimony had made him unlikely to serve on the Supreme Court because it showed that he was biased by the Democrats.
She said, "I think his comments, and his behavior in pursuit of the Clintons and the Democratic caucus, made him feel overwhelmed".
When asked if he would like to be confirmed if Kavanaugh were elected and the Democrats won the House, Pelosi was asked in a very dismissive manner.
"Pelosi said, 'Maybe if he's not being honest with Congress or the FBI, he's not qualified to be on the Supreme Court, and he's not qualified to be on the Supreme Court now.'"
Mr. Kavanaugh is now a judge in D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Pelosi added that as a Democrat, she was concerned that Kavanaugh would oppose the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade, which she considered a conservative judge.
During his testimony, Kavanaugh was asked if he wanted to see certain Supreme Court decisions overturned.
Pelosi said, "This is not the time to be bitter, and we're waiting for biased people to come to court and say, 'Isn't this really terrible?'"
And the woman shall use it.
It is the sin of righteousness, burning like a flame of anger for months, years, and she cannot see it without weeping.
"After 45 years, Mrs. Steinem told me, "We cry when we're angry".
"I think that's not normal, if you do that".
She continued, "One woman in management helped me a lot, somewhere, because she said she cries when she's angry, but the new trick is that she starts crying when she's angry, and what she's trying to say to the person she's talking to is, 'You might think I'm sad, but I'm crying.
I'm eating my anger".
And she went on.
I thought, "This is really special".
Tears can be seen as the ultimate outlet for a part of our anger that we inherited.
One of the most vivid memories of my early career is that I once worked in a government office where men were in leadership positions, and I was so angry that I cried myself to death, and my clearest memory is being dragged up the stairs by an older woman, who was a cruel supervisor, and I was always a little scared.
She said, "They'll never see you cry".
And he said, Behold, they know not that thou art angry.
They will be very happy to know that you are very upset because they think they know you".
Patricia Schroeder is a Democratic women's congresswoman from Colorado who worked with Gary Hart during his presidential campaign.
In 1987, Mr. Hart was involved in an outsourcing dispute and was disqualified from the ship, the Merchant Marine. Schroeder was so upset that she saw no reason not to consider running for president.
And she laughed 30 years later and told me, "That was not a good decision".
"We've got seven candidates now, and at the end of the day, they need someone else.
And one of them said, "Snow White and Seven Short Men".
The protest was delayed, and she was behind on the fundraising side, so she said she wouldn't run unless she was willing to say she was prepared to raise $2 million.
This is a losing battle.
She found out that some of her supporters had given the guy $1,000 and she hadn't given her $250.
"Do you think I'm being undervalued?" she wondered.
When she speaks out and announces that she can't run for office, she is heartbroken, grateful to those who support her, and shows a deep belief in the discipline that rules don't work, that rules don't represent the people, and that anger at gender discrimination drives her to her knees.
Schroeder recalled how the reporters looked at him: "You must think I was shocked and scared".
"You think Kleenex thinks he's my business owner?
I thought, What have they prepared for my grave, that I should remember it?
"Did she cry?"
How could a US-China trade war benefit Beijing?
For one thing, experts warn that there is a trade war between China and the United States that is not yet over, and that Beijing may benefit from the long-term tensions between the two countries.
This year, President Donald Trump of the United States announced the first sentence of tariffs on Chinese exports, including electricity and steel.
The most obvious is that this week, the new tariffs will affect goods worth $200 billion (£150 billion) and will effectively reduce the tariffs on all goods coming into the US from China.
Beijing has repeatedly retaliated, recently raising tariffs on US goods worth $60 billion from 5% to 10%.
China has promised to give the United States a hand up, and the world's second largest economy is not going to blink anytime soon.
Washington's decision to withdraw was to follow their own wishes, but generally speaking, capitulation to the United States would be a huge embarrassment to the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping.
But one expert said that if Beijing can make the most of its ability, the pressure of the US trade war could reduce the economic interdependence between the two countries and make China a valuable long-term asset.
Abigail Grace, a junior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Asia at the Joint Commission, said, "Washington never predicted that Beijing's rapid collapse would lead to a rapid economic collapse of both countries, which is more dangerous than the observers thought".
The Syrian Foreign Minister said that the Syrian refugees are ready to return.
Syria says it is ready to accept the return of refugees voluntarily and is calling for help to rebuild the country after more than seven years of war.
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said the country was doing well at the UN General Assembly.
He said, "Thanks to the success in the fight against terrorism, the region is now more stable and secure than ever before".
The government is continuously rebuilding and restoring the devastated areas.
Refugees now demonstrate a willingness to return to their homelands, where they were forced to leave by a system of economic control that was designed to be violent and to disrupt the daily lives of many.
The United Nations estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the war began in 2011.
And we need to give humanitarian aid to the six million people who still live in that country.
Al-Moualem said the Syrian government would be happy to help rebuild the country after its devastation.
But he insisted that he would not accept any help or assistance from any nation that would support his rebellion.
Europe won the first Ryder Cup in Brazil.
In 2018, the United States won the 2018 Ryder Cup in Europe by 16.5 to 10.5 seconds, defeating the United States in the final at Le Golf National near Paris, France.
The United States has now lost six straight games on European soil and has not won a European Ryder Cup since 1993.
Europe took the crown, and with the boldness of Danish commander Thomas Bjorn, they reached the point where they needed 14.5 minutes to beat the Americans.
American Phil Mickelson struggled in the long run and fell into the water on the par-3 16th hole, losing to Francesco Molinari.
Italian co-driver Molinari has been a perfect fit in every race since the competition was introduced in 1979 and has a perfect 5-0-0 record in the top four since 1979.
Jordan Spieth of the United States defeated Denmark's Thorbjorn Olesen, the lowest ranked player in Europe, 5-4 on aggregate.
World No. 1 Dustin Johnson lost 2-1 to the British Ryder Cup player Ian Poulter.
The eight-time Ryder Cup champion, Spaniard Sergio Garcia, set a record of 25.5 seconds, making him the most successful European rider in the competition.
"I don't cry all the time, but today I couldn't stand it.
And it shall be a year of trouble, and of trouble.
Thomas, thank you for choosing me and for putting your trust in me.
And I was very glad, and I took the cup, and I was glad.
It's about the teams, so I'm really happy to be able to help", Garcia said, feeling very emotional after winning the European Championships.
He passed it on to his brother, John Ram, who was the one who defeated the American Cocker Spaniel on Thursday in the Tiger Woods Tournament, 2-1.
"I'm so proud to beat Tiger Woods", says 23-year-old Rahm, "I'm too old to see him".
Woods lost four times in the Ryder Cup, and now has a career record of 13-21-3 in Ryder Cup play.
That's an amazing number for one of the greatest players in history, who has won 14 world titles and is tied with Jack Nicklaus.
Patrick Reed, another American runner, was on the track for the race this weekend, and Justin Thomas and Tony Finau were in the race for the high-water mark in the middle of the race.
U.S. Army General Jim Furyk said after his troops played poorly, "I'm proud of them, they fought hard.
This morning we had a hot time in Europe.
We were scattered.
Thomas took off his mask and held out his hand.
He was a military officer.
All 12 of his players played very hard.
We've regrouped, and I've been working with the PGA Ryder Cup Tournament Board, and we're moving forward.
These men were my delight, and I was glad to be their captain.
And thou shalt take off the skirt of the girdle, and cover it with the hem of the girdle.
We lost".
The red cow story: Pinellas is getting redder, Manatees and Sarasota.
Recent data from the Florida Department of Fish and Wildlife shows that there is a general drop in the temperature of the Red Sea in some areas of Tampa Bay.
According to the FWC, there are reports of temporary flowering in Pinlellas, Manate, Sarasota, Carlote and Collier counties, and this is declining.
The red clouds are concentrated from Pinlelas in the north to Lee Fields in the south, about 130 miles from the lake.
There's a patch of mud in the lake about 10 miles from Hillsborough Farm, but it's a little less than the area of the previous drive.
We're studying red waves in the Pasco field.
In the last one, the Pinellas County was at an average elevation, the Hillsborough County was at a low elevation, the Manatee County was at an elevation, the Sarasota County was at an elevation, the Charlotte County was at an elevation, the Lee County was at an elevation, and the Collier County was at an elevation.
Pinellas, Manate, Sarasota, Lee and Collier counties continue to report respiratory distress.
There have been no reports of respiratory distress in northwest Florida in a single recent flight.
