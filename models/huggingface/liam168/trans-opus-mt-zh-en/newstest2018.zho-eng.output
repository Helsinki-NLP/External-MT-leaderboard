Last week, the temporary suspension of the old play, " American private room food " , unexpectedly triggered a lively debate about the counterfeiting of national production.
Civil rights groups have issued travel warnings against Missouri.
As a result of Missouri ' s discriminatory policies and racist attacks, the American Association for the Advancement of Colored Peoples (NAACP) issued travel warnings to colored populations preparing to travel to Missouri.
“As called in the NAACP Missouri Travel Consultation, which came into effect on 28 August 2017, in response to the recent series of suspicious racial incidents in Missouri, all African-American travellers, tourists and Missouri nationals should pay particular attention and exercise the utmost caution in travelling in Missouri, I would like to inform you of the group's statement”.
NAACP noted that the recent adoption of a Missouri law made it more difficult for people to win discrimination suits and that the state ' s enforcement of laws targeted minority groups to some extent, prompting the organization to issue travel warnings.
Violations of civil rights are happening to people.
They were questioned by parking and beaten or killed because of their skin colour, “Missuri NAACP President Rod Chapel told The Kansas City Star.
“We have received an unprecedented number of complaints.”
This was the first such warning issued by the organization against a state in the United States.
The organization cited the racial defamation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of a black male, Tori Sanders, 28 years old, in Tennessee.
Earlier this year, Saunders died under suspicious circumstances. He spent fuel fuel while travelling in Missouri and was detained without charge by the Missouri police.
The consultation also noted that a recent report by the Office of the Attorney-General of Missouri indicated that “Black drivers in the State are 75 per cent more likely to be stopped and examined than whites”.
Chapel said: “The consultation was to raise awareness and warn their families, friends and colleagues of what might happen in Missouri.”
“People need to be prepared to travel to Missouri with bail, or to let relatives know that they are travelling within the state”.
According to the latest data from the FBI hate crime reporting programme, Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015; according to the crime, the state ranked 16th in the country.
Travel warnings were also a response to the new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to prosecute housing or employment-discriminatory businesses.
Prior to the adoption of immigration law enforcement laws requiring local law enforcement authorities to detain immigration offenders, the United States Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) indicated that this would increase the number of racial litigations and issued travel advisories for Texas and Arizona.
Travel warnings are usually issued by the United States Government against other countries, but more recently, advisory groups have adopted this approach in response to certain laws and trends in the United States.
After the “Golden Age” of the 2015 surge, the overall film market entered a cooling period in 2016, and the ability to break through last year's $4,069 billion gross house performance became a suspense.
According to data published by the National Statistical Office, in October, the prices of the new and second-hand houses in Beijing cooled by only 0.6 per cent and 1.1 per cent.
Lupescu, the current CEO of the Federation of European Unions, presented a technical report at the Congress on the 2016 Euros and the past seasons of the League of European Cups.
BBC called Beijing the most exciting city: to make the foreigners feel “living in a new era”.
The English media reported on January 18 that Beijing may have a long history of 3,000 years, but it is also rapidly becoming today's modern city of charm.
The capital of China, with its fast-growing Internet, its sophisticated technology, such as face-to-face recognition software, its huge investment in artificial intelligence and its incomparable internationalized energy, is one of the most exciting cities for a foreign country rich in exploration.
According to the BBC website on January 16, German expatriate Clemens Sethi says, “If I succeed there, I will succeed anywhere in the future.” He quotes a singer, Frank Sinatra, who sings the words of New York City.
Seth, who is the creative director of the Traveler Archives magazine, says, “If Sinatra survives today, he will probably sing about a city like Beijing.” He says, living in this city will make you feel like a “new age” and always keep up with the tide.
The old Simon Norton, who lives in England, but recently in Beijing, published an article on his personal blog website, 4 Corners7 Seas, saying, "People generally have a feeling of being at the centre of something big, and it's hard to tell, but it keeps many foreigners there for a long time. They want to see what it looks like, and they want to witness it."
It was reported that the city ' s high-quality, high-speed Internet and technology-friendly environment made daily life easier than ever before.
Andy Penya Fuert, from Manila, who is currently the Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the Beijing Children's Web site, says: “Beijing is rapidly turning into a cashless society, where the Internet integrates the functions of traditional wallets into smartphones, making it easier for everyone to make many transactions.”
Reports indicate, however, that smart phones are only the beginning of Beijing ' s technological ambitions, that facial recognition software has become widely available, and that many mobile phone applications use this technology for bank transfers and payments, for access to apartments and offices, and even for verification of the identity of network drivers.
Beijing has also recently announced plans to invest 13.8 billion yuan in the construction of an artificial smart technology park, where more than 400 enterprises will settle, focusing on the development of various artificial intelligence technologies, from biometrics to autopilot.
Food is also at the core of many major festivals in China over the years, which are celebrated by foreigners, and spring is the most important social and economic holiday and one of the most easy days for foreigners to participate.
Seth said, “I suggest helping Chinese friends prepare for the New Year, cleaning their apartments and putting a new year's blessing on their doorsteps are equally important. On New Year's Eve, all family members must come together to eat a great meal, and then wait until midnight and greet the New Year with a radiant fire. For foreigners, spending the night with friends and family is a real opportunity for integration.”
It was reported that the number of foreigners in Beijing was large and growing, but the language barriers in China and the ease of communication among the diaspora could easily be used as a pretext for their incomplete integration into the local culture.
Seth said, “Some foreigners have lived in China for many years, but they have had little experience with their host countries. If your initial attempts to reach out to the Chinese have not been successful, then it is easy for you or easier for you to get along with other foreigners.
In these so-called “foreign bubbles” (“foreign bubbles” are those in which foreigners mix only among foreigners and do not touch local people and local culture — the translator's note), foreigners congregate in their own communities, eat in Western restaurants, and friends only foreigners.
The simplest way to overcome this is to learn a little Mandarin — which is simpler than one might imagine.
Seth said, “The Chinese private lessons of one or two hours a week, or the introductory radio drama, should suit everyone's busy schedule.”
Even learning a few classic short sentences helps shopping, ordering meals in restaurants or chatting in taxis.
Persistent air pollution is also reported to be a fact of daily life, although in recent years the Government has made efforts to contain some problems.
Residents stressed the importance of outdoor activities in the warm months of pollution, which are often lighter, and of using the blue days as a window in the long-standing alley or as an opportunity to explore popular solar parks.
According to Norton, “Beijing is the Chinese city that can discover the most things on the surface, and you can find great artistic and musical activities, angry night life, historical wonders, super-modern commercial zones, and ancient holocausts.”
The report argues that the role of ageing as an impediment to the growth of human capital is increasingly evident, particularly in the north-east, where ageing contributes to human capital growth at an average annual rate of -1.28 per cent.
Pan Kwok noted that the risks of cross-border capital flows are currently manageable and the underlying factors underpinning the balance of payments remain long-standing.
On December 17th, the China-News-China World Summit Forum on the Restoration and Conservation of Chinese Ancient Books, 2016, was opened at the People's University of China.
In April of this year, the European Commission accused Google of forcing mobile phone manufacturers to pre-package software such as Google Search and Chrome Browser, otherwise they would not be allowed to use other Google applications.
The EU Commission considered this to be detrimental to the interests of consumers and an impediment to competition.
EU regulators initially requested Google to respond by 27 July.
If an anti-monopoly charge were to be found, Google would face a fine of up to 10 per cent of its global revenue, amounting to approximately $7.4 billion.
Google has not yet commented on this immediately.
Google is also being investigated by the European Union for favouring home shopping services in search results.
Jang's legacy is solid, and it can be said that it was not by chance that he “stepped” from the youth to the Olympics, and that his leap to growth was still surprising.
A picture of Bitcoin's legal status around the world.
Summary: In addition to the price retrenchment that is naturally triggered by speculative properties, the collapse of the current round of digital currency is also linked to the “hosting enemy” - regulatory risk.
From visual maps, Eastern countries have a more conservative attitude than the West, countries with global dominance are still looking at digital monetary legitimacy, and represent a “black swan risk” that remains high.
*This paper is from Wall Street (Web ID:walltreetcn), editor Wang Mu. For more wonderful information, please visit Walltreetcn.com or download Wall Street Access APP.*
With the rise of regulatory storms in major Bitcoin markets, such as China, the Republic of Korea and the European Union, the global digital currency headed by Bitcoin has been bled out since this week, with the price of bitcoin falling by $10,000 on Tuesday and the largest single-day fall in three years.
In addition to the price reversals that are naturally triggered by speculative properties, the collapse of the current round of digital currency is also associated with the constant “hosting enemy” - regulatory risk.
At this important juncture, the big visual data site, HowMuch.net, produced a map showing the legitimacy and degree of regulation of Bitcoin in countries across the globe.
As shown in the figure below, green represents the legitimate market of bitcoin; orange yellow represents the neutral market, although it has not publicly legalized bitcoin status, but there are no major restrictions on its use; light pink represents the restricted market, where local governments try to use digital currency through red-line policies or regulation; dark pink represents the country defined as illegal; grey is the country that has not yet been evaluated.
(The above figure is drawn from the HowMuch.Net visualization team on 15 January.)
According to the article, the traditional attitude of the Eastern countries of Bitcoin is more conservative than that of the West, as can be seen from the green mass distribution of Central Africa.
Russia is currently the largest country to define Bitcoin as illegal, China as one of the largest restricted markets in Bitcoin, and India as one of the largest countries in which Bitcoin has not yet been evaluated and has not yet introduced relevant policies.
North America and Western Europe are the regions with the highest acceptance of bitcoin, i.e., the more concentrated distribution of green blocks.
The views of the countries of the Middle East and Latin America are distinctly polarized, with a more mixed distribution of colour blocks in the above-mentioned regions.
Of these, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Brazil are the legitimate Bitcoin markets, with some restrictions on their trade and use in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Bolivia, among others, and more Latin American countries that have yet to make a sound.
Combined with the above data, it is known that a total of 99 (or 40 per cent) of the 246 countries surveyed globally have unrestricted transactions and use of the bitcoin, i.e., green and orange areas.
Seven countries (or 3 per cent) are restricted markets (light pink), 10 countries (or 4 per cent) define Bitcoin as illegal (deep pink), and 130 countries (or 53 per cent) do not treat digital currency information more (grey).
This suggests that countries with a global majority (53 per cent, more than half) are still waiting to see the legitimacy of the digital currency headed by bitcoin within their borders, and that the “black swan risk” of bitcoin remains significant, as some of these countries may eventually take legislative decisions to limit the digital currency.
According to the article, the emerging category of digital currency, which is not yet fully understood by global regulators, may be the main reason why most countries have not yet made a pronouncement.
Although the “human face” of Bitcoin has grown exponentially since last year, it does not represent the interest of all countries, and there may be concerns in some countries about the threat of local French currency as a result, or even more about the use of digital currency by criminal organizations.
Wall Street interviews have written a detailed summary of international regulatory news against Bitcoin since last week, including China’s start on a centralized online service platform and mobile App against off-site exchanges, South Korea’s continuing consideration of closing the digital currency exchange, the EU’s view that bitcoin has not been widely accepted and warns investors of the risk of “bringing away” the blood.
The editor-in-chief of Wall Street selects the Year of Digital Currency as the year of the global central bank's digital currency, either from the standpoint of regulation, acceptance/criticisation or adoption.
The criticism of the legitimacy of Bitcoin by major Powers, such as Russia, is also intended to give way to the official issuance of digital currency.
Xinhua Society, Madrid, 8 January, New Aid Curtiño, Barcelona (Reporter, Xie Woo-ji), 8th, in Nokamp, for the first time in a pizza jersey.
Cutinio passed a medical check-up in Bassa that morning and signed a contract with Basa President Bartoméu, which will expire in the summer of 2023.
He then appeared as a Bassa player in front of nearly 7,000 fans in Nokamp.
According to the Spanish media, Curtiño ' s total transfer of contributions amounted to Euro160 million (Euro1 = approximately RMB 7.77) and was the first price of the Basa Club and of the history of Nica.
As Curtiño is still wounded, he will have to rest for nearly 20 days before he will be able to meet himself in a paisa jersey troupe.
What else is sacred?
Trump's White House is now targeting the Statue of Liberty.
The most definite sign of regime change was when they started attacking the statue.
Americans, like anyone else, agree with this. So, in 2003, Saddam Hussein of Paradise Square in Baghdad was deliberately pushed down.
Stephen Miller, one of the key thinkers of the Trump government, must have known what would happen to his symbolic ax to the Statue of Liberty when Jim Acosta, of CNN, engaged in an intense debate about the President's proposal to severely restrict legal immigration.
To be fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself.
If he did, a group of cruise ship owners and liberal followers would surely eat him alive.
But he did attack the meaning of the statue, especially when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was carved on the base in 1903, and this monument was built 17 years later.
As Miller denounced Acosta, “I do not want to talk about all the facts of history here, but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of America's freedom to light the world ...
The poem to which you refer, which was added later, not part of the original Statue of Liberty.”
In fact, Miller was right, but, as he himself said, this is not really about history.
This relates to the modern echo of the language of Lazarus, the only country that seems to invite not only any old immigrants, but also the poorest of the poor: “Your fatigue, your poverty, or your crowd of people who want to breathe freely,/the suffering reject your crowded beaches”.
There is no “rejection by the suffering people” at a time when our screens have become even more dazzling.
Miller did not engage in literary commentary, and he made it clear that these people would not be welcome in the Trump-era United States.
This conflict over the significance of statues is part of a broader political and cultural war: it is in fact a conflict with the American spirit.
Lazarus, as well as her friends, who engraved her poems on the ground after her death, are well aware of the highly political nature of the acts in which they are involved.
The purpose of the sculpture was to express the link between French and American republicanism through the old classic metaphor of the female incarnation of the Statue of Liberty.
Lazarus changed the meaning: in her poem, the image of a woman was no longer abstract, and she had to speak.
She gave herself a very different name: the mother of exile.
The poem, combined with the painting, was a successful feminist coup d ' état and a devastating blow to American indigenousism.
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, right-wingers always wanted it back to its original meaning.
The great speaker, Rush Limbagh, an ad interim Baptist of Trump, argued in 2010 that liberalism was not an invitation to anyone, but that he was an early neo-conservative who brought America's fire of wisdom to a foolish world: “The Statue of Liberty has no way forward.
Her intention was to bring the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.
The torch is not the path of America.”
What is unusual is that Limbo is actually touched by something.
The meaning of the statue depends entirely on the cognitive angle.
The most imaginative thing about Lazarus is to be able to see it. When weary, poor, but hopeful people can see it on the deck of the ship after a long and often terrible journey.
On the face of it, this involves the world view of those who seek refuge and have the opportunity to improve their lives.
Her statue conveys to them and requires the hope and welcome they hear.
Of course, this is not the point that Miller and Trump wanted to acknowledge.
Their torches are not intended to light the way, but to inflame the hatred of their only source of power.
In 2006, Sacap became the first Chinese to sign a contract with the world's British headquarters with a unique musical style.
The 2017 World Cup: Neil Black highly praises Scotland's team in the British National Team.
Eilidh Doyle recalled that there were only two Scottishs in the British National Team at the time.
Neil Black, Executive Director of the Athletics Association of England, said that a 16-strong Scottish team from the World Cup team would make a huge contribution to the National Team.
The number of Scottish field athletes selected for the London Athletics World Cup in 2017, which opened on Friday, was the highest in history.
Black believes that “Scotland is making extraordinary progress”, from which UK trackers must learn.
“We accept and try to understand this, and we will persevere until we succeed”, Blake says.
"I'm talking to people at the Scottish Sports Institute. They think it's about what they're doing.
Scottish trackers think this has something to do with what they're doing.
The Athletic Association of the United Kingdom considers this to be relevant to their actions.
Even street people think so.
Whatever the situation, it's brilliant."
A wide range of Scottish track and trackers are medal racers, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will be at 5,000 metres below Mo Farah, while Eilidh Doyle was selected by the team as team leader.
“Erid is a little modest.
Her captain's speech was incredible." Blake said.
“Many track and track athletes, whether Scottish or not, or wherever they live or train, walk out of the house with pride and energy.
Eric's natural passion and true feelings are very good."
The winner of the Commonwealth silver medal, who will be participating in the 400-metre cross-column contest in his fifth World Cup, says that there are 16 Scottishs in the British National Team, which is “unbelievable”.
Previously, the number of Scottish track and track athletes participating in the World Series was up to seven, i.e. in 1983 and 2015.
Midrunner Muir is a leader. She's made five British and two European records over the past year.
She's going to the 1,500-metre and 5,000-metre project competitions.
Chris O'Hare, who took part in the 1500-metres contest, was another notable Scottish player who had achieved great results during the season, winning the British pre-elections and the Olympic anniversary, respectively.
Doyle recalled her participation in the first World Championship, when the only other Scottish on the team was Lee McConnell.
The captain said that she was very proud that so many of her compatriots would not only join the team, but also, in some cases, challenge the medal and enter the finals.
“The special thing about being a captain of the national team is that it was elected by the other members of the national team. So, knowing that your teammates voted for your very unusual achievement, which, in any case, is a great honour to me”, she added.
“Of course, I am very proud of all the Scottish team members.
This is just an indication of how far we have gone.
And they're all old track and track athletes here, track and track athletes who are about to move towards the purpose of the Medal.
What about my captain's message?
Well, I think it's very good.
I have just referred to the fact that, under these circumstances, we are very fortunate because we hold the World Cup in the main arena.
That is why it is really important that we grow up with home-based support and by returning to the Olympic stadium.
I will be given a second chance to compete, and there will be a wonderful atmosphere.”
In 2016, the total number of employees was 180,000 and the cost of employees amounted to $121.8 billion, an increase of 21 per cent over the same year.
Curb critics on Facebook: if you can't stand the blame of voters, don't run for office.
Our Father is aware of the bad media.
The Americans loved Washington, but not long after that, major newspapers began to speak out against everything, from domestic policy to political principles.
He was irritated by those criticisms, no doubt.
But he did not silence those critics.
Because, as early as 1783, Washington said, “Freedom of expression is denied — we will be slaughtered like lambs in silence and ignorance”.
This reminds me of the Governor of Maryland, Larry Hogan, who needs to learn from Washington.
Hogan's staff blocked and deleted at least 450 people's posts because they had published their views on his official Facebook home page.
The American Civil Liberties Union brought a lawsuit against him earlier this week.
The governor's staff described the lawsuit as hasty, and the online coverage was full of their fierce resistance: “Who cares?”
A lot of people say, "It's just Facebook."
But it's important.
This is particularly important because people like Hogan are confronted.
It was a Republican who served as governor in a state with a democratic majority, and he was surprisingly popular.
Of the country ' s 50 governors, he was ranked second in good ratings.
Hogan is not a reactionary rash.
He has smooth control of Maryland and strictly abides by the rules.
He was also very good at using Facebook as the main way to communicate with voters, showing his bald head after chemo on the home page for the first time.
So the people who came to the governor’s homepage for comment are completely unnecessary and, ultimately, dangerous. The homepage is a public forum, an official management platform for public tax-supporting employees.
In an interview with the Washington Post, the spokesperson for Hogan, Amelia Shas, defended the actions of the Governor, saying that she believed that she was merely trying to shield their comments from restraint.
But they were too hasty to describe it as a flood beast or cynic overflowing the network.
The Washington Post spoke face-to-face with people who had been blocked by Hogan.
They are just ordinary people talking to their chosen leaders: they are teachers, small business owners and priests, not flood beasts.
They have expressed their comments in depth, with respect, and not in a bad way.
The pastor quoted the Bible in his post, calling on Hogan to remember his Catholic faith.
Lakshmi Salma Lamani, a barrister in Bowie, Maryland, was not cynical, but she asked about hate crimes.
In the news story review section of the Washington Post, she wrote, “I was polite to comment that I was disappointed that he had not responded to hate crimes and other recent news incidents.
Nor do I like to have a group of people comment on the same subject, because they are simply ignored by some, who think they are so-called people's minds, rather than treating them as citizens of a nation concerned.”
The so-called “intense garbage information bombing” by the governor's staff may, in the view of others, be “persistent”.
The Facebook era made it easy to modify a message, merely blocking a critics or removing a negative comment.
It was also much cleaner than in the past, when the same effect required the dispatch of staff to collect and burn newspapers with critical comments or to arrest or silence protesters.
But that's what's happening now, just at the digital level.
Hogan is not the first public official to be blamed for scolding others on Facebook and other social media.
President Trump was being sued by Twitter users for blocking them on Twitter.
A landmark ruling came out last week in the state of Virginia on such issues.
According to the District Judge of Alexandria, James c. Catharris, in the United States, the Chairman of the Lawden County Supervisory Board blocked voters from her Facebook page in violation of the First Amendment.
The state governor of Kentucky, Matt Bevan (R), was also targeted by the American Civil Liberties Union for his use of Facebook and Twitter.
This shouldn't be so hard.
In the Washington era, affordable postage and the Internet had a similar impact.
The number of newspapers quadrupled between 1776 and 1800, with anonymous letters criticising his leadership.
And even then, Washington had an anonymous flood beast against him.
The pseudonyms of Julikla, Valerius, Belisaius and Porgius were used to write letters to newspapers critical of Washington's decision-making.
His office was flooded with petitions and his attitude to the Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation between His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom and the United States of America, signed with the United Kingdom, was criticized, according to historical documents collected by the George Washington newspaper Online Project.
But he didn't snort them.
Freedom of expression, dissent and speech are the foundations of this country.
And true leaders need to accept that.
The wiring of the city's wind and grass is holding people's sensitive nerves.
Restricted purchase is a hard bar for many urban real estate regulation policies.
In May 2017, Jinan introduced a six-month continuum of undergraduates in social security, with equal access to home purchase policies for residents of the local permanent household;
In June, Wuhan introduced a policy whereby university students could be registered with a diploma and an employment certificate within three years of graduation.
The policy was then added to the official statement that “university students can buy a house at less than 20 per cent of the market price”;
In July, Chengdu introduced the requirement that young people with undergraduate and higher degrees in field universities could apply for a residence permit.
In addition, cities or regions such as Quanshan, Shanghai, Shanghai, etc. have introduced “brain-in” policies that lower the threshold for home-buying by talent.
Zhang Xuan believes that it is in fact the competition of the major cities for the population, especially the talent, and the retention of the population, especially the talent, that makes the cities competitive, which is the most important of these real estate policies.
It has even been argued that this means that the time has come to cancel the “restrictive purchase” of the building.
The director said on that day that the film was planned for a long time and that the first adaptation of the script took place in 1999 and that he was even looking for the Golden City Wu to play Yan XIII.
Ronan Lafferty looks forward to enjoying his home at the Renaissance Club.
The East Loosean Renaissance Club holds the 25th Scottish Permanent Green Open Competition, with Ronan Lafferty, the former European champion, enjoying home for the next three days.
This Northerner led the next-door Archerfield Links to the finals last year, but eventually lost to Paul Iles. He now works for the new conference, representing Jerry Salvatti, the founder and CEO of the club, as the Ambassador of the race.
Lafferty said, “I witnessed the establishment of the Renaissance Club, and we will witness its glory through this game.
The athletes will see the best face and state of the field.
Jerry created this place like nothing else.
He was a keen supporter of the game and was very proud of what had been achieved here.
This is the best stage to show the field."
The Englishman, Ils, looked forward to the first crown, although in 32 years of his career, he had won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour.
The Southport athlete said, "This is really special.
I didn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was cancelled the second year I won.
It's amazing to be here.
It's wonderful to play golf here.
Last year's memories came to light, and for me and my wife Sharon, the victory last year was of special significance to us.
It's really a special memory, and we'll always remember it."
Returning to the homeland was Gary Orr, who had just turned 50 earlier this year, and then participated in the European Youth Tour.
This is his first competition in Scotland since the 2013 Scottish Golf Open.
“There will always be more meaning in homecoming games,” said Helensburger Orr.
You want to be good; but you can feel the extra pressure.
I really enjoyed being able to play again, and I've been playing golf.
I am satisfied with the current state of affairs.”
The three-member group on the scene was the former winner of the Maestro, Ian Woosnan, and the champions of the IYA, Paul Brodhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNuit.
There were six Scottish athletes, two of whom were Sam Torrance of Orr and former Leader of the Leed Cup, and four of whom were Andrew Odcorne, Stephen McCallyst, Bill Langmue and Ross Drummond.

In August, the Director-General of the Environment Inspectorate of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China, Zou Guangmin, introduced in Beijing a total of 57 cases of continuous daily punishment throughout the country, and the new amendment to the Environmental Protection Law, introduced earlier this year, significantly added to China ' s environmental enforcement efforts.
At present, environmental protection agencies in all parts of China can investigate and punish environmental offences by means of daily and continuous punishment, seizure, lock-down and transfer to administrative detention, and cooperate with the judicial authorities in the punishment of environmental offences.
According to the head of Zou, in August, a total of 335 cases of seizure and seizure were carried out in various parts of China; 177 were restricted or suspended; 189 were transferred to administrative detention; and 166 were transferred to suspected environmental pollution offences.
Of these, Henan imposed seven consecutive daily punishments, and China is now moving from last-end control to full-scale embedding to comprehensive and enhanced environmental pollution control.
Despite the downward pressure on the economy, China's Ministry of the Environment has previously made it clear that China should properly address the positioning of environmental protection in economic development and enhance the “green force” and that the more the economy grows, the less the environment can be relaxed and the better the role of environmental protection for the economy can be optimized.
Without the highest, but only higher, the stock price of the poo in Guizhou cannot be stopped on the path of high innovation.
On 9 January, A's “Sharelord” in Guizhou once again reached an all-time high of $782.52, with a total market value of $983 billion, just one step away from the trillion market value.
The guidance price of $1499 increased by $200 over the previous retail price of $1,299.
An announcement was issued on 28 December 2017 in Maotai, Guizhou, stating that, as a result of the study, the prices of the taupulega products had been adjusted appropriately since 2018, with an average increase of about 18 per cent.
This price increase has stimulated a sharp rise in the prices of Maotai in Guizhou, where, according to the Beijing Morning Reporter's statistics, the prices have risen by more than 14 per cent since the eight transactions announced with regard to the price increases in Maotai in Guizhou.
Statistics show that the total value of production for the first to third quarters of Guizhou Province in 2017 was $950 billion, and the market value of Mao Dai has pushed Guizhou ' s GDP far behind in the first three quarters of the past year.
Under the leadership of Maotai, white wine-listed companies have opened the price-fixing rhythm to reap the dividends of rising consumption.
Since 2017, the stock prices of most of the white wine companies listed on the market have continued to rise significantly, with the prices of the wells, the five grains, the mountain gin, the matai, etc. having more than doubled.

When people feel civilization, they become the builders of civilization. In the countryside, villagers from the Guangxi River pool are building new flush toilets in their homes.
Much has been achieved, and the active promotion of the toilet revolution will not only help people to stay away from disease, but will also lead to economic development to narrow the regional development gap.
The issue of the toilet is a public issue and a node for the development of social issues.
It is a national civilizational project that guides the layout from a national point of view and then addresses small social problems with varying degrees of participation.
That's how we complete all our shorts.

Poverty and death in Phnom Penh, Indonesia
Baddina Dejay doesn't cook with stoves.
She doesn't even use pots.
Her cabin is located in Enarotali, the capital of Paniai district, Papua, Indonesia, where the housewife usually simply puts a potato — the locals call it “nota” — directly into the fire.
Half an hour later, the burnt cassava was taken out by an unwashed hand and devoured by the wolf.
Daiji sits on the mud — she has no furniture, and this is where she does her daily household chores, such as washing clothes, washing water, which is so muddy, from the nearby marshlands.
There's a bucket in a room without a roof, and that's the outdoor toilet.
She was the youngest of the four wives of her husband, so she was not assigned to the field.
Polygamy is common here.
Of course, it is dangerous to work late: most men in the village are unemployed and many are drunk and there are many soldiers.
She said, "No one dares to walk around the village after 5 p.m.."
This is a rare glimpse of everyday life in the highlands of Papua, once a colony of the Netherlands, incorporated into Indonesia after the 1969 referendum, which was also controversial when only 1,026 elders were forced to vote by show of hands in the presence of the army occupying the area.
The current campaign, which is strongly for independence and opposition to Dutch rule, soon again targets the Government of Jakarta, which exercises high-handed rule over the region and isolates foreign journalists and defenders.
In 2003, the province was formally divided into the provinces of Papua and West Papua, while Papua New Guinea independently controlled the eastern part of the island.
Enarotali is remote and empty; it takes 90 minutes from the provincial capital, Jayapura, to fly to Nabyre and rent a car for five hours, and to roll the river all the way to the sea.
There's no public transport here.
In this town of approximately 19,000 people, outside the cabins are surrounded by bamboo fences, wrinkled iron-coated roofs are various kinds of rust-based yellow-brown covers.
Few Indonesians came, let alone journalists, and few foreigners.
Before the arrival of the Christian preacher, Mee Pago Papuans believed in a god called Uga Tamee.
There are other changes here as well.
Djay says, "We're not used to these clothes." She means her beautiful hand-weaving turban, her dark shirt and her fancy half skirt.
"We used to cover our bodies with leaves."
Papua is the poorest province in Indonesia, where 28 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line and is the region with the highest infant mortality rate and the lowest literacy rate in Asia.
But here, too, is Indonesia's gold continent.
Paniai County is up in the highlands, approximately the same size as New Jersey, with 153,000 people. The world’s largest and most profitable gold mine, Glasberg, is only 60 miles from here, owned by Philip McMollan Copper, based in Phoenix.
In 2015 alone, Felipe mined around $3.1 billion worth of gold and copper.
In addition, the timber resources of Papua are abundant, with an estimated value of $78 billion.
However, these vast resources are also the source of the tragedy of the Papuans, and that is why the powerful military forces of Indonesia have been able to suppress them all the time.
According to a 2005 New York Times survey report, Felipe paid nearly $20 million between 1998 and 2004 to local military personnel and troops, up to $150,000 for one official alone.
The growing demand of the Papuans for independence threatens the gold lord and as a result they have been subjected to cruel treatment.
According to defenders, more than 500,000 Papuans have been killed and thousands raped, tortured and detained by the Indonesian army since 1969.
According to the Asian Human Rights Commission, the mass killings in the highlands of the Papua tribe in the 1970s escalated into genocide.
Last year alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful protesters.
A 2016 report by the Catholic Brisbane General diocese, " We will lose everything " , contains evidence of the perfidence of the previous year, such as extrajudicial executions, torture — another reported that rape and electrocution were particularly widespread — and brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations.
According to the Indonesian researcher Andrias Harsono of Human Rights Watch, “violence occurs every day, and it is therefore difficult to calculate the number of victims”.
The repression began when the resources of Papua brought in large numbers of immigrants outside Indonesia.
Eighty-three per cent of the 3.5 million people in the province are Christians, but the demographic structure of Muslim economic migrants has changed since they arrived from the densely populated islands of Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra and Sulawesi.
The Javan snack stand sells a combination of fried chicken and vegetables, with peanut butter.
The locals struggled.
The 24-year-old Paniai native, Abos Yu, moved to the provincial capital, Jayapura, to find work, explaining that “those immigrants began selling chicken and vegetables in the traditional market at lower prices than the local Papuans.
This has caused the local Papuans — the mama-mama — to lose their markets.”
Indonesian President Zorko Widodo, commonly known as Zorkovi, vowed to address the inequality and abuse of power in Papua during his 2014 election campaign.
The carpenter's road to the Jakarta presidential palace was supported by 27 out of 29 districts, including Paniai.
But there has been no change in Papua, and today the locals feel betrayed.
In particular, “we are heartbroken, and in 2014 we voted for Zorkovi, hoping that he will live up to our wishes and restore justice”.
In fact, just two months after Zokovi took office in October, Paniai had the worst nightmare ever.
On December 7, 2014, Enarotali 11 children sang a Christmas hymn in front of the bonfire outside, and two Indonesian soldiers suddenly came on a motorcycle.
The frightened kids told them to turn on the headlights.
According to the local pastor, Aveit Tebai, one of the soldiers was dissatisfied with their tone and then returned with four soldiers.
The victims and witnesses claimed that the drunken soldiers were chasing the children with their guns.
One of the soldiers then opened fire on the children.
A 16-year-old, Yulianus Yemmer, was severely beaten and unconscious.
A few hours later, a fire broke out in the nearby government agency, the Electoral Commission building, and the incident escalated the following day.
Approximately 1,000 young Papuan men, women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice.
With the ritual bow, they danced the waita of the Mee Pago tribe of Papua -- running around and imitating the birds.
Some of the protesters started throwing stones at regular military posts.
According to an official document seen in Times magazine, when the mood continued to intensify, soldiers were ordered by internal radio: “If the crowd resists more than three times, shoot immediately.” However, this document was not made available to the local media.
The young Jeremiah Kayamu, the leader of the Enerotali Kego Koto neighbourhood, felt the imminent danger and appealed to the crowd to calm down and beg them to return to their homes.
But no one's in the mood to listen to him.
He stood on the porch of his beautiful cabin and told Time magazine, "When I turned back, my left wrist was suddenly shot."
Kayamu still does not know who fired the gun, but he said that the bullets came from among the assembled soldiers.
And he said, "Well, it was crowded, and they fired a lot of shots."
According to the cousin of the local citizen, Alfyous Juul, he witnessed the shooting and saw Alfyous Yur shot three times in his body.
Juhanes sadly told Time magazine, "I ran over to check his body to see if he was him.
I found him dead and I kissed him."
The chief inspector of the Papua police, Yuje Mende, told journalists that his subordinates were only at the “protective” police station, which had been attacked.
In 2015, the police spokesman for Papua, Chief of Police, Pugio Sulistio, said, “When there are threats to kill us, we must defend ourselves.
It's a matter of life and death."
According to HRW, five young protesters were killed and many more injured.
The news of the killing the following day spread slowly only in Jakarta.
Three weeks later, Zokovi gave a well-spoken speech in Jayapura, expressing deep sympathy to the families of the victims and vowing to address the abuse of power inherited from the history of Papua.
He said, “I hope that this case will be settled as soon as possible so that it will not happen again in the future”.
In October 2016, the Minister of Security, Valando, stated that he would establish a non-judicial mechanism to address the historical legacy of human rights violations.
But the excuse for the escape is almost instantaneous as well.
He said, “Most of the violations took place a long time ago.
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s.
The point is that we are committed to addressing these violations, but this still requires a process.”
Then, on 5 June, in Jakarta, during a conversation with the Times magazine, Virando went back and said that he had no plans to establish a complaints mechanism in Papua.
Instead, he said, “everything will be settled in accordance with the law”.
The United Nations had filed a complaint against Virando for “crimes against human rights” in the 1999 bloody independence vote in East Timor, but he said that 11 cases of human rights violations had been resolved in Papua, including the Pani incident.
The families of the victims of the Pani ' incident were scorned by these statements.
Juhanes said, “I have been interviewed four times in the last three years, but things have not progressed at all”.
Years later, he said, "I'm tired."
He still lives in fear.
He said, "I'm scared.
I fear being arrested and shot by the army.”
His brother, Yukabus, also believed that the people of Paniai were afraid to talk about the incident.
He stated that he had been beaten by the military after helping to bury the four victims.
He said, "When the body was buried, the military came to me."
The shooting did not stop.
On Tuesday, the Indonesian police opened fire on villagers in Dayay district, Paniai Neighbourhood.
A construction company manager refused to facilitate the transport of a unconscious man to the hospital, and a clash resulted in the death of one man and the wounding of 17 others, including children.
A 24-year-old man, Lavianus Dowu, drowned while fishing near the river and died on his way to the hospital.
The angry villagers protested in front of the company's field office.
The police said the villagers threw stones at the police, so the police fired warning shots.
However, the mobile anti-riot forces (the Indonesian paramilitary police) began shooting at the crowd and one person was killed.
Dominiya Badi, aged, told Time magazine that “we were all panicking and now are afraid that they will retaliate.” He lived near the hospital when he witnessed the wounded being rushed into the hospital.
"I've been at home for two days."
The Deyai Parliament has called for the police involved to be brought to justice and for the mobile anti-riot forces to be withdrawn from the area.
Panai has always been a land of right and wrong for the Indonesian government.
The lack of effective development has fuelled the grievances of the Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal tribes, which are scattered in the central highlands of Pani'ai.
Many joined the Free Papua Movement (OPM), a rebel army that claimed to protect the rights of the Papuans by spreading attacks and raids to abduct Indonesian soldiers.
Some of the top leaders of the Free Papua Movement were born in Paniai, including Tadius Yuji and Daniel Yodas Kogoa.
As a result, in recent years, thousands of Pani have been arrested and deliberately detained by the military under the guise of “preservation of national sovereignty”.
Some never showed up again.
In the eyes of Papuans, Paniai is a “forgotten place of tragedy”.
Poverty breeds discontent.
Enarotali sells rice that is poor, and the locals can't afford it.
The bread is simply out of reach.
The people here grow what they can eat: mainly the cassava and some fruit and leaf vegetables.
Farming is a woman ' s job, and each woman can take care of four or five pieces of potato land.
They usually use the bulk of the harvest to retain writers and the rest to sell on the local market.
Ten potatoes worth only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents).
Over time, economic inequality has spread among the local Papuans and new immigrants, whose numbers have increased significantly since the opening of the new route to the airport in Nabyre.
The few jobs available are usually in the hands of better educated and richer migrants.
Papuans have little money or the necessary skills to run competitive companies.
The Chairman of the Paniai Tribal Council, John Gobai, said, “Youth do not want to stay in this village ... because there is no job, no money”.
Papua is isolated from the world.
In addition, restrictions on international media coverage remain tight.
Earlier this year, French journalists Frank Escudi and Basel Lonchen were expelled from Papua because they “did not cooperate with the agencies concerned”, even though they had rarely obtained authorization to film.
According to Felim Kane, Deputy Director of Asia, Human Rights Watch, the electoral oath to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development was not realized.
In a statement, he stated that “if foreign journalists try to cover the disgruntled provinces of Papua and West Papua in the easternmost parts of Indonesia, they are at new risk: denial of visas and blacklisting”.
The absence of media oversight means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely confined to the neighbouring countries of Papua.
In March, six Pacific States — Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, Solomon Islands — asked the United Nations Human Rights Council to investigate “all types of widespread human rights violations” in Papua, including the Paniai shooting.
These countries have also supported the Free Papua Movement.
The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia, Almanata Nasir, who had no concern for the group's allegations, told the Jakarta journalists that “the democratic institutions in Indonesia and the freedom of the media are still in place, so that evidence of human rights violations is difficult to conceal”.
Locals want more foreign government attention.
According to an informed source, on 4 May, when the Dutch Ambassador for Human Rights, Keith Van Bar, led a delegation of officials to Jayapura, the local people broke the silence and cried, “We want freedom.” He also attended the meeting, but asked for anonymity.
Indonesia will hold its next presidential election in 2019, but the Papuans claim that they are unlikely to vote again.
The Chairman of the Tribal Council, Gobai, said that “Zokovi's intentions were good, but he was surrounded by people involved in the Pani's shooting”.
He wanted to let Zokovi know that the people of Paniai lived not only under the threat of a greedy army, but also with nothing, with few education and few public health-care services in the region.
Gobai says that the people of Paniai, like other Papuans, think that the vote they voted for Zokovi is a debt that he has to pay.
He said, "They don't need money, they need justice."
Even under threat and intimidation, the families of the victims of the Paniai shooting made their last symbolic protest: the body of the victim was buried opposite the military police post.
They know that justice may never come, but at least they will not let those responsible forget their crimes.
"My family was killed.
What else can we do?"
On 10 February 2017, the CSRC approved the initial application of Guangdong Plumbing Houses and Homes Co. Ltd., and issued a permit to enter the market for a long-term settlement, after having just been approved by the IPO for more than 20 days.
Industry sources argue that, with the remixing of houses and the subsequent listing of Europa homes, the area of custom-made homes, which was already in the air, will move from product competition to capital competition.
At the beginning of the new year, the announcement that a typical representative brand-based home in the area of customizing the home was about to be marketed attracted the attention of the entire household industry.
Reuters, 9 Beijing Time, stated that the release on Tuesday of the first set of auto-drive components, jointly developed with Harman International, and the information and entertainment solution, by Samstar Electronics, was an important initiative of the company to enter the electronic market for military vehicles.
Three star electronics acquired Haman International about a year ago.
At the Consumer Electronics Fair (CES) held in Las Vegas this week, Samsung released vehicle cameras with collision alerts, traffic diversion alerts, cruise control functions, which were developed in cooperation with Haman.
Three Stars plans to start out this year with this camera system, which is built on technology such as automatic machine learning and scaling-up.
The three stars also display a “digital cockpit”, which, even if the driver is not the owner, can make the vehicle more personal, as the system allows users to download the driver's information from mobile devices and clouds.
Tonight, the 20th regular race of the CBA is about to begin, which also means the second half of the CBA tournament in the 2016-2017 season.
Once again, the fire swallowed the Tower of Dubai's Torch.
On Friday, a fire broke out in one of the world ' s highest residential buildings in Dubai, forcing hundreds of residents to flee the high 337 m, 79th floor super-high building.
It was the second fire in just two years that swept the high-rise building, and it happened in the sky tower, known as the torch.
The building has been evacuated, no injuries have been reported and no cause of the fire has yet been identified.
“We're sleeping, and then we wake up with a fire alarm, and people start screaming.
We ran down the stairs, down from 50 floors, and it took about 10 minutes, "A resident named George told Reuters.
According to the Dubai Civil Defence Authority, the fire brigade extinguished the fire around 4 p.m. on local time (Greenwich Standard Time 00000) and is in the process of cooling the building.
The Government indicated that efforts were being made to provide refuge for the affected persons.
The accident could rekindle worldwide concerns about the safety of the use of outer-wall materials in high-rise buildings.
A survey carried out by the management of the Ferris Tower following the fire in 2015 found that most of the damaged objects were overstretched walls for decoration and insulation.
The British police have indicated that they believe that the problems with the insulation and overpanding systems of the Glenfield Building in London may have contributed to the rapid spread of the June fire, which killed about 80 people.
The Williams convoy also suggested a possible return of Massa, although he had announced his retirement.
On 9 January, just one month from the opening of the Ping Chang Winter Olympics in Korea, the atmosphere in the country became stronger with the spread of the Olympic fire from the south to the north and the intense preparatory work.
Korean public opinion expects this long-defeated inter-Korean talks to bring a “brown egg” to the Ping Chang Winter Olympics in a month's countdown.
On 1 November of last year, the Pingchang Winter Olympic Conference holy fire arrived in Korea.
The heat of the fire was directly reflected in the sales of tickets to the Pixan Winter Olympics.
Just over two months ago, the Pixen Winter Olympics ticket sales rate remained at only 32 per cent, the Winter Paralympics ticket sales rate was 4.3 per cent, and the low ticket sales rate was once a source of concern for the people of the Pixen Winter Olympics.
But, as Lee Xifan, Chairman of the Panchang Winter Olympic Organizing Committee, recently predicted to journalists, “The Winter Olympics are becoming more hot with the passing of the fire across Korea, and it is believed that the sales of tickets will soon improve”.
According to Korean media reports, as of 3 January, Pingchang Winter Olympics ticket sales had reached 64 per cent, and the Winter Paralympics ticket sales were over 50 per cent.
In order to encourage foreigners to go to the Korean Olympics, the Korean Ministry of Justice also announced on 8th that it would extend the stay in Korea for up to 120 days for foreigners visiting Korea to watch the Ping Chang Winter Olympics.
The investigation found that more than one in five American travellers boarded the plane with prohibited items.
A survey of aircraft passengers found that more than 20 per cent of passengers had boarded the aircraft with illegal items, intentionally or unintentionally, through a United States Transportation and Security Administration checkpoint, and that at least 6 per cent of the passengers had boarded the aircraft unintentionally carrying prohibited knives or other bladed objects.
Less than 1 per cent of passengers declared that they only later discovered that they were travelling with the wrong gun, ammunition or explosives.
The investigation of more than 1,000 persons was carried out by Stratos Jet Charters Inc., which also found that young travellers were more likely to be in flagrant disregard of the rules.
19.7 per cent of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately attempted to board TSA prohibited items were millennium generations, compared to less than 15 per cent of the X generation.
The most common items of deliberate passing of TSA security agents are food and drinks.
More than 3 per cent admitted to having intentionally carried the blades through security checks, while 2.2 per cent of female respondents and 3.7 per cent of male respondents indicated that they had intentionally boarded the plane with prohibited drugs.
The company stated that the purpose of the investigation of the country ' s travellers was to find out the number of people who had boarded aircraft by accident and intentionally carrying embargoed goods.
It is not surprising that those most likely to carry embargoed goods through security checks — intentionally or unintentionally — are those who fly most frequently.
However, it noted that the TSA Guide was somewhat complicated and difficult to understand.
People are often uncertain as to what and how many liquids they can carry.
So it's not surprising that TSA caught the most prohibited liquids.
It was once thought that TSA might have used books as an embargo.
Domestic flights are allowed to carry liquids, but international flights are not allowed to carry liquids.
U.S. EPA Prutt changed his mind about Obama's era emissions reduction regulations.
One day after being prosecuted by 15 states, the Director of Environmental Protection, Scott Prute, changed his earlier decision to delay the implementation of Obama's era air emissions reduction.
Prute proposed this change, as the Environmental Protection Agency was able to respond more quickly to the needs of state bodies that regulate the environment than the previous Government.
He makes no reference to the legal challenges brought by the Federal Court of Appeal against his former position.
The controversy focused on setting 1 October as the deadline for states to start meeting the 2015 terrestrial ozone standard.
In June, Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance for one year in order to give the Environmental Protection Agency more time to study the plan and avoid “disrupting local decision-making or impeding economic growth”.
Prior to his appointment by President Donald Trump, Prout, the State Attorney General of Oklahoma, had long opposed the tightening of environmental regulations.
Since their arrival in Washington, Prute has repeatedly turned to preventing or delaying anti-regulations in the chemical and fossil fuel industries.
Wednesday's sudden reversal is one of the most recent legal obstacles to the return of Prute's supervision to the agenda.
Last month, the Washington Federal Court of Appeal ruled that the Director of Environmental Protection had exceeded his authority in an attempt to delay the implementation of the Obama administration ' s requirement that oil and gas companies monitor and mitigate methane leakage.
In a statement issued on Wednesday night, Prute proposed a major shift in his attitude towards the ozone standard, expressing the need to strengthen the commitment of the Environmental Protection Agency to work with the states to adopt complex procedures to achieve new standards.
Prute stated that “under the previous government administration, EPA usually did not meet the prescribed deadline, then waited for the radical groups and others to sue and agreed to set a specified timetable by agreement.” He had initiated more than a dozen prosecutions against EPA in his previous work.
“We do not believe in regulation through litigation, and we take deadlines seriously.
We also take the rules and authorities seriously.”
Nevertheless, the EPA statement states that Prute may again use his “renewal of authority and all other legally available authorizations” to ensure that the provisions are consistent with “good policy and best available information”.
Republicans in Congress are pushing for extensive rewriting of the ozone layer regulations.
The House Bill, approved last month, aims to delay the 2015 rule by at least eight years.
This measure has not yet been voted on in the Senate.
The State Attorney of New York, Eric Schneiderman, led the State Union this week to sue the United States Environmental Protection Agency for its intention to maintain legal pressure.
Schneiderman said, "The reverse of the US EPA — after we filed a lawsuit — was an important victory for the health and safety of 6.7 million New Yorkers, with more than 115 million American communities directly affected by smoke emissions."
The States of California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington, D.C., joined the New York State in this case.
Ground-based ozone is formed by the reaction of common pollutants from vehicles, power plants, refineries, chemical plants and other sources to sunlight exposure in the atmosphere.
The resulting smoke can cause severe respiratory problems to sensitive populations, causing thousands of premature deaths each year.
Of course, public health advocates and environmentalists cheered Prute for his amazing transformation.
Lori Ann Bird, Biodiversity Center, stated: “It is disturbing that this common-sense measure is under great pressure from the heads of the departments that protect the air we need to breathe”.
“We must end our struggle with the Trump Government's ideological movement to cater to polluters and special interest groups.”
In addition to external factors such as the heating of steel, enterprises are also struggling to move on to lower costs.

Since the second half of 2009, Xiaoshanwood sales have remained at a high level, particularly this spring, when Xiaoshan Hsiao Hsiao's sales rose again to an all-time high, with huge increases in sales and prices. According to statistics, from January to June of this year, Xiaoshan hill saw a 48 per cent increase in sales revenue compared to the same period last year, with the largest increase in nearly 20 years.
The Deputy Director of the Xiao Mountain Forestry Authority, Xi Hae Yong, said that, along with good sales, the production of Xiaoshan Hana-wood had also developed more rapidly.
During the past two years, the area of Xiaoshan flowerwood cultivation has been expanded by 30,000 acres, with a total area of 180,000 acres, while at the same time there has been an active out-of-area development, with Xiaoshan seedling farmers establishing 80,000 acres of flowerwood bases throughout the country, an increase of 30,000 acres over 2008.
In parallel with the expansion of the area under cultivation, the quality of seedlings has also been improving, the value of nurseries has been increasing, large-scale, high-quality seedlings have been retained and some of them have been sold.
He also warned that, in the face of the current boom, producers should face with calm and objective analysis, recognizing that the demand for flowers in society will be long-term and increasing, while recognizing that there will be greater competition in the market.
On the morning of 13 July Beijing time, the United States company Somaltus filed a suit before the Eastern Texas District Court, alleging that Apple had violated a battery technology patent that it had applied for in 2010.
The same patents were used by the company in the past to sue Fuzu, Associative, Samsung, Sony and Toshiba.
The suit alleged that both iPhone 6s and similar apple equipment violated US patent No. 7,657,386, entitled Integrated Battery Services.
The plaintiff sought compensation in cash or a patent fee for post-judgement tort equipment.
It appears from the indictment that the plaintiff argued that the iPhone ' s fast-filling function violated the company ' s patent.
iPhones with fast charge functions quickly charge up to 80% of the charge, followed by trickle-up.
Somaltus is in fact a so-called “proprietary hooligan” because it does not provide obvious products and services and it is difficult to find relevant information online.
However, they have been successful in reaching an out-of-court settlement with car manufacturers such as Ford and Japanese.

According to leaked telephone records, Trump had pressured Mexico to pay for the construction of the border.
The Washington Post leaked records of calls between the President of the United States, Donald Trump, and the leaders of Mexico and Australia.
On 27 January, in a call to the President of Mexico, Enrique Pena Nieto, Trump urged him to stop publicly stating that he would not pay for the proposed border wall.
It was reported that the President of the United States had expressed dissatisfaction with his public criticism of the wall, allegedly saying to him, “Don't tell the media”.
During the presidential campaign, Trump undertook to build the separation wall on the southern border of the United States and solemnly announced that Mexico would pay for the project.
A record of his calls with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also made public, showing an intense exchange between them.
Trump told Turnbull that the United States deal with the repatriation of refugees to Australia was “preposterous”, “disgusting” and “breathless”, and that he had recommended that the United States ban the resettlement of refugees, and was now insisting on the deal brokered by the Obama administration, which would make him look like a “dumb”.
Trump hung up after telling Turnbull that this was the most unpleasant call of the day.

In accordance with the joint statement issued by the two sides, the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea will send a high-level delegation and a delegation from the National Olympic Committee to participate in the Ping Chang Winter Olympics.
In addition, the Democratic People ' s Republic of Korea will send groups of athletes, cheerleaders, artists, journalists, etc. to visit Korea; the Korean side will provide the necessary facilities.
It also agreed to reduce the current military tension and decided to hold talks between the Korean and Korean military components.
The report analyses the results of the questionnaire survey involving 1,045 foreign tourists who visited Seoul last December.
According to the report, the per capita purchasing value of foreign tourists is 1.06 million won.
Of these, China has the largest per capita amount of shopping, at 2.13 million won, 6.5 times as much as Japan and 3.2 times as many tourists from the United States and Europe.
Asked about the purpose of travelling to Seoul, 62.2 per cent of Chinese tourists responded to “shopping” and 94.9 per cent of Chinese tourists bought cosmetics.
96.3 per cent of Chinese tourists shop in urban duty-free shops, at a cost of 1.56 million won per capita.
This year, at the TFBOYS 3rd anniversary fan meeting, Jin Joon-tin acted as an active music producer.
The Moor Beach tragedy: Racist lynchings of activists and justice
A 1948 Ford Mercury car ran through a crowd of viewers in the town of Monroe, Georgia, towards the little Moor Beach Bridge.
The vehicle was carrying four black passengers and a white driver, and a group of white men with guns went in front of the bridge, blocking the vehicle ' s way.
The thug's leader, a middle-aged man in a striped suit, took a deep breath of cigars and saw his eyes in the windshield.
The passengers in the car were full of fear.
"We want-- Roger!" the man shouts.
"Get him out of the car!"
A young black man was dragged down from the previous row of passenger seats and the screams broke the silence.
Fortunately, on July 22, this terrible scene was just a repeat.
But when Roger's neck was covered with a rope, almost all the surrounding viewers made a real sound of breathing.
Since 2005, civil rights activists have returned to the Moor Beach Bridge, reproducing the scene of two black couples, Roger and Dorothy Malcolm, as well as George and Mérè Dossi, who were hanged by three K lynchings in 1946.
No one has ever been charged with murder.
“Although we know who they are, and although we have seen them in the community, none of them has been arrested over the years, which is incredible,” Tyrone Brooks, who helped organize this repetition, said.
“This is the stain of history, the burden of our souls.”
Brooks, 71 years old, was a former member of Georgia's Parliament and a lifelong rights activist.
For him, the repetition was a remarkable call to action, reminding the people of the Monroe community every year that injustice had never been redressed.
“We want to prosecute, we want to close, we want to cure, we want to reconcile, but we must first get justice,” he said.
“Unless we get justice, we will not be cured and reconciled.”
On July 27, 1946, the Coroner laid a sheet of bed on the body of a victim of lynching on Moor Beach.
According to the FBI file obtained by the National Broadcasting Corporation of the United States, more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties are suspected of being involved in lynchings.
None of them, however, has been prosecuted.
Although suspects have been at large for decades, civil rights activists have stated that the dual motives for lynchings are well known throughout the town: political and sexual.
In April 1946, a Supreme Court ruling enabled black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the initial elections later in the summer of that year.
According to the FBI, at about the same time, the black tenant Roger Malcolm stabbed a white landlord, Barnett Hearst, in a fight that looked like it was for a woman.
Brooks said that the town rumor was that Hearst slept with Malcolm's wife, Dorothy, and that her baby was not her husband's.
According to the FBI, on July 25, 1946, the prominent white landlord, Roy Harrison, spent $600 bailing Malcolm out of prison.
Dorothy and cousins Michael Murray and George Dorsey accompanied him to prison.
However, when they came back from prison to the Moor Beach Bridge, a mob of thugs surrounded the car.
“It turns out that Harrison organized and ordered the murder,” an FBI report concluded.
“It is clear that there is a conspiracy between state and local law enforcement authorities, who not only participated in the murder, destroyed the evidence, but also concealed the identity of the witness.”
Brooks is very concise.
He said, “This is a tragic vote.”
"They were killed, and the murderer sent a message to the black people of this community: 'If you register and vote, you will have the same end.'"
For almost a decade, Cassandra Green has been responsible for leading the annual recurrence of the lynching at the Moor Beach Bridge.
Her modus operandi was clear, well-known and deeply racist. Many hoped that that racism would cease to exist in the United States.
It's hard to see, not harder to see, but Green says that's the key.
“We do not want to talk about lynching, because lynching brings us to the ugly side of all,” she said.
“But if you don't listen to me or hear me tell my story, I can't have a relationship with you.”
This year's performance began in June, with nearly 30 actors on the first day - a dozen whites, the rest of them blacks - combing in a room and listening to Green's release of a well-rehearsed performance overview.
Wade Malbau is the co-director of Green.
He's been playing the role of the three Ks for years, but he says it's never easy.
"I feel so dirty because I'm not the same person," Malbau said.
“But I think it is very important to keep this history alive, because we do not want to go back to that era.”
In the room, the actors Roger Malcolm and Barnetthurst, Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona, rehearsed their lines.
At the beginning of the scene, Malcolm shouted and pushed Hearst away, angry that he had slept with his wife Dorothy.
"I said, get out of my land!"
Rascona echo.
And then they fought.
And then everybody laughter.
Green laughed the most.
"What's going on?
He was panicking and confused.
Am I too much?
"No," Green laughed.
"I just think white people don't say 'ah' when they strike back."
"Yes," another black actor plays fun.
"You have to be strong."
As a result, the energy in the room has changed; the feeling of fraternity has driven the feeling of discomfort away.
Everyone tried to do so not only to perform the scene, but also to honour the memory of the four victims.
The scene begins again.
This time, when Rascona said the word "ah", the tone was sharp and strong.
No one's laughing.
The reoccurrence came to a strong and quick end.
The screams, the gunshots, the silence.
A woman in a funeral black, standing next to the body of an actor, sang the words of condolence of Billy Harold, the strange fruit.
Her voice slammed over other words.
A hundred yards away, about 40 viewers are swirling their sweat and tears.
Blacks and whites make up almost half of the audience.
There was a couple who came from Isaka, New York, to see the show, and a lot of people lived near the road.
Brooks took them to the cemetery of Malcolm and Dorothy for nearly eight hours, and everybody was enduring Georgia's uncomfortable wet fever.
Until then, the murderer remained obsessed. But now, on the same land where lynchings took place, there was anxiety in the air.
When the last note of the song disappeared, Green asked people to come closer and examine the body of the actor.
The children bowed down, watched fake blood and corpses, whispering to each other.
"They're not really dead," a little boy mumbling, like a reminder to himself.
A few minutes later, Green thanked the crowd and then the show ended.
The actor threw away the lynching rope and wiped out the tears.
Brad Shaw embraces a man in a suit who plays the three K's leader, Malbau.
Nick Rascona hugged two of his colleagues and wept in their arms; the emotions in the performance eventually infected him.
“It's okay,” one of the women whispered.
“We know that your heart is not that way.
There's a reason you're doing this."
After that, the audience sat down and had dinner with the actors.
On the same table, a white couple from Atlanta chatted closely with a black couple they had just met, talking about reoccurrence.
Dennis Duplinski had difficulty finding words to describe how she felt after watching.
“It is hard to imagine those terrible words and acts... which are made out of people like you, because they look just like you,” she said.
“This, to me, really makes me think that lynching is still going on,” she added, “now this is just a police shooting.”
In the room, Tyrone Brooks sits at the table watching, tasted and reminiscent of civil rights.
He said he'd already started planning next year's performance.
“Recurrence is an encouraging way, because it describes the horrors we have experienced, but it is also very educational,” he said.
“If you do not learn from it, it may happen again.
Those who do not study and do not know their own history are doomed to repeat their mistakes.”
For gas market-based reforms, the importance of “net independence” reforms is self-evident, but resistance and controversy are also greater.
The journalist was informed by Kaiji Hebei Group that at 11.25 a.m. on 7 a.m., an explosion occurred at the emulsification workshop of the Kaiser Group Chemical Ltd., located in the ancient smelting area of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, in which 13 operators were trapped.
To date, of the 13 people trapped, one has been rescued and rushed to hospital, while the remaining 12 are under intense search and rescue.
It is known that the site has been closed and that the local public security, fire and medical services are in the process of being rescued.
According to witnesses, there was a loud noise and an instant mushroom cloud emptied.
According to members of the Open Group, which organized a search and rescue on the ground, Tangshan Kaihai (Group of Chemical Industries) Ltd. was located in the north of Zhao's village in the ancient smelt district of Tangshan City, Hebei Province, and was a State-approved site production company for civilian blast equipment, which was established in 1958 and was formerly known as the 60-O-2 factory of the Open Mining Authority.
Since his release 15 years ago, this newspaper (journalist Choi Jian) must have produced a new album every year, but last year he lost a rare date.
The fans, however, did not express any displeasure, but instead came together to give their blessing, because the reason for the failure was that Jay was happy as a father.
After a full year and a half, Jayron finally arrived in Beijing yesterday to present the first piece of his father's promotion, as well as his 14th album of his musical career, " Jay's Pre-Sleep Story " .
US Media: China Air Force Engineering University Scientists researching laser satellites for the removal of space debris
The American media reported on January 18 that Chinese scientists made a bold and innovative proposal to use large lasers to clean up chaotic Earth orbits and destroy old satellites and their sky trash.
According to a 15 January report on the United States Newsweek website, researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University wrote a paper entitled " A study on small-scale space debris transformation models for space-based laser removal " , which describes how space debris can be irradiated by lasers into smaller, less hazardous fragments through the use of space-based platform lasers.
It was reported that space debris had been the concern of international space agencies for many years, and NASA had considered a variety of options for tracking, detecting and removing man-made debris.
Large-scale space debris is removed by means of meganets used to clean and collect waste, as well as magnets that can be used to exorcise them out of orbit. Chinese scientists conducted laser simulation studies and concluded that this would be an effective way to clean up Earth orbit.
The summary of the paper states that: “(Simulation studies) provide the necessary theoretical basis for the application of space-based platform laser space debris removal technology.”
A 2014 study by Lockheed-Martin, the giant of the United States defence industry, found about 200 threats per day for satellites in orbit.
High-speed debris moving along Earth orbit is considered a serious threat to future space missions and has been described by experts from the European Space Agency as a “lethal chain of threats”. High-speed debris has continued to grow over the past year.
As also reported on January 17, the United States monthly magazine Mass Machinery website, space is essentially empty, but space next to the Earth is becoming increasingly crowded. Each satellite we send into space will eventually become another piece of debris around the Earth and, over time, it will accumulate.
The more debris there is, the more likely a satellite still in operation will be hit by debris, thereby damaging or destroying an investment worth millions of dollars.
It was reported that all space agencies had plans to remove space debris in the future.
NASA was considering the use of jet gases to reduce the speed of debris and de-orbit it, Europe was considering launching a satellite with a large net to capture debris and bring it back to Earth, and Japan was thinking of using an electrical chain to capture debris.
For the time being, China is also proposing a solution to the problem of space debris, namely, the use of a large laser to strike floating space debris into less harmful small fragments.
According to a paper published by a group of researchers at the Chinese Air Force Engineering University in the German monthly optical magazine, the installation of such a laser on a satellite would be effective enough to clean space, at least on the basis of simulations.
It was reported that the only way to prove effectiveness was to conduct tests and that there were no arrangements for such missions, but perhaps sooner or later a laser device would be installed on a satellite and put into space.
Once that has been done, we can finally start ridding space debris once and for all.

Retrenchment of 3000 positions by PSC, substantial reduction of dividends to revive operations
On Friday, the British Education Group called for an additional 3000 posts to be cut and a substantial reduction in the medium-term dividends of 72 per cent, as it had begun another restructuring project to deal with operational pressures.
According to Chief Executive Officer John Fallon, most of the post reductions will take place in the second half of 2018 and the first half of 2019, after a reduction of 4000 posts in the previous reorganization.
PET announced in May plans to reduce the cost of a further Pound300 million ($394 million) in the third cost-cutting project in order to revive operations that are hit by the rapid development of digital learning.
Last month, the company agreed to sell its shares in the Penguin Landon Bookhouse to its partner, Betasman, and published a report that its basic sales rose by 1 per cent in the first half of the year to Pound205 billion, but that this year ' s outlook remains unchanged.
A few days ago, the China Association issued a serious notice, severely shunned the phenomenon and was prepared to impose a heavy penalty on violators for their lifetime.
A suicide bombing attack on the convoy in Kabul killed NATO soldiers
According to official sources, a military convoy was hit by suicide bombers in the Afghan capital, Kabul, killing one NATO soldier and injuring several others.
The NATO statement stated that five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured.
According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians also died in this incident in the Karabagh area of the city.
This is the latest violent attack on Afghanistan, the Tuesday bombing of the Herat mosque, which killed more than 30 people.
On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi Embassy in Kabul.
According to NATO statements, an explosion occurred on Thursday night and a joint Afghan-NATO coalition patrol was attacked by “individuals carrying improvised explosive devices”.
The statement stated that all the wounded were currently in a stable state and were being treated at the United States military hospital at Bagram Air Force Base.
According to journalists, the growing Taliban and so-called Islamic State (IS) organizations in the Karabakh region have raised serious concerns about NATO forces stationed near Bagram.
According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, compared to about 20 per cent in the capital.
A suicide car bomb attack in late July in the Shia-dominated area of Kabul killed at least 30 people.
The Taliban claimed to have launched the attack.
On 31 May, a huge explosion took place in the centre of Kabul, killing more than 150 people, the deadliest armed attack in the country since the overthrow of the Taliban by the United States-led multinational force in 2001.
The violence highlighted the dangerous security situation in Afghanistan as United States President Donald Trump weighed whether or not to increase Afghan troops in support of his army and police.
Journalists have reported that the suicide bombings in Kabul in recent weeks have also triggered a crisis of public confidence in the Government and its policies, in particular the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani.
U.S. National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) action to overturn resolution and delay smoke regulations
When Obama came into office, he imposed a ban on all types of emissions that cause smoke, 15 states, because of the indictment against the US National Environmental Protection Agency. One day after the indictment, EPA overthrew the regulation.
The U.S. EPA announced on Wednesday its decision to continue the so-called “Ozone Target 2015” and committed the EPA to work with the states.
In a statement, the United States Director of Environmental Protection, Scott Pruett, said, “We have confidence in dialogue with and are committed to responding to national partners”.
In June, Pruitt announced that EPA planned to postpone the implementation of the ozone compliance area standard until October 2018, with a one-year delay - based on this standard, measurements of existing smoke pollution in some areas to determine which areas should be reduced to meet air quality standards.
The main Democratic states, as well as the District of Columbia, filed a lawsuit on Tuesday alleging that the act was unlawful.
As part of a broader agenda, the authorities of President Donald Trump have been working to revive the environmental regulations introduced by former President Barack Obama to stimulate economic growth.
But these efforts have provoked opposition from Democrats and conservative groups, who fear that more emissions will affect public health.
The US EPA website states that breathing ozone-containing air “reduces lung function and increases respiratory symptoms”, such as asthma.

McKee Garcia and Vasili Lomachenko met for the first time to explore possible future battles.
The most notable of the under-pound boxing contest, which will take place shortly, is the first meeting on Thursday between Vasili Lomachenko and Macky García, who are currently in a state of potential conflict.
In separate rooms in Los Angeles ESPN's office, the undefeated World Boxing Council lightweight champion García took the lead down the corridor, paying tribute to the world boxing organization's super-featile champion, Lomachenko.
At the Showtime boxing competition held on Saturday, the referee unanimously concluded that García had won the victory of Adrian Bronner, the world champion of the four subdistricts, and that both fighters had become the top five players on the same weight list.
Garcia reached out to her right hand and said, "How are you, champ?
Good luck with that."
In the ESPN competition on Saturday night at 7 p.m., Lomachenko won Miguel Mariaga and preserved his position.
When both of them took photographs, Egis Clemás, the agent of Lomachenko, pointed out that the potential confrontation between the two players depended on “the perfect size”.
"I was lightweight before," García.
"I went up against Bronner, but I didn't weigh that much.
I'm a little overweight compared to 140 pounds.
I want to go back to lightweight.
And he had to be lightweight (135 pounds) before we could fight.
That's what fans want.
Then we meet them."
This was agreed to by Lomachenko.
"The boxing world needs this battle."
Clemás asked him whether he should pay the fees, and part of his strategy was to have Lomachenko run a premiere with a 135-pound player later this year, hoping to set a date with Garcia next summer. García was also interested in a match with Jorge Linarez-Luc Campbell’s victors, following the Forum’s light-weight boxing contest of September 23.
“Since all the fans are asking the question, the fight may be on a charge-by-charge basis,” says Garcia. Then he expresses his openness to the competition on the network that offers the best financial options.
“We are the principals.
No other person could have generated such a great deal of attention.
As long as they're ready..."
García appreciates Lomachenko as an “excellent player” and may be watching his boxing match on Saturday.
But Lomachenko was hesitant about Garcia's praise, saying he thought the tri-district champion from Riverside looked "so slow." Sorry, Mikey, you're going to be out.
García said that the focus was on showing the power of the fist and then boxing.
They all said they could feel the momentum of their boxing competition.
“This is the battle that has to be fought,
Concern and hot speech are beyond the reach of other boxing competitions.
I'm very happy to be in the race, "Jascia says.
He said, “I've been waiting for top fighters, and this time it's Mikey's turn.
This will be a great battle.”
Promotion of the environment yesterday, the West Side organized a major environmental volunteering event on the theme “Green Home, Powering West City”
Unlike the traditional methods of garbage collection and distribution of promotional materials, the sponsors have set up six special game experience areas, including water-saving toilet displays, enzyme production experiences, traffic domino dominoes, etc.
At present, in the country, many young people have given up their studies because of the targeting of professional golfers and are on a smooth career path, let alone universities.
The early completion of the 11 per cent reduction target by officials of the China Development and Reform Commission (CDRC) has given strong rebirth expectations to the steel industry, which is constrained by electricity restrictions.
Although the steel plant has not yet received a clear notification from the local government that the energy-saving emission reduction effort has been closed, it is estimated in industry that, on or about 15 December 2010, the restricted steel plants in various parts of the country will be returning to production and the price of steel may begin to be pressured.
No notification of the end of the restrictions has been received, but in practice the pressure from businesses has been considerably lower than in September and October, when a private steel company in Hebei province told journalists.
The northern branch of the river has repeatedly issued restricted production documents and, at one point, has imposed restrictions on the production of enterprises by means of forced locks.
Journalists have learned from local businesses that steel plants in most of Hebei have now resumed work and production restrictions have been eased.
My steel network analyst, Zhang Iron Mountain, predicted that the end demand for building steel would gradually shift from strength to weakness as the north is wintering.
The phase-out of energy-saving emission reductions will lead to the resumption of most steel plants by 15 December and the arrival of products in local markets by New Year ' s Day.
The increase in the availability of resources will put some pressure on the current boom in steel prices.
On December 20, Chinese smart car-related sources told journalists at www.thepaper.cn that Chinese communications had acquired 70% of the shares of the Pearlhai Guangbus and, on that basis, formed a smart car team for Chinese communications, which was “undisclosed, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. We are looking for talent, and the future of smart cars will be a very important business for Chinese communications.
According to the foreign media, on 19 July, local United States time, Gary Marshall, a prominent Hollywood director, died of pneumonia complications in a hospital in Burbank, California, at the age of 81.

In the history of the National Feathers' finals, no one has ever taken a double crown at the same time.
The 68th Emmy Awards ceremony was held yesterday in Los Angeles, United States, on the evening of September 18, local time.
This year's drama, “Operator” and “Operator” competition, led to the defeat of an old actor by two newcomers: the Best Man Prize was won by the first-nominated Hero of the Hacker Corps, Rami Marek, and the Best Female Actress Award was won by Tatiana Masrani of Black Orphans.
The big winner of the Emmy Award is the Game of Power and the American Crime Story.
U.S. Crime Story is a collection of major prizes in the category of miniatur/television films, while the Game of Power takes 12 prizes (including technical ones), including the best drama series, the best director and the best writer, the three heavy-pound prizes.
To this end, the Game of Power has won 38 Emmy Prizes as the largest television drama in history.
Unfortunately, this year's Game of Power failed on the actor's awards.
Just a few years ago, the ability to engage in the field of wind investment was limited to those who had started a company and later joined the company, or those who wanted to do more.

International Online News (journalist Liu Xing): On 18th, the Economic and Commercial Branch of the Italian Embassy in China organized the China-Italy Environmental Relations Conference, which brought together experts from enterprises and scientific institutions from both countries to exchange views and reach a positive consensus on cooperation between the two countries in the field of renewable resources in the light of the new situation.
It was reported that China ' s participation in the meeting consisted mainly of China Renewable Resources Development Ltd., China ' s International Technology Transfer Collaborative Network, and that it consisted of institutions such as the Global Energy Environment Exchange and the Bologna Regional Business Federation of Italy.
The representative of Italy said that Italy, with its diverse environmental technologies and solutions in the field of renewable resources, proposed pilot projects with China in the areas of industrial waste disposal, waste oil treatment and waste incineration equipment, and looked forward to applying China ' s environmental cooperation experience to other parts of the globe.
Publication of the results of the latest age assessment test for asylum-seekers in Sweden
The latest method used by Swedish asylum-seekers to medically assess their age is the latest results, which show that over 80 per cent of the victims were sentenced to over 18 years of age, but not all of them believed in their accuracy.
The Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine (R?ttsmedicinalverket) started this test earlier this year.
After being accused of failing to accurately assess the age of some of the refugees who claim to be minors, the Swedish Migration Board (Migrationsverket) designed these tests with a view to conducting a more accurate age assessment during the asylum process.
To date, the Swedish Migration Board has brought 6880 testers, and the Centre for Forensic Medicine has now published the results of a total of 2481 testers for the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017.
Eighty per cent (2002 persons) were sentenced to 18 years of age or over, but in another 25 tests, the Swedish National Centre for Forensic Medicine determined that the subject “may be 18 years of age or more”.
In 432 tests, the result was that the person “may not have been 18 years of age”.
The test is only for persons whose age is in doubt.
According to John Grant of the Forensic Medicine Centre, these results are consistent with those of the previous months.
He told The Local: “The data are not very different from those of the previous months, and the figures are very consistent.”
The higher proportion of those over 18 years of age who have been convicted does not necessarily mean that the asylum-seekers falsely declare their age.
In May, the Centre published 581 test results and stated 442 cases “indicating that the subject had reached the age of 18 or over”.
The newspaper Svenska Dagbladet investigated the results of the 581 tests released and found that 243 of them had publicly indicated that they would be 18 this year.
An X-ray examination of the intellectual teeth, an MRI scan of the joints, followed by an analysis of the results by dentists and radiologists, was also questioned in some areas.
One of the skeptics was Claude Marcus, an endocrine scientist at Caroline College, whose work included assessing the biological maturity of people to determine whether they experienced puberty earlier or later than normal age.
He told the newspaper Metro: “I have reason to think so, and I don't think the measurements used should be like this.
The determination of the biological age in this way is inaccurate.
If we cannot guarantee accuracy, we should not pretend that we can do it.”
However, Glandson of the Forensic Science Center defended the accuracy of these tests: “The risk of uncertainty in determining a child as an adult is, by and large, minimal”.
The greatest risk is that the person happens to be under the age of 18, which is about 10 per cent.
The governor of West Virginia announced a party change.
Thursday night, Jim Justice, Governor of the West Virginia Democratic Party, announced at a rally of President Trump that he would change the party.
"I like it, I don't like it, the Democrats have left me," the governor's judge said.
“Today, after a lot of prayers and a lot of thought, I would like to tell you that today I am going to tell you, as a West Virginian, that I can no longer help you as a Democratic Governor.”
The rally broke out with cheers.
“So, tomorrow, I'll turn the Republican party into a Republican”, Justin added.
"As a coach, I'm going to tell you it's time to start another race."
Trump promised a major announcement at an earlier rally in West Virginia.
Mr. Trump won 42% of the vote in West Virginia, and Justin didn't support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.
According to Forbes, Justin was selected as the only billionaire in the state in 2016.
Forbes stated that he inherited his father ' s coal industry and owned coal mines in each of the five Länder.
At the moment, he's worth about $1.59 billion.
At the same time, the Republican National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening stating: “Governor Justinian's change is yet another blow to the Democratic Party, not to prevent our country from becoming once again great, but to make our country once again great”.
“Democrats now have only 15 governors, and control of the State Council is the lowest in history, and the Governor's statement is the latest rejection of a political party that has lost leadership from top to bottom and cannot find a positive unifying slogan.” Rona McDaniel, the woman president of the Republican National Committee, stated in a statement to the CBS News.
Fong Mansan tells the truth, telling the whole story with music is a dream of his own.
A song four to five minutes, it's hard to tell a full story.
I write songs with emotions, no story lines, and it's always been a shame.
Sebastian Ko applauds Russia's “probably” apology for the stimulant scandal.
On Thursday, the President of IAF, Sebastian Ko, expressed appreciation for Russia's apology for the stimulant scandal and stated that the apology was “offensive”, but reiterated that it was not the time for Russia to re-engage in the campaign.
The President of the Russian Association of Athletics and Athletics, Mitri Chirac, stated at the International Congress on Fields, held on the eve of the World Athletics Championship, that his country was right to be banned from participating in the campaign and that he was determined to combat doping.
He expressed his regret that "all the athletes who won gold and silver medals in the competition were deprived of medals."
Despite his comments, the Congress voted to maintain the ban. Previously, the report of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) mentioned the discovery of evidence of Russian state-sponsored doping, which was implemented in November 2015.
“I think today's response was very frank and very frank,” as the President of the International Federation of Fields told the press.
“The entire Council and the General Assembly of the United Nations are pleased ... the Russian Federation acknowledges that it has gone through a very hot period and is doing everything in its power to ensure that Russia can retake the game.”
He said that he was also “happy” that Russia had accepted the criteria for re-entry.
“I think that this is a very constructive day and that we have made some progress, but the United Nations General Assembly supports the Panel's recommendations, and this is not the time to reinstate Russia's candidacy,” said the Section.
“We need to do everything in our power to normalize this situation in the coming months.
Our guiding principle has been the desire to separate innocent athletes from the contaminated system”, he added.
Nineteen Russian athletes meet the strict standards of the International Federation of Athletics and will participate as neutral players in the World Athletics Championship to be held in London on Friday.

After his speech to the International Council of the Federation in London, he told journalists that drug testing was still inadequate and that banned trainers were still teaching.

Marketers have pointed out that, in recent times, the ECB’s monetary policy has tightened with expectations to boost the euro’s exchange rate, that the dollar index has continued to decline, and that the renminbi’s exchange rate against the dollar has increased with a corresponding surge, although at present it is unlikely that the ECB will quickly adjust its policy stance, that the short-term fluctuations in foreign exchange markets will eventually be followed by a return to basics, and that it is likely that the renminbi’s exchange rate will continue to function smoothly.

What is the impact of football financial rules on Neymar's transition to Paris?
The rules designed to prevent unrestricted spending by the European Haomen Football Club do not prevent Nemar from moving from the Barcelona Club in Spain to the St. Germain Football Club in Paris (PSG) in France at record prices.
As a result, the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) has further downgraded the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris. The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) is the governing body of European football games and has the right to ban teams from participating in widely watched Eurocap leagues.
The Financial Fair Contest Rules (FFP) launched by the Federation of European Football Federations in 2011 meant that the Paris Club of Football in St. Germain had to prove eventually that Nemal’s transfer would be funded without major losses.
The Barcelona Club has already disbursed €222 million ($262 million) simply to cover the cost of dissolving the Brazilian player, whose salary will be as high as tens of millions of dollars a year.
The following are some of the financial implications of Nemal's transfer to France.
Considering that the team is funded by the rich Qatari ruling family, the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris can, of course, sign Namar in cash and include him in the ranks of other stars.
Clubs can spend a great deal of money on buying players, but they must use legitimate sources of income to make up for the huge sums spent, allowing them to achieve a balance of gains and losses in football-related operations.
The Financial Fair Contest Rules were conceived by Michel Platini following his election as President of the Federation in 2007.
In the view of the former French player, if banks or owners withdraw support funds, they are in fact deceiving and putting the club at risk of destruction for those clubs that are heavily indebted for success.
In 2011, the focus of the Rules shifted from club debt to club loss monitoring.
This change means that Rome? The business model used by Roman Abramovich when he acquired the Chelsea Club in 2003, namely, to buy a club with potential, and then to spend a lot of money to improve the team and build a global brand, is now in a much harsher position.
During the three-year rule assessment period up to 2018, the club may lose €30 million.
Despite Abu being devalued by the current president in 2015, Aleksander Ceferin, a successor to the Federation, remains committed to stopping excessive spending.
“Of course, the Rules have not lapsed, and we will certainly strengthen future regulations.” Andrew Traverso, who is in charge of the Rules, told the Associated Press last week.
Although the Némal buyout clause will be paid in one lump sum by the St. Germain Football Club in Paris, it may also be allocated over the duration of the contract on the basis of accounting purposes.
Nemal had already signed a five-year agreement, so the transfer of contributions might be shown as a cost of Euro44.4 million in the annual account for the next five years.
The first wave of the Rule sanctions imposed in 2014 brought the most severe sanctions to the St. Germain Football Club in Paris and the Manchester City Club under the banner of Abu Dhabi.
The St. Germain Football Club in Paris was fined Euro60 million (US$ 82 million at the exchange rate at the time), which was reduced to Euro20 million, and demanded that the team be reduced to 21 instead of the normal 25 players in the 2014-15 season.
The Federation is looking at clubs that seek to increase revenues by linking to the owners of the clubs and to deceive financial regulators.
While Qatari companies can sponsor the St. Germain Football Club in Paris, if the amount of the sponsorship is considered to exceed the standard market price, the Federation will not consider it to be a legitimate income.
This occurred in 2014, when the Federation ruled that the amount of the Qatar Tourist Board ' s sponsorship of the St. Germain ' s Football Club in Paris had been overstated.
It was reported that a portion of Nemar's income at the St. Germain Football Club in Paris might come from payments made by the Qatar World Cup Organizing Committee in 2022.
However, both the St. Germain Football Club in Paris and the Organizing Committee denied that Nemal would be an ambassador to the World Cup, and such an initiative would be easy for the regulatory bodies of the Federation.
The recent sanctions imposed on the St. Germain Football Club in Paris mean that the Federation will be more vigilant about any attempt to circumvent the rules.
According to Thursday's sources, the Federation did not engage in pre-discussions with the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris on the transfer of Nemal.
The above-mentioned individuals contacted the Associated Press only in an anonymous capacity, as they were not authorized to discuss the situation at the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris.
According to the last published accounts, the operating income of the St. Germain Football Club in Paris in 2015-16 was Euro542.4 million, with a profit of more than Euro10 million.
The accounts for the previous fiscal year have not been disclosed.
The Club de Football St. Germain in Paris is expected to bring the evangelical benefits of sponsoring events, franchising and the sale of jerseys.
The club anticipates an increase of at least 30 per cent in revenue after the signing of the Namar camp.
It is clear that the Spanish coalition, deeply angry at seeing one of the most famous players leave, tried to block Nemal's move and claimed that the St. Germain Football Club in Paris violated the Rules.
USC President Javier Tebás told the Spanish newspaper AS that “this is a clear example of a `financial stimulant', with the same clubs and countries”, referring to Qatar, with the ultimate ownership of the Club de Football St. Germain in Paris.
Arsene Wenger, coach of the Arsenal team (the club's owner is the United States sports tycoon), has reservations about the attitude of the state-funded club and the WAC.
"This is the consequence of ownership, which has completely changed the entire ecology of the past 15 years of football," Wenger said on Thursday.
“When the State owns the club, everything happens.
This would make it very difficult to comply with the Rules, as there are many different ways or interests for a country to demand that large players represent a country.”
Robid, an intelligent interactive robot developer, has a new investment.
In recent years, start-ups in the area of artificial intelligence have continued to enjoy a high level of capital.
An artificial intelligence, Rakid, recently completed a new round of financing, led by the Pumazi, with Swiss credit, CDIB (an investment agency under the Taiwan China Development Finance Corporation), old shareholder IDG capital, etc.
The scale of the current round of financing is known to be approximately $100 million, with Xin and CDIB appearing for the first time in domestic financing transactions in the area of artificial intelligence.
Rokid, an intelligent interactive robot researcher dedicated to robotic research, is a product that manipulates home-based smart devices, has a continuous autonomous learning and growth function, as well as recognition, comprehension, feedback, etc.
The current round of financing will be used primarily for R & D, talent acquisition, strategic push and investment deployment in the industrial chain.

On 1 November 2016, Rokid completed a round of financing by Sang-jian capital, IDG, Mfund, Yuanji capital, Walden International, and others.
At that time, Rakid stated that the post-financing B valuation had reached $450 million.
In May 2017, Rukid released a consumer-grade smart voice robot, “Rocky Moon Stone”, combining artificial intelligence and family scenes at a price of $1399.
The robot uses speech synthesis, natural language understanding, speech recognition technology and microphone array technology with chat, music, intelligent home functions.
He was awarded two prizes, Tech For A Better World and Home Audio/Vidio Components and Accessors, as well as the German IF Design Award, known as Oscar in the Design Community.
On the recently concluded 2018 CES, Rokid published a new product: the consumer-level enhancement reality ARGlass.
The glasses will be used as stand-alone head displays, i.e. without connection to smartphones or external computers, and are expected to be commercialized in 2018.
Previously, the company had released the first-generation family robot, Rokid Alien, and the second-generation smartphone, Rokid Pebble.

When built and put into use, Chinese users upload and download data without having to transmit back and forth long distances across the US and Central America, increasing speed and reducing delays.

The Nostalgia Infective Market - Summer Camp and Detective Two.
This story is recapitulated in memory of actors in the 1980s, the wind and light of the 1980s, and the era of garbage in the 1990s (in the lead-up to and after David Wayne and Michael Seward's sketches of the MTV, The Nation); as well as in the memory of the past itself, in the memory of 2001; a year ago, so many stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poeler and Paul Luther, had not yet come to life.
As a cultural art, it is an imitation and a reflection of our permanent memory of the Facebook era.
But as a series, it feels like time is running out.
The first day of the camp echoed strongly, but not only because of its absurd humor (theatrical story of the original story of a talking vegetable can, by H. Jon Benjamin).
The double use of cynics in dramas -- middle-aged actors playing kids at the age of trouble -- makes it impossible to go back to the past and become a funny part of it.
In Ten Years later, adults play a real role as adults, and their emotions are not too deep-rooted and imitation is more widespread, including the improvising creation of stalking films in the 1990s, such as " Hands on the Cradle " .

Many core stories are the same.
Mr. Sugar is now a novelist, but he still hasn't forgotten Katie.
Victor (Ken Mariño) remains a virgin.
There was also another treacherous conspiracy involving Ronald Reagan (also played by Mr. Seward), instigated by George H. W. Bush (Michael Ian Black, impressed).
As always, the best part of this series is interjection.
It is particularly interesting to see this forever young Mr. Luder, who flaunted Matt Dillon's soul patch in the film Single Nobility, and Andy in the former School Giant now feels like a giant.
This is a time of random madness, which may give impetus to the film, like the Recital Seven Years of Life series, until it comes to what I think is a logical conclusion: Camp Harald: Twenty Years Later, the last act of which was to let the Cassies watch the premiere of Camp Harald.

The comedy, written by Brian Gaitwood and Alejandro Tanaka, was pushed onto the television screen by director Reese Thomas: it was a comedy film of the brother-in-law, set in Romanian in the 1980s, and told the story of two Bucharest officials fighting for truth, atheism and Marx Leninianism.
The main players - Grigor, the hard-wing, and Ethel, the idealist - were young Florin Pierszi and Cornelius Ulrich, respectively, and the dialogue was spelled out in English by Chanin Tatum, who was also the executive producer, and Joseph Gordon-Levette.
It's a wonderful idea.
But this is not just an idea.
Some of them are very good visual (the police watch chess on TV as Americans like to play football).
And there were a lot of celebrities -- including Jenny Slater, Nick Ofman, Mahhara Hashbaz Ali, and Kolo Sevini -- who made a wonderful sound.
But Detective Twins is so dedicated to creating a loud and genuine comedy -- a killer with a Reagan mask on it -- and it usually plays that role.
The television of the six episode was slightly delayed, and the comedy effect was not released quickly or frequently.
The long-edited version of " Detective Two Males " was even stricter, with a better sarcasm effect when Gregor and Ethef visited the United States Embassy repeatedly, as two fat boys were always swallowing a bunch of hamburgers in the embassy lobby.

Recent interviews by journalists revealed a general decline and even a loss in the efficiency of the iron and steel, orbital traffic, ships, mechanical manufacturing, etc. in the north-east.
Some experts were of the view that, under the current circumstances, the new round of industrial revitalization in the north-east was not only related to the economic recovery of the country, but would also have an impact on the long-term development of our manufacturing industry and international competitiveness, and that it was therefore urgent to restructure the transformation.
The general decline in business efficiency in traditional industries, which is even more costly to the raw materials industry and the manufacturing industry of heavy machinery and equipment, is the primary manifestation of the economic downturn of the current round of medium- and north-east industries.
In the past, the economic downturn was characterized mainly by low-end and high impact on primary products, but this economic volatility affected both high-end and low-end industrial products from traditional Northeast industries.
The saddle steel group (Web) began with the restructuring of its products in previous years, focusing on the development of high-end panels such as container boards, steel tracks, shipboards and civil household panels, but sales of these varieties have declined considerably this year, particularly by 50 per cent over the same period last year.
Saddle steel shares (Haw Kyung-soon, Director of the Metallurgical Department of the Liaoning Provincial Industrial and Communications Commission) described metallurgy as the third pillar of Liaoning ' s industry, with an annual capacity of 60 million tons of steel production in third place in the country.
In January-May of this year, Liaoning Province produced 2,154 million tons of rough steel, while the production and distribution of the products needed for projects with a high degree of local government encouragement and competition in the market fell considerably, a further feature of the manufacturing industry in the north-east.

The film Trinity, the Ten Million Flowers, which is about to be shown on August 4th, was launched yesterday in Kyoto at a conference called "The Four Seas of the Eight." The White Night couple, Yang Yang and Liu Yifei, appeared together.
Yang Yang, who had just had his right ear surgery the previous few days, appeared for the first time after his injuries, reading his role as “irritated and indifferent”, always giving in silence and hiding all his feelings.
Yang said that there was a need to mobilize all the emotions to convey to the audience the gloom of the role, “this is a new challenge to my performance, and I am really about to suffocate myself during the performance”.
Liu Yeefei, for his part, revealed that in the film, he was so "sobbing" that at one point he cried and collapsed.
The Japanese Olympic Committee had recently indicated that the Japanese delegation had set 30 gold medals at the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games and had advanced to the top three gold medals.
Last October, the Chairman of the Japanese Olympic Committee's Sports Committee, Tae-woo Yama, stated that the total number of gold medals expected from Japan's Kenja at the Tokyo Olympics was 2.5 times that of the Rio Games.
At the 2016 Rio Olympics, the Japanese delegation ranked sixth on the gold medal with 12 gold.

Yesterday, the second meeting of the four People's Congresses of the city of Guangan was held in a brevity.
There were no banners, no tea cups or even a bottle of ordinary mineral water on the premises of the Guang'an Exhibition Centre.
Instead, it was replaced by a simple banner, a meeting place, a simple environmentally friendly paper bag with conference materials, and a green paper cup filled with tea.
Conference materials were somewhat thinner than before, and several papers summarized the theme and agenda of the meeting.
“Save for the people, but also for the economy. We understand and welcome a return to the present simple, real meeting environment.” The Guangan City People's Congress, on behalf of Wang Sung, said that efficient, pragmatic, non-formal meetings are what they want to see and participate in.
The experts noted that the current slowdown in inflation and deflationary pressures was certainly good news for the financial transition.
A total of 22 electric cars are being sold by major car dealers in California, but there are far fewer options available in other states, with only 14 models in the second state, and no electric car sales even in six states.

The Bank of England will maintain a 0.25% interest rate.
The Bank of England will announce at a later date that interest rates will remain unchanged, and earlier weak economic growth and relaxed inflation have dashed hopes for upward adjustment.
The Bank of England warned that economic growth would continue to be “weak” as it controlled interest rates while increasing household income contraction.
The Bank ' s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) policymakers decided to maintain a 0.25 per cent interest rate with a 6-2 vote, while a few members this month called for higher interest rates, even though weak economic growth has weakened the upwards.
In its quarterly inflation report, the Bank of England reduced growth projections to 1.7 per cent in 2017 and 1.6 per cent in 2018, respectively, and issued warnings that household income contraction would continue, while inflation would soar to almost 3 per cent in the autumn.
However, it was suggested that interest rates would need to be raised in the coming years to contain the inflation associated with de-Europe, while borrowing costs might need to be increased even further in terms of expectations in the financial markets.
A year earlier, the de-European influence had led to the implementation of a large-scale economic promotion policy, which members had also voted to withdraw.
The Bank of England will suspend its periodic financing scheme, providing low-cost funding to banks starting next February, although the Bank claims that under the plan, the Bank will now need an additional £15 billion over £115 billion.
In the minutes of interest rate decision-making meetings, the Bank of England stated: “In the MPC's core projections, gross domestic product (GDP) has remained weak in the near future, as real household income contraction will continue to suppress consumption.”
With regard to interest rates, the Bank has repeatedly reiterated the need for “a certain monetary policy tightening” to combat inflation, and for a “greater degree” than market expectations.
The market is now expected to grow for the first time in the third quarter of next year, and for the second time in 2020.
The Bank stressed, however, that any upturn would be “slow” and “restrictive”.
The Bank ' s growth projections for this year and next year show a downward trend, as compared with the projections for May of 1.9 per cent and 1.7 per cent.
The Bank maintained a forecast of 1.8 per cent growth in 2018.
The exchange rate of the pound has declined against the United States dollar, and the euro has followed.

Prior to this constant decision-making, rising expectations were dashed by recent unoptimistic growth data. GDP rose to 0.3 per cent in the second quarter, compared to 0.2 per cent in the previous three months.
According to the Bank, growth in the third quarter was likely to remain at 0.3 per cent, although it would increase slightly by the end of the year.
The recent inflation report by the Bank of England did not bring any good news to ordinary households, which were hit by inflation surges, while wage growth was negligible, because it claimed that austerity would get worse before it got better.
It was also stated that monetary policy “cannot prevent” a blow to income in the coming years, but that wages were expected to recover “on a large scale” at the end of the three-year forecast.
At the same time, owing to the depreciation of the pound sterling and the significant growth in demand for British commodities, the economy will be strained to offset some of the effects of low consumption.
One year before the decision was taken, the alarming European Union referendum plunged the pound sterling, with interest rates down to 0.25 per cent in August.
The Bank of England estimates that it may take four years to fully influence prices and the British economy.
Until the latest decision on interest rates is published in the Bank, the call for higher interest rates will be heard, as inflation exacerbates already stressful ordinary households, while three policymakers call for interest rates to be raised to 0.5 per cent in July.
Last month, inflation fell from 2.9 per cent in June to 2.6 per cent, although the Bank of England stated that this was expected and would rise again in the coming months.
The line is called relative to its 2% target, and the excess is already the final bottom line of the weak pound.
The director of the Coreco Mortgage Brokers, Andrew Monterey, stated: “In view of the recent fall in interest rates, the mortgage market once again seems to be becoming more competitive, as lenders strongly call for more business and look forward to a positive end to the year.
For those who may be nearing the end of existing transactions, such markets appear to be particularly beneficial, as re-collateralization (many free of charge and low interest rates) is increasingly popular.
On 13 November, at 1902 hours, China's seismological network officially measured an earthquake of 8.0 magnitude at a depth of 10 km in New Zealand (42.53 degrees South, 173.05 degrees East) with a strong sense of wellington's.
The British National Health Service (NHS) has a huge green light on controversial HIV drugs.
The patient will be able to obtain “transformational” HIV preventive treatment from September, after the high court's determination of the drug financing of NHS has come to an end.
NHS England announces that a pre-exposure prophylactic drug (PreEP), a pre-sexually available drug, has been shown to reduce the risk of infection in high-risk populations by about 86%. Health services will now provide the drug to an estimated 10,000 people through a three-year preliminary trial.
It agreed to fund the experiment after the Court of Appeal had upheld the High Court ruling last year, which stated that, although NHS claimed that local authorities should fund the drug, NHS was entitled to pay for the prEP.
The announcement announced on Thursday was described by the British Chief Executive Officer of NHS, Simon Stevens, as a “major new intervention”, while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described it as a “critical moment”.
Sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool, and Sheffield will be the first registered sexual health clinics. More clinics will join in October, followed by full implementation in England in April 2018.
Pre-exposure prophylactic (PrEP) is an HIV drug that is administered prior to sexual activity to reduce the risk of HIV infection.
Experiments have shown that PrEP can significantly reduce HIV transmission among people at risk of infection.
PEP before sexual intercourse means there's enough specific drugs in the human body to prevent HIV infection.
The drug can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse.
Those eligible for treatment include homosexuals, bisexual males, transgender persons and HIV carriers who have not successfully received treatment.
The clinic will determine whether eligible participants, including men, women, transgender persons and their sexual partner, who are not known about their HIV status are receiving antiretroviral treatment.
Persons residing and registered as general practitioners in England may also register at their local sexual health clinics.
The scheme will cost £10 million, while the NHS England branch signed a contract to purchase these drugs this week after international competitive procurement.
The experiment aims to assess the full potential of PEP by collecting clinical evidence on how it is located, absorbed and implemented on a large sample basis.
Mr. Stevens said: “This major new intervention should complement and reinforce HIV prevention with a broad and increasingly successful approach.
This is yet another milestone in 30 years of action worthy of progress in addressing the major health challenges of humankind.”
The Chief Executive Officer of the United Kingdom AIDS Trust (NAT), Deborah King, said, “This is a critical moment in the fight against AIDS.
If it does target populations in need and at risk, pre-exposure prophylaxis offer the possibility of altering the UK AIDS epidemic.
Starting in September, the HIV-at-risk population will be given a new and permissible tool through the NHS-funded experiment in England, a truly stand-alone tool that will bring about improvements in the lives of so many people without consultation with their sexual partners.
We agree with this announcement.”
The Chief Executive Officer of the Higgins Trust, Ian Green, said: “The first task now is to ensure that the test is rolled out rapidly throughout the country and that none of the people infected with HIV are left behind.
Now that we've bought PEP experimental drugs, we're ready to protect more than 10,000 people at high risk of HIV."
The shadow Minister of Public Health, Sharon Hodgeson, stated: “After months of delay and government delays, the start of PrEP's first test was welcome and should have come earlier.
Evidence shows how this drug can bring about change as part of our approach to preventing HIV and halting the spread of this deadly infectious disease.
This experiment will give us a better understanding of the advantages of PEP.
It is now very important that the experiment be launched as soon as possible throughout the country in order to protect people exposed to HIV and to help us further to end the spread of HIV in society.”

Quality of life: using attics and smart designs to make the small condo of the Earl's Palace a spacious home
Joanne Ray, a former banker, was very keen on renovating her house, and in 2014 she moved from her big house on the Knight Bridge to a small condo at the Earl's Palace.
This apartment is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Queen ' s balcony -- the fact that Joanne did not pack her bags and sold it -- is a strong proof of the new design.
“Before then, my ex-boyfriend and I lived in a bigger house on Knight Bridge,” Joanne said.
“I was looking for the right house with the offer.
I saw this apartment at the Earl's Palace, and it's a very high ceiling.
I'd like to make an offer on the same day.”
Since the first house visit, this 1,000 square feet apartment has now been completely overhauled.
The apartment was originally a complex one-room layout -- one that needed to pass through the kitchen to get to the bedroom -- and Joanne wanted to increase the storage space and the attic to take full advantage of the full ceiling height.
“I want high ceilings, big windows, enough light.
That's what I'm asking," she said.
To that end, she hired Elvan Azadi, from the Duck&Shed Building and Design Studio (in Notting Hill), to use this 12.5-foot-high ceiling to build a family, not just a development project, but a place where Joanne lives.
The height of the ceiling is not enough to increase two spaces up and down, so the construction challenge is to create an attic that is high enough to stand.
Ervan has to think creatively in order to solve this problem.
“The steel structure is quite complex”, he explained.
“We must arrange space for it to be displayed up and down, without the need for shrugs.
It is not just as simple as building a simple platform, but also starting up the steel so that it is at the appropriate level to achieve its function.”
Through this arrangement, Erfan was able to acquire two rooms of full height in the space, with many interesting elements added.
The loft uses the rectoruvius brand ' s rectangular copper windows to oversaw the fascinating areas of life.
The entire style of the mirrored gold furniture, the small silver furniture and the regenerative light of Sergei Mouille were laid down.
The use of mirrors plays an important role in increasing the atmosphere, space and light.
A mirror on both ends of the short corridor would make it look longer.
In the kitchen, the splatter with the mirror is like a window to another room.
At the plaque, small cells with mirrors provide Joanne with storage space for the storage of utensils and glassware.
The beautiful living room has an attractive sense of space to put the kitchen away when it is not used.
Collapse kitchens are not fresh.
But the uniqueness of this folding kitchen lies in a garage-style lift door.
“In this case, there is some knowledge in the field of engineering,” Ervan explains the steel-strength-enhanced, hand-held MDF door.
"This is the principle of balance, so when you push the door, it's easy to slide."
As a result of the skilful use of space and storage, Joanne obtained an additional 16 square metres, an extra bedroom and an improved layout.
"In the end, you sell the size of the house -- or your property is valued on the basis of the size of the house," Ervan says.
“Basicly, the real estate agent would walk into the room and calculate it according to the size of the floor.”
They will seek to increase the occupied space while using high-quality materials, thus bringing a sense of luxury to the space.
According to Ervan, “the material was chosen by you personally, thus helping to create emotional bonds in the home”.
"You don't love the power on the wall.
These things are important, but they don't hold your heart."
It has been shown that, through good design and the addition of additional space, standard apartments can be shaken to surprise you.
In fact, you might as well live with Joanne.

26 July News: On 22 July, journalists learned from Red Bridge that the city's largest river belt park was completed and made free of charge available to the public with the greening of the landscape on both sides of the southern Canal of the Red Bridge.
The entire landscape belt, thanks to the pre-existing natural ecological and historical and cultural resource advantages, has been reprogrammed and upgraded on both sides of the South Canal, resulting in the creation of five riverine landscapes along the western hyenas along the corridor of the West Side of the New Heavenly Street in Wellington Square Park.
Some 1,500 metres of plastic ducts, marked by distance, have also been laid in the green land on the banks of the river between the Kanhua Bridge and the three new stone bridges.
On both sides of the road, in addition to planting a variety of herbs and trees, a children ' s playground was constructed and several small sets of sculptures were set up.
As we walk, it can be seen that seats, tunnels, bridges, water-friendly platforms and sand pools for children have also been built on the shore, which has resulted in the greening of landscapes and water systems on both sides, providing another place for recreation, fitness and recreation.

Two brothers in the 500-million-dollar Real Estate War.
Forty years after the founding of the dynasty in his Italian family, two brothers fought for one of Victoria's largest real estate empires, worth more than $500 million.
The former director and developer of the Carlton Football Club, Colin De Lutis, lived in a mansion in the Tulkara district, the distance of the three doors being his brother Paul's residence. The latter brought him before the Supreme Court on the division of their real estate and business assets.
Paul has wanted to leave the family business since 2014, but the two brothers have had an intense debate on the division of assets in the Supreme Court.
The brothers and their mothers together own 38 real estates worth more than $500 million, which have accumulated since the family bought Smith Street in Colin Wood in 1973.
There, the family founded Westco Jeans and gradually expanded it to the size of 160 retail chains.
In 1999, the company sold it at a price of $85 million.
After that, the money was invested in real estate. Now, the De Luttis family's portfolio includes city office buildings, the Brunswick and Solento development projects, the Golden Coast and Blue Hill apartments, and suburban shopping malls.
According to an agreement with his late father, Colin, known by his brother Paul as the “principal protagonist and dominant figure” of the De Lutis family, owned about two thirds of the company's assets, while Paul accounted for about one third.
According to the documents submitted to the Tribunal, the converted value of property owned by Colin was $316 million, while property owned by Paul was valued at $176 million.
Paul came to believe that the division of real estate and cash proved to be the crux of the bargain.
“The proposal for the division of property put forward by Colin left him what I thought was the best property”, he wrote in a first court affidavit in 2015.
Last Friday, the Supreme Court held its first hearing after several failed mediations.
Now, the brothers are still competing for control of the existing business, and Paul claims that Colin has kicked him out of the game.
Colin denied this and accused Paul of poor management of certain real estate.
In the early affidavit submitted by Colin, he expressed a desire to settle the dispute.
"My Italian tradition determines the family as the most important option. My Italian origin determines the family as the most important option," he wrote.
The cost of the case continues to rise, with hundreds of pages of affidavits, e-mails, company reports submitted by Deloitte, Pitcher Partners, Charter Keck Cramer, Allan Myers, QC, top law firms, and senior lawyers engaged by both parties.
Ms. De Lutis and her late husband, Luigi, are all Italian immigrants. They started running general restaurants and deli shops in the late 1950s and bought a store in Brenrich in the early 1970s.
They used collateral to buy Colin Wood's property, where Colin opened the family's first jeans shop.
Colin said, "I was in third grade," where he founded Westco, "And Paul was very small (about 10 years old).
Anna de Lutis said that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, wanted to be able to pass the property to his son in peace.
“Luigui used to say to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court”, she wrote.
Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, were no longer members of De Lutis Group, and Colin paid Mark $10 million to him when he said that he had left the company, and $26 million to Luke.
According to Paul, both Luke and Mark expressed “unsatisfactory with the terms of the division of their property”.
According to a biography published from TV star Eddie McGuire until his release in 2015, Colin kept a low profile despite being a member of the board of directors of the former AFL Club.
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul, as well as their lawyers, on Friday.
But only Colin replied by text. He said that because the case had been referred to the court, "I really can't say much."
“My brother Paul chose to sue me and bring our family business to court, which is very, very sad”, he wrote.
In mid-2016, Colin wrote in a court document that he had tried to satisfy his brother ' s demands.
He said, “Our father did not want to see Paul and I end up in a dispute like the one we currently have” and added, “we still have hope for a settlement of the dispute”.
Friday, that hope seems to be dashed.
“Our problems will be resolved through the Court in the near future”, Colin wrote.

Trump's new Chief of Staff plans to limit the President's media time.
Others have tried, but all failed.
John F. Kelly might really be able to do that.
If that's true, then he's the first.
According to the United States political news website Politico, the new White House Chief of Staff planned to restrict the flow of information to President Trump — including media reports — with a view to ensuring greater stability for the big boss.
The following is a quote from the journalist Josh Dauth:
“When the new Chief of Staff of the White House, John F. Kelly, met with senior officials on his first day of work, he pointed out that he was addressing one of the main issues of President Trump's admission to the White House: bad information in the hands of the President”.
Kelly told the officials that receiving good information would help the President to make better decisions, so that the information needed to be in his hands — whether in writing or in the form of a briefing.
Kelly's diagnosis seems to be the same, but others tried to tame it by monitoring Trump's media time, but ultimately failed.
President Trump's television addiction has a long history — now in the White House, his habits of watching television are still deepening.
In February, former campaign adviser Sam Naberg told Politico that “if the candidate Trump is frustrated with unfair reporting, it would be useful for him to know that he has received positive reporting through credible channels as well.
“In the light of the experience of the six former campaign officials, the habit of controlling Trump's tweets was to ensure that certain praises were always included in the media messages he personally received.”
It's totally okay.
But Trump’s Twitter habit of being “controlled” is ridiculous.
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know — that, had it not been for their intervention, Trump's Twitter would have been even more intense.
We may never know the Twittersphere that Trump did not send.
If his staff were able to save him from the fire, even a few times, their efforts would be worth it.
But no one can keep Trump from being controversial.
Part of the problem is that in the White House, a group of competing groups, people promote their world view by delivering potentially reliable or unreliable information to Trump, in a flowerful manner.
Politico — all about this story — reported in May on advisers' appetite for strategically providing the President with suspicious information.
This is an example of what the journalist Shane Goodmancher described:
“The current and former Trump officials claim that Trump's response to negative news clips, such as volcanic eruptions, especially those with destructive information leaks, would be insanely desperate to find its source.
At the end of February, the President received a malicious copy of an article on the Internet incendiary Charles C. Johnson's website, GotNews.com, which accused Deputy Chief of Staff, Katie Walsh, of being the “source of the vast amount of information leaked” to the White House, as was the case with Trump.
Even if Johnson had been permanently blocked by Twitter for harassment, no concrete evidence had been provided, and he had bombed a large number of false allegations, all of which were later openly denied.
Trump read the article and then started asking officials about Walsh.”
Goodmancher also stated that the then Chief of Staff, Reines Pribas, and the White House Secretary, Robert Potter, “had tried to establish a system to manage and record documents received by Trump”.
And?
Kelly's going to do the same thing in three months.
Maybe he can prove himself to be a more efficient manager than Pribas, but Trump is still the impulsive Trump, and his assistant is still competing for influence.
These permanent factors of influence will make the task of Kelly even more difficult.
Traveling town: how the wind gets drunk
[Summary] The potential of Zhejiang town was gradually awakened.
Today, these towns are an important destination for tourists to see the water of the mountains, to read the culture of the country, and to feel the sorrow of the country. They will also provide an important boost to our efforts to build the “Poetry Zhejiang” China's most beautiful tourist destination.

“Society plays go with the moon rising and weenie smells with the wind.
The traditional handicrafts of the town of Anchanggu, which has swept through the town of Anchang, where traditional crafts such as buckets, bamboo-coats, iron-cracking, shoe-picking, flower-picking and cotton-climbing, are a full demonstration of the intangible cultural heritage of the town of Anchanggu, and where Quartet tourists are indulging in the atmosphere of experience of the popular ethos of Xiao, and of the historical and cultural glorification of the past.
During the three days of New Year ' s holiday this year, more than 65,000 tourists were reported to have visited the town of Anchanggu.
In Zhejiang, a small town as unique as the town of Anchanggu, Xingxi Tong's Xiaobo Xiao Xiao Xiao Xiao Xiao Xiao, with its warm spirits in the town of Jiangnan, the white wall of the 28th of the state, Deva, about the end of the millennia of the ancient town, and the fisher's drawings in the town of Ishigang, Taiwan, which outline the lives of traditional and modern fisher ... these towns are the “baskets” of Xijiang tourism and the “hearts of love” of the eight tourists.
In recent years, the potential of Zhejiang town has been gradually awakened as the development of tourism across our province has advanced.
In 2016, the Office of the Provincial Government officially published the Implementation Scheme for the Creation of Tourism Townships in Zhejiang Province, which proposes, over a five-year period or so, the designation of about 100 provincial tourist townships with a popular, eco-friendly and tourist-like environment throughout the province.
Today, these towns are an important destination for tourists to see the water of the mountains, to read the culture of the country, and to feel the sorrow of the country. They will also provide an important boost to our efforts to build the “Poetry Zhejiang” China's most beautiful tourist destination.
The head of the Department of Tourism explained that, in the midst of the emergence of a tourist-friendly town, we now attach greater importance to the development of the individualized tourism industry in the towns and cities of our province, and that new tourism projects and trade patterns have given tourists a rich experience and a good reputation.
Focus on promotion
Recently, the Zhejiang Province Tourist Board and Zhejiang Daily News Group hosted the “Stown X Future Artists” sharing and the “Poetry Zhejiang? The City has a passion for the Zhejiang Tourist Town” at the Zhejiang Province Exhibition.
“Circumbery has the beauty of art and the temperature of life.
The style of a small town lies in its original juice, its original taste, its native land, an original ecological pureness.
“The Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, the Film and Animated Art Faculty, the film and video department of the Chinese Academy of Fine Arts, the national front-line film advertising director, Xie Changfeng, and the director of the Chinese University of Metrology Institute of Arts and Communications, Professor Xu Xiao Xiao Xiao, shared the cross-border stories of small towns such as the Small Village Renovation of Small Villages.
Many of Zhejiang's tourist towns have deep cultural resources, and the new town from the south of the city of Huzhou, with its representative, Dong, has read the country's south.
The town of Jiangnan, which has been popular with painters since ancient times, is now in deep cooperation with such artistic institutions as the Chinese American Academy.
Tourism-friendly small towns require weather factors, tourism factors, service elements and environmental factors.
In this context, the services and environment of tourism are also very important components.
Rainy days, with a timely umbrella, can also give tourists a better experience of small towns.
In this age of sharing, the hottest shared umbrellas of the “Poetry Zhejiang” editions were custom-made by Zhejiang, one of the hottest shared umbrellas of the All Media Centre for Tourist Tourist Tourist Group, hoping to promote the concept of “Share? Green” and to raise the awareness and common sense of civilized tourism among tourists and small town residents in order to share a wonderful tourist environment.
This became one of the bright spots of the “Poetry Zhejiang? Towns with the wind” of the 2017 Zhejiang tourist town during the season's promotion.
Looking forward to it.
To date, Zhejiang Province has published a list of the first 21 provincial tourist towns and 115 provincial tourist towns.
As a priority area for the development of rural tourism during the “13th Five-Year” period, wind towns will eventually be built up as tourist attractions above level 3A, which will become a new model of diversity of tourism products, high tourism efficiency, and a win-win industrial integration.
The key to the attraction of a tourist town is the taste of its original juice.
The beauty of tourist-friendly towns stems not only from the blighting of small bridges, but also from long-standing cultural traditions; rural renewal stems from cultural self-confidence.
Throughout the international landscape, the small towns of Lisser, the Netherlands, Halstadt, Austria, and pumpkin, France, with tulips, “salts” and pumpkins as their core attractions, attract large numbers of tourists from all over the world each year and enable tourism to boost the economy of small towns.
In the case of wind towns, the focus of “focusing on identity, staying in the countryside” gives the town a distinct personality and soul, and more so the provision of cultural immersion, the carrying of local literature and the visibility of native civilization.
Traveling small towns, bound by culture and the countryside, with a human and landscape as their vehicle, connect the quartet of tourists, and allow traditional ethos and culture to carry on and innovate in the common building and sharing.
In essence, tourist-friendly small towns are complex open tourist attractions, and more so should be shared living spaces between local residents and foreign tourists, as well as travellers.
As the main battleground for future tourism growth, tourist-friendly towns may not only change the ecological profile of the village, the way in which economic and social development takes place, but also the direction in which industrial elements flow, but also be an important force in bridging the urban-rural infrastructure divide and awakening the revival of rural culture.
The Zhejiang tourist town will be a richer story in the context of the surge of accelerated rural revitalization.
Data show that 70 per cent of China ' s travel needs are concentrated within a 3-km radius, so that the entire short-distance market is a shared bicycle.

The lean and seasoned team found a gap in the line of defence, through which their vehicles were squeezed, despite the fact that a roadblock had not been set up to pass.
The angry population criticised the Solihull Council Commission, saying that it “did a poor job in dealing with the problem”.
“They arrived there on Monday night, before they came to Benliches Street and threw stones at passers-by.
The Committee should be ashamed of what they did, because they were nothing to deal with.
The tenants came here in May and were subsequently expelled, and now they are back.
There's been a lot last night, probably more today."
She added: “The Birmingham City Council knows how to handle it by enforcing a long-term ban to protect its park.
I live on Streetsbrook Road, and I'm not willing to continue paying municipal taxes if the council can't stop things like this.
A local resident who did not want to reveal his name said, “This is ridiculous. We have just seen the last group of tenants leaving, but only for another group to destroy.
The number has increased this time, with some even seeing horses eating grass on the park lawn.”
“We are aware of unauthorized camping in an open area of Schultzbrook Road, and we are now cooperating with the Soliher police and taking the necessary legal action to remove them as soon as possible.
In order to support us in gathering evidence, it is important that as many local residents as possible call the police to report any anti-social or criminal acts.
This helps us to outline the situation for the Court's review when we refer the case to the Court.”
On 15 March, the fifth meeting of the Twelfth National People ' s Congress held its closing session in the Beijing People ' s Hall.
This was an interview with the Director of the National Post Office, Ma Jun.
Xinhua Xinhua journalist Chen Xuhua, International Online Report: On 15 March, at 9 a.m., the Fifth Meeting of the Twelfth National People ' s Congress held its closing session in the People ' s Hall.
In an interview with the Minister's Channel before closing, the Director of the National Postal Administration, Ma, stated that this year, the State would strengthen its supervision and guide the strengthening of industry self-regulation in response to outstanding problems in the current express delivery industry, such as delays, loss of express items and damage.

Italy ' s hard-line approach to the non-governmental organization Migrant Rescue Ship
Italy warned the non-governmental organizations operating migration rescue boats in the Mediterranean that they would not be allowed to continue to do so without the signing of new operational regulations.
In an interview with the daily newspaper Turin, the Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, stated: “It is hard to see what they will do if non-governmental organizations do not sign a new code of conduct”.
The day before Minniti's warning, the Italian authorities detained the crew of a German aid organization, “Youth Rescue”, on suspicion that they were actually collaborating with traffickers to assist illegal immigrants.
The aid organization operated for only one year and refused to comment on the specific subject of charges against the Italian prosecutor, Ambrogio Cartocio.
In a social media statement, the organization stated that “to us, saving lives is and will be the most important thing, and we therefore regret that we cannot operate in search and rescue zones at this time”.
“When all the information is collected, we can now only assess all the allegations and situations.”
The Italian government has been monitoring the Iuventa ship of the “Youth Relief” since October.
Its crew is suspected of carrying migrants brought directly from small boats by traffickers and of allowing smugglers to flee in haste and re-use the ship.
According to the documents of the Prosecutor, at least one such meeting allegedly took place at sea 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast and was published by the Italian media.
Its crew was suspected of blatant disregard for the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, which oversaw relief operations in the area out of humanitarian enthusiasm and not for any other motive.
Under the code of conduct, ships such as Iuventa clearly require an Italian police officer to supervise their activities on board.
At present, only three of the nine non-governmental organizations involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to comply with the code of conduct: Save the Children, the Migrant Maritime Aid Station in Malhe and Pro-Activa Open Arms in Spain.
The latter stated on Thursday that it considered the new provisions to be unnecessary but acceptable, as they did not bring about any “significant change and impediment” to its relief operations.
Among the organizations that refused to sign were the Nobel Prize-winning organization Médecins sans frontières (MSF).
At the same time, Minniti claims that there has been a sharp drop in the number of migrants arriving in Italy in recent weeks, indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guards and to unite local mayors are beginning to bear fruit.
The Minister stated: “In recent days, we have begun to see the dawn at the end of the tunnel.”
He announced plans for in-depth talks this month: discussions with Libyan mayors on economic development activities and with Chad, the Niger and Mali on ways to reduce the number of migrants leaving those countries for Europe.
According to the Chief Financial Economist of the Transport Bank, the growth in industrial value added is expected to accelerate to 6.6 per cent in December, owing to end-of-season highs in the first three quarters of 2017.
The cumulative increase in fixed asset investments in December is expected to be 7.2 per cent, the same as in the previous month, down from last year.
Industrial production, although weak in October, remained largely the same as in November.
In December, while our manufacturing investment was running at a low level, capital investment has improved slightly, and therefore capital investment is expected to level in November of that month.
More than 200,000 people, mostly stowaways, have entered the United States; they are living in a foreign country, returning to their homes for a long time, with their loved ones separated, and similar scenes continue to unfold.
Beijing's new initiative for “high school rehabilitation”: thousands of teachers and students from the North Chemical Industry will be admitted to the new campus in Changping
The inauguration of the new campus of the Beijing Chemical University was held in Changping District, Beijing, where 1,800 acres of green campus were officially operational.
Journalists learned from the ceremony that, in order to strengthen the core functions of the capital and to combat the “big urban disease”, in recent years, in the context of the concerted development of Kyoto and the defusion of non-capital functions, Beijing has accelerated the process of dissipation of central city high schools to suburban areas, and some students and teachers of higher education schools are moving to new suburban campuses such as Hyo, Da Hing, HOUSE, etc.
The new North Chemical Campus, located in Changping, South Pass, occupies 1,800 acres of land, 40 kilometres from the urban area, and is one of the priorities of the defusion of non-capital functions in the city of Beijing.
The new school is divided into three phases, which are now fully completed, and the second phase, which is expected to be fully launched by the end of this year, is expected to meet the learning and living needs of nearly 20,000 undergraduate, postgraduate and teaching staff.
Looking back at this year's film market, we find that the original text of the film and the two crowds of the stars in the movie form an important part of the intended audience.
Today, at 1710 hours, the 119th command centre of the city of Yooyang received a warning of a fire in the storage of tetrahydrofurans at an ambitious plant located in the Yongchung district of the city's two Qing district.
The fire brigade of the city immediately deployed five squadrons of 20 fire trucks to the scene, with equipment such as heavy chemical suits, chemisted digestors, etc.
After preliminary detection, fires occurred in small storage tanks where chemical substances such as tetrahydrofurans were stored, resulting in greater smoke at the site.
As at the time of the press release, the firefighters were under intense rescue, and the municipal health, security, environmental, security, traffic and other sectors had travelled to the scene without any casualties.
Michelle Carter was sentenced to death for texting to encourage Conrad Roy to commit suicide.
A girl from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her boyfriend to commit suicide through text messages and telephone calls.
In the current year, 20-year-old Michelle Carter will be serving a 15-month sentence, with the possibility of conversion to a suspended sentence.
Carter was convicted in June of unintentional premeditated murder of Conrad Roy, who committed suicide on 13 July 2014.
Roy's father said at the hearing on Thursday, "My family is devastated.
My son is my best friend."
While awaiting appeal, Carter was granted liberty of person.
She faced a prison sentence of up to 20 years, but her lawyers believed that she and Mr. Roy were both mentally ill.
At the time of sentencing, Carter stood standing, dressed in red pants and rice coats, holding his hands tight, with tears in both eyes and looking down.
“Her actions killed Conrad Roy”, the prosecutor told the court.
“She ended her life for a better life.
She didn't take responsibility”, the prosecutor said.
"She has no remorse."
But Carter's lawyer says it's “a terrible consequence, and she's very sorry”.
Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said that he had not found any significant impact on her “age or maturity, or even on her mental illness, on her behaviour”.
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said, “I haven't had a day to grieve for losing my beloved son.
I want him to be proud of what I've done and what I've done. I'm trying to stand with his sisters in all of my pain, and it's going to be with us forever.
Mr. Roy's sister, Cady Roy, testified that she was “spiriting” because she realized that she could never attend her brother's wedding or become his child's aunt.
“The loss of a man who has been with me since I was born is pain, and the rest of my life will be with it.” She said.
This case appears to set a legal precedent, as the laws of Massachusetts do not provide for the criminalization of encouraging others to commit suicide.
In 2014, Roy was found to have died of carbon monoxide poisoning in his car; this year, Carter was 17 years old.
After Carter ' s text message revealed that she had encouraged him to commit suicide, the case drew national attention.
“There are many ways to hang, jump, stab herself.” She said in several text messages sent two weeks before his death; he was on vacation with his family.
During the period before his suicide, she wrote, “You need to do this, Conrad”, and, “All you have to do is start the generator and then be free and happy”.
Judge Monez stated that Carter had drawn attention through the death of Mr. Roy and ordered her not to profit from the case through any media.
There are differences of law in this case.
One of the few defenders of Carter, Amanda Knox, who was charged with the murder of her British roommate in Italy in 2007, was acquitted two years later.
In a column published in The Los Angeles Times, 30-year-old Ms. Knox said: “Michel? Carter deserves compassion and help, not imprisonment”.

On 2 February, journalists learned from the Lassard Net Earth Basketball Club that, in the recent past, the Lassa Net Basketball Youth Team had won its fourth in the finals of the National Youth Basketball League in Beijing.
The Lassard net earthball youth team consists of 11 indigenous players, and the principal coach is the Assistant Coach of the Lassard net earthball adult team, Jin Sang-ju.
The Tibetan Basketball Kid before going to Beijing for the finals.
The director-general of the Lassard Net-Basketball Club, Liang Joon, said to reporters that the team's performance had improved compared to last year, and that the self-confidence of the players and their confidence in the playing field had improved significantly. Exchanges between the players and other teams had been more comprehensive, with more and easier on- and off-the-ground exchanges.
At the end of the competition, Captain Jiangtsang expressed his desire to gain experience by participating in the competition and to do his best for the cause of basketball in Tibet.
It was understood that in the Beijing game, players had overcome factors such as low-altitude intoxication and displayed the image of Tibet.
Despite the fact that the track is a gold medalist at the Olympics and that those who have access to the track and track have access to the world, the track and track name will be in the bottom.
Automotive manufacturers are under shock and Audi will convert up to 850,000 diesel vehicles.
Audi announced that the BMW would provide software upgrades to more than 350,000 vehicles the day before the conversion.
The BMW Chairman stated that BMW believed that “driving with more intelligent choices than restrictions” meant that major cities in Europe - including Munich, where BMW had its headquarters - were considering banning or restricting diesel vehicles.
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would convert 3 million Mercedes cars in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.
None of the companies claimed to have done so as recall.
European auto manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to help meet CO2 emissions requirements.
Nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines, however, are considered carcinogens and may lead to asthma.
The cost of installing equipment to offset diesel vehicle tail gas emissions is also increasing, making it difficult to maintain the price competitiveness of diesel vehicles.
As German car manufacturers faced scrutiny, the Government of Prime Minister Angela Merkel was also accused of over-exercise of these powerful car companies and ignored the signs of the problem.
These automobile companies are trying to avoid repeating the popular pattern of concealing their use of so-called failed devices, adjusting emissions to comply with regulations during vehicle tests and returning to normal driving conditions.
Several public executives have been charged in the United States, while others are being investigated by countries on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.
Last month, the former head of thermodynamics of the Audi engine development department was arrested in Germany.
The former manager, Zacero Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and therefore not protected by extradition, and may face trial in the United States.
Earlier this year, Audi was involved in a public criminal investigation in Germany, where the German Government accused Audi of installing a system to evade European emissions requirements, expanding the scope of the investigation previously limited to the United States.
Audi was surveyed for a potentially significant impact on the general public: luxury car manufacturers account for a disproportionate share of the profits of the public automobile.
It is common for a film to take a year or two, from its preparation to its presentation.
The animated film, the Big Fish Seagull, announced its launch on July 8, 12 years from the time of its preparation to the time of its launch!
The original author of " Big Fish Seagull " , Liang Dynasty, 21 years old, from Qinghua University ' s Heated Power Industry, and a close friend, Zhang Chun, founded the other side of the world, received a million dollars in venture capital in 2008 to launch an animated film, " Big Fish Seagull " .
The film has won numerous national and international prizes during the creative sample phase, and has been recorded and praised as “one of the most outstanding works of art” by the Pompidou Centre for Contemporary Art in France.
As a result of the six-year period from creativity to production, the film was referred to by millions of fans who looked forward to it.
Big Fish Seagull tells a fairy tale that belongs to the Chinese. With the release of this pre-scheduled film, it brings new expectations to all viewers.
Liang said, “This is the only thing I've done for 12 years, and now it's turning from a dream to a reality, and I'm both nervous and excited”.
Zhang Chun said, “I'm driving the team crazy to think of using one-fifth of the other's budget to produce exactly the same image as the others.”

Provence lavender threatened by climate change
Lavender has become a symbol of the city of Provence in southern France, but there is now bad news that it is threatened by climate change.
As a result of persistent drought and the emergence of viral insects, lavender is declining, causing headaches among scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions.
Eric Chaisse, an expert at the Institute of Agriculture in Provence (CRIEPAM), said: “The lavender of Provence is under great threat, as the plant has been affected by climate change in recent years, and the spring rains have decreased significantly, while the fall has been dark.
This affects the life cycle of lavender.
There is also a small individual twig, a leaf twig that can spread micro-bacterial bacteria, and in very dry weather, they appear in large numbers.”
The key is its enormous volume.
In addition to attracting vacationers, Qingya lavender has also been promoted by the perfume and cosmetics industries.
Eric Chase says, "Contrary to the many big flowers that can be opened, with long avocado plants, we have small, stunted, missing or weak individual problems.
So we have less oil."
The solutions being studied include the adoption of better irrigation techniques and the mitigation of evaporation of soil moisture, the spraying of a protective mixture of clay and water on a plant, and the development of more drought-resistant varieties.
Compared to the science fiction element in the film, it is the story of the film that is more attractive to both of them.
On the afternoon of 5 September, the Washington City journalist, who continued to interview a number of prominent voices, as well as two vocal artists, was surprised by their near-unanimous silence.
One was the Berlin Film Emperor, one was an up-grading young actor, and Psychiatry was the first partner of Liaofan and Li Yi Feng.
Mexico is dangerous, journalists are killed.
The staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the riots in Sinalo, which were caused by criminal organizations, corrupt officials and the endless drug war.
But today, the shadow of tragedy looms over themselves, and they come together to discuss security issues.
It is important that they be told to change their daily habits.
Two senior journalists discussed which was more safe: whether their children should be brought to the office, which had been hit by a grenade in 2009, or whether they should be left at home.
The security expert wrote three words on the blackboard in front of the room: the enemy, the neutral and the ally.
They asked the journalists to name themselves under each column — without the need for evidence, observation and intuition are enough.
The presence of suspected drug traffickers, politicians, businessmen and journalists on government lists, or cartels, is dangerous for Mexican reporting.
The violence continued and the country witnessed a growing number of dead bodies, including journalists: according to the Commission for the Protection of Journalists, at least 25 journalists have died since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012; 589 journalists have been under federal protection following attacks and threats; so far this year, at least 7 journalists have died in seven states.
The last person who died was their editor and inspiration, as well as Javier Valdiz Cárdenas, co-founder of Riodoce.
Valdez has written many books on drug violence, and he wrote in one of them: “The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and become a journalist”.
You can feel very deeply that he has left, even though he is everywhere — a huge picture hanging on the front of the Riodoce office building, with a middle finger and the word “justice”; the T-shirts of Aaron Ivala and Miriam Ramirez, two journalists in their 30-year-olds, also displaying his smile, wearing glasses or his brand-new Panamanian straw hat.
Less than two months after his death, the seminar was held; journalists discussed their common wounds, nightmares, insomnia and paranoia.
Although a special Federal Prosecutor ' s Office was established in 2010 to deal with journalists ' cases, only two cases were prosecuted, according to the records of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.
The vast majority of the thousands of criminal cases per year involved drug trafficking and organized crime, so the perpetrators of the killings of journalists were rarely brought to justice.
In Riodoce, they insisted on reporting on the violence in Sinalo County, although they had been heartbroken, and the land had been devastated.
Ivala said that without information about the perpetrators and justice, it would not be very useful to hold a security seminar.
He said, “It's stupid to waste time participating in a seminar like this.
As long as we don't know why, you don't trust anyone.”
On the morning of 15 May, Valdiz left the Riodoce office in the capital, Culiacan.
His red Toyota Carola drove just a few blocks away and was stopped by two men; they forced him to get out of the car and fired 12 shots, presumably because of the newspaper's name — the XII River.
The assailants left in his car and crashed it in the vicinity.
Valdez is 50 years old.
Leave his wife and two adult children behind.
Curiam's rumours are rife.
But the subject of Valdiz actually has nothing but silence.
Since Guzmán was arrested last year and extradited to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the country's bloodiest battlefields, with all the hostile forces ravaging.
One or more people are shot every day in the streets of Sinaro State, and it is common for graves to be filled with two voracious mausoleums of drug lords.
The “quiet” state was temporarily forgotten at a time when only one cartel controlled the coastal state and its ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States.
Even so, even though Valdiz was well aware of the dangers of the job, the 60-year-old founder and director of Riodoce, Ismail Pohoqué, was guilty of failing to protect his friends.
He believed that two mistakes had led to this tragedy.
First, in February, an interview was published with Damasso Lopez, who led a cartel that fought against several sons of Guzmán.
The story may have provoked the sons; the newspaper was bought by suspected gang members as soon as it arrived at the newsstand.
The second mistake was that Valdiz had not been forced to leave Mexico for his own safety after another newspaper reporting the same story had been confiscated.
Valdiz was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his death was of great significance to the violence against journalists in Mexico.
His spirit endures, and his friends and colleagues believe that he has always been with us.
He was also a senior journalist in Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues in the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 dollars in shares.
Pohoqui said that, in Sinalo, “it is impossible for the press to walk away from the drug problem”.
With the passage of time, the newspaper gained a good reputation for its bold and honest reporting, as did sales and advertising.
Journalists prefer to be able to publish head-on investigative reports without fear of censorship, and readers prefer newspapers to publish stories that others do not dare to report.
Five years after its creation, Riodoce won the María Moskapo Prize for Journalism in Latin America.
The same year, the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the Valdiz International Prize for Freedom of the Press in recognition of his courage in pursuing the most authentic Mexican drug story.
He says he's scared, too.
When the Association for the Protection of Journalists awarded the award, he said, “I want to live.”
Later in the second half of October, in an interview with the local television station Rompetiento TV, he said, “Drug trafficking is a way of life in Sinalo,
You must assume the task that falls on your shoulders as a journalist — either as such, or as deaf as a mute.
I don't want to be asked, "Why don't you make a sound about what's happening in the face of so many deaths?"
All the staff of Riodoce miss Valdez, remembering him cursing like a dock worker, remembering a friend who never hesitated to embrace and advise, and miss a teacher who knew how to live.
They depend on his habits.
He used to wear that hat.
The El Guayabo bar across from the office often sits on the same table.
Now, they will ask: Is it his daily habits that caused his crash?
His death also forced them to think about how to do a good job and live a good life.
“They don't like you causing trouble to their women and children, nor do they like you influencing their legitimate companies and secret airports used to transport drugs.
It's all over their bottom line."
The result is to maintain a high level of self-censorship and self-protection, even in the safest of times.
Trust your instincts.
If you smell dangerous, get away.
Andres Villariel, editor of Riodoce, says that the problem is that “the breath is a feeling of deception ... and then what happens to Javier”.
He and others have said that the previous rules no longer apply to the states of Sinalo — just as they no longer apply to the states of Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states, where smuggling routes are lucrative and institutions are weak, government officials corrupt, and smoky.
The situation is constantly changing.
In the room where the staff of Riodoce participated in security training, the use of mobile phones was suddenly denied; a few days ago, spy software allegedly sold only to the Government had been used in Mexico to monitor journalists and activists.
Outside, two policemen took the cold under the shade, avoiding the temperature of 104 degrees Celsius.
They were sent by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodoce, located in a four-storey building in the middle class neighbourhood of Culiacan.
Some journalists joke about whether the police officers are 50% of what the governor himself says.
Journalists had gone to the mountains for several months, where drug cartels were under de facto control.
The week's Riodoce featured three major events.
Among them was the murder of the brother of Julio Cesar Chávez, a great former boxer in Sinalo County.
There is also the disclosure of government funds from the governor's hometown.
And the kidnapping in a expensive restaurant in Culiacan, just a block from the prosecutor's office.
No official information was published on the targets of kidnapping and the kidnapping process, so it was necessary to write down what the city knew: the restaurant was a destination for drug traffickers and officials alike.
A journalist learned from the public record that the restaurant was registered in the name of a politician of the ruling Revolutionary System Party (PRI), which dominated the political class almost throughout the past.
Recently, several Revolutionary System Party governors have been accused of corruption in several high-priority cases.
Verariel asked journalists to write about what had happened at the scene of the incident, including the escape of one of the sons of the Mexican drug lord Guzman from a military attack.
If only a few months ago, readers would look at the column of Valdiz and look for the most powerful information on the kidnapping.
The young Verarrier, who, because of his thin body, is called “Little Man”, said, “We already knew what had happened before.
Now all our sources of information are cut off.
Valdiz ' s office is now being used to store signs and stickers to protest the killing of journalists, as employees become what they never wanted to be: activists representing the media.
The following morning, journalist Miriam Ramirez took a sign and took it out of the room and went to the office of the local prosecutor to attend a march in connection with another journalist.
El Salvador Adamé disappeared in the western state of Michoacán three days after his murder in Valdez.
Officially, a burnt body was discovered and claimed to be his body according to DNA tests.
Throughout the country, journalists have become more vocal, organizing protests and wearing the words “save the media” on sidewalks and buildings.
On that day, Director Pohoqué was not in Washington and he was trying to bring justice to the Valdiz case and to secure international support.
The day after the killing of Valdiz, in a meeting with the Governor of Sinalo County, Ramírez complained about the official espionage of journalists and the killing of them because they had told the truth.
In view of her anger, which had affected her objectivity, she also requested to resign from reporting on government affairs.
Valdiz has repeatedly reiterated that journalists in Mexico are “backed” by organized crime, mixed-up government officials and indifferent societies.
In his last book, Drug News, he wrote that journalists were not only mutilated by drug cartels, but also on the list of politicians and security forces who were complicit in organized crime.
Media Watch Group Articulo 19 blames police and public officials for more than half of the attacks on journalists last year.
Ramirez said, "In Mexico, they let you die just to shut you up."
Obviously, these murders are chilling.
No one forgets that, six years ago, the Boss, Maria Elizabeth Macias, died on the northern border of Tamaulipas.
Her body was accompanied by a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel: “I came for my report”.
Her head was cut off with a computer keyboard and headphone next to her.
After Miroslava Brech was killed in March, some newspapers opted for closure, such as the El Norte newspaper on the northern border of Chihuahua.
Others continue to be killed in 2014 by the directors of El Manana of Nuevo Laredo.
In 2010, Diario de Ciudad Juarez used a front-page news and open-dialogue drug cartel entitled “What do you want from us?”
Some journalists fled their homes or even left the country.
It's a tough choice.
It is difficult to find jobs in exile, and they still need to be careful and wary of dangers in the streets.
Sometimes they were arrested and in 2015 the photographer Ruben Espinosa was reportedly killed with four women in a Mexican city three months after he fled Veracruz.
For those who continue to work behind the scenes, this is a routine step in high-risk decision-making.
Ivala had wanted to be a poet, and he admitted that reporting on the drug trade scared him.
He said, "Mexico is turning into hell, so I became a journalist."
Last Friday, in the middle of the night, the latest issue of the newspaper had been printed, and the editors of Riodoce sat outside the office drinking beer and suddenly their cell phone rang.
A series of gunfights between rival gang forces and security forces near the beach resort city of Massatland confirmed 19 deaths.
The fighting is escalating, as a series of cartel information found in the region portends.
They uploaded the news to the Riodoce website just by the side of the road via their cell phones.
The next day's headline had to be changed.
The sirens rang in the vicinity — another shoot-out in the area of a deadly duel.
Pohoqué glanced at the police officers standing there guarding them to see if they were alert.
If they were a little scared, they didn't show up.
The founder of the newspaper was killed, and in his large portrait, he pointed to the places where the entire Sinalo State needed to look, and the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps.
“How could you even want to shut down? The day Javier was killed, the intern asked me to send her on the street to report.”
China ' s own-car tourism market size or trillion yuan in 2020
[Summary] In the broader context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free travel, self-tourism is encouraged by national policies and is increasingly favoured by consumers.
At the same time, however, the prospect of breaking the trillion-scale self-driving market faces a double challenge.
In the broader context of rising consumption and the prevalence of free travel, self-tourism is encouraged by national policies and is increasingly favoured by consumers.
At the same time, however, the prospect of breaking the trillion-scale self-driving market also faces a double challenge, with the development of the self-driving industry as opposed to market demand, and self-driving organizations, such as auto-driving clubs and travel agencies, facing a low level of profitability; and, on the other hand, the infrastructure and services facing self-driving are still at an early stage.
60% of the total number of people in the country, and the market is expected to break by trillion.
In 2016, domestic tourism was 4.44 billion times a year, and self-carriage accounted for about 60 per cent of the total number of domestic tourism trips, and the size of the self-carriage market is expected to break out of trillion by 2020.
According to the statistics of the China Touring Boat Association on the number of people travelling in and out of their cars, the number of people travelling in and out of China has continued to grow over the past five years, and the proportion of people travelling in and out of the country has remained stable at over half.
At the same time, regional as well as national levels have shown greater interest and support in the emerging field of self-driving, with policy and regulations relating to self-driving, residential and camping tourism increasingly in place between 2016 and 2017.
In July 2017, eight departments, including the National Tourism Institute and the National Directorate of Sports, jointly issued the Development Plan for Automobile Sports Camps; in the same month, self-travel was highlighted in the Programme of Action for the Promotion of the Development of Precursors of Rural Tourism (2017), which was jointly issued by 14 departments, including the DRC, the Ministry of Finance and others.
The introduction of the policy provides opportunities and policy guidance for the development of the country ' s self-drive.
The self-drive club has little profit, and the whole industry chain is the key.
Despite the enormous potential of the domestic spin-off market and the positive orientation of national policies, the self-drive industry is still at an early stage.
According to China ' s Annual Development Report for Self-Riding 2016-2017, the number of domestic auto-driving clubs, car clubs, car clubs, etc. reached several thousand, but the proportion of tourists travelling on their own by self-help arrangements accounted for the majority, and the proportion of tourists participating in various institutions, such as car-and-friends ' associations, auto-driving clubs and so forth, was only around 15 per cent.
At the same time, the number of online tourism enterprises and traditional travel agencies that are autonomous in the development of self-carriage products is also negligible, with many online tourism platforms selling only self-carriage products from suppliers and some self-carried clubs as important suppliers.
In terms of organizing self-drive activities, many aspects of “eat, live, walk, swim, buy, entertain” are covered, with high fragmentation, heavy upstream supply chains and high random consumption by tourists.
The founder and CEO, CEO Congji Lee, of the Beijing Car Club, considered the self-drive club to be essentially similar to the travel agency, with early major profit models dominated by offline activities and centred on the self-drive line product and lead service.
However, now that there is a high degree of homogenization of line products and varying levels of leadership services in the self-carriage sector, the self-carriage clubs face the need for a renewed transformation.
As can be seen, self-tourism is not an independent industry in itself, but rather, by its shifting character, forms a trans-geographic, industry-based biosphere, and it is important to form a complete chain of industry.
Experts noted that, in addition to basic tourism consumption, experience is a more important element of consumption.
Therefore, for the development of the self-driving industry, it is important to enhance the empirical identity and develop the theme “self-driving +” as well as the IP for the self-driving product.
The landscape is not just a road. Car camps should not be just for food and accommodation.
In the face of the rise of self-driving, the basic development of self-driving is also relatively low.
According to Li Congjie, tourist attractions are not just a road, but require the integration of transport and tourism elements into them, but road and tourism are the responsibility of the two sectors themselves, the transport sector adds tourism elements, and the construction of latrines, counselling centres, billboards, etc., is not sufficiently integrated with tourism.
The construction experience of the well-known self-driving route, the United States 66 Highway, is worth drawing on.
The landscape design is no longer the most direct and rapid route between the point of departure and destination, but is guided by the design concept of “exercise the pleasure of driving”, which provides the best enjoyment for self-carried tourists of the beauty of the road. The landscape is able to connect point and face tourism landscapes, preserving the historical and cultural value of ecotourism resources along the route, as well as organizing thematic events to enhance the participatory and travelling experience of tourists and create economic benefits for local tourism.
In addition to the landscape, the camp is also an important side-facilitating facility.
However, among the self-carried tourists known to the journalists of the New Kyoto newspaper, few consumers chose to stay in the camp.
In their view, many camps are in favour of infrastructure and can only satisfy the need for food and shelter, a low grade, a single product, and a large number of elements of self-travel.
According to industry sources who did not wish to reveal their names, many of the businesses that had been camped in previous years were to take land, after which the later stages of infrastructure construction and services were not kept up, many of the operations were at a loss, and some of the accompanying products were difficult to produce without a later infusion of funds.
Consumption group
According to data published in 2017 by the China Association of Travel Vessels, age groups are concentrated in 21-40 years of age, especially those aged 31-40, with a certain economic base and a high demand for individualized tourism, mostly as parent-and-child travel clients.
According to the accommodation survey, the self-travelling population is relatively more inclined to prefer non-standard accommodation.
In terms of the type of self-driving, the most important type of self-driving is the peri-driving, which is 84.32 per cent.
Expatriation self-driving is a desire of many, but a smaller proportion.
At the same time, with rising consumer demand, visitors who used to like to drive their own “shows” have begun to change their mindsets, no longer “get out of the picture, get in the car and sleep” in the course of their own trips, but focus more on the experiences and processes of travel.
Dinosaurs use their disguises to hide from the enemy.
At first glance, it was scary, but it looked like a statue.
The researcher published the first study of the incredible biochemicals found by Canadian miners, the size of rhinoceros, noting that the fossil was well preserved and therefore the experts referred to it as “Mona Lisa of the dinosaur community”.
The fossil is very well preserved, and it can even be determined that the colour of its scaffolding skin is red brown. This suggests that it has had some "happy experiences."
Relevant reports in Contemporary Biology magazine describe it as “the best preserved picature dinosaur ever discovered, and one of the world's best dinosaur specimens”.
The fossil is a newly discovered type of pulmonary dragon that lives in the mid-Cyberic period of 110 million to 112 million years ago.
Its preservation was so perfect that it shocked the researchers, who described it as “genuinely impressive”.
According to the National Geographic Journal, this herbal pavilion is the best preserved type of dinosaur that has ever been discovered.
On March 21, 2011, Shawn Funk discovered this fossil during mining at the Senkol Millennium Millennium Mine near McMerriburg, northern Alberta, Canada.
At the time, he ran into something that seemed different from the surrounding rock, and he decided to look closely.
The fossils that he discovered were then taken to the Royal Tyrell Biology Museum in Canada.
It took the researchers six years to show the real face of this beast, hidden inside the 2500 pounds (1,100 kg) of earth.
After such hard work, the final results are now being made public.
"If you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping," said Caleb Brown, a scientist and first author of the Royal Terrill Museum. The creature was on display at the gallery.
"It will be one of the most beautiful, best-saved dinosaur specimens in the history of science -- the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world."
Researchers, by studying their skin, found that the herbivores, while wearing armor, like walking tanks, were at risk of major threats from predatory dinosaurs.
The heavy armored dinosaurs use red and white disguises to escape predators, as well as covert techniques known as “anti-shade”, which are also used by many modern animals.
In this way, the experts indicated that it could be better integrated with the surrounding environment, thus avoiding the enemy, indicating that it was preyed upon by larger dinosaurs.
This 110 million-year-old creature, a member of the Journey family, became the headline for the first time in May and is currently on display at the Royal Terrill Biology Museum.
Mark Mitchell, a museum technician who was a member of the team, and after seven hundred hours of careful lifting of the beast's veil, the researchers now study it and name it “Borealopelta marktelli”.
The samples were extremely well preserved, allowing Dr. Mitchell, as well as the international team of scientists, to record the patterns and shapes of the scales and armour on their bodies.
They discovered an anti-shade technique, a common form of defence in the animal community, which meant that the animal had a darker back than its side.
Despite the fact that anti-shade techniques are common, the results found are surprising, as the dinosaurs are much larger in size than the existing animals that use anti-shade.
The dinosaurs are under pressure to be hunted by meat-eating dinosaurs, which evolves in a favourable direction, allowing them to hide in the cross-base as a means of survival.
However, most of the existing anti-shadow animals, such as deer, zebra or zebra, are as small and vulnerable as prey, indicating that the creature is under real survival pressure.
“The wild hunting of large-scale pneumatic dinosaurs shows how dangerous the white-coloured ogres are”, Brown says.
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also showed that the dinosaur had red brown skin colours.
Scientists are continuing to study the life clues of the creature, including its stomach content, in order to find the last food to eat.
In their view, the dinosaurs fell into the river at the time of their death, then washed into the sea and then sank in a back-down way into the sea.
At that time, Alberta's climate was as warm as it is today in the southern part of Florida, and rivers and oceans may be deeper inland than they are today.
Brown said, “This nostril is truly amazing because it is completely covered by the staircase skin that it is preserved and, so far, is preserved in the dimensional space, so as to preserve its original shape.”
“Therefore, the creature is now almost identical in shape to that of the circulatory period.
You don't have to rebuild it with too much imagination; if you look at it, you'll almost believe it's sleeping.”
The time of cataract is a time of two-legged, large animal-footed dinosaurs roaming the earth.
Although the Tyrannosaurus is the king of the dinosaurs, it only appeared a few million years after the Piranzo dinosaurs, which could have been captured by some of the Tyrannosaurus' ancestors.
They include high-crested dragons, a giant beast weighing 6 tons, long 38 feet (11.5 metres).
Recent studies have found that scientists appearing in Contemporary Biology magazine believe that nodes were washed into the sea after their death and that mummies were formed in the mud.
On March 21, 2011, Sean Fink dug up the creature at the Millennium Mine near Fort McMurley, Alberta, Canada.
According to the museum, it is the world ' s best preserved picature dinosaur, with complete skin and armor in the area from the nose to the hip.
The average length of this organism is about 18 feet (5 m) and weighs 3000 pounds (1300 kg).
It's got two 20 inches long, sharp horns from the shoulder.
According to researchers, this herbal pavilion operates in the current western part of Canada and is then swept into the sea by flood-spilling rivers.
However, such dinosaurs are buried in the sea floor so that their coats can be preserved in their entirety.
The fossil remains of this particular sample are very well preserved, leaving the residual skin still covered by the puncture of the skull of the dinosaur.
As Michael Greshko wrote in the National Geography magazine, this preservation is very rare, as it is in the middle colour.
The more I look, the more I find it incredible.
Residue skin fossils continue to be covered by refrigerated armor on the skull of the dinosaur.
Its right front palm is on its side, with five toes going up.
I can count it out."
Journalists learned that adding natural or plant-based kelp acids, corrosion acids and amino acid efficiency carriers to urea production processes allowed for the transformation of traditional urea, resulting in an increase of 5-10 percentage points in the use of urea, zinc corrosion urea and urea nitrides compared to general urea.
Environmentally friendly, with a clear potential for increased crop yields, urea, especially in large particulates, is a high-quality material of BB-fat.
This total number of security personnel is twice as high as the number of security personnel at the 2012 London Olympic Games.
In order to ensure the safety of the Rio Olympic Games, Brazil will launch the largest-ever security liaison programme.
Previously, the Brazilian Government had indicated that a total of 85,000 people from the army and the police, including 20,000 military and 65,000 police, would work together.
The majority of the military will be responsible for the protection of Olympic stadiums, while the additional 3,000 will be responsible for the security of international airports, metro stations and streets.
The police patrol the rest of the city, including the metro, bus and street.
According to the information received, 6,000 military personnel have now arrived in Rio to provide security for the Olympic Games.
In addition to the four major areas of the Rio Olympic Games, they are also responsible for patrolling the airport and the main roads connecting the airport to the Olympic complex.
The introduction of evaluation mechanisms in the service sector is no longer new, and for evaluation mechanisms to be effective, it is important to make regulation more effective and less formal.
How radicals learn to answer this question: "Whose street?"
On August 9, 2014, Brittany Ferrer was disturbed in his heart.
On the first day of his trip to New York City, the St. Louis man sat in a rent-in bed in Episode, browsing Facebook on his cell phone.
She accidentally found a post by a high school student.
It says, "The police just killed an 18-year-old kid who was lying on the street."
She was confused when she discovered that no other person had published the message on the feed. She turned off Facebook and turned on Twitter.
One @TheePharaah user kept pushing her for the Dynamic Times.
Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old black man, was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Missouri.
He posted a picture of Brown's body lying on the street with lost vital signs and his body lying on the street for four hours.
"Magic," Ferrer thought.
But death is not new to her and her community.
She dropped her cell phone and did not turn on Twitter until the same night to read the tweets about the crowd gathering on Canfield Avenue.
There's a police video and a photo of people screaming, and there's a photo of a man who claims to be Brown's father, and it says, "Policies Ferguson just killed my unarmed son!"
She saw a live feed and a policeman standing in front of a crowd of protesters with a barking dog.
In another video, she said, another policeman raised his rifle and screamed, “I will kill all of you ... animals”.
“It's not normal,” Ferrer recalled.
“This is not what we used to call a typical murder.”
At that moment, I felt chilly.
I'm angry, I'm crying."
She booked a return flight and went home the next day.
After landing at 11 p.m., she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided to go to Ferguson the following morning.
In the next three years, what happened to Ferrer and Ferguson was the theme of a new documentary, "Who's Street? " , on the 11th of August at the cinema.
This is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and tenacity from the perspective of those who live in this community and are crowded with streets and alleys demanding answers.
When Ferrer drove to Ferguson with her daughter, wearing a flower dress, wearing a coronation, the two rediscussed the countless topics that they had discussed before that morning: “About black experiences and the situation of blacks”.
"Do you remember when I taught you when black people had to fight for their faith?" She recalled.
"We're going to Ferguson now because the police killed an 18-year-old boy, which is wrong.
I had to take her with me, "Real said later.
“What happened today is the climax of everything in the past.
She needs to know, see and rise from this.
She needs not only to develop well in radicalism and organizational aspects, but also to understand the different dimensions of the black experience and the black situation and what we must do in order to be free and free.
Even if I had the privilege of providing her with a racist experience that she had not experienced personally, she was no different from other black girls.
If I protect her in this matter, I think I'm hurting her."
Their first stop at Ferguson is at a site opposite the South Florence police station. The site became their camp when the militants waited for the final outcome of Officer Darren Wilson’s failure to prosecute.
Ferrer and her daughter contacted a local business owner who was packing lunch.
They prepared a bag, which they handed to the protesters.
Slowly, Ferrer began to form a new type of activism.
She said, “My radicalism changed completely after 9 August.” At St. Louis, Missouri State University, she was president of the Association of Nurses and Students of Ethnic Minorities, focusing on the gap between food justice and health in the black community.
“I have no organizational experience.
And that's all there is to it."
A few weeks later, Ferrer met with the film co-director, Sabah Fleiyan, during a night march.
Fleiyan said that she and her photographer, Lucas Alvarado Fall, “just wanted to record what happened”.
A question arises in Ferrer's mind: "Do you want to record or find a story you can use?"
This suspicion stems from many cases in which people, usually whites, enter a community to benefit from their pain and resilience.
As Fryán explained in his latest interview, “we have heard that native-born people in Ferguson do not concentrate their voices, and we want to do it differently”.
Fryyan has contacted co-director Damon Davis. Damon Davis is a regional artist known for radicalism against prisoners on death row.
His involvement brought Ferrer together with six other locals to join the “Who's Street?” project team, which lasted several years after the shooting of Brown.
“This documentary is not a talk or talk to us, this is our statement.” Davis says.
"I'm concerned about how these people are presented, because that's the way I'm being presented."
Although the goal is not to focus on Ferrer’s experience – but to show that the campaign “is not about the Savior’s leader, but about community cohesion”, Fryyan says – she has proved to be the most open of film participants.
As a result, “Who's Street?” is a surprising record of Ferrer's personal life, such as falling in love and entering into marriage.
"I feel naked, and Ferrer laughed when he first saw the finished product.
“I understand, however, that a certain degree of vulnerability is necessary to do this and to humanize blacks.”
In addition, the Ferrer story reaffirms and repositions the role of black cool women in the wider black life event movement.
Two of the three founders of the movement -- the creation of #BlackLivesMutter on social media following the 2012 shooting of a black teenager, Trevor Martin -- were identified as cool.
“Black cool women in leadership generally support this movement,” said Ferrer, “That's because we are fighting on multiple fronts.
Black cool women have to live with this."
Flaiyan agreed and said, “This movement really enjoys the support of black women and many black cool women.”
Because of her identity, Ferrer was chosen as the core of the film. However, she insisted that this was not “a positive action for the sake of the matter”.
"She's the one who inspired this energy," she said.
“Although she's on the front line, it's not a coincidence. Because in these crossroads, as a black cool woman, you have a lot to do.
You can feel her energy through the screen."
Meanwhile, in Ferguson, news cameras had long disappeared, but ethnic tensions between the community and the police persisted.
As a result of an attempt to block the highway during a demonstration, Ferrer was given a suspended sentence of more than two and a half years.
She described the socio-political atmosphere in what she called the area of the home: “a mess.”
Nevertheless, since she went to the streets of Ferguson three years ago, she has insisted on the hymn she tried to remember.
“It is our duty to fight for freedom.
It is our responsibility to win.
We must love each other and support each other.
We can no longer fail, except the shackles of our bodies.”
In fact, online translation services had been available on the Internet 10 years ago, and the argument that “machines are about to replace human translation” had been heard a long time ago.
Similarity: Artists create portraits using the DNA of Chelsea Manning
There are multiple faces in the center of the museum in Friedman, New York: white, black and brown, with almost undetectable similarities between each face, bound by the ropes that descend from the ceiling.
The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg using Chelsea Manning's cheek tampons and hair shreds.
Manning sent hair crumbs from Livingworth Fort Prison, where the former intelligence analyst was sentenced to 35 years ' imprisonment for leaking confidential diplomatic telegrams via WikiLeaks website.
The exhibit, entitled “Similarities”, was opened on 2 August.
This is the result of two years of communication between Dewey Hagburg and Manning, Dewey Hagburg, who combines his discipline with his own technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a famous dissident, who went to prison and completed a transgender surgery in prison. Former US President Barack Obama pardoned her remaining sentence three days before the end of her tenure.
Arithmetic analysis from Manning's DNA, and the creation of 30 portraits of the “probably possible appearance” of this image. Heather Duway Harborg made a sharp and somewhat merciless comment. His comment was both on the multi-meaning nature of DNA and on the concept of identity itself.
Manning was born with the name Bradley Edward, who publicly admitted that she was a woman at puberty. He was convicted in 2013 of 20 charges, including 6 espionage offences, computer fraud and theft.
In prison, her image was repressed, with only one photograph, a photo of herself in a particle-sensitive black and white, apparently uneasy, sitting in the driver's seat, wearing a platinum-colored wig.
In 2015, Heather Duway Harborg was a great success in her 2012 project, The Face of Strangers.
In that work, she created a portrait of a possible similar 3D figure, using DNA taken from cigarette butts and gums in mid-court exhibits, from scraps.
That's exactly an e-mail she received from PaperSmart magazine.
“They want to interview Chelsea Manning in prison, and they need a photo,” Heather Duway Harborg said to the media at the opening of the exhibition.
Chelsea Manning couldn't visit and take pictures, so they contacted Chelsea and asked if she was interested in making DNA portraits.
As a result, the artist and her imprisoned muse became impossible pen friends and exchanged many letters over a period of two years.
They even created a comic book, The Repressed Head, by Shoili Kanungu. The comic book envisaged that the president would grant Manning privileges in the future, and that she would be able to see an exhibition in prison.
And Obama asked for her release just a few days after the publication of the book. This is perhaps a coincidence, when Manning spent his seventh year in Kansas Military Prison.
In addition, the exhibition has another meaning. Because of the current US, the Trump government has continuously declared war on government leakers and transgender soldiers, while seeking new ways to unmask the division, which the exhibition is trying to bridge, and which can be tweaked on Twitter.
When asked about all this particular occasion, Heather Duway Harborg said, “Anything happens for a reason”.
In the artist's statement written on the gallery wall, Manning's super-large signature is down there, calling for an end to the “mixed images of parties based on gender, sexual orientation and culture”.
On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence, with pencils twisting Cs, Gs and As symbols.
With 200 letters (or nucleotide, a complex scientific dictionary for every artist), Heather Duway Harborg wants to express itself, at least in a physiological structure, by drawing these amazingly similar portraits.
“I hope that people get out of this dilemma, that our genome doesn't care who we are, how our open genetic data are interpreted, how subjective it is,” Heather Duway Harborg says, his 2007 video, The False Memory, is also on display.
"DNA data can tell many different stories, so this is 30 of them."
The last piece of work in the exhibition, in a room, came from a page in a novel in the previous illustration.
The soldiers in the United States were shown to be exaggerating under a loudspeaker, a manning made of gold.
"When they stop your speech, they win," says the wall.
"So, don't shut up."
"This came directly from a letter she wrote to me," said the artist from Philadelphia.
"I'm afraid again, and I'm still going to say it."
Manning hasn't seen the exhibition in person, as foreseen in the comic book, but when she does, she'll get her own DNA portrait mask, like a group of protesters in the center of the pavilion cheering.
It's also purposeful, as with all the items in the exhibition, to reach the height of the genetic monotonous information she wrote in pencils (5.2 feet, Manning's height).
“In the past, I put them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a group of people”, Dewey Hagburg said when he spoke of the portrait.
“But I want them to feel like a group of protesters following Chelsea, just as people were protesting against her release.”
Northwestern University Professor and Oxford University staff are wanted for murder.
According to the police, a man was found to have been fatally stabbed in a luxury apartment in Chicago, and a Northwestern university professor and an Oxford university employee were subsequently wanted and are currently searching for suspects throughout the country.
The Cook County Court records show that on Monday, 42-year-old Windham Lesem and 56-year-old Andrew Wallen were arrested for the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranlo for a first-degree unbailed murder warrant.
According to the documents, 26-year-old Cornell Duranlo died as a result of multiple stab wounds.
According to a community alert issued by the Chicago Police Department, the body was found on 27 July.
Upon receiving a telephone call, the police arrived at the Grand Plaza apartment and found several fractures on the victim ' s body.
According to the police, Cornell Duranlo died instantly, the detective is investigating the murder, and the police are actively looking for the two suspects.
Lesam has been an associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007.
In an e-mail statement, the Deputy Director of Campus Relations, Alan K. Cobbage, stated that Lesem had now been separated from his post and had been denied access to the University of the North West campus.
According to Kabechi, “it is now a criminal case, which is being investigated by the relevant authorities, and the University of the North West, which is actively cooperating with the investigation”.
Warren is a senior finance assistant at Oxford University.
“We have been in contact with the British police and stand ready to assist U.S. investigative agencies as required”, a spokesman for the Summerville College, Oxford University, in an e-mail statement.
The statement added that all of Warren's colleagues were deeply shocked and hoped that he would be able to turn himself in.
Anthony Güllermi, Chief Liaison Officer of the Chicago Police Department, expressed strong encouragement to suspects to surrender to the authorities.
Gulermi stated that “the police have a general idea of their whereabouts, and we are trying to locate possible locations”.
Gulermi indicated that local, regional and national authorities were fully assisting in the search of suspects.
Gulermi stated that the police had received a telephone call from the manager of the Grand Plaza apartment, and that he had just received a secret reminder that something had happened in apartment No. 1008.
The police described the situation as terrible.
Gulermi stated that it was still unclear whether the incident had also occurred on 27 July.
He stated that, according to the security cameras, it was confirmed that Lesem and Warren were in the building at the time.
“We believe that Professor Lessem has a relationship with the victims,” according to Güllermi.
The management team of Grand Plaza issued a statement to the residents that “the police are currently studying the victim's timeline and circumstances and are investigating various motives, including a possible domestic incident”.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Muteko stated that “we will complete the road map for the world anti-doping agency in the near future”.
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko stated that it would not take too long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) for restoring the rights of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).
“The implementation of the road map standards has reached a certain stage, and RUSADA has acquired the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (United Kingdom Anti-Doping Agency).
The WADA Road Map has been updated in this regard.” Muteco indicated on Thursday.
Deputy Prime Minister Muteko made the above statement in his comments on the second part of the Compliance Provisions of the World Anti-Doping Agency road map, which set out the criteria for the restoration of RUSADA rights and was recently published on the organization ' s website.
According to Mutko, the criteria do not contain anything that could cause Russian concern.
He added that “everything has to be declared, and everything will be implemented.
The results will also be submitted to IOC [IOC] and WADA in the near future.”
One of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, is that the Russian anti-doping agency must publicly accept the findings of the investigation into the use of stimulants in national sports, approved by Canadian lawyer Richard MacKaylen on WADA, by the Russian State.
Turning to this, Muteco said, “We are investigating that our anti-doping system has undoubtedly failed.
All measures have been implemented.
But there is no national plan behind it, and we will not acknowledge what does not exist.”
Mutko's words echoed the words of Vitaly Smirnov, head of the independent Russian public anti-doping committee.
Smirnov acknowledged the past problems of the Russian anti-doping agency when he was interviewed by the media earlier that day, but added: “We have said on various occasions that the report contains controversial positions and provisions.
No one plans to accept the report unconditionally,” Smirnov said.
Following the November 2015 stimulant scandal, WADA suspended the right of RUSADA to carry out stimulant screening in Russia.
But in June this year, RUSADA was allowed to plan and coordinate tests this year under the supervision of international experts and UKAD.
During his visit to the organization's headquarters in Moscow in July, the Director-General of WADA, Olivia Negrey, stated that RUSADA was “going in the right direction” in an effort to restore its rights.
For computers, whether it be chess or national chess, defeating human beings was no longer a matter of decades ago.
In an interview, Croatian FIFA President Davo-Suk said that participation in the Chinese Cup was very interesting for Croatian football, and that the number of prizes for the Chinese Cup was very high.
No more surrogates! There's zero duty on more than 8,000 products.
On 11 January, at a regular press conference organized by the Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Commerce press spokesman peaked at the conclusion that, to date, there are 15 FTAs in force in our country, covering 23 countries and territories, covering more than 8,000 duty-free imports.
At the same time, imports of cosmetics, Icelandic salmon, Chilean wine, tropical fruits of ASEAN... these products you want are no longer purchased at great cost.
At present, 16 free trade agreements have been signed with 24 countries and territories, and 15 have entered into force, covering more than 8,000 zero-tariff imports.
In the case of agricultural products, with the implementation of the FTA, consumers are able to taste agricultural products of varying origin, of good quality and at low cost, every four quarters of the year.
For example, in ASEAN, tropical fruits such as durians, thugs and falcons, import tariffs are reduced from 15 to 30 per cent to zero.
Tariffs on Iceland ' s salmon imports were reduced from 10 to 12 per cent to zero;
(a) The red wine of Georgia and Chile, where import tariffs are reduced from 14 to 30 per cent to zero;
There are also significant tax cuts for special agricultural products such as beef and milk powder in New Zealand.
In the case of industrial goods, for example, part of the import of cosmetics in Switzerland has been reduced to zero;
(b) A 50 per cent reduction in duty duties on selected watch imports, which will be reduced to zero in a few years;
Korea ' s import tariffs on products such as refrigerators, cooking pans, massage machines, beauty machines, etc. have been reduced by 40 per cent and will be reduced to zero in a few years ' time;
There are also significant tax reductions for consumer-type electronics, among others.
At the same time, the zero-tariff products under the FTA also include intermediate products and raw materials required for the manufacture of many domestic final consumer goods, which in part contribute to the structural upgrading of domestically produced consumer goods.
The Ministry of Commerce press spokesman, at a peak, said that our imports of nearly one third of the total volume of our products were subject to preferential tariff treatment under the Agreement on Trade-Related Agreements, most of which were end-of-life consumer goods, bringing tangible benefits to consumers.
Further reduction of tariffs on imports of consumer goods
Since 1 December 2017, we have adjusted our tariffs on the import of some consumer goods, further reducing our tariffs on the import of consumer goods, covering all kinds of consumer goods, including foodstuffs, health products, medicines, daily goods, shoe caps, household equipment, cultural entertainment, and groceries, for a total of 187 tax numbers.
The average tax rate for this consumer product will be reduced from 17.3 per cent to 7.7 per cent, almost “stopping off”!
Since 1 January 2018, our customs duties on other imports and exports have also been partially adjusted.
(a) Tariffs on imports of some cosmetics, such as lipstick, eye shadow, perfume, etc., were reduced from 10 per cent to 5 per cent;
Lowering tariffs means that consumers do not have to purchase, let alone travel all the way abroad to buy their preferred foreign products.
2018 U.S. Imported Merchandise Shopping Festival: Imported wine, snacks, fruits...all cheap!
Exterior: At the end of the year, the U.S. malls made a big difference.
China-New Network December 29th.
According to the United States Daily News, just after Christmas, there was a retreat.
According to the American Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), about half of the goods sold last Christmas were re-exported.
In addition, readers have been defrauded on a number of pop-up web purchases, and consumers need to be careful when shopping on informal websites.
In general, large shopping companies have formal and reasonable return procedures, but when buying gifts or electricity from small shops, care must be taken.
Ms. Huo of Rolandon bought a coat on 1 December local time at an online shop specializing in stamp jackets, at a cost of over 60 (US$, under the same) and has not yet arrived.
She sent an e-mail to the customer's service, and she didn't reply.
There were also reports of a visit to the United States last year to buy a mobile phone from a third-party seller, which was sent and found to be a box of rubber mud.
After knowing that he had been deceived, he applied to the website for a refund, which was good enough to be paid in full.
But there are also customers who believe that the website refund service is not 100% perfect.
Mr. Wang, a Chinese resident of Northern California, said that there had been two purchases of an emergency distribution service for a website, one for an emergency service of $4, but neither had been delivered on time.
No response was received to a subsequent application for a refund.
Large malls or shopping malls have a better return policy.
Most of Macy's commodities are fully refunded within 180 days.
Goods must, however, remain “old” and must have purchase vouchers such as receipts or bank purchase records.
In the absence of a certificate, the customer may also obtain a market score, which can be used for the purchase of other commodities.
Target usually had a 90-day return period for general commodities, and electronics usually had 15 days.
However, the period for the return of electronic, entertainment-type goods purchased between 1 November and 25 December 2017 was extended to 30 days.
It should be noted that the 30-day period for refunds began to run on 25 December, i.e., before 25 January 2018.
A great shopping experience, a new era of shopping in the business world.
More than a decade ago, our country was in the overall market for sellers, with limited options and limited demand.
After a decade of development, however, markets had long been transformed from seller to buyer markets, and the consumer's taste had become worse, and they were no longer content with simple shopping practices of “one hand, one hand, delivery”.
Thus, how to give consumers an extreme shopping experience becomes the next competition for real estate developers.
Among the many factors affecting consumer shopping experiences, the impact of shopping centres in the business world is most significant.
It's about how local city builders focus on shopping experiences.
There are no two completely identical leaves in the world, nor are there two completely identical shopping centres, and a well-known shopping centre necessarily has its own characteristics.
For example, the world-famous Kanyon shopping mall in Turkey, whose unique wave-shaped architectural design is inspired by Canyon, is named Kanyon, who walks in the 200-metre walk of Minister Kanyon as if it were inside the Grand Canyon.
In addition to canyon-style designs, there is a large elliptical performance site in the centre of shopping malls, which is unique in shape and often features.
The open platform was designed to allow tourists to walk on each level to look down at the activities carried out in the “cany” and to have the effect of a change of scenery.
Domestically, the Nanjing Forest Moor Commercial Street, known as China ' s first forest-style roaming consumer, combines shopping perfectly with ecology and fairy tales.
The 7000 square metres Green Square, the 3,000 square metres roof water platform, a project consisting of nine single-body buildings, air-column connections between the buildings, the overall submersion of the courtyard design, the top of which is the surface of the building, the roof water roof, and the creation of a forest-like feeling.
Walking into Forest Moore is like falling into a rabbit's hole in Alice's vagabond, climbing the trunks surrounding the building, the grasslands, the springs, and bringing people into a forest full of life and vitality.
Also in Chongqing, the Jujia Water Community, built by Dragon Lake, plans for 100 different businesses, plans to introduce in the future more than 50 international flagship flagships, more than 100 international top brands and more than 500 national and foreign brands to become centres of business with a conglomerate of services industries with a strong thematic focus.
In addition to this, the Rigga Water Community integrates ecology into buildings, is guided by tod public transport, brings together fashion shopping, living services, catering, recreation, education, sports, while also leading consumers to enjoy the unique “waterfront culture” of Chongqing, which combines shopping with aquatic recreation and leisure.
On the whole, it can be seen that a number of housing enterprises now have insight into this new urban business trajectories, and industry sources suggest that this consumer model, centred on the consumer experience, and how to combine shopping with experience, will also be the mainstream of future urban development.
The business world today is not only a repository of goods, but also a complex of artistic, creative themes, and carries with it the responsibility of people to live in urban areas.
Thus, while meeting the one-stop material needs of consumers to eat, drink and play, maximizing the multilayered spiritual need for the transmission of culture and art, and fulfilling the need for habitable housing, must be a high point for the future development of the business community.
In Chongqing, the north bank of the nation's flourishing mountain, north of the river, near the bridge of sound, the world's commercial excellence, the confluence of international giants, the confluence of first-class brands, and close proximity to international fashion.
There's a lot of pace here, and there's a lot of beauty in the world.
Toyohara, for its part, has a better shopping environment, as it is close to the South Lawn Business Circle, with exclusive access to the West and even the country ' s leading four-storey traffic system, which enhances the comfort of shopping.
In addition, the greening of the groves and landscape floors on the two walking streets of Leisure and Wanda Square has been upgraded, with the planting of approximately 300 ox logs, the remodelling of 40,000 square metres and the enhancement of the image of the South Lawn Business Circle;
On the other hand, Lake Dragon Lake One, near Chongqing's first low-density waterfront, surrounded by nine parks, low density and openness of commercial neighbourhoods, makes people more willing to stay, stay and enjoy the pleasure of shopping, rather than rushing ahead in a rush by the people behind them.
Today's commercial competition will only grow more intense, and it is worth serious thinking by all real estate developers about how to kill a bloody path in a highly homogenous market and capture the reputation of “shopping sites” in the minds of future consumers.
Differential strategies alone are far from sufficient, and only those developers who really put consumers in their minds, rush consumers, think consumers' minds, and offer consumers an extraordinary and simple shopping experience can laugh in the markets where storms come.
Of course, at the end of the day, I thought it would be the people of Chongqing, with such a good shopping experience and a business circle, that no one could have imagined today's plentifulness 10 years ago.
Festival: Consumerist carnivals to mask real environmental prices
16,82.2 billion dollars, which is the sum of the amount consumed by Skycat users within 24 hours of the 11th Global Carnival, 11 November 2017.
Specifically, three minutes after the two 11s, the cat's deal breaks by 10 billion, six minutes and five seconds to more than 20 billion dollars and nine hours to 100 billion dollars.
On that day, the total number of payments made by consumers worldwide through the payment of treasures amounted to 1.48 billion, an increase of 41 per cent over the previous year.
These consumption will result in 812 million logistics orders.
Whether Skycat buys platforms or pay-as-you-go platforms, all belong to the Ali Group in Maun.
Ten years ago, no one would have thought that the monolithic subculture of 11 November, created by self-defeating cynicism, would be compiled by electric dealers as a “double 11” shopping carnival of the present-day phenomenon.
On November 11, 2009, Alibaba used the first marketing head of the "Photo Festival": no one was in love with you, so the "single dogs" came to buy it online.
Surprisingly, this day's trade in Treasure Stewardship (the “Sky Cat”'s predecessor) exceeded $52 million, 10 times the day's day-to-day turnover.
Since then, the “double 11” has become the shopping carnival built by Ali Baba, with domestic buyers enjoying themselves from the beginning to the current influx of global traders. Nine years later, the “double 1.1 billion” trade in Skycats has been more than 3,200 times the same year, making the “black Friday” impossible.
There are also a number of power suppliers, the strongest of which is the "Kingdong".
“Kyoto” has its own shopping festival, “6.18”, but with no “double 11” impact, the cumulative sales of “Kyoto” reached $12.7 billion this year, from 1 to 11 November.
After the “twilight 11”, it was followed by a similar “twilight 12” carnival, Christmas New Year shopping slot.
After the New Year, Chinese consumers were waiting for the pre-spring annual purchase slot, Valentine's Day shopping slot, and consumption was not on vacation.
The environmental implications of instantaneous consumption of large amounts of energy have attracted the attention of professionals and institutions.
According to Xinhua's daily telecommunications, the average standard of 0.2 kg per box in industry is conservatively estimated to produce at least 300,000 tons of garbage during the “double 11” period this year.
Liu Hua, Director of Pollution Prevention and Control Project, Greenpeace East Asia Division, told the China-China dialogue that this year's “double 11” Skycat-only orders generated 160,000 tons of packaged garbage.
A report issued by the National Post Office in 2016 indicated that, during the “double 11” period (11-16 November) in 2015, the amount of fastware was about 780 million pieces, using more than 3 billion woven bags, 9,922 million boxes and 16,985 million metres of tape, with tape lengths that could circle the Earth's equator 425 laps.
This year, however, the National Post Office expects a “double 11” fastware business volume of more than 1.5 billion items.
The manager of a waste-burning centre in Beijing City, Wang, told Xinhua Society that more than 2,000 tons of garbage had entered the site every day after Xinhua, and that it exceeded the capacity of the burning station.
Express delivery companies have become aware of the environmental pollution caused by the express delivery industry.
A number of power suppliers, including Suning, introduced recycled and reused plastic delivery boxes prior to “double 11”, recycling bags that could be reused as shopping bags and garbage bags, but the troublesome consumer acceptance was low.
Ma'un also called on the logistics industry to support “green packaging” and “green logistics” in Twitter.
The microblogging yielded more than 68,000 “celebrities”.
What kind of mobile payments do the Germans want?
Q: The mobile payment battle in Germany is not expected.
We don't pay and pay but to move the battlefield to Europe. The rivals have not changed, the position has not changed — the Chinese, is globalization?
And wherefore there shall be a payment of a treasure, and there shall be a payment of a messenger.
Under an agreement with Wirecard, an electronic payment service provider in Germany, the payment was officially made in November of this year in Germany and is gradually being laid out by businesses in the European context.
The two “home towns” met this time in Europe.
The payment of treasures and the payment of micro-mails have been singing all along the path of globalization.
With regard to China ' s approach to the globalization of mobile payments, Irene ' s consultation on the China Third Party Mobile Payment Industry Study 2017 concluded that there were two types of measures: strategic investment, export of experience, equity and support for foreign domestic mobile pay enterprises.
The second is the promotion of mobile payment services to foreign businesses through the consumption behaviour of Chinese tourists abroad, thereby changing the perception and acceptance of China ' s mobile payments by foreign natives.
It's true, the Chinese get the world.
China ' s rapid economic development, coupled with a large population base, is a tempting figure for Chinese tourists in Europe.
But it is also doomed that the Chinese mobile payment battle, which was pulled out of Germany this time, has no expectation.
Is it also globalization that the micro-credit payments and the payment of the treasures merely move the battlefield to Europe, that the competitors have not changed, that the positions seized have not changed — or that of the Chinese?
A more pioneering exploration is whether China ' s mobile payments can spread its territory on the mainland of Europe.
Take Germany, for example.
"New Retail" enchanted.
Chen, Yang Kaihe: The Amazon announces military bookstores and grocery stores, regardless of timing or motivation, as it crowds into the world’s 10 largest retailers.
In November 2015, Amazon opened the first real bookshop in Seattle, followed by two bookstores in Portland and Santiago.
At the beginning of 2017, Amazon opened a shop in New York and plans to have at least eight by the end of the year.
At almost the same time, Amazon announced that no-man ' s supermarket (Amazon Go) was running on a trial basis, that customers did not have to queue to the store, nor did they have to close the accounts, that the door was open, that the desired merchandise was taken away, and that the purchase amount was automatically deducted from the customer ' s Amazon account.
In the case of the Amazon, the sudden frequency of movement on the real store in recent years is a very unexpected event.
Because as early as 2007, in an open letter to shareholders, CEO Jeff Bezos stressed that the Amazon would not open a real shop easily unless the following four conditions were met simultaneously:
1. We must be certain that this new opportunity will yield returns on shareholders ' investments;
We must be convinced that this new opportunity is of great importance to the company as a whole;
3. We must be convinced that this new opportunity is ignored by the market;
4. We must be convinced that in this market we have sufficient resources to make customer-oriented differentiation.
Bookshops and grocery stores are the most rocky classification of retail sales in both entities and the first to fall in the wake of the rise of the Amazon.
The Amazon announced its entry into the markets of both entities, regardless of timing or motivation, as it crowds into the world ' s 10 largest retailers.
Was the Amazon practice contrary to the assurances contained in the shareholder's letter?
A similar voice was heard on the other side of the globe. On the morning of October 13, 2016, at the Hangzhou Cloud Habitat Congress, President Ma Yun of the Board of Directors of Alibaba gave a keynote address.
He said, “From next year, Ali Baba will no longer mention the term ‘electronic commerce’.
The era of pure power suppliers will soon come to an end and there will be no e-commerce in the next 10, 20 years, to be replaced by `new retail'.
New retailing takes place when there is a combination of on-line and logistics.”
At one point, the word “new retailing” was as enchanted as it was, and was frequently talked to by the industry.
But what exactly does “new retail” mean?
If it's just a combination of the finger line and the line, then the concept is not new.
In 2016, eMarketer, after tracking 180 of the largest electricity suppliers, estimated the total sales to be around US$ 200 billion, of which the largest 25 accounted for more than US$ 159 billion.
Of these 25, 18 are traditional retailers (e.g. Macy's Department, Nordstrom, Target, Gap, etc.) that have only started operating on the line in the last five years.
The Aribaba Group, with its $28.3 billion in shares in the Suning Clouds, is also well known.
Globally, retailers and electricians are shifting from a single channel to an all-channel retail system that covers real shops, power suppliers, mobile end and socialized media.
Is Maunti “new retailing” more a summing up than a vision for the future?
If not, what is the difference between the whole channel concept and “new retailing”?
Perhaps the point is not whether or not to merge online with underline, but rather how to integrate.
Looking back at the past 20 years of retail trade, the rise of electricity suppliers, like the early rise of discounted retailers, focused on prices and convenience.
On the basis of these two pains, the electrician moved the highly standardized products, such as books and CDs, from the bottom of the line to the line.
With the development of on-line consumption habits and the growing experience of customers, electricians have extended their tentacles to other groups of goods and have begun to improve efficiency.
In the words of Alibaba CEO Zhang, “using the ideas and technologies of the Internet to comprehensively reform and upgrade the existing stock of about 30 trillion social retailers, makes it possible to effectively meet the rising consumer demand of Chinese consumers and makes the entire process of production, circulation, service delivery more efficient because of the extensive use of the Internet and big data”.
The electrician road is therefore a superficially light and physically asset-intensive road.
“Light” means that the burden of fixed assets, staffing, management processes, etc. is not high in the traditional retail industry; “Light” means that huge inputs are required in logistics, warehousing, etc.
Changes in logistics modalities have ensured the efficiency of power suppliers.
According to the Chinese Government's online sources, the Premier of the State Council, Li Keqiang, hosted the State Council's Standing Meeting on 28 April, which considered the expansion of domestic consumption demand to be an important step towards steady growth and structural adjustment.
It was determined that specific programmes would need to be developed as a matter of urgency, on the basis of scientific assessments.
(a) The introduction by the end of June this year of a pilot project to reduce import tariffs and gradually expand the range of duty-reducing goods for a large portion of the foreign consumer demand;
(b) To improve the consumer tax policy on consumer goods, such as clothing and cosmetics, in conjunction with the reform of the tax system, and to harmonize the scope of the tax, the tax rate and the collection chain;
(b) The creation and rehabilitation of border entry duty-free shops, the rational expansion of the tax-free variety, the increase of a certain amount of duty-free shopping, and the facilitation of the purchase of foreign products by domestic consumers in the country;
Further promotion of customs clearance and tax refunds for foreign travellers, and strict enforcement of legal voluntary tax reporting requirements for imported goods.
(b) Develop a quarantine policy to support cross-border electricity suppliers ' imports and clean up unreasonable fees for imports;
To accelerate the promotion of the branding of Chinese products, to support real shop development and to achieve off-line and off-line interaction.
Regulates the market order, falsifies hypocrisy and promotes victory.

On 18 January, in Chongqing, Ali Baba held a high-level dialogue on de-poverty among electricians, announcing the promotion of accurate poverty eradication and rural revitalization through the exploration of a new “Internet + anti-poverty” model.
This is a further “plus” of Ali's fight against poverty, following the introduction of a rural strategy, the launch of a rural treasure-hunting project, the online farmers' anti-poverty platform and the establishment of the Ali Baba poverty alleviation fund.
The fight against poverty is one of China ' s most important national strategies of the present time.
The total eradication of poverty has never been achieved in China in the last few thousand years.
“The alleviation of poverty by electric power suppliers is an innovation in the new round of pro-poor development and is an important enabler in achieving the goal of poverty reduction and poverty eradication.
The Centre attaches great importance to, and notes, the role that the Internet can play in contributing to the fight against poverty, promoting precision poverty, precision poverty alleviation and the release of agricultural products from the countryside through the Internet.”
Thus, as early as 2014, Ali proposed a rural strategy along with big data cloud computing and globalization as three core strategies for the next 20 years.
In the same year, Ali launched the Rural Treasure (Village) Project to recruit “Village 2” in the village, leading farmers out of poverty through electricity dealers.
In 2017, Ali, in partnership with the business sector, created the Agricultural Poverty Alleviation Channel, which now brings together 13 provinces, 120 poor counties at the national level.
Ali's platform has already generated 2,118 treasure-hunting villages.
Of these, close to 400 are found in poor districts in provinces and 33 in poor districts in 13 countries.
In 2017, on the Arababa China retail platform, the country ' s treasure-hunting village sales amounted to 120 billion yuan.
Zhang Yung stated that, in the face of a national strategy to fight poverty, Ali has been thinking about how to use the technological, big data, cloud computing and other innovative capabilities of the Ali ' s economy as a new way out of poverty.
Among them, the village was the main platform for the Ali Electrician to lift itself out of poverty, and a new link to the Internet out of poverty was opened for direct sale.
In the planting chain, village prairie and ant gold garments jointly support farming tools and micro-credits.
In 2017, of the 832 poor counties at the national level, 795 ants served in ants, providing easy payment, credit, etc.
Greenbirds deal with warehousing and logistics, Skycats are responsible for marketing, and Aryan's big data counterfeasible guides agricultural production and further improves the standards of supply, quality and market competitiveness of agricultural products.
The development of electricity suppliers out of poverty requires not only products, marketing channels, industrial planning, but also human resources.
Ali has achieved a combination of “poverty-plus mind-raising” and sustainable poverty eradication through the introduction of an electricity-marketing course at the University of Bounty, where farmers are taught standardized, Quality-based and scale-based farming methods.
These courses already cover some 92 per cent of the poor counties at the national level.
The “public good mentality, business instruments” approach to poverty eradication also guarantees Ali's “real poverty reduction” when it comes to poverty reduction.
The Chairman of the Board of Directors of Alibaba, Ma'un, had stated that poverty eradication should be divided into three phases: poverty alleviation, poverty eradication and enrichment.
Poverty alleviation is the teaching of fish, poverty eradication is the teaching of fish, and wealth is the building of a “fish pond” for farmers to feed.
The power-driven industry, which is pro-poor, is the building of fish ponds.
In the area of industrial poverty alleviation, the model of poverty alleviation in the Los Angeles Apple industry, developed by Ali in cooperation with Shaan Shirokawa, has been replicated throughout the country as an example.
Anti-poverty efforts by Ali ' s electricity suppliers have also been recognized at the decision-making level.
Electric companies, represented by Alibaba, have been sent to ensure that farmers increase their yields through online and offline channels.
A number of village Xiaoji and ant gold uniforms workers have also been invited to the United Nations and Africa to share their experiences in lifting electricity suppliers out of poverty.
Currently, the China office of the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) has been working with the village to reduce poverty in the electricity industry, including in Anhui.
The Third Congress of the New Economic think tank, co-organized by the Ali Institute and the China Vision think tank, was held on January 16, with the participation of and a statement by Zhang Li, Director of the Institute of Electric Business of the Ministry of Commerce.
In her view, our globalization actually ignores the most important issues, namely, the nature and use of globalization, as well as the stages of globalization.
Many thus believe that globalization has stagnated and that many developed and developing countries have different attitudes and models to globalization in the new phase.
The second is the question of the medium-term phase of globalization, and what are the constraints of the medium-term phase of globalization?
Economic and environmental fundamentals are constrained precisely by the changes in economic fundamentals that have taken place as a result of globalization.
According to Zhang Lei, the global economic restructuring was largely over by the end of 2017, and a new round of growth would enter after 2018, the next round of growth must be a raw product.
The 7FRESH, the first birth market in Tokyo, has opened in recent days and plans to open more than 1,000 shops throughout the country over the next three to five years.
Together with Ali's box of horse fresh life, immortal super species, Sunin's fresh life, the fish of the American troupe, and so on, the “New Retail Door” has begun to pile up and to “call” each other on innovative models and even prices.
The rise in the competition for fresh supermarkets has become a phenomenonal topic in the field of new retailing, where is the new retailing?
“In 2018, we will enter the country quickly, opening a lot of shops in Beijing, Shanghai, Hangzhou before the Spring Festival.”
On the occasion of the Second New Retail Summit, the 10-year-old Cemetery CEO revealed the "new game" of 2018.
“From 2018, the boxhorse was not just a raw electrician, but a consumer's immediate-service consumer.
Underneath the core mode is the current, the experience, and on the line is the real sale.”
Unlike traditional malls, supermarkets, boxes of pony freshborns are, in the eyes of many consumers, a fun and delicious “net red store”, and even the concept of “boxrooms” has been developed by intermediaries.
Both online power platforms and offline retailers have advantages and disadvantages, while consumers appear through multiple channels, so both parties are trying the full channel model.
The industry believes that, in the larger context of rising consumption, there will be an increasing number of “cattlehorses” shops in 2018.
In the new year, there will be more innovation in the retail market, as can be seen from the first fresh and ever-explored areas of consumption.
"For example, the business model of online-to-line combinations attracts the eyes of consumers, and the live supermarkets are called and called."
“These relationships talk too much, they don't work, and it turns out that you've brought a good experience to the consumer before I'm willing to pay.”
In the view of CEO Yuan Bin, the co-chair of the Great Rush Flying Cow Network, consumer habits changed in the new retail environment, as did the demand for purchases.
Turns out the line was cut off, the line was broken, the line was defeated, the line was counter-attacked, and now the consumer is holding hands together, as there is no longer a distinction between the line and the line.
The competition for capital has made the new retail gunpowder, which is now represented by the fresh supermarket, veritable.
The analysis found that the current pattern of new retail competition in first-line cities is far from the Red Sea and that there are large areas of second-line cities yet to be excavated, and markets still have great opportunities and space.
Different types of industries bring the development of new retailing into a diversified state of development for new retailing.
In conjunction with the Institute of Financial and Economic Strategy of the China Institute of Social and Economic Sciences, China's Finance and Economics channel has co-ordinated a dry product, which is the annual development report of China's telecommunications merchants.
What kind of report card did the Chinese electrician make in the year?
What are the trends in global electricity suppliers?
We're here to let you know.
Total sales are back on the acceleration track at record speed again.
Since 2006, our online retail sales can be said to have been growing at a very high rate, and it's probably so cool to think that Internet purchases are so fresh that they can buy things out of the house.
However, starting in 2013, the increase in online retail sales began to fall below 50 per cent, with the first increase below 40 per cent in 2015 and 26.2 per cent in 2016.
This year, however, the situation is different, with retail sales on the Internet accelerating again, rising to 34.2 per cent in January-September of this year.
The growth rate was significantly higher than in 2015 and 2016.
Maybe you're going around in circles, and it's easier to buy and buy.
Of this, the value of online retail sales of goods in kind is close to $5.08 trillion, and the value of online retail sales of services is close to $1.49 trillion.

Amy Erett used to want to investigate employee well-being at her e-commerce start-up company, but it didn't work.
Responses are often vague, unhelpful and even worse, deceptive.
Even though she was committed to anonymity, some employees still did not trust the process.
Eret, responsible for managing 75 people's San Francisco e-commerce and development company Madison Reed, stated that “the responses received lacked consistency and objectivity”.
So she called outside to ask for help.
A new group of start-ups in human resources has emerged in the wake of the rains, helping companies to understand how employees feel.
They build and empower software specifically designed to measure staff participation, thus allowing companies to conduct rapid polls for specific teams and population groups, provide anonymous and complaint hotlines for employees and, in some cases, allow whistleblowers to report directly to the board of directors.
"Now, you can track your health by using the Strava and Fitbit tools, but where's the company Fitbit?" Jim Barnett, the co-founder and CEO of the Redwood Enterprise. Glint's software analysis tool is used by companies to measure employee professionalism.
Eret said that, in three years, she had gained more insight into the thinking and feelings of her employees with Glint.
In addition to rapid surveys and opinion polls by specific teams, Glint also provides company heat maps, which units have the highest number of complaints, which managers have a low approval score, and it is clear that this allows her to gain insight into the cause.
Companies are beginning to realize that they must be skilled in taking control of the company’s workplace culture so that they do not become the next advantage. Pre-optimal workers have previously published a blog post describing the harassment environment, and the speakers have been punished by the company, and then the euphemism has become a scandal.
For start-ups such as Glint, this corporate desire for supervision is a money-rich business opportunity.
The value of the global governance, regulatory and compliance industry is likely to exceed $118.7 billion by 2020, according to the Financial Technology Analysis website Let's Talk Regulations.
Convercent, a start-up firm in Denver, Colorado, dedicated to helping companies prevent and detect bad behaviour, saw an increase in interest and activity during the loss of the reputation of the eugenics earlier this year.
Convercent has nearly 600 clients, including Euphoria, Microsoft and Tesla.
Yuzuki has recently signed into a client.
As with Glint, Convercent allows companies to send customized “diagnosis” surveys, collect confidential responses in real time, and view hot maps of their problem areas.
Convercent also provides anonymous SMS hotlines for staff to report misconduct.
If the chairman of the board is implicated, the complaint will go directly to the board of directors.
Patrick Quinlan, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Convercent, stated: “The Court of Opinion usurped the powers of the regulator.
If a company is found to be ill-treated or unethical towards its employees, it may also face the high consequences of consumer resistance, loss of staff and involvement in litigation, as Quinlan suggests, even if regulators do not intervene.
Ruby Tuesday, a catering chain that spans more than 500 places and has more than 25,000 employees, has been in use for over a year to ensure that employees are aware of work norms and protocols and provide easy access to company headquarters.
Prior to that, if an employee wishes to report a problem, he or she must find the company ' s head office telephone number or e-mail and lodge a formal complaint, which he or she hopes will be taken seriously.
This is often a frightening and disturbing experience, as the general legal adviser to Ruby Tuesday, James Witrano, said, did not believe that there was a good way to track complaints from employees.
But now that the company uses Convercent, it can more quickly identify and resolve problems that were previously unknown to a remote office, city or state, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair wage behaviour.
"I can get a full picture of my work experience closer, 360 degrees." Vitrano, who is in charge of Ruby Tuesday's risk management team, says.
“We are protecting our shareholders from employment litigation.”
According to Quinlan, following the collapse of the Andorran firm of accountants due to the Enron scandal as a violation of ethical norms, companies began to pay greater attention to ethics, values and staff professionalism in 2002.
But it was only after “social media went into their own world” that companies realized that they could not stop their blasts from spreading the virus online.
“Before using technology to monitor ethics, hope is seen as a strategy”, he said.
Glint and Convercent both provide their software as a service and charge companies recurrent fees for the use of their products.
This business model and business opportunities are supported by venture investors who have already supported both start-ups.
In February, Convercent raised $10 million from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising its total capital to $47 million.
In November, Glint received $10 million in funding from Bessemer Venture Partners, with a total of $60 million.
Given the interconnectedness of corporate, cultural and venture investments, these investments are hardly surprising.
A growing number of studies have shown that today's employees have higher expectations of the workplace than before.
In a highly competitive market such as Silicon Valley, high wages and interesting projects are mere bets.
Employees want to feel that they are accepted, valued and that their time is spent on a company with a positive mission.
"When people are happy to join the company, feel their voices heard, and what they do is useful, they're more committed to making the company succeed," expressed by Nina McCartney, Vice-President of the Global Welfare and Staff Experience. LinkedIn uses both Convercent and Glint software.
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio is performing well; companies are performing well in terms of employee loyalty and professionalism.
If the third-party analysis tool commits to increasing the loyalty and professionalism of its staff, it is not surprising that they will seek financial support.
Workplace culture experts argue that it is important to have data on the professionalism of employees.
However, these data are useless unless corporate managers take action.
In fact, if a company requests feedback from its employees, it can be expected that the company is undergoing change.
If change is not moving fast enough, or if little progress is made, it may create disappointment and lead to the separation of staff from the company.
“If you want to look for 4000 proposals, then you need to be ready for 4000 conversations.” He saw the mistakes of some companies that relied too heavily on data collection.
'Cause if you don't follow it all, the staff will think, 'Did you really hear me?
Do you care?
If you don't care, why should I?"
Eret said that Madison Reed was now conducting a monthly staff survey and had been able to take action on the day that Glint reported the problem.
After collecting feedback from staff on their frustrations due to the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication, she was able to solve the problem by reorganizing her in-house team and increasing communication training.
Ruby Tuesday is gaining new insights into its employees and, in the long run, hopes to be able to make a shift in this industry, known for its high brain drain, to better retain its staff.
“If you're not committed to creating a culture of transparency, you'll lose your talent,” Witrano says.
"If you lose your talent, you lose your client.
And when you lose your client, you lose your company."

NCAA, cancel twice a day of training and extend the daytime training of the Bears.
At approximately 11 p.m., members of the football team of the University of California, Los Angeles, wandered and chatted next to the team's new campus practice.
Some of the players have taken off their sweatshirts and exposed their bodies after hard training on the first day of the camp.
For a large part of the team, the free minutes are rest time.
After three hours of practice, the participants in the summer course will return to the dormitory to prepare for the final exam and then return to the Wasserman Football Centre at 6.30 a.m. the following morning.
"The next three days are a chord for these guys," the Bear Coach, Jim Mora, said on Monday, coming into Tuesday.
NCAA cancelled its practice twice a day (in order to ease the burden on the players), but actually extended their training time during the day - at least by Friday.
That's why the first three training sessions at UCLA are scheduled to start at 7:15 p.m. to adjust to the crowding schedule.
From the cancellation of training twice a day to more training once a day, the Bears started training almost a week before the last season, and Moira first trained at the summer school in the six seasons of Westwood.
They plan to start 18 training sessions on August 20, then start preparing for the official race of Texas farmers in September.
Mora said that he supported the adjustment of the NCAA rules, although that would allow the players to have a busy trip to add another project.
“In three or four days, we will put a huge amount of training on them, which is very challenging,” Mora said.
"They've just passed. They're grinding, they're great kids.
I think on Saturday, we'll have more time. It's really great."
As soon as the camp is over, the University of California Los Angeles will stop training. Given the proximity of the parking lot and the clear view of Luskin Center, this is not an easy task. The Luskin Center High Hotel has been thrown across the football fence.
Starting this weekend, members of the Bears will be staying at the hotel. But Mora admits that once these rooms are empty during the season, there may be problems.
"We'll take security measures," Mora said.
“This is a real concern. The idea that someone might rent a room and sit in a room and record the training scene is not too far-fetched.
If you have a training tape, it's pretty good.
But we'll take security measures there, and we'll take security measures in parking lot 8.
We will make the best use of existing resources.
I wouldn't worry too much about it.
We've made plans.”
Data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) show that, in the second quarter of this year, the value of houses in Australia rose by an average of 1.5 to 2 per cent, an annual increase of 3.5 per cent, the lowest annual rate of increase since March 2013.
At a time when real estate intermediaries expect more properties to be sold during the holiday season, Australian housing prices have risen to their lowest level since 2013.
House IT reported this morning that the Wall Street Journal reported that AT&T had cancelled its plans to sell China's new flagship smartphones in the United States.
China planned to announce this partnership on CES this week, and AT&T cancelled it at the last minute.
In response, on 9 January, Chinese journalists responded that on 9 January, local United States time, China would release new products and specific listing information to the United States market.
China indicated that, over the past five years, it had demonstrated its strength through the introduction of high-end products in the global and United States markets.
According to earlier reports from IT House, China will launch a “best cell phone you've never heard of” at the CES exhibition in Las Vegas on the afternoon of 9 January, and its ability to continue the service for two days.
The industry is generally of the view that the Chinese flagship phone, which is about to be released, is Mate 10 Pro, on board the Android Oreo system.
On September 30, the film "I am not the Pankin Lian " , led by the night reporter Wang Bingice, Guo Tao, Da Peng, Zhang Jia, and others, will be shown throughout the country.
Yesterday, the film held a seminar in Beijing on the theme “The sadness of comedy”, attended by three guests, Von Xiaogang, Ning Ho and Da Peng.
The alternation of the map, the speciality of the director, " I am not the Pankin Lotus " , is the alternation of the map, and especially the newness of the image of the circle with the masked lens.
Von Xiaogang explained: "This is a subject like the Qiu Ju case of art director Zhang, and it's easy to think together, and I want to do it in a way that we don't use. There's nothing special about it, but to think it's funny, to do something special."
Von Xiaogang called himself a virgin, learned how to make a round picture with the photographer, and even spent millions of dollars on a 10-minute audition.
Facebook will launch a fact-checking feature to counter false news.
Facebook announced on Thursday that more potential prank articles would be sent to third-party testing agencies and the results displayed under the original post. Facebook, the world’s largest online social network, is trying to crack so-called false news.
In a statement on its website, Facebook stated that Facebook would begin to use an updated machine to learn to detect possible pranks and send them to the fact-checker, and that the results of the fact-finding could be displayed under the original post.
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main outlets of the so-called false news, with many arguing that Facebook influenced the 2016 presidential election in the United States.
This issue has also become a major political issue in Europe, with voters experiencing a proliferation of false stories before the May presidential elections in France, Germany taking the lead in adopting a scheme of fines prior to the September elections, and a fine if social media networks fail to remove hate posters in a timely manner.
A separate statement by Facebook in Germany on Thursday indicated that a new functional test of fact-finding was being launched in the United States, France, the Netherlands and Germany.
In a blog, Facebook news feeder Sarah Sue said: “In addition to seeing which stories are questioned by third-party fact-checkers, people want more context to help them make informed decisions about reading and sharing content.
She added that Facebook would continue to test its “relevant articles” functionality and make other changes to its press summaries to reduce false news.
Create a drawing novel: The story of the Castle of England
Recently, the tiny Castle of Skotney became the leading actor in the compressed music film and was once the refuge of Mrs. Margaret Thatcher in the '70s and '80s.
But Scotney, who witnessed 700 years of turmoil in the comfort of the Baylor Gorge in Kent, is now a source of inspiration for graphic novels written by Jamie Rhodes, a Yorkshire man with a special interest in historical documents and a moped.
"I can see the ancient handwriting of 300 years ago, and I find it so beautiful," he says with all his eyes.
“What kind of personality is this in order to leave this letter in my hands.”
Throughout the Middle Ages and through the Eduard era, the book “A Castle of England” recorded the families living in Scotney, each story being done by different, future British artists, such as Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer, and Isabel Greenberg.
This is not the first book by Rhodes with its archives as a raw material: he also wrote " The Dead ' s Tooth and Other Story 2014 " , a book inspired by the British Library ' s literature, a work that he had done with uncontrollable creative passion.
He said, "I couldn't contain my writing impulse from the moment I saw the thumbprint left on the side of the letter, which was written by a double agent who worked for Jacob in the 18th century."
"That's his fingerprints!
And the letter always smells like smoke, because then you need to light the fire to have light.
For us 300 years later, this odour makes us feel that they are also with us.
Oh, I love the archives!"
For those who were touched by the old paper, it seemed wonderful to have been able to live in the castle for almost four months with the support of the National Trust and Arts Commission of England (“To be honest, I've been here a little too long”), and I can't believe it.
Rhodes spent several days visiting Victoria's “new” castle, looking at archives, studying many of the estate's treasures and ancient games, such as hyena heads hanging on walls, and bottles that spent centuries in the moat.
He walks on the land and ruins of the old castle, chats with vagrants, gardeners, and sometimes with artists who draw illustrations for his book.
And then at night, he'll "drink whiskey and write."
The hidden history of Scotney is not yet clear, because the British National Trust was fully entered only after the death of Elizabeth Hershey, the last heir in 2006.
Ten years later, when Rhodes arrived, the staff began processing the files, which he described as "the nobles of hundreds of years ago are leaving": "Oh, put it in the attic."
Diaries, letters from the British Empire, maps of national boundaries: “You'll think land disputes are boring” Rhodes says, “But two families will fight for a white birch tree.
Let go, guys!"
Some of the stories in the work began with castles, which led to a broader study of British history, including The Labor, which was traced to a man who left the new castle to participate in the peasant uprising of 1381.
The story of the book called Knights of Kent and Sussex recorded a riot in the castle in 1380, which Rhodes said.
“The peasants' uprising began in that area, and I think it was a good place to launch it.
Maybe there's a connection between these two?"
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of castles, such as The Priest, which tells the story of the Darrell family hiding a Jesuit pastor for seven years during the reform of the British religion.
Or The Smuggler, who owned the story of the 18th century smuggler Arthur Darrell, who was supposed to have his own funeral by filling his coffin with stones.
The Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of the Castle Scotney: “These gentlemen seem to be scoundrels, always borrowing money and buying things they can't afford.
Generations and generations of Darrell men solve their debt by marrying rich old women, and I think they should be handsome young men who know how to pursue women.”
As his mission in the castle ended, Rhodes began to look for other peculiar writing experiences.
In the wilderness of Finland, he completed a drawing novel in two weeks, about “El?um?nm?ki”, a sanatorium in the early 20th century, which was slowly abandoned.
But Scotney has a special position for him.
"I'm sad to leave," he said.
"It's like, "Oh, I've got to go face-to-face in real life."
According to journalists, the Chinese intelligent car team is based in Pearlhai and the executive vice-president of communications in Central China, Tengo.
Large-scale energy companies are all “rich and enemy countries”, so who is the best of the many energy companies around the world?
Yesterday, the well-known PFC Energy Company announced its top 50 rankings of publicly listed energy companies in 2011, with the US oil and gas producer Exxon Mobil championing at a market value of $406.3 billion, followed by China oil and the Dutch Royal Shell.
In the PFC list, the first place in the PFC list was occupied by Exxon Mobil in 2007 and 2009.
Out of the top 50 rankings in 2011, there were three companies from China and China, with China ' s petrochemical ninth and 15th in addition to China ' s middle oil.
According to the PFC, however, despite the fact that current oil prices are much higher than they were four years ago, PFC Energy Co. CEO notes that there are many reasons for the low overall market value, including mainly the decline in natural gas prices in North America and the low activity of the global stock market.
According to Xinhua, the heavy-pollution weather in and around Kyunjin began from 16 to 19 and further intensified, with the emergence of “blast forms” in North Rock, Sindang and AQI, the city of Xiaohua.
U.S. Modification of Green Card Regulations
The media quoted President Donald Trump's statement that the United States would launch a new immigration plan to amend the green card regulations.
The scheme is intended to reduce the number of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year, and temporary work visas and family-oriented visa applications are subject to stricter restrictions.
The new provisions were proposed by the Republican Party and supported by the President.
The draft law will be discussed in both chambers.
The American media quoted Trump as saying, “This law will reduce poverty, raise wages, save billions of dollars for taxpayers, and achieve these benefits by changing the way the United States issues green cards to citizens of other countries.
The law will replace the current programme and reduce chain migration.
This new application process is beneficial for applicants who speak English, have financial support and have skills that are beneficial to economic development.”
On 29 May, the first China Fireworks Safety and Environment Fair will be held in Xiaoyang.
The event will take place over a period of two days under the theme “Technology, safety, and environmental protection”.
The Expo will invite a large number of experts, entrepreneurs and academic exchanges in the fireworks and fireworks industry to share the latest technology for the safe and environmentally sound use of fireworks and fireworks.
Among these, the demonstration of fireworks mechanized production equipment and safe and environmentally friendly products will take place in the town of Oyster, and the main exhibition projects will include technically mature, scientifically validated and safely demonstrated fireworks for the production of drug-related machinery, low sensitivity, low-explosive pyrotechnics, safe and environmentally friendly personal combustion products such as sulphur-free, pyrotechnic, etc.
At the same time, the demonstration of fireworks and fireworks safety and environmental products, organized by a group of 16 cedar companies in Xiayang, was divided into product selection and product demonstration phases, and the demonstration of excellent new products, selected through the previous selection, will take place on the evening of 29 May at the Xiaoyang Gun Station and the Golden Beach burning grounds.
And in 2017, Zhao Lei Tan said, "I want to clear myself up after next year's tour and then settle down and write more new works."
With a view to optimizing the landscape environment and building a beautiful south-root environment, the “Spinning and Home-Friendly” environmental campaign was recently launched by the “636” volunteer corps of the South Worm Tobacco Specialized Agency (branch).
The campaign was supported not only by the entire staff of the District Tobacco Bureau, but also by the involvement of retired cadres, workers and their families in environmental practices. The three generations worked together to climb the mountain range, clean the garbage, and contributed to the building of “Beautiful Nam”.
The volunteer campaign, which aims to preserve the south's landscape resources, promote the concept of volunteerism “to care for others, to care for society, to care for nature” and allow the next generation to take on the fumigation of volunteer virtues from a young age.
Since its establishment at the beginning of April this year, the “636” volunteer corps has been known to have 16 development members, with a series of volunteer activities, such as watching disabled retail customers, helping smoke farmers to care for tobacco leaves, and the Ya'an earthquake love donation, becoming a volunteer force with a heart to deliver positive energy.

In recent years, the giants of the Silicon Valley, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Facebook, have been engaged in an arms race in the area of artificial intelligence (AI).
Sex robots are on the rise, but we should be careful.
Just when you didn't think it would be weirder in 2017, a new technology development report was released in the field of sex robots.
Yes.
Sex robots are a big deal now.
Recently, the Responsible Robotics Foundation (FRR) published a report that looks forward to the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.
According to the Professor Emeritus of Robotic Technology and Artificial Intelligence of the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, Noel Shaggy, we need to start taking seriously the rise of sex robots.
Customers can choose the eye colour, nipple shape and nail type of robot.
In the release of the new report, Shaggy said: “People laugh behind their backs, but the big companies do have a lot of sex robots, and we'll see more.”
Modern sex dolls have evolved from inflated dolls to robots, with silicon skins, warm touch, and artificial intelligence specially designed human-like sexual reactions.
Users can also “self-defined” their robots to satisfy their preferences, from eye colour, nipple shape to nail type or colour.
But even more disturbing is the fact that many robots with “personality” make the “reproducing wife” seem advanced.
Modern sex toys have evolved into robots with silicon skin.
For example, RealBotix robots can come from definitions, such as shyness, depending on what the user considers attractive.
There are also Roxxy Gold sex robots, developed by True Company, which can predetermine character characteristics, including a slightly shy “cold Farah” and a “probably risky” Wild Wendy.
“Roxxy Gold robots have personality that is as appropriate as possible to you.” The True Company website is happy about this.
That's why she loves the love you love and hates the evil you do.
She was just like a normal person in those days!
She can be lazy, she can talk, she can be `sexually strong'!"
The rise of sex robots has caused many uneases — not only replacing real human relations — but also the grotesque female character and the most worrying hint of rape in cold (read as resistance) Farah.
True Company compares Roxxy to a man's truncheon on its website.
The website says, "If a woman has a truncheon, why can't a man have Roxxy?"
But these sex robots aren't just lovers, and they're not just sex toys.
Their emergence and increasing maturity point to the darker and deeper part of our culture: fleeing from perfect gender equality to sex with submission as an additional option.
Of course, most men do not leave sex robots, and while FRR points out that sex robots are becoming increasingly popular, they are still on the margins of the consumer culture.
But what permeates from the edges is a way to see the course of the era in which we are living.
Many people were neither weird nor aggressive until the free market gave them the opportunity to become so.
It is no coincidence that these fine sex robots appear in an era where the rights of women are threatened globally, and that a White House president boasts of sexual violence against women.
The most chilling part of the television drama The Tale of the Concubine is not about the real picture, but not about the hanging body, or the eyes that were dug out, but about the overreal imagination.
The Republic of Gilead was a leap, but it does not seem to be far away.
The goal behind these sex robots is to create, as technologically as possible, the bodies of the most similar women (although in proportion to the sex stars).
The creators of these robots want them to have the human touch and imitate the real human movement.
But to put it bluntly, their “personality” does not represent the real woman.
They can't break up, they can't run away.
They have no recourse and no follow-up story, no independence at all, and no possibility of breaking complete slavery illusions.
In other words, they're fun slaves.
Or according to the general saying of 2017: make a girl.
The Great Wall tells the story of an ancient Chinese elite force that fought the death and death of monsters on the Great Wall, known as the Great Wall, in defence of humanity.
The final issue of the fourth season of Runaway Brothers has been recorded, and on 30 May, the leader of the Runaway Boys Group, Deng, received a micro-letter interview with Shenyang Evening, a reporter from Shenyang's Network, from the Run-Man's “Student” to the “Jolly Badger” from the “Run-Man” to the “Frank-Man” Chen Moo, and Deng's image of the audience as the “Moved Stars” is constantly changing.
Deng said, "I'm not going to do the same thing in the show, I'm going to keep it up to date."
The great work of Trump?
Let Mitt Romney be the epiphany of common sense.
Political divisions have led to the polarization of American voters, which, from a microeconomic point of view, has undermined American family harmony. This is not surprising for the Trump era.
Before and after Christmas and Thanksgiving, major newspapers in the United States were rife with fears of how to respond to the election of Trump's relatives.
It is generally believed that we are doing our best to pierce our “filtration bubble”.
It is the power of Trump to bring his family together that makes less of a comment.
I mentioned this because my cousin, a left-wing poet living in Chicago, had a long history of discord with the Republicans in our family, and he was visiting me this week in New York.
She reminded me that united against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.
By working with Trump at the White House, all the people she knew, even relatives of Republicans, who had been in political strife for decades, were all suddenly and strangely on the same front.
It would certainly be a good thing if we were all at the table. But I am shocked that, from a broader perspective, there are significant risks.
Although the left-wing figure has always been encouraged by Trump, the heated effect of his presidency drives us all to the right.
When we talk about “normalization” and Trump, we are talking about the possibility of fear that his eccentric behaviour might one day cease.
However, there is a more worrying and long-term scenario in which Trump would like to “normalize” his relationship with the right-wing Republicans, who had previously opposed Mr. President's standards, and now suddenly appear to be the symbol of reason.
I found myself recently missing a little bit about the madness of Mitt Romney: putting dogs on cars, 14 percent of the income tax (but at least we know his tax returns), and the crimes of these two moves seem to be far too minor as compared to Trump.
After the Trump era, the next Republican candidate needed only rationally to qualify for incalculable improvements.
When my cousin lived in town, we took our kids to the carousel of New York Park, the biggest carousel managed by the central park administration in New York, and, if you don't need coffee, the $3 tickets are the most valuable in the city.
The sounds of the horses are as thunderous as thunder, the central cylinders are designed for fibreglass, all the clowns and the animals turn their heads, with horror and evil looking at their shoulders, and the jingle sounds strangely.
Too many mediocre cities are disappointing: the landscape overlooking high-rises becomes old, the skyline becomes too familiar with the incentives that no longer provide, and the reality of cities does not sustain dreams.
35 years later, I haven't completely forgotten that day, when I found out that this “Swiss cabin” was not really a Swiss hut, but rather a Swiss cabin in the theme bar, the “Eurde Swiss Cottage”, I can't remember, but near a crossroads in northern London.
However, the merry-go-round horse in Central Park is still a magical experience, and everyone has fun for two 2-year-olds, an 11-year-old, and four 40-year-old girls.
If I could evaluate the carousel, I'd give it a full score, but fortunately no one asked.
But this week, at a department store, before a credit card, I was asked to score one to five stars for my business experience.
And in my coffee shop in the corner of the street, it's the same thing, and you can choose 15 percent of the tip to rate it for shopping on the counter.
The effect of this is not only to slow down the supposed neutral transaction, but also to put pressure on the waiter to add the personal element to the unwanted scenario.
The poor woman in the department store laughed, and I was tired, and the credit card trading experience gave her five stars.
Oscar Pistolis moved from prison to hospital for chest pain.

Several local governments, such as Shanghai, Shanxi, Shandong, Jiangsu and Heilongjiang, have recently proposed reforms to address excess capacity.

Does the meat, dairy products and chocolate help to alleviate inflammational intestinal disease (IBD)?
The meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare of your digestive system.
However, a new study shows the opposite: diets rich in meat protein and dairy products can help alleviate the associated symptoms of inflammatory intestinal diseases.
The incurable disease affected the lives of about 1.3 million Americans and about 300,000 British, causing stomach cramps and abdominal swelling, recurrent or haemorrhagic diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.
Researchers at the University of Washington usually advise patients to avoid eating meat and dairy products in order to mitigate symptoms, but researchers find that key amino-colouric acids in proteins contribute to the growth of immune cells that increase the intestine tolerance.
Dr. Marco Colonna, Chief Researcher, explained that immune cells patrol the intestinal tract to ensure that harmful micro-organisms hidden in food do not sneak into the body.
A balance is maintained between the cells that cause inflammation and those that promote tolerance, protecting the body from all kinds of sensitive and fragile tissues.
Inflammatory intestinal disease can occur when the equilibrium is too biased towards inflammation.
An immune-promoting cell was found in rats carrying specific bacteria.
Bacteria require chromosome amino acid (a component of protein) to form a cell ' s appearance.
Professor Colona said, “We have established a link between a bacterial population, which is a normal part of the intestinal microbial community, and the development of cells that promote resilience.
The more cyanide is consumed in the diet, the more immune cells the mice have.
He suggested that if humans used the same method, i.e. a combination of Lactacetic Bacillus and a gluten-rich diet, a more resilient and less inflammatory intestinal environment could be created.
Luisa Cervantes-Barraganwas, postdoctoral researcher, studied an immune cell that could increase resilience when she found that a group of rats had such cells, but not when another group of the same strains were raised separately.
She suspected that the difference was related to the community of intestinal microorganisms in mice (beginning bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually living in the gastrointestinal tract).
DNA sequencing of cholesterol in mice revealed six bacterial species present in mice with immune cells, but not in mice without immune cells.
The mice are rearing in a sterile environment, so they lack intestinal microorganisms and cannot produce this immune cell, and the presence of Lactocobacteria produces immune cells.
In order to understand how bacteria affect the immune system, researchers cultivate Lactium in liquids and then transfer small amounts of bacteria-free liquids to premature immune cells separated from young rats.
The immune cell developed into a resilient cell.
When the active ingredient is purified from the liquid, it can be demonstrated that the active ingredient is a by-product of gluten amino metabolite, known as thi-3-emulsifier.
The number of cells increased by about 50 per cent when researchers doubled the number of chromosomes in mice' feed, but when the level of chromosomes was halved, the number of cells was halved.
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people, like rats, have the same resilient cells, and most of us have Lactus in our gastrointestinal tract.
It is not yet known whether humans can induce the development of the by-products of cyanide from Lactus, as in experimental mice, but genetic defects associated with cervix have been detected among inflammated intestinal patients.
She said, “The development of these cells is probably what we want, because they control the inflammation of the internal surface of the intestinal tract.
It may be inaccurate to say that the presence of high levels of cyanide in Lactium may lead to an increase in the number of species.
José Murinio thinks the United Man signed the Genius Nemania Matic.
On Wednesday night, following the first appearance of Nemania Mathić in the Sampodolia competition, Muriño concluded that Mansion had signed a “genius” midfield player.
Martić came from Chelsea, with a contract of £40 million, and hit 2-1 in Dublin on Tuesday in the final pre-season match before the European Super Bowl in Royal Madrid, winning the favor of Paul Borgba and Andreas Perera.
However, during the pre-Brunesti Asian Tour, the Mattics were severely understated, with only 45 minutes to complete, and Muriño acknowledged the need for improvement before the British super season began.
“He needs time, but he has the experience, the wisdom and the genius of thinking — he thinks about football,” Muriño says.
"We will prepare him as soon as possible."
Muriño started his head starter at the beginning of the season. Like Mattiche, the newly-contracted players Victor Linderlov and Romelu Lukacu also started a game at the Injeju Stadium.
This week, the independent newspaper reported that Muriño still wanted to bring in three more signed players, but he insisted that the club “worked well”, with four top-chosen players in his heart and three of them in the club.
“The club brought in three of the contracted players, and I am very grateful.” He added.
“I'd be happier if the club could bring in all four players, but they've done a great deal for me.”
Will China be lagging behind if it doesn't build a frigate like this?
With the recent announcement by the world's major naval powers of plans for the construction of new frigates, as if one night the frigates had become the focus of the attention of the naval forces of the great Powers, first of all, the decision by Japan to purchase two new frigates in its 2018 defence budget, which led to a substantial breakthrough in the Japanese frigate's plan, and then the recent announcement by Lockheed Martin, the United States, of the latest plan for the United States frigate FFG.
With the discharge of one of the most recent 054A frigates in late 2017, marking the construction of up to 29 frigates in 054A, approaching the sum of the 053H series, the construction of 054A has been under way for 12 years since the first 054A in 2006, and even worldwide, the construction of so many high-performance common frigates, apart from China, can be compared with the “Peri”-class frigates built by the United States in the 7th and 80th centuries.
And the simple reason why so many 054As have been built is that they are profitable, useful and supplement the many years of naval arrears.
The frigate 054A, which has been favoured by the Chinese Navy for many years with a high value of value and good combat power, has been carrying about 4,000 tons of drainage, a 76-mm main gun, 32 units of sea red flag-16 and fish-8 anti-submarine missile co-launching hair-trigger systems, eight eagles hitting 83 and a direct-9 helicopter, although it was built in 2006 and was designed earlier, its combat power, even today, is not too poor, and it can reach the upper-to-medium level among the world ' s frigates.
But it is, after all, a ship designed at the beginning of the twenty-first century with a weapons configuration on one side, with a large gap in power systems and electronic radar equipment as compared to the current world ' s mainstream frigates, and it is time to develop a new type of vessel when the same type of frigates in Europe are equipped with full electric propulsion, small multifunctional array radars, large-sized helicopter decks.
So how China ' s new frigate should develop is directly related to its future positioning and the strategic approach of our Chinese navy.
The future development of the Chinese Navy is bound to be complete blue-water, and the future is bound to be ocean-bound, with areas of vital interest to China that will rapidly deploy, demonstrate the presence of force and, if necessary, have the force to ensure that China ' s vital interests in the region are not compromised. It would therefore appear that the new Hu Wei River is bound to move towards mega- and over-oceanization.
Looking further at the positioning of new frigates in the future Chinese naval sequence, the future Chinese navy should be similar to the United States Navy, and other major naval vessels, in addition to the required offshore defence vessels, would form carrier combat groups or amphibious attack ships as required.
The role of new frigates in future carrier battles should serve as anti-submarine mains and mid-to-near spaces, and as frigates in amphibious attack fleets, and the need for new frigates to have a strong anti-submarine capability and a good mid-range regional emptiness capability.
Based on the above positioning, a bold vision of the future of the frigate of national production can emerge.
First, there would be a significant increase in discharges relative to the current 054A frigate, with an estimated discharge volume of 5,000-6,000 tons from the new frigate; the power system would use an integrated power propulsion system consisting of an QC280 modulated gas turbine and two diesel machines, with a maximum speed of about 30 knots and a significant increase in continuation capacity; a 76-mm main gun and 1130-barrell should be retained, but a red-flag 10 launch system would be added, with a 32-48 unit of a red-flag 16 improvement and a fish-8 co-ship on the back of the frigate, with a large pyretic system on the back of the ship, which would be used to launch Eagle 18 and new cruise missiles; hangars and hangar platforms would also be increased, with a halt and storage of two 10-ton helicopters; and, with respect to an electronic radar system, a high configuration should be equipped with a small four-face fixed-side radar, based on 346-A, which could be fitted with a multifunctional rotation control radar similar to that of the European frigates.
This would bring the overall level of the new frigates to the world ' s current world-class standards, even if compared to the FFG of the United States.
Of course, the above-mentioned concept is merely an assumption of the new frigate of national production, and in particular how we can only find out when the new frigate is in the water, so let us look forward to it.

In recent years, our city has encouraged the active participation of enterprises in the construction of national, industry and regional group standards, awarded 300,000 yuan to enterprises that are primarily or involved in the development of Zhejiang manufacturing group standards, and 500,000 yuan to enterprises that manufacture brand certification through Zhejiang, which is the highest level of the award in the province and stimulates business participation in the subject matter.
Formerly, the head of the Wangqiang group production workshop, along with his staff, Gao Jian, was packing a security door block against theft as a sample for participation in the Zhejiang manufacturing group standard against the standards, to be sent to the Shao Hing Quality Monitoring Centre.
Just the previous two days, Wang Li had passed the on-site audit by the Zhejiang Manufacturing Accreditation Group.
Quality indicated that a professional team of industry technical experts and quality certification organizations commended the group for its performance in core areas of excellence, autonomous innovation and agreed that there was a perfect match, and that Wang Jian would be one of the first to adopt the standard as long as the product passed the test.
Wangqing is only a microcosm of the standard-motivated industrial transformation and upgrading.
Our city has been synchronized with its Zhejiang manufacturing group standards for standards and compliance with standards, as well as yang and troupe groups.

What's worse is that China's household debt rate is closer to the United States than it's going to be able to afford a home?
In recent times, there has been a debate about recent changes in real estate policy, whether real estate policy will be untying again. Will the diversification of land policy providers lead to a decline in housing prices?
However, at a time when we were worried about real estate prices, macroeconomic regulation, and the future of the real estate market, the People's Daily wrote again. The last time we devoted our comments to the regulation of real estate, the People's Daily is now writing about a more serious topic than the affordability of housing, which is whether you can afford the debt even if you can afford it.
Today, let us talk about a bigger problem than buying a house: repayment of loans.
I. The growing housing debt crisis in China
The People's Daily's overseas edition published a review article on 17 January, Awards and Loans. The joys and worries of struggling youth. According to the data, in November 2017, the Third Quarterly Report on China's Deleveraging Process, issued by the National Financial and Development Laboratory of the Chinese Institute of Social Science and Technology and the National Balance Sheet Research Centre, noted that the population sector's leverage rate continued to rise, from 47.4 per cent in the second quarter of 2017 to 48.6 per cent in the third quarter, an increase of 1.3 percentage points, and 3.8 percentage points in the first three quarters of 2017.
The share of debt of the resident sector in the overall real economy has increased, and the leverage rate has risen faster.
Studies indicate that China ' s family ' s debt to financial institutions is dominated by consumer loans, which account for about two thirds of the resident ' s debt, approximately twice as much as the operating loan.
Among them, medium- and long-term loans, dominated by housing loans, account for about 80 per cent of consumer loans, but in terms of volume, short-term consumer loans are growing faster than medium- and long-term loans.
In addition, China ' s household debt rate merely accounts for the total amount of credit received by the family sector from financial institutions, while Chinese households also have large-scale hidden debts, including private borrowing from relatives and friends.
In view of this data, it is difficult to draw some conclusions. According to the statistics of the Suning Institute of Financial Studies, China ' s leverage rate was only 3 per cent in 1996 and 18 per cent in 2008, but since 2008 it has begun to grow rapidly, doubling in just six years, reaching 36.4 per cent, and reaching 48.6 per cent in the third quarter of 2017.
By way of comparison, in May last year the HSBC Bank released a survey report across nine countries with close to 10,000 interviewees.
The report was addressed to the “Millennium Generation” of young people (born between 1980 and 2000) in nine countries.
According to the report, China ' s housing ownership rate for young people after 80 and 90 years is as high as 70 per cent, leading the second largest country in Mexico (46 per cent) and twice the United States target of 35 per cent.
These data tell us one of the most likely problems, which is that the biggest potential “hinos” in China at this stage are expected to be unable to pay their debts as compared to the inability to buy a house.
II. Why is the housing debt crisis the most serious problem?
As we have previously analysed, although we have always said that China has higher housing prices, the housing ownership rate in China is actually quite high compared to other countries in the world.
Throughout the world's real estate markets, China's real estate market, due to its late start, has not experienced a major real estate crisis, except for what we said earlier about Hainan, but just 10 years ago, the financial tsunami of 2008 in the world began with the real estate crisis in the United States.
The real estate crisis in the United States, on the other hand, was attributed to two houses: the United States House and the United States House.
In the golden age of the United States, real estate companies sold their houses to the low-income population of the United States at a very low initial price in order to expand their sales. At a time of economic well-being in the United States, the real estate market also flourished. However, with the stagnation of growth in the United States economy, the incomes of home buyers fell, and large household consumption expenditures began to fall.
The current situation in the United States, however, was one of financial assets and real estate assets that formed part of United States household assets, almost all of which were real estate in the low-income group of the United States, while most of the assets in the top 20 per cent of the high-income group were financial assets, the higher the debt rate for real estate in the United States.
A serious fact is that these people buy houses in better economic times, so the money to pay their mortgages is also calculated in terms of their better income, and when the income falls, the pressure on mortgages not only does not diminish, but even because some subprime schemes have become more floating, so the real estate problems of these American families have gradually evolved into a real estate crisis.
Thus, because the income was too low to pay the mortgage, the bank began to recover the property, and when the bank recovered the property at a very low price from the buyer of the loan in arrears, they sold it at very low prices, which led to a gradual decline in housing prices in the region, which in turn triggered a vicious circle in which, when the price fell to a certain level, more and more buyers found that their house was even lower in value than their own loans, so that more people stopped paying their mortgages and caused more bad debts.
As a result, a huge vicious circle emerged:
“The economic downturn — the decline in income — a segment of the population could not afford to pay mortgages — the low-priced sale of unaccountable houses by banks — the fall in house prices — more people stopped repaying their mortgages — the banks sold — and the prices fell ”
And the problem is more than that, because the price of the house continues to fall, and you don't have a debt when people stop paying the bank for the house, and if the money you owe to the bank for the house to be auctioned by the bank is still not on the loan you owe the bank, then you still have to pay the money back, just to put it simply, assuming that you bought a house worth $3 million with a down payment of $600,000 and a loan of $2 million, and when the house falls to only $2 million, you don't repay the house to the bank, and when the bank auctions the house, you lose not only the downpayment of $600,000, but also the debt you owe to the bank, and you pay the next.
As a result, under such a vicious cycle, the United States economy gradually collapsed, culminating in the United States financial crisis of 2008.
Thus, the high level of domestic debt in China at this stage, at 46.8 per cent, is a matter of great vigilance. The data are still below the level of developed countries, but the problem has begun to emerge, and the country has repeatedly emphasized deleveraging since last year. This is a very priori judgement that family debt ratios, if allowed to continue rising, will entail enormous risks, so that the emergence of financial risks is prevented.
As a result, houses have been established for housing, not for fumigation, and the State has accelerated the establishment of multi-subject supply, multi-channel security, rental and mergers, among many other measures, to further mitigate potential risks.
For our individual families, it is important to move away from real estate speculation, to buy houses in a way that avoids the huge burden placed on their families, and only a reasonable assessment of their income and level of indebtedness is a healthy path to family wealth development.

The British inventor implants a chip in his own body and waves into the house.
A British inventor installed a chip for himself, and just waved to open the front door of his home, entered the office and even started the car as the first person in the country.
33-year-old Steven Nordham implanted a tiny chip between his thumb and his finger, and is now providing this service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives, through technology, by his company BioTeq.
He has joined forces with Dr. Jeff Watson, a senior consultant at the Royal Hampshire Hospital in Winchester, to ensure that the implantation process meets medical standards.
The technology is similar to cat and dog chip implants, and it only takes 30 seconds.
Mr. Nordham's company will also replace the locks of the rooms and vehicles to be compatible with the chip, at a cost of £300 per lock.

White House props cost thousands of dollars.
According to the military records published in Time magazine, last month the White House decided to transport a Marine helicopter to the South Lawn to highlight the great glory of the United States manufacturing industry, at a cost of up to $24,000.
On July 17, the White House highlighted the importance of the US construction project.
President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Burns and senior White House officials visited manufacturing products from all 50 states.
The exhibits included helicopters made in Connecticut, a Maine yacht, a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift.
According to the records of the first unit of the Force Marine Helicopter (HMX-1), which operated the helicopter, the White House Military Office required the helicopter to appear on the daily order (FRAGO), i.e., only 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn to participate in the “special” event.
The day before the event, Commander HMX-1, in an e-mail sent to the superior Deputy Commander of the Marine Corps, said, “I just want to make sure that you know that this event is highly valued”.
The information indicated that the helicopter would arrive on the South Lawn at approximately 7 a.m. on 17 July for an event at 3 p.m., before leaving at 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. on the same day.
The information also indicated that, in the event of a delay in departure from the White House, a second crew would be required to return due to the time limit for duty.
The original crew was on standby alongside the helicopter during the operation, while the security forces were on standby nearby while the aircraft was on the ground.
The record in Time magazine does not clearly indicate the eventual need for a second crew.
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using government property for political purposes.
It was noted that HMX-1 had asked whether the event was in violation of the Act.
The commander wrote that “one of the questions we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hutch Act and was told that there had been no violation”.
"Sounds like you're locked up." Deputy Commander replied.
The White House defined the “manufacture of the United States” as an official activity and therefore was not subject to the Hatch Act.
But even official activities are political.
At the event, the President pursued the issue of the then Senate: the reform of the medical system and the control of government regulations.
The use of Marine I or Air Force I aircraft for political propaganda purposes is no longer new.
Successive presidents have been asked to travel by these aircraft.
However, it is not common for them to be requisitioned for the sole purpose of taking photographs.
In February, Trump was the focus of attention, when the President's jet slipped into Melbourne, Florida, and ended up in the background of his first campaign rally, where his Twitter account was filled with complaints about the use of the President's jet by the former President.
Lindsay Walters, the White House's deputy news spokesman, said that “the White House was so excited about this “American Manufacturing” exhibition, which showcased products from all 50 states, all of which were made by American workers using American materials”.
HMX-1 crews regularly conduct flight training near the Washington area and on the South Lawn to practice the accurate placement of the President of the United States in the White House.
In early July, during Trump ' s G-20 Summit in Germany, HMX-1 had 58 landings at the White House.
One official stated that the U.S. manufacturing flight was included in the crew training requirements for the month.
The helicopter unit also flew an additional 11 hours of “non-presidential support mission” on the same day.
The White House claimed that the taxpayers did not bear the cost of any other props for the event.
The spokesman for Sikorsky stated that the company was not involved in arranging a South Lawn helicopter display.
HMX-1 did not maintain budgetary records of presidential flights, and it was therefore very difficult to determine the exact cost of the event.
However, according to the Ministry of Defence ' s hourly costs recorded for the 2017 financial year, the reimbursable costs of the Ministry of Defence for VH-3D were USD 24,380 per flight hour.
The force recorded 30 minutes of each flight from the base of the Quantico Marine Airport in Virginia.
The White House, for its part, claimed that the cost of operating the helicopter was much lower than that cost.
Walters claims that “the cost of the taxpayer's expenses is very misleading to estimate on the basis of reimbursable expenses.
These estimated costs include personnel costs, maintenance costs and many other sunk costs, including in the annual appropriation.
A 2015 RAND study showed that the reimbursable costs of the Ministry of Defence did not include personnel costs, but did include oil, maintenance and contracting costs.
At that time, the former White House news spokesman, Sean Speicher, defended the use of the helicopter for the event.
"The idea is to show what the U.S. made this week.
And I know that Sikorsky and Connecticut are proud of it, and they both have contributed to our national security, and I guess there are hundreds of people who work on it without thousands of people.
And I feel that, like most Americans, we are proud of this helicopter and other military equipment, the fruit of countless American efforts.
So it's certainly not out of the question to make this clear.”
It is not clear to us whether Trump interacted with the helicopter during an active tour of the South Lawn, but he did take the driving seat of the fire truck.
In the White House, Trump addressed a representative of the Sikorsky Company and joked about his own company's aircraft and the media.
He said, "I know the Sikorsky plane. I have three."

According to the information received, Chongqing currently has 18 shale gas prospecting rights established by the Ministry of Territorial Resources and the first shale gas mining rights in the country, China's petrochemical masonry shale gas field.
As of January 2017, Chongqing had completed the drilling of 368 shale and gas wells (without parameters) and brought in 261. In the recent past, with the good news that the four shale and gas wells in the south of Pinghashi, a region of China's petrochuan region, each produced more than 200,000 cubic metres per day, the Chinese shale and gas fields, the first of the world's largest commercially mined fields outside North America, are expected to build 10 billion cubic metres of capacity this year, as planned.
It is understood that 10 billion cubic metres of shale gas fields are equivalent to a 10 million-tonne-grade large oil field.
Shale gas as a clean energy source is known to reduce carbon dioxide by 12 million tons per year after the construction of 10 billion shale gas fields.

This made the family of high aunts who lived in the dormitory of the Department of Democratic Roads in Nanning happy.
Neighbors say it's a rare thing to see when a rich tree blooms. The residents of the neighborhood think it's a good thing, and when they learn it, they come to watch.
The “Maraba Chest” is a tropical plant of Mexican origin, warm and humid, and flowering is possible only when many conditions, such as sunlight, moisture and nutrients, are appropriate.
Even in the wild, where tropical conditions are appropriate, it is rare for rich trees to bloom, with the expression “only one in a thousand”.
Yesterday morning, journalists came to the residence of the Democratic Road Office in Nanning City and, under the guidance of Aunt Gao, they saw the rich tree.
The rich trees are planted in the garden of the small area about 5 metres high, the thickest branches about 30 centimetres long and the leaves green and thick.
Flowers bloom at the top of the higher branches, bloom at more than 10 centimetres of width, dispersing the thin yellow filament, curling on both sides as the green cylindrical cleavage splits, the filamentary gold dots.
Aunt Gao told the press that the rich tree had been planted for eight years, about 1 metre high at the time and now more than 5 metres long.
This is the picture that her son bought from the flowerbird market, which she later planted in the garden, and which she did not manage very much, just sometimes to cultivate the earth.

According to the Market Star, between 2005 and 2011, my provincial GDP rose from the central side to the bottom.
However, my provincial economy continues to suffer from low investment efficiency and a lack of core competitiveness in the industrial economy. To this end, the latest edition of the Economic Blue Page of the provincial economic information centres recommends that the quality and effectiveness of economic growth be improved.
It is based on a number of representative indicators of our provincial economy in 2005 and 2011 and is compared with the national and central regions.
In terms of industrial economic efficiency, in 2011, a significant proportion of the energy-intensive industries in my province, such as industrial energy, raw materials and so on, were subject to greater market volatility and to “double pressure” overcapacity, while the dominant industries, such as domestic electricity and automobiles, were under-innovated, resulting in low profits.
The failure of large investments to bring corresponding economic benefits is an important reason for the poor quality and efficiency of economic growth in our province.
In this regard, the experts recommended that effective measures be taken to encourage innovation in enterprises and that the scientific and technological achievements of universities and research institutes be “transferred” to enterprises in a timely manner.
With regard to the low efficiency of the industrial economy, experts said that industrial merger restructuring, optimization of industrial layout and extension of the industrial chain should also be actively promoted.

General Union of British Trade Unions (GMB) focused on investments in the McVitie plant in Glasgow.
The union hopes that the management of McVitata, the manufacturer of biscuits, will ensure a long-term commitment to production at the Lasco factory.
According to the Scottish branch of the British General Union, the company remained silent about the future of the investment in the Tollcross factory.
The factory has over 500 employees and produces products such as oatmeal biscuits (Hobnobs), tea biscuits (Rich tea).
Pradis, the owner of McVitat, said that the company had invested more than £5 million in the plant over the past few years.
He added that in the event of a change in the operation of the plant, employees and trade union representatives “will take the lead in knowing”.
In a letter to the director of the company, the Scottish branch of the British General Union called on McVitat “to address the problem of the non-transfer of funds to the modernization of the production line”.
The Senior Founder of the General Union of Britain, Drew Duffy, said, “We cannot get a clear picture of the future business needs and investment plans of Tollcross from the general manager of the plant, which is a source of deep concern to our members.
Generations and generations of families work here, and the high concentration of labour in the local community and in the Greater Glasgow region is an important pillar of decent employment in regions with high unemployment and severe social deprivation.
Thus, from the perspective of employment, pay and economic prosperity, the eastern part of Glasgow urgently needs an expanding production network of McVita in the context of the loss of British Europe, rising cost of living and the long-term decline of manufacturing.”
The spokesperson for Pradis stated: “The director of Tollcross just yesterday received a letter from the Scottish branch of the General Union of British Trade Unions, and the company will respond immediately because of the importance we attach to maintaining continuous contact with employees and trade union representatives.
Two months ago, we held a regular meeting with employees and representatives of the General Union of England in Tollcross to discuss a number of issues in public.
We had discussions with our employees, and then, like all other companies operating in an environment of intense competition and economic uncertainty, we reviewed the continuing business model that we applied to enterprises and factories in order to remain competitive.
She added: “In recent years, we have invested more than £5 million in the Tollcross plant, especially in production lines and operational improvements.
We are fully aware of the historical status of Torcross as a production base, and if there is any change in our operations at the plant, the workers' and trade union representatives will be the first to know.”
On 11 May, the Deputy Director of the Tibetan Autonomous Region ' s Sports Department, Nima Tirin, 10, from China ' s Tibetan Fate Day (journalist Chen Xubing), stated at the main camp of the North Plop, Everest, that the future clean-up of living garbage on the North Pap will move from past actions of public benefit to the usual behaviour led by the Chinese Government and with the participation of the international community.
On 10 May, environmental volunteers loaded the collected garbage into the truck.
Over the past decade or so, the issue of environmental protection at the peak site has become more acute with the dramatic increase in the number of explorers and tourists on Everest.
In the spring of 1997, the Tibetan Autonomous Region Mountain Climbing Association launched its first clean-up campaign on the north slope of Everest, cleaning up a collection of living waste such as oxygen bottles left over from the 1960s and 1970s. The video was also aired at the Tokyo World Climate Conference, which attracted world attention.
According to Nima Tirin, after 1997, the public interest team has been cleaning the northern slopes of Everest, but most of the participants are lay people.
Three years ago, St. Germain of Paris warned Barcelona to sign Nemal?
Nica may regret throwing an olive branch at Marco Valetti.
After an offer of £189 million to allow it to exercise its immunity clause, St. Germain, Paris, would not give up its entry into Nemal, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of launching an attack on the world record raider?
This sensational approach has opened the summer roundup window, and the Al-Facha Club is about to break the world round record at twice the price of the last round. Paul Borgba returned to Mansion in the last quarter, amounting to £89 million.
Once the transition is completed, Nemal will leap to the highest-priced player in the world, as well as the world's highest-paid professional player, St. Germain, Paris, who provides after-tax salaries of over £500,000 a week.
Barcelona was outraged by the manner in which Nemal was attacking and the way out, and sources of information about the Catalan Board of Directors insisted that the club had done everything possible to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013.
But did President St. Germain of Paris make such a prediction of the football world three years ago?
When Man City expressed interest in signing a contract with Bryce Matedi in 2014, Nasser Al-Hlaif issued a strong warning to any club that wanted to sign the best player in St. Germain, Paris.
“I'm not worried, because they know that if they come into contact with any of our players, we'll be against them, and we'll be in contact with their players,” Al-Hlefi says.
“We respect all clubs.
But if they try to sign on to our players, they will also suffer the consequences.”
Earlier this summer, the Spanish club seemed to have crossed the line and Barcelona threw an olive branch at Marco Veratti, the midfield player of St. Germain in Paris.
St. Germain of Paris made it clear that they would not in any way allow the Italian foot to leave, and Barcelona would most likely be affected by the loss of Nemar, the genius of the battle.
Reporter Wang Qing: The International Seminar on New Energy Development and Technologies, co-sponsored by the National Network Corporation and the International Electrotechnical Commission, was held in Frankfurt, Germany.
At present, the acceleration of new energy development and the promotion of a clean, low-carbon energy transformation have become global trends.

3 January: The journalist was informed yesterday by the Guangzhou City Office that the spring flower market in 2008 would soon begin to call for tenders.
On 29 and 30 last month, two tenders for orange and flower positions were launched in the Handu district.
The Viet Xiu District Archives are organizing and collecting hundreds of historic old photos of the Spring Flower City (both five or six decades old), and an open exhibition is scheduled for 8 January 2008 at the Viet Xu District Centre for Culture and Arts, which will be moved to the hundreds of small squares of Beijing Road at the beginning of the construction of the City at the end of January.
In addition, the Viet Xiu District Department of Culture will organize a flower market forum, which will bring together the old leaders of Guangzhou City, social folklore experts, social celebrities, the old neighborhoods of Beijing Road, etc., to discuss the history and future development of the Lusi Lake Flower market in Beijing.

Deterioration of fiscal subsidies for Sichuan's new energy vehicle, low coverage of charging facilities, suspension of the use of the three-dollar lithium battery in the new energy passenger vehicle, in the face of current upward pressure on the domestic market for new energy vehicles
From 3 to 6 November, during the first phase of the 16th International Expo for Western China (hereinafter “Sibo”), the six municipal states of Chengdu, Nanchang and Ja'an demonstrated their development gains in advanced manufacturing, with new energy vehicles emerging and new products of interest to the industry.
Currently, the domestic market for new energy vehicles is under temporary upward pressure with the weakening of fiscal subsidies for new energy vehicles, low coverage of recharge facilities, and the suspension of three-dollar lithium batteries in new energy buses.
However, the Sichuan-made new energy vehicle is on the rise, and the market is broken down by large-scale and commercial vehicles.
The current situation of Zhao Zewoo, a journalist in this newspaper, focuses on the development of the “Shokawa” new-energy auto industry in recent times.

It is assumed that British athletes' promising impact medal projects come from single-board skiing, ice pots, steel rack snowmobiles and short-way skiing.
During the past winter Olympic cycle, the British Sports Council allocated a total of Pound32 million (approximately RMB 280 million) for training for the Winter Olympics project, doubling the Pesche Winter Olympics cycle.
Most of this money comes from national lottery tickets and the rest from national finances.
Britain's hope for gold is primarily placed on two people: Alice Christy, last year's world short-track ski championship winner, and Liz Janod, the last female steel rack champion.
The 2014 Sochi Winter Olympics, in which the British delegation had achieved a golden and a silver 2 bronze, had been the best since the first Winter Olympics in 1924.
