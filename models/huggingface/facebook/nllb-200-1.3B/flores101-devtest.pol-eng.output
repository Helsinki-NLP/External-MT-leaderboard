This confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a popular theory, but it also provides details like color and three-dimensional patterns that you can't get from fossils.
Scientists say that the animal's plumage was chestnut on top and light or carotene underneath.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed trunk, called a stosin, but have other features such as feathers  rays and prominence , the researchers concluded that the stosin was probably a later evolutionary stage than these other features.
The feather structure indicates that they were not used for flight, but for temperature control or for display, and scientists believe that this is the feather of an adult, not a chicken, even though the tail belonged to a young dinosaur.
The researchers suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the tail of the specimen indicates an adult, not a chick.

The work was largely theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations of galaxies in the constellation Sagittarius.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon affects the Earth and causes tides, so does the Milky Way exert its force on the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have been able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that standard matter does.
This theory says that most of the dark matter surrounds the galaxy like a sort of halo, made up of many small particles.

Candidates have the opportunity to send representatives to observe each stage of the process, and in the evening the votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to defined procedures.

She's in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but eyewitness testimony may be unreliable because her image has been widely publicized.
This is common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish justice system operates differently, and the courts feel that publishing the photographs can be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "journalists are entering dangerous territory by publishing pictures of suspects and so on".
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is generally responsible for conducting the investigation, told reporters that any further comment would be withheld at least until the indictment is filed.
According to the leak, the document will be about the disputed borders that Palestine wants to restore to the state it was in before the Six-Day War in 1967.
Other issues reportedly touched on include the future status of Jerusalem, the holy city for both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel has demanded a permanent military presence in the valley for 10 years after the signing of the agreement, and the PA has agreed to a five-year military presence.
The shooters participating in the additional pest control test were to be closely monitored by the foresters as the test was monitored and subject to an evaluation of effectiveness.
The NPWS and the NSW have partnered to recruit skilled volunteers through the NSW hunting programme.
Mick O'Flynn, the director of conservation and heritage at the NPSW Park, believes that the four shooters selected for the first shooting operation have been given comprehensive safety instruction and training.
Martelly was sworn in yesterday as a member of the new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the presidential committee requested the dissolution of the previous Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) as part of a package of measures to expedite new elections in the country.
The Commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests were a blow to the lack of elections, blocked in some cases since 2011.
Over 60 cases of iPod malfunctions due to overheating were reported, which caused six fires and four people suffered minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan stated that it was aware of 27 incidents involving devices.
Last week, Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry said that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating, describing them as "not dangerous".
When Apple delayed the report, the ministry called the decision "very unfortunate".
The quake struck the Mariana Islands at 7:19 a.m. local time (which is 9:19 p.m.
The Northern Mariana Crisis Management Bureau reported that the country had not suffered any damage.
In addition, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no signs of a tsunami.
A bus carrying Hong Kong tourists was hijacked in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, by a former Filipino police officer who took the passengers hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 towards the tourists.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and at least six are presumed dead.
The Filipino photographers and six hostages, including children and seniors, were released earlier.
Then the photographers took the place of an old lady who needed a toilet.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He trained as a midwife and in 1959 began work at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at the hospital, Liggins used his free time to start researching premature birth.
His study showed that the introduction of the hormone would accelerate lung development in the fetus.
Xinhua News Agency reported that on Wednesday, government investigators recovered the black boxes.
The wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tomy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of Extreme, and she died on the night of the two moons, which was as special as she was, a strong woman.
Dustin Goldust Runnels said Luna was as crazy as I was... or maybe even more... I love her and I'll miss her... you can only hope she's better now.
A survey of 1,400 people conducted before the 2010 federal election showed that the percentage of people opposed to the introduction of a republic in Australia had increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic with the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of respondents agree and want Queen Elizabeth to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extreme points of the poll, 29 percent of respondents think Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and 31 percent think it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to compete in the 100m, 200m freestyle and triple jump at the Commonwealth Games, but as he complained about his form, doubts arose about his expected results.
The pain medication he needed was prohibited by the rules of the games, so he couldn't take it.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
By early February, several people had confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets brought water to Earth along with organic matter capable of making proteins and sustaining life.
Scientists hope to learn about the process of planet formation, especially what it looked like on Earth, because comets collided with it long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year, and the month before, he had signed into law a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense".
There's speculation that he's running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA says would allow planes to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel and reduce carbon emissions.
The use of satellite technology instead of older generation radar technology allows air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and to provide pilots with more detailed information.
There will be no additional transport options, no overland trains will stop at Wembley, and in addition, car parks and park-and-ride facilities will be off-limits to ground travel.
The potential lack of transportation has made it more likely that the game will be played behind closed doors without the presence of team fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reports the emergence of a new species of bird in Ecuador's Galapagos Islands.
Scientists at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have announced that a new species has been formed in just two generations, although this process was thought to take much longer because of the reproduction of Darwin's finches, black Darwin's finches, cactus Darwin's finches, and rough-coated Darwin's finches.
Gold can be made into many shapes, even the smallest.
It can be stretched into a thin thread that can be twisted and braided, or it can be unfolded or unfolded on a sheet.
It can be spread thinly and glued to another metal, and it can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books, called illuminated manuscripts.
We call this the pH of a chemical, and the juice from the red cabbage has the ability to detect pH.
The color of the cabbage juice depends on how acidic or alkaline the chemical is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (letter H for pH) in the test chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have been stripped of electrons (the hydrogen atom is made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and squeeze them together with your clean, wet hands to form a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which will cause a strange sensation and create a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, nearly every home had a flush toilet connected to a modern sewer system.
Remnants of a sewage system have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, Greece.
Toilets were also known in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, and in Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women shared a common space.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use satellite.
The call hits a satellite in space, and then it bounces back almost immediately.
Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts the light and so the image seen from Earth.
Sending a satellite or a telescope into space requires the use of a huge rocket over 100 feet high.
The wheel has changed the world in many amazing ways, and most importantly, it has made transportation much easier and faster.
Without it, there would be no railways, no cars, and no other means of transportation.
The lower-sized cats feed on the medium-sized prey: rabbits, antelopes, and even deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including domestic cats) that eat far more small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the niche, the special task that each cat performs, so that it cannot compete with the others.
Lions are among the most sociable cats and live in large herds.
A lion pack consists of one, two or three related adult males and up to 30 females and cubs.
Females are mostly closely related to each other, forming one large family of sisters and daughters.
Groups of lions behave like a pack of wolves or a pack of dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior and the deadly threat they pose to their prey.
A well-built tiger athlete can climb (though not very well), swim, jump great distances, and pull five times better than a strong man.
The tiger, along with the lion, leopard, and jaguar, are all members of the genus Panthera, and these four species of cottontails are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not as loud as a lion's, but it is more like a tangled, screaming word.
The ocelots prefer small animals, and when possible they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and most of the victims are much smaller than the ocelot itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find food animals by smell.
They see very well in the dark because of their night vision and they move stealthily, hunting their prey by blending into their surroundings and then jumping on their prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originates (e.g. when moving over a mountain range or a river or if moving to a new island, without the possibility of easy retreat), it is often in a different environment than before.
In this new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population will have to develop new characteristics or adapt in such a way that they can compete effectively in their new environment.
The original population hasn't changed a bit and still has to adapt.
As the new population adapts to its new environment, it becomes less and less like the other populations.
After all, thousands or even millions of years later, these two populations will be so different from each other that it will be difficult to call them one species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the creation of new species, and speciation is an inevitable outcome of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale.
Photosynthesis is the process by which plants use sunlight to produce nutrients and shade.
We make our homes out of plants, we make our clothes out of plants, we make most of our food out of plants, and without plants, animals wouldn't survive.
The Mozaurus was the largest predator at the time, so he was only afraid of other Mozaurus.
It had over 70 extremely sharp teeth in its elongated jaws, and an extra tooth protruded from the crown, so victims had no chance of coming into contact with it.
He's not completely sure, but he could have a forked tongue, fed on turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs, could even be a cannibal.
He wouldn't back down from attacking his victims in the water, and even a dinosaur as big as the T. rex must have felt respect for him.
While we are familiar with most of the foods that the Romans ate, their feasts included quite exotic dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snail, and lizard.
Another difference was that the poor and the women ate meals sitting on chairs, while the rich met at banquets where they ate in a reclining position.
The dishes of ancient Rome could not have contained the ingredients that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They didn't know about corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman had ever tasted turkey.
In Babylon, each deity had a dedicated main temple, which was considered his home.
The sacrifices to the gods were offered by the people, and the role of the priests was to provide for divine needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard, behind which was the inner sanctuary, accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were erected and became part of the temples.
A special sanctuary dedicated to the god was located on top of the tower.
The home was not particularly important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Most of the life of a Hebrew family was outside.
Women prepared food in their backyards, shops were simple shelves that faced the street, and stones were used to build houses.
Because of the lack of forests in Canaan, timber was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated, and according to Norse legend, Eric the Red was banished from Iceland for murder, and on his journey westward, he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
While not diminishing his role as an explorer, it should be noted that the Eskimo tribes were already inhabiting the area at that time.
While each country could be described as "Scandinavian", Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland differ in people, rulers, customs, and history.
If you've seen the movie "Treasure of Nations", you might think that on the back of the Declaration of Independence, there's a map drawn to the treasure.
There's some writing on the back of the document, but it's not a map to the treasure.
On the other side of the Declaration of Independence were the words: "The original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776".
No one knows for sure who wrote it, but it is known that at first this large parchment document (29.75 by 24.5 inches) was shredded for storage.
It can therefore be assumed that the annotation was added as a descriptive label.
The Normandy landings and further fighting led to the liberation of northern France, but the south remained under occupation.
The French Vichy were the ones who made peace with Germany in 1940 and worked with the aggressors instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies launched an invasion of southern France, which they called Operation Dragoon.
It took two weeks for the forces of the United States and Free France to liberate southern France and head for Germany.
Civilization is one culture, shared by a fairly large group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis", which means "citizen", and "civitas", which means city or city-state, which also indicates the size of the community.
The city-states were the prototypes of nations, and the culture of civilization is about passing knowledge down through generations, creating a lasting cultural imprint, and distributing it fairly.
Important cultures often disappear without leaving a significant historical record, so they cannot be considered true civilizations.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states first formed a fragile central government - the only element of which was Congress - based on the Articles of Confederation.
Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial branch, it relied on state governments, which often showed little willingness to cooperate in enforcing all their laws.
Moreover, he had no authority to overturn interstate laws and tax rates.
The Articles required unanimous approval by all the states before any changes could be made, and the states treated the central government with such disdain that their representatives often did not appear.
Alongside Germany, the Italian national football team is ranked second in the world football rankings, and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italian athletes compete in international tournaments and the Olympic Games.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshū), making it the seventh-largest island in the world.
Because of the cluster of islands it has, Japan is often called an archipelago in the geographical sense.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when European sailors recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning beautiful island.
When the Dutch East India Company established a factory in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, it began to implement changes in indigenous grain production practices and employed Chinese to work on rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the armies of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) conquered the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and in 1885 declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, after defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which handed Taiwan over to Japan, which would rule the island until 1945.
Within Machu Picchu, three main sites stand out: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
To better represent the original appearance of the site to visitors, most of the buildings on the outskirts of the complex have been rebuilt.
By 1976, one third of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the process is still ongoing.
For example, the most common format used in photography is 35 mm, which was the most common size of film tape at the end of the analogue era.
It's still being produced today, but more importantly, this image format has been transferred to matrix formats in digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is quite confusing.
The ratio of this format (dividing by 12 to get the simplest total) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g. APS group formats) are identical or very similar to this ratio.
The rule of thirds is often abused or ridiculed, but it is a simple guideline that helps to achieve the effect of dynamism without disturbing order.
It states that the ideal location for the main object is the point where the lines dividing the image into three equal parts vertically and horizontally intersect (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, came under close scrutiny.
For more than a millennium, Christianity has provided a vital bond between European nations with different languages and customs.
His power was so pervasive that it affected everyone, from the king to the peasant.
One of the basic tenets of Christianity is that wealth should be used to help the suffering and the poor, and that church funds should be used for that purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and such concentration of power and money calls into question whether this doctrine is being observed.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
This strategy effectively cut off vital military and civilian supplies, even though the blockade violated generally accepted international law as enshrined in several international agreements made over the previous two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to block ships from reaching vast swathes of the ocean, putting even neutral vessels at risk.
This tactic met with limited response, so the Germans expected a similar situation for their unforgiving underwater warfare operations.
The 20th century is characterized by a pacifist and isolated attitude of most nations and citizens.
After the terrible and cruel experiences of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla settled in the United States because of his job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He set foot on American soil with four cents in his pocket, a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods were uniquely represented; each stage in China or each ruling family constituted a separate dynasty.
In the transitional periods of kinglessness between successive dynasties, the provinces were plunged into turmoil and division.
Many of the notables who were contenders for the throne fought fierce battles during these periods.
The Three Kingdoms era was a period of great bloodshed in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting for the highest throne in the great palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just to a single ruler.
After the Revolution, all male candidates were given free access to the professions, so that those who showed the greatest ambition and ingenuity could succeed.
The same is true of the military, because the ranking of armies that used to be class-based is now based on the sword.
The French Revolution also inspired many of the oppressed working class people in other countries to start revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters beyond his ordinary life, and often went to contemplate the cave known as Hira at the top of Mount Noor (Mountain of Light).
The cave itself gives a very colorful idea of the spiritual predilections of Muhammad.
The cave, located on top of a mountain north of Mecca, is completely cut off from the rest of the world.
It's not easy to find, even if someone knows it exists, but inside the cave, the visitor is completely isolated.
Nothing is visible except the clear, beautiful sky and the surrounding mountains, and from inside the cave, you can't see or hear much of the outside world.
The only one of the seven wonders of the world that has survived to this day is the Great Pyramid of Giza.
The Great Pyramid, built in the third century B.C.E., is one of many large pyramids erected in honor of a deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau (also called the Giza Necropolis) in Egypt's Valley of the Dead is home to several pyramids (the largest being the Pyramid of Cheops), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and relatives.
The upward slide symbol looks like the letter V, and the downward slide symbol looks like a button or a square without a bottom.
Up means you start at the tip and you press the loop, and down means you start at the frog (that's where the hand holds the loop) and you pull the loop.
The loop from the bottom up creates a softer sound, and the loop from the top down creates a louder, more determined sound.
Feel free to draw your own characters, but remember that the characters printed on the string are there for musical reasons, so you should usually stick to them.
The crowd of bribes forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (Mary Theresa, 11, and Louis Charles, 4), and the king's sister, Elisabeth, to return from Versailles to Paris.
As the king and queen returned to Paris in their carriage, they were accompanied by an angry mob, who threatened them.
The angry butterfly forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows wide.
At one point, a person in the crowd waved his head at a guard who had been killed at Versailles, right in front of the terrified queen.
The imperialist United States' war expenses for the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover most of the expenses and interest on the bonds put on the market on behalf of the Philippine government by the Wall Street banking houses.
Of course, the great profits from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipinos would be the primary profits of US imperialism.
The context in which the Templar Order was formed is important in understanding its specificity.
These events belong to the period commonly called the Late Middle Ages, which spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries of European history (1000-1300 C.E.).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500.
Technological determinism covers a wide range of ideas in practice, including the technological impulse or technological imperative, and the strict definition of human destiny, guided by the latent logic of scientific laws and their manifestation in the field of technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism combine two general principles: first, the process of technological development itself is not subject to cultural or political factors, and second, technology generates effects in societies that are immanent rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the motor vehicle necessarily leads to the development of the road network.
As the national road network is not economically viable when the number of vehicles is negligible, new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of running the vehicle.
Mass car ownership also leads to an increase in road accidents, and thus to the invention of new ways of repairing damaged bodies in medicine.
Romanticism contained an important element of cultural determinism, which can be found in the writings of such authors as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, the individual was shaped by geography, and over time, customs and culture associated with that geography developed, so consistent with the place of society that they were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the modern fashion capital, so Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a luxury sanctuary began around 400 C.E. and lasted until 1000 C.E.
Its status declined in the 12th century, primarily because the Crusaders returned from their expeditions with goods such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what was offered at the Byzantine markets.
It was then that the title of fashion capital was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the 11th and 14th centuries.
The dress was originally heavily influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, because the exchange of information was slow, Western styles could be developed with a delay of 25-30 years.
By the late Middle Ages, Western Europe was beginning to shape its own style, and one of the greatest achievements of the time, as a consequence of the Crusades, was the use of buttons to fasten clothes.
Self-sufficient farming is the farmer's production of enough food to meet his and his family's needs.
Self-sustaining farming is a simple, often organic system using self-sustaining seed from the ecoregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively easy methods of maximising yield.
In the past, most farmers were self-sufficient, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures attract people who have similar attitudes to the world, people who feel that social norms do not meet their needs, people who find a sense of identity within subcultures.
Subcultures differ in terms of age, ethnicity, class, location and/or gender of members.
The distinctive features of a subculture may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical or may be a combination of factors.
If you're a member of a subculture, you show it through a expressive and symbolic style that incorporates fashion, mannerisms and slang.
One of the most popular ways of illustrating the importance of socialization is to draw on a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during adolescence  whether because of neglect, unhappiness or intentional exploitation.
Some of these children were imprisoned (usually by their parents) and some were abandoned because their parents were unable to come to terms with their child's severe mental or physical disability.
Before being abandoned or fled, feral children may have suffered from trauma or abuse.
Others are thought to have raised animals, and some are said to live in the wild on their own.
If a wild child is cared for only by animals, he behaves almost entirely (including physical limitations) like these animals, showing fear or indifference to humans.
The project method should make learning easier and more attractive, while the scaffolding method goes a step further.
The scaffolding method is not a way of learning but rather a support provided to individuals who are participating in new learning experiences, e.g. using a new computer program or starting a new project.
The scaffolding can be both virtual and real, so the teacher is a kind of scaffolding, just like Mr. Spinach in MS Office.
Virtual scaffolding is embedded in the software and is designed to question, suggest and explain procedures that may be challenging for the student to understand on his own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, including neglect, abuse, and even bullying.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that does not provide for him or her education, care and education, but unfortunately that is what is happening.
We believe the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system is designed to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education and good medical care.
The foster family is supposed to meet any needs that weren't met in the home they were taken from.
The Internet can be used for both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the Internet open up new dimensions in terms of how it is used and approaches to gratification.
For example, "science" and "connections" are proposed as important reasons for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
'Personal engagement' and 'permanent relationships' were also identified by Eighemey and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation when they examined audience reactions to websites.
The video recordings have made important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, or facial muscular movements that last for only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is said that one can detect whether a person is lying by correctly reading his microexpressions.
In an article entitled "The President's Speech", Oliver Sacks argues that people who have brain damage that prevents them from understanding speech are still able to correctly judge the sincerity of the speaker.
He even suggests that such abilities to interpret human behavior may also be present in animals, such as domestic dogs.
Scientific research over the course of the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation - one hidden and the other expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, while selection removes the variation from the pool of expressed genes.
With each generation, there is a reciprocal exchange of variability between the two pools through segregation and recombination.
The plants growing in the savannah have a hard time allowing primates with digestive systems like ours to meet the body's demand for amino acids.
Moreover, failure to do so can have serious consequences: stunting, malnutrition, and eventually death.
The easiest plant resources to obtain would be the proteins found in leaves and stems, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest without first cooking.
Animal food (anthills, termites, eggs) is different, being easily digested and providing high amounts of proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, it should come as no surprise that our ancestors solved their protein problem in a similar way to how chimpanzees do it in the savannah today.
Interruption of sleep is the deliberate awakening during normal sleep and falling back to sleep after 1060 minutes.
It's not difficult if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you back to consciousness, but doesn't wake you up completely.
If you find yourself shifting the clock while you're sleeping, you can put it across the room, which will force you to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based methods recommend drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is diuretic) before bedtime to get up to urinate.
The level of inner peace is inversely proportional to the inner and physical tension of the person.
The less stress, the more positive the life force, and each person has the potential to find complete peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment, and the only thing that's stopping us is our own tension and our own negative attitude.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but additionally includes the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple, and it includes Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of all-embracing love.
Kundalini yoga is the awakening of the kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through the practice of asanas, breathing exercises, mantras and visualizations.
At the heart of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of the gods, and by visualizing the various gods, you clear the energy channels, activate the chakras, and create enlightened consciousness.
During World War II, the United States and the Soviet Union allied against a common enemy, Germany, but when the war ended, a radical clash of systems, processes, and cultures separated the two countries.
Two years had passed since the end of the war, when the former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War had begun.
It was to last for the next 40 years and include real battles fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba and elsewhere.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was broken, the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian wharf.
But these plans quickly fell apart when more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops formed a Belarusian and Ukrainian front after invading eastern Poland, thus violating the provisions of the Russian peace, the Polish-Soviet nonaggression pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping is by far the most efficient way to transport large quantities of goods and people across the oceans.
The Navy's job has always been to provide the nation with the means to transport people and goods, while preventing the enemy from moving its people and goods.
The North Atlantic campaign during World War II was one of the most remarkable examples in recent history. To help the British, the Americans attempted to move men and equipment across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy, using submarines primarily, tried to block these transfers.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have succeeded in conquering Britain, as well as the rest of Europe.
The domestication of goats probably began in the Zagros Mountains of Iran about 10,000 years ago.
People of ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them for their milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Domesticated goats were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures, often guarded by shepherd-like goat-chasers, who were usually children or teenagers.
Railroad towers were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the tracks were built on parallel wooden planks, the horses could move faster and carry larger loads than on the busy roads of the time.
Rail-mounted railway rails were relatively early in the development of the railway, but it was gradually realized that iron bands were needed to increase the efficiency of the track.
This became common practice, but iron contributed to the increased use of wooden wagon wheels.
Eventually, wooden wheels were replaced by iron ones, and in 1767 the railings were made entirely of iron.
The first known way of moving was walking; humans began walking upright two million years ago, hence the term Homo erectus.
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not used to walking upright.
Forms of bipedalism can be found in Australopithecus fossils dated to 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although it is not excluded that Sahelanthropus moved on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly lives, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even take on the role of activists to some extent to help reduce the suffering in the future.
This often resembles symptomatic treatment, but rather than being a temporary solution, the root cause of the problem must be identified and eliminated.
Clearly, the world has changed dramatically because of scientific and technological advances, and overpopulation and extravagant lifestyles have exacerbated problems.
When the Declaration of Independence was passed by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten version signed by John Hancock, the President of Congress, and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing plant a few blocks away.
Between 150 and 200 copies were printed overnight, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
The document was first read publicly by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6, who ordered it read to his troops on July 9 in New York City, and a copy arrived in London on August 10.
The 25 Dunlap bulbs that still exist are the oldest copies of the document that have survived.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived to the present day, and we call them birds.
A lot of people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
But there's still a lot of things about birds that resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs and walk on two hind legs, like the T-Rex.
In fact, all computers in use today are based on manipulating information encoded as a binary system.
A binary number can have a value of 0 or 1 and such numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal intoxication doesn't have to be immediately apparent, but symptoms like vomiting are so common that they don't warrant immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of poisoning is the presence of an open packaging containing medicinal products or toxic industrial chemicals.
Read the instructions on the label to learn how to give first aid in this particular case.
The name worm is formally used by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient times, when bugs were foreign to humans, insects highly adapted to parasitize humans.
Both insect bugs and house bugs are nesting bugs, adapted to live in the nest or in the host's home.
In the United States, there are about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis, making it the most common neurological disorder among young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies show that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interests or in the child's best interests.
These couples may decide to prepare an adoption plan for their child.
Adoption is when the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can be the parents of the child.
The overriding goal of science is to discover the mechanism of the world through the scientific method, which is the basis of most scientific research.
But it is not the only method; an experiment is a test that allows one or more possible hypotheses to be rejected.
The classical texts, especially the Latin Bible, have been the basis for the study of naturalists and philosophers.
Aristotle's ideas have been adopted in all scientific fields, including psychology.
As Greek language became less widely known, the West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
Many of the observed rhythms in physiology and behavior are often essentially dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their creation by biological clocks.
Cyclic rhythms that are not just responses to periodic external stimuli have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that run through cycles even in the absence of external stimuli.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the leading suggestions that DNA was genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used the same bacteriophages or viruses to implant their own DNA into the bacteria.
Two experiments were carried out, one marking the DNA in the flask with radioactive phosphorus and the other marking the flask protein with radioactive sulphur.
Mutations can have different effects, depending on their type, the significance of the genetic material involved and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to children; mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in exploring natural areas, admiring landscapes, including flora and fauna.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, as well as visits to parks and gathering information about ecosystems.
For example, visiting Borneo, taking photographs, and learning about orangutans.
Every morning, people leave their small towns by car to go to work, and they are passed by others who are driving to the places they just left.
In this dynamic shuttle transport, everyone is participating in some way in the private vehicle transport system and the system supports it.
Now science shows that the huge carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of its steady state, which has supported human evolution for two million years.
Everyone is a part of society and uses transportation.
In developed countries, such complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges are rare.
Why are there so many complaints about transport systems, why are there malfunctions in their operation every day, are the engineers responsible for them, are they just the groundskeepers, or is the problem much deeper?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that occur between them.
There is no way to predict the behavior of drivers with absolute certainty, so unfortunately, studying traffic flow is a challenge.
Fortunately, the behaviour of drivers is in a generally consistent range; therefore, traffic flows also show some consistency and can be approximated by mathematical calculations.
The relationships between the three key characteristics, namely (1) flow, (2) density and (3) speed, make it possible to better visualize traffic.
The planning, design and operation of road infrastructure uses this type of relationship.
Insects were the first animals to soar in the air, and their ability to fly made it easier for them to avoid enemies and more efficient in finding food and mates.
Most insects have the useful ability to fold their wings along the body.
This gives them a wider choice of small hiding places from predators.
Today, the only insects that do not have the ability to fold their wings are the weasels and the jets.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, while others held the opposite view, that the solar system, with its sun and other stars, revolves around the earth.
It makes sense, because the Earth doesn't seem to be moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, stretching nearly six miles in places.
The Amazon is responsible for 20% of the water in the rivers that feed the oceans of the Earth.
The Amazon is 3,980 miles long in its main course and is fed by thousands of small tributaries.
Although stone pyramids were built until the end of the Old Kingdom, they never surpassed the size and technical perfection of the Giza pyramid.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom looked with admiration at the buildings of their ancestors, which were over a thousand years old at the time.
With a population of about 800, the Vatican is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
The Vatican uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Most of the people who work in this country speak Italian on a daily basis, and Latin is often spoken during religious ceremonies.
All the inhabitants of the Vatican are of the Roman Catholic faith.
Since ancient times, people have known basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper because they are found in nature in their natural form and can be extracted relatively easily with simple tools.
The philosopher Aristotle theorized that everything is a combination of at least one to four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like the four states of matter concentration (in that order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that these could be converted into new substances that shape what we see.
An alloy can be defined as a mixture of two or more metals.
Calcium and potassium are considered metals, and silver and gold are, of course, metals.
There may also be alloys which contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, e.g. carbon.
Everything in the universe is made up of matter, which is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly microscopic that the dot at the end of this problem would contain trillions of them.
So when the pencil came along, it became a good friend to a lot of people.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil lost its status and frequency.
People are now writing messages using computer screens and don't need a tempering device at all.
You can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works by the principle that it takes energy to connect the nucleus with many protons and neurons.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei that break down with or without a small impact.
The surface of the moon is covered with rocks and dust, and the outer layer of the planet is called the crust.
The coverage is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It's thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the highlands.
On the visible side, there may be more areas of maria, because the shell thickness is smaller here, and the lava was easier to penetrate to the surface.
Content theorists focus on finding what people respond to and appeal to.
These theories assume that people have certain needs and/or desires that are acquired during the process of maturation into adulthood.
These theories are about what makes some people want what they do and what in their environment makes them do certain things and others don't.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's pyramid of needs and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when managers start leading their former colleagues, there are two types of behaviour that can occur.
This type of manager is reluctant to make unpopular decisions, avoids disciplinary actions, and refrains from evaluating performance, assigning tasks, and holding people accountable for their work.
The other extreme is the unrecognizable transformation into someone who feels that he has to change everything the team has done, to make it conform to his own vision.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the successes and failures of the team.
This behavior often results in friction between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams have the same standards of excellence, but there are slight differences.
Members of a virtual team often act as a point of contact for a physical group directly related to them.
They often have more freedom than regular team members, because their teams can organize meetings according to different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is a unique element of a virtual team.
An invisible group is a governing body to which all members are subject, and an invisible group sets standards for each member.
Why would a company want to go through the time-consuming process of setting up a learning organisation?One of the objectives of implementing the concept of a learning organisation is to innovate.
Creativity and ingenuity flourish when all available resources are used effectively in functional departments of the organisation.
As a result, collaboration within the organisation to overcome the obstacle can lead to the creation of an innovative process that meets the needs of customers.
To become an innovative organisation, its management must create a culture of innovation, knowledge sharing and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method that helps organisations achieve higher performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition, and it narrows the field of study and makes it more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior is supported by ongoing research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, injury, injury, and tumor affect behavior and lead to changes in mental function.
New technologies are allowing us to observe and study previously unknown brain structures and processes.
We're getting a lot of information and material from this to build simulation models that allow us to better understand what's going on in the human mind.
Although AI is closely related to science fiction, it is a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning and intelligent adaptation of machines.
The research on artificial intelligence is about building machines to automate tasks that require intelligence.
Examples are: control and planning, the ability to respond to customer statements and questions, and the ability to recognize handwriting, voice and facial characteristics.
These things have become separate fields, focused on providing solutions to real life problems.
AI systems are now commonly used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and military technology, and are embedded in several applications used in personal computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of any class, and often a teacher would be happy to take her students to places that the buses do not reach.
Technology has made virtual field trips possible, allowing students to see museum collections, visit aquariums, or admire art from their living room.
By making the field trip available in a virtual mode, you can stimulate reflection and share experiences with the next class.
For example, every year, students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; every year, the website is changed, but the old versions remain online as an album.
Blogs can help students improve their writing skills, and often when you start blogging, grammar and spelling aren't at their best, but the presence of readers usually changes that.
Blogger starts to make efforts to improve the quality of their texts and avoid criticism, because students often get the most harsh grades.
In addition, blogging "makes students better acquainted with the world around them". The need to respond to the audience's interests inspires students to offer intelligent and interesting content (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool to inspire collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond the traditional school day.
Through the proper use of blogs, students can become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online posts, they can define their own position on the work of others and draw their own perspective on certain issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada, with many art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south are Niagara Falls, and to the north are the pristine beauties of Muskoka County and the surrounding region.
All of these things, and not just the things, clearly indicate that Ontario is considered by outsiders to be the quintessential Canada.
The vast areas further north are sparsely populated, some of them virtually unpopulated wilderness.
This comparison of population is surprising to many: the number of African-Americans living in the United States exceeds the number of Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean east of the African coast.
Madagascar is undoubtedly the largest, and because of its nature, it is a separate continent.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or allies of France and are famous as luxury seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, which was firmly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European expansion and colonialism began in the 15th century when Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that any woman travelling should present herself as married, regardless of her true marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (if it doesn't look too expensive.
Women should know that cultural differences can lead to behaviour that they consider to be harassment, often being followed, being held by the hand, etc.
Be firm in your refusal, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences don't mean you can!)
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the tenth century B.C.E. by Berber fishermen and served the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city as Daru-i-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who had trading bases there called it Casablanca.
When it comes to shopping, Casablanca is the last place in all of Morocco.
Traditional Moroccan goods such as tajin, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes and a host of other items can be easily purchased in the old Medina, but this is a typical tourist offer.
Goma is a tourist town in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located at the eastern end of the country near the border with Rwanda.
In 2002, the city of Goma was devastated when the Nyiragongo volcano erupted and lava covered most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is fairly safe, all visits outside its area should be pre-screened for the fighting in North Kivu province.
From the city, you can go climbing Nyiragongo volcano and mountain gorilla tracking, which is one of the cheapest options for this kind of activity in Africa.
Motorcycle taxis (known as boda-boda) can be used to get around Goma, with a standard (local) price of around 500 CFA francs for a short course.
In the context of its relatively difficult-to-reach location, Timbuktu has become a metaphor for exotic and remote lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor city, but its reputation as a tourist attraction and an airport are still there.
In 1990 the city was inscribed on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger because of the devastation caused by desert sands.
It was one of the main stops on the Henry Louis Gates special on PBS's "The African Wonder of the World".
This city is definitely different from the rest of the cities in the country because it has a more Arab climate than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the north-east of South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecosystems, with different flora and fauna.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South Africa's National Parks (SANParks).
There is a daily security fee and a park admission fee, as in all other South African national parks.
Purchasing a wildlife card can be beneficial, as it gives you access to selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong is named after Hong Kong Island, which is a major tourist attraction.
The combined array of buildings that make up the panorama of Hong Kong has been compared to the glittering grid pattern embodied by the Victoria Bay.
The best views of Hong Kong are from the coast of Koulun, across from the city.
The vast majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern shore.
This is the place that was occupied by the British colonists, so it's worth starting to look for traces of the colonial past of this territory.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest belt of mangrove forests, stretching 50 miles (80 km) from the coast into Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and the forest in India is called Sundarban National Park.
But forests are not just earthquake seismic sites - they are also the last remnants of the vast jungles that once covered the Indian Plains.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which about one third is covered by water and marshes.
Since 1966, Sundarban has been a wildlife reserve and is now thought to be home to 400 royal Bengal tigers and an estimated 30,000 tigers.
Buses leave from the Inter-Regional Bus Station (across the river) throughout the day, although most depart between 6:30 and 7:30, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumthang.
It is better to buy a ticket several days in advance, since buses between neighborhoods are often crowded.
Most districts are served by small Japanese shore buses, comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient means of transport to nearby places such as Paro (No 150) and Punakha (No 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, French Guiana.
The two towers are 83 metres high, 378 metres long and have two lanes of traffic 3.5 metres wide.
The vertical span of the bridge is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened for use until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be open for use in September 2017, when the construction of the Brazilian customs offices is expected to be completed.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group in the region of what is now eastern Paraguay, leading a semi-nomadic life of hunting and farming to meet their own needs.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Great Province of the Indies", was founded in the 16th century by Spanish conquistadors and groups of indigenous people.
The Spanish began a colonial period that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and the best players in the world.
In December, the biggest tournament of the year is held at the polo courts of Las Cañitas.
Other months are also filled with smaller-scale tournaments and games.
The Asociación Argentina de Polo offers more information about the games and tickets for polo matches.
The official currency of the Falklands is the Falkland pound (FKP), which is equivalent to the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, located in Stanley across from the FIC West store.
Payments are generally accepted in British pounds throughout the islands, credit cards are available in Stanley, and often in U.S. dollars.
You should not expect to pay by card while on the outermost islands, although British and American currency may be accepted; it is best to ask the owners in advance about the payment method.
It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland currency outside the islands, so you must exchange money before leaving the islands.
Because Montevideo is south of the equator, summer is when winter is in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone, which means that temperatures often exceed +30°C in the summer months.
Winter can be colder than you think: the temperature rarely drops below zero, but when combined with wind and humidity, the feeling of cold is greater than the thermometer shows.
There are no dry and rainy seasons, and the rainfall is basically the same all year round.
Although many of the animals in the park have become accustomed to the sight of humans, they are wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials recommend that you keep at least 100 yards per meter from bears and wolves and 25 yards per meter from all other wildlife!
Although they may appear mild, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Dozens of visitors are injured every year because they don't keep their distance, and these are large, wild, potentially dangerous animals that need space.
Also, be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking smelly foods and keep the campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and is home to fewer than 40,000 people.
The 1950s saw the founding of Apia, which became the capital of Samoa in 1959.
This is where the infamous naval stalemate of 1889 occurred, when seven ships from Germany, the United States and Great Britain refused to leave port.
All but one British cruiser sank, with the loss of nearly 200 American and German lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful rally in the city ended with the assassination of the chief leader of the Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Auckland is between two bays, so there's plenty of beaches, and the most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches of the North Harbour District are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all beaches are sandy, with safe swimming areas, and most shade is provided by metrosideros trees.
Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Waitemata Bay, in the luxurious suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
They are often crowded, family-friendly beaches with a wide selection of shops filling the shores.
The main local beer is Number One, which is not a complicated beer, but a pleasant and refreshing one.
It is worthwhile to stock up on various French wines, but New Zealand and Australian wines may be more likely to endure the journey.
You can drink tap water here without any fear, but if you have any doubts, you can easily find bottled water.
The concept of flat white is unfamiliar to Australians, with the small black being espresso, the cappuccino being filled to the brim with cream (not foam), and the tea being served without milk.
Hot chocolate is by Belgian standards, and the fruit juices are expensive, but they're delicious.
Many reef expeditions are year-round, and reef injuries caused by any of these factors are rare.
However, take the advice of the authorities, heed all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The cuckoos have been found near beaches and estuaries from October to April, north of 1770, and can sometimes be found outside this time.
No one denies that sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans, and most of these creatures are afraid of contact with humans and run away.
The pink crocodile does not live in the ocean, but its primary habitat is the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance means that travelers do not have to worry about having a place to sleep when they reach their destination.
Travel agencies usually work with certain hotels, although it is possible to book another form of accommodation, such as camping, with a travel agent.
The travel agency offers packages which include breakfast, airport/airport transport, and package travel and hotel.
You may be granted an extension if you need time to think about the offer or to obtain other documents you need at the destination (e.g. a visa).
Any corrections or requests should go to the travel agent first, not directly to the hotel.
In the case of music festivals, the vast majority of participants choose to camp on the spot, and most of them consider it an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll have to come early to find a camping spot near the music.
It should be noted that even after the main stage music is over, some festival sectors will continue to play music into the late hours of the night.
Some festivals offer picnic areas for families with young children.
When crossing the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the cabin, as traveling through the ice generates terrible noise for those most affected.
The tourist passengers are not required to have a visa (check the conditions).
Casinos tend to make sure that their guests stay as long as possible and leave as much money as possible, so there are no windows and no clocks, and it's hard to find a way out.
They usually have special offers of food, drink, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and at home.
Some bars offer alcoholic beverages at the company's expense, but being sober is a judgmental affair, and all hard-core gamblers know the value of being sober.
When driving at high latitudes or on mountain passes, conditions such as snow, ice and sub-zero temperatures shall be taken into account.
The ice and snow-covered roads are not as friction-free as the clear asphalt.
When a snowstorm rages, so much snow can fall very quickly that the road becomes impassable.
It can also reduce visibility from falling or rolling snow or dripping or ice on the car's windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries where traffic is smooth all year round.
Safari is probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most important event for many visitors.
Popular usage of the term safari refers to overland trips to enjoy the beautiful African countryside, especially the savannah.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, are often close to cars, and standard equipment will allow for adequate viewing.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shallow, so it's best to watch them through binoculars.
A walking safari can last from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will begin on August 24 and run through September 5, 2012, with some events hosted at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to host the Summer Olympics twice (the first time was in 1964).
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the reschedule, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation rules vary, but by the end of March, most coronavirus cancellations do not include July 2020, when the Olympics were due to take place.
The price of most tickets to events is expected to range from ¥2,500 to ¥130,000, while the typical ticket price will be around ¥7,000.
Many hotels rent irons and ironing boards if they are not included in the room's equipment.
If you do not have a hair dryer or do not like to wear pressed socks, you can try using a hair dryer if available.
The fabric must not be overheated, as it may shrink or burn in extreme cases.
There are many ways to purify water, and some are more effective at combating certain hazards.
Depending on the area, boiling the water for one minute or several minutes is sufficient.
Filters vary in efficiency, so if you're concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter pests that do not occur in their native countries.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation or, worse, allergic reactions, release poison, and transmit infections.
Pests are not usually considered to be infectious diseases as such or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans.
Free-purchase offers the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain places.
Travelers visiting particularly taxed countries can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on such goods as alcohol and tobacco.
On the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, the most difficult stretch for drivers is between Point Marion and Fairmont, often crossing isolated wooded areas.
If you are not in the habit of driving on country roads, keep your eyes on the road, for you will often encounter steep curves, narrow sections, and steep turns.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those in force on the preceding and subsequent sections (typically 3540 mph, or 5664 km/h), and strict compliance with them is of the utmost importance.
But the interesting thing is that the cell phone network here has a much stronger signal than many other parts of the route, like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite tasty, and Bavarian pastries are as nutritious and varied as those of Austria, which borders Bavaria to the south.
Fruit baked goods are very popular: boiled apples are available year-round, and cherries and plums are available in summer.
Many German pastries include almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts, and the popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but nutritious meal, try what is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices served with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be either dried or moisturized depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is a common addition to curry, while coconut milk is used in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
Since there are as many as 17,000 islands, the term Indonesian cuisine encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines from across the country.
This term, without further specification, usually refers to the cuisine typical of the central and eastern areas of Java, which is the most important island of the region.
Now readily available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine includes simple spices, and the Javanese's favorite additions are peanuts, chili peppers, and various aromatic spices.
The stremions are the rider's footrests, which hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide the rider with greater stability but may raise safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown off a horse and his foot becomes trapped in the saddle, the running horse can pull him back.
First of all, most jockeys wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Then some saddles, especially the English ones, are fitted with safety features which cause the saddle-goals to fall off if they are pulled by the falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley  the most important climbing location in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America and offering a variety of large granite walls and towers.
The spectacular views from the summits continue to be seen as climbers from all over the world make new routes through the walls of the mountain, offering countless possibilities.
Winter sports such as downhill skiing and snowboarding are popular sports that involve skating on snow-covered terrain on foot-mounted skis or snowboards.
Skiing is a staple of travel for many enthusiasts, sometimes called "ski lunatics", who plan their entire skiing vacation at a given location.
Skiing has a very long history - as far back as 5,000 B.C.E. - with figures of skiers painted on cave walls!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861 the Norwegians opened the first recreational ski resort in Australia.
Skiing: This activity is also called cross-country skiing, skitouring or ski tours.
There are some similarities to alpine skiing and climbing, but unlike them, the trail does not run over steep terrain and requires no more solid skiing and boots.
Think of a ski run as a similar hiking trail.
Under favorable conditions, you may be able to cover a little longer distances than you would on foot, but only on rare occasions will you reach running speeds, provided you are without a heavy backpack and have the route properly prepared.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries.Under normal circumstances, travelling through several countries would mean applying for many visas and many passport checks.
In this respect, the Schengen area functions to a certain extent as one country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without having to re-enter the passport control points.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each Schengen country separately, which saves you time and money and reduces formalities.
