In my view, the literature program was shaped by the ladies of the Balzac age based on their interests.
From the 19th century Russian literature, we preferred Danilovsky and Volkonsky.
They wrote fiction, of course, from the perspective of the same ladies of Balzac's age.
And the psychology and torment of Tolstoy and Turgenev's heroines are not so interesting for teenagers.
Teenagers are rarely interested in the psychology of heroes.
Thank you very much, very interesting.

Germany: Fourth coronavirus vaccine is inevitable
The fourth vaccination will be required in the summer or fall of 2022.
According to the expert, the current vaccination in Germany will not be final, but will continue with new force.
Despite an active vaccination campaign in Germany, neither two nor three doses of the coronavirus vaccine will likely be enough to provide complete protection.
The head of the Association of General Practitioners, Ulrich Weigeldt, is convinced of this.
This is reported by Die Welt on Saturday, December 11.
"We expect the fourth vaccination to be in the summer, at the latest in the fall", says the expert.
Weigeldt also hopes that the fourth coronavirus vaccination could be done "in combination with influenza vaccination".
This will help to achieve the best results.
In addition, increased vaccination may help to combat the spread of the new strain of the coronavirus, Omicron.
And the new variant is particularly dangerous.
So, the likelihood of re-infection with Omicron is three times higher than with Delta or Beta strains.
This is evidenced by the results of a preliminary study conducted in South Africa.
Based on this, BioNTech/Pfizer manufacturers plan to provide an Omikron-adapted vaccine by March 2022.
The companies stress that two doses of the vaccine do not provide sufficient protection against infection with the new variant of the coronavirus "Omikron".
A study by BioNTech and Pfizer showed that with two doses of the vaccine, the effectiveness was significantly lower: "the neutralizing potential was reduced by more than 25 times".
"This indicates that two doses of BNT162b2 do not provide sufficient protection against omicron strain infection", BioNTech and Pfizer stressed.
That's why we need a third dose.
Experts are pushing for a faster vaccination rate in the country.
For example, Bernd Salzberger, president of the German Society for Infectious Diseases, advocates shortening the interval between the second and third vaccinations.
Moreover, according to Salzberger, accelerated vaccination will have an impact on the spread of both the delta virus and the omicron variant of the coronavirus.
"The experience of Israel is a very convincing example of this", he said.
The Pontoon 21, the Bet-A Vib, 54 Silent, 54 mm, 8.5 g.
The Bet-A-Vib Series is a special branch of the Bet-A family of Pontoon21®.
It (like the Kalikana Vib series) is different from many other vibes in that it was originally created for underwater fishing, not just for fishing.
These vibes have a greater specific gravity than their similar-sized counterparts, which undoubtedly has a positive effect on the nuances of using these interesting lures.
Another recognizable feature is the upper fin made of durable and flexible plastic, which creates additional vibration shades when wired vertically and horizontally.
As a "winter vibe" when fishing in the pond, Bet-A-Vib is showing a fairly aggressive game.
Often the most catchy is a simple monotonous animation, that is, the up-and-down movement of the stick almost without pauses.
The planing is not too far off the vertical axis, which is convenient for fishing in confined spaces with underwater vegetation, logs and other obstacles that can be trapped.
In addition, a slight deviation is relevant when catching winter pike and great octopus, and especially in mid-winter, when point and aggressive bait is required.
Once at the end of the trajectory, the Bet-A-Vib instantly turns around and returns to its original vertical.
Bet-A-Vib is equally successful in winter fishing for pond trout.
To suit her whims, there are two variants: with a noise capsule (NS  NanoSound) or without (SL  Silent).
It's also been noted that Bet-A-Vib can irritate a passive pike that doesn't even respond to a live one by playing a game of balance.
When it comes to fishing, the Bet-A-Vib is a bit more accurate than the other two.
This is a lightweight, lightweight, and well-fitting woolly, even with large diameter lace and braided cords.
For fishing picked pike, pike, herring or octopus, in addition to the evenly sized "step", sometimes with "chircanning" on the bottom.
If you're fishing in tight spaces, you can swap the front triple for the double, which will reduce the likelihood of being caught.
Bet-A-Vib is among the most stable of its kind, and consequently one of the most subtle.
It can be used with equal success on relatively small and rather deep areas.
All models are equipped with Owner ST-36 hooks.
How many young idlers sit on the necks of old parents.

Libya has 7 thousand Russian mercenaries
There are over 7,000 hired men in Libya for the private military company Wagner.
This was announced on Sunday, December 12, by the chairman of the Republic's Supreme State Council Khaled al-Mishri.
"There are currently over 7,000 Wagner PMCs in Libya.
They have planes.
They also dig trenches in Sirte and Kufra.
They have 30 jet planes at the Ghardabiya airbase (also used as a civilian airport in Sirte) ", - quotes him Anadolu Agency.
Khaled al-Mishri also pointed out that Russian mercenaries are "trying to take over" central Libya, stretching from Chad to the Mediterranean Sea, after "bringing their man to power" in the Central African Republic.
Save the presence
According to the source, Moscow was looking for a country to maintain its presence in North Africa and "located itself in Libya".
Wagner has been in Libya since 2019, using an airbase and port in Sirte, as well as an airbase in Jufra, the agency said.
The Russian authorities officially deny that the Wagner PMC is supported by the Kremlin.
Where else could there be mercenaries?
According to the agency, Wagner is believed to be operating in nine African countries - Central Africa, Libya, Sudan, Mozambique, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Madagascar, Zimbabwe and Angola.
The company provides military training for local forces, personal protection for leaders and protection of energy facilities.
In exchange for these services, Wagner's subsidiaries receive certain privileges and licenses to use minerals and natural resources, as well as to supply weapons, technology and military services to these countries", the article says.
According to the media, the Wagnerites allegedly fought in Donbas, Syria, Mozambique, Sudan and the Central African Republic.
This group is not listed in the law enforcement agencies or the register of legal entities, and its fighters are not on the formal lists of personnel.
This company is under US sanctions.
Earlier, the EU's 27 permanent representatives approved restrictions against Wagner.
The decision is expected to be approved by the Council of the European Union on December 13.
The situation in Libya
The Supreme State Council of Libya is de facto the second chamber of parliament with consultative functions with the Islamists dominating it, TASS reports.
This body has repeatedly called for the single day of voting for the parliamentary and presidential elections to be moved from December 24 to at least February 2022.
"With less than two weeks to go until the election, the chances of it being held on time are rapidly declining", the report said.
The country's top election commission has postponed the announcement of the final list of candidates indefinitely, Sky News Arabia reported.
Foreign policy through the eyes of Russians
38% of Russians see more successes than failures in the country's foreign policy, 29% believe that failures predominate.
"Examples of successes - "in Syria we defended, restored peace there", "the decision on "Nord stream-2", "the whole world was intimidated that cool weaponry", "Crimea we squeezed".
The main failures are "conflict with Ukraine", "confrontation with Western countries", "isolation from the world", according to a study by the Public Opinion Foundation.
The Dubai government has completely abandoned paperwork - all government services have also become digital.
The Dubai government has announced that it will completely abandon paper-based paperwork and switch to digital technology.
All public services will also be provided exclusively electronically.
This is reported by the Emirati news agency WAM.
"Today marks the beginning of a new phase of digitization of all aspects of Dubai's life - we have completed the transition to a fully paperless government", said the emirate's Crown Prince and chairman of the Dubai Executive Council, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, on Saturday.
Now, all internal and external documentation in all government offices in Dubai will be carried out only digitally through special information platforms.
The innovation has affected all sectors without exception: healthcare, housing, police, municipal bodies, courts, etc. Many commercial structures have also joined the government's initiative.
The transition to e-government and the digitization of documentation began in Dubai in 2018.
During this time, authorities estimated that 336 million sheets of paper were saved, which is 14 million man-hours and $353.8 million in cash equivalent.
Earlier, Moscow Mayor Sergey Sobyanin said that electronic services save citizens 2 days a year.

Turkey 's car production and export fell below 2020 levels
Turkey's car production and exports fell sharply in November amid the depreciation of the lira.
As a result, the industry's performance in the last 11 months was worse than last year, Bloomberg reports, citing data from the Turkish Automobile Manufacturers Association.
According to the association, in November, 115,000 cars were produced in Turkey, 20% less than a year earlier.
About 75,900 cars were exported, which is more than 25% less than last year.
And if the first 10 months of this year showed positive growth in the Turkish automotive sector compared to last year, then in the 11 months of 2021, the production of cars was already 0.3% worse than last year.
The reason for this drop was the sharp weakening of the Turkish lira, which in November was 29% cheaper compared to the dollar.
This has led to a drop in economic activity in all sectors.
More than 500 SMEs received credit payments in 2021
First Deputy Prime Minister Alihan Smailov spoke about the situation regarding the provision of benefits for small and medium businesses, the correspondent of the MIA "Kazinform" reports.
"According to the information of the Agency for Regulation and Development of the Financial Market of the Republic of Kazakhstan, in the current year, in fulfillment of the instructions of the Head of State dated April 1, 2021, the order of the Chairman of the Agency dated April 9, 2021 No. 127 "About approval of the Procedure for granting deferral of payments on loans of small and medium-sized businesses" was adopted, - Alihan Smailov wrote in his answer to the deputy request.
He recalled that the procedure for granting deferral of payments on loans provided for the granting of deferral of payments by banks and organizations engaged in microfinance activities on loans issued to SME subjects, including IPs, until April 1, 2021, in the period from April 1 to June 30, 2021.
The delay was 30 to 90 days, depending on the SME's choice.
The borrower's application could have indicated another deferral period.
During the deferral period, the claim-claim work, the notification of the need to pay off the overdue debt, as well as the collection of commissions and other payments by the creditor were suspended", the deputy prime minister noted.
In 2021, 603 SME borrowers submitted applications to second-level banks for deferral of payments on loans, of which 553 SME subjects received deferral of payments in the amount of 9.7 billion tenge.
131 SMEs submitted applications to the MFO for a deferral, of which 95 were granted a deferral of 105.8 million tenge", A. Smailov concluded.
Pulmonologist Puryasov suggested that people with weak immune systems could easily carry the okmiron strain.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems could tolerate it more easily than those with strong immune responses
Pulmonologist Sergey Puryasov explained why the "okmiron" strain of coronavirus can be dangerous.
The reason is to look at the conditions of the virus.
Scientists believe that the oxymoron originated in the body of an HIV-infected or immunodeficient person.
So, with the mutation, he didn't encounter any resistance from the immune system.
It makes him more aggressive.
Because of the lack of immune response, he became very fast.
Apparently, there are more spike proteins, spines, and their antibodies have not been cut during mutations", says pulmonologist Sergey Puryasov.
The doctor suggested that people with weakened immune systems might tolerate oxymoron more easily than those with strong immune responses.
Turns out, a strong response to anything, any infection, is not always good.
In such cases, the body may kill itself.
This is what happens with pneumococcal infections, where young people die in their 30s, and old people in their 60s sneeze.
The young man's immune response is furious, it is completely inadequate: where you could only threaten with a finger, he hits like a cannon on sparrows, - concluded Sergey Puryasov.
The doctor also reminded that the coronavirus has dangerous side effects, the most unpleasant of which is pneumonia.
Pneumonia can be bacterial or viral.
If the former is treated very successfully and quickly, the latter often can only cure the symptoms - the body's only hope.
The first signs of developing pneumonia are the onset of intoxication - fever, weakness, nausea.
Then there are respiratory symptoms: shortness of breath, a runny throat, cough.
Pain on the right or left, abdominal pain, can also indicate a developing problem.
Meanwhile, Russia could begin vaccinating the younger generation of 12 to 18 years of age before the end of the year.
Virologist, head of the Genomic Engineering Laboratory of the Moscow Institute of Technology Pavel Volchkov noted that this category is very actively suffering from Covid.
Teenagers who go to school have the most contacts.
This is the most socially active group, as are the children of kindergartens", said Pavel Volchkov, a virologist, head of the Genome Engineering Laboratory at the Moscow Institute of Technology.
A huge thank you to the author for this article.
I'd love to refresh your memory...
Teath-In.
In the late '70s and '80s, no dance floor was without the music of this band.
And at home, when we got together with friends, we danced to their music.
Immunologists have proposed a hypothesis about why people with obesity become victims of COVID.
The authors of the paper studied fat tissue left over from bariatric surgery and found that fat cells, known as adipocytes, can become infected with the coronavirus.
The immune cells in the fat tissue, the macrophages, were also infected, and they showed a strong inflammatory response.
Scientists also examined the fat tissue of patients who died of COVID and found particles of the coronavirus in the fat surrounding various organs.
It's known that HIV and influenza viruses can hide in fat tissue, using it as a reservoir, in an attempt to evade the immune system's response.
Perhaps SARS-CoV-2 is capable of doing the same.
Biologist tells about the causes of dementia
Biology candidate Semen Golosheikin gave an interview with Sputnik radio about the causes of dementia and ways to prevent it.
According to the WHO, more than 55 million people suffer from this disease.
The syndrome is characterized by a gradual loss of cognitive function - with time, the person has difficulty navigating even in familiar surroundings.
Golosheikin noted that most often dementia is caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and a lack of certain vitamins.
Some factors increase the risk of developing the disease.
These include high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, obesity, depression, and alcoholism.
At the behavioral level, factors such as social isolation and lack of active cognitive activity may play a role", he said.
Bad habits, such as smoking, alcohol abuse, poor sleep, and sedentary lifestyles, also contribute to dementia.
Among the first signs, the expert noted forgetfulness, inability to concentrate, and a decrease in abstract thinking.
"There is a debate that hearing loss may be both an early sign of Alzheimer's disease and a risk factor for it", he added.
To prevent the disease, the WHO recommends maintaining the necessary level of physical activity, training cognitive skills and abilities that require memory and logic.
Previously, he was a professor of neurology, neurosurgery and medical genetics at the RNIMU.
N.I. Pirogova, head of the cognitive disorders department of the Federal Center for Brain and Neurotechnology Anna Bogolepova spoke about the causes of memory problems.
Egypt returns about 30,000 artifacts illegally taken out of the country
Over the past 10 years, the Cairo government has managed to bring back some 30,000 artifacts that were smuggled out of the country.
This was reported on Saturday, December 11, in the broadcast of Al-Hayat television channel by the chief inspector of the Department of Returned Antiquities of the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities of Egypt Shaaban Abdel Gaoud.
Since 2011, the Egyptian state has managed to recover 29,300 artifacts.
This year alone, 5,300 ancient Egyptian artifacts have been discovered at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, D.C"., he said.
Abdel Gauad said all the artifacts smuggled out were registered in the archives.
Now, the department is working on getting them back to Egypt.
In particular, experts "monitor auctions around the world and online sales" through foreign and Egyptian websites, as well as social media.
The chief inspector said that the cultural treasures will be restored and then put on display in museums.
He said one of the returned artifacts was an ancient human skeleton found in Belgium, which is now part of the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Cairo.
In 2020, Egyptian authorities asked Interpol for help in finding a bust of Pharaoh Tutankhamun that was sold at auction in London.
Christie's auction house held an auction on July 4 where the over 3 thousand-year-old bust was sold for $5.97 million (about 680 million rubles).
This caused displeasure on the part of Egypt.
The Egyptian side also claims that the artwork was illegally removed in the 1970s from the Karnak temple in Luxor.
The head of Tutankhamun, depicted as the sun god Amun, was kept in a private collection and has not been on sale since 1985.
How the relic reached Europe is unknown.
Egypt has been actively seeking to repatriate antiquities illegally taken out of the country at various times.
According to authorities, 95% of the smuggled antiquities are the result of archaeological searches by "black diggers".
"Crimean Tatars are not taken into account" - and that is correct, because Crimean Tatars (232 thousand) are an independent people (close to the Turks).
If you want to add, only 42 thousand people - that many Tatars (Kazan) live in Crimea (see census).
Crimean Tatars are a separate people, and the name of this people consists of two words!
They are united only by the Turkic language group.
FT: Credit Suisse wants access to personal mobile devices of employees
Credit Suisse is requiring its employees to give the bank access to their personal mobile devices, reports the Financial Times.
The fact is that in Europe and the US, a Swiss bank does not give out corporate communication devices to its employees, instead offering a discount on the purchase of a mobile phone or smartphone from a partner telecommunications operator.
Under current rules, banks can view information on corporate devices issued to their employees, as these are used to resolve business matters with colleagues or customers.
The bank has the right to check mobile devices in extreme cases - for example, if an employee used it to hold a meeting with a customer that was not approved by Credit Suisse.
Now that many employees have moved to remote work, the bank wants to extend this rule to all devices that were used to handle work issues.
According to the newspaper, the bank's management has set a deadline for employees to get acquainted with the new rule.
Credit Suisse has not officially commented on the new requirement.

Part four
The last year of Sergey Yessenin's life - 1925 - was fruitful in terms of his work, but it was a difficult one for the poet and his ego.
He's out of any literary circles, he's dissolved with imagination, he's on his own, but he's popular, he's in demand, he's sometimes harshly criticized, even spitefully, but the reading public is ready to carry him around.
Over the year, more than 60 poems were written, many of them are real masterpieces, the cycle "Persian motifs" was completed, the poem "Anna Snegina" was written, 8 books were published, the collection "Russian Soviet".
And the main success - at the end of June 25th, the State Council signed a contract with Yessenin to publish his works in 3 volumes.
None of the contemporary poets of Sergei Alexandrovich has been given such an honor, he is the first!
Besides, it promised very good money - according to the contract, the fee was 1000 rubles per month for 20 months (the director of the plant, for example, received 300 rubles per month, the engineer - 200).
The funds were needed that year as never before.
Yesenin married Leo Tolstoy's granddaughter, Sofia Tolstoy, and had to provide for his family, including his sisters Katya and Sasha, and his mother.
It seemed that life was getting better, there was something to rejoice about, but for him everything was mostly painted in dark tones, as if the nightmare from the poem "Black Man" (written in November 1925 and published after the death of Yesenin) materialized:
My friend, my friend,
I'm very, very sick. I'm not going to be able to get out of here.
I don't know where the pain came from.
♪ Is the wind whistling ♪
Over the empty and desolate field,
♪ Like I grow in September ♪
Alcohol is filling your brain.
Many of his acquaintances said that Yesenin was very badly failed, badly looked, clearly ill.
There's a growing trend of hangovers, of nervous breakdowns.
And the reason is probably not just alcoholism...
However, if someone diagnosed Sergei with alcoholism, there are no reliable documents.
Let's say, dating back to May 1923, when Yesenin was recovering at the insistence of his fourth wife, American Aysedora Duncan, in a clinic near Paris with Professor Peter Gannushkin (Yesenin would return to him two years later, in Moscow).
But there are plenty of testimonies of the poet's drinking, scandals on this ground, police arrests - scattered in dozens of memoirs.
From the early 20s, the poet's horror novel with the green snake developed rapidly.
In the late summer of 1923, Yesenin settled for a short time with a friend, the imaginist Ivan Startsov.
Surprisingly, despite his very good income, Yesenin never had a place of his own in Moscow or St. Petersburg, he lived in rented apartments, hotels or with friends.
The elderly man recalls:
"He only came in for the night, and most of the time he was drunk and insane.
One day, returning home at four in the morning, Yesenin fell down the stairs...
He fell, scratched his face and snorted.
When he regained consciousness, he began to cough incessantly, splashing blood all over the sheet . . . "
Yes, Yesenin himself, after traveling in Europe and the United States (the United States was a dry law country at the time, but Duncan had brought along a decent supply of alcohol), admitted:
"I saw nothing but the cafes and the streets...
I'm getting tired of people.
Well, and drinking, of course...
I drank because I was bored".

Poland's Foreign Ministry says Belarus is using migrants as a weapon against the EU
Poland's Foreign Ministry believes Belarus is using migrants as a "weapon"
Poland's deputy foreign minister, Pavel Jablonski, said Belarus' president, Alexander Lukashenko, had used refugees as a "weapon" against the European Union and intended to return to such an "operation" next year.
The Deputy Foreign Minister made the relevant statement in an interview with the Australian Financial Review.
According to Yablonski, sanctions against Belarus temporarily "ceased Lukashenko", but he "is actively looking for new ways".
The Polish official also said that illegal migrants will now be used as weapons "in many parts of the world".
As the kp.ru website wrote, the European Union has already imposed a fifth set of sanctions against Belarus.
It affected 17 individuals and 11 organizations.
Europe has said it is ready to further expand restrictive measures against the republic "if the situation in the country does not improve".
Minsk in response imposed a food embargo on a wide range of goods from countries that had previously decided to impose sanctions against Belarus.

"Not in the Shadow of the Hat": when a velvet jacket makes a man look ridiculous
The 2021 secular events were dominated by velvet jackets.
Perhaps the first to announce his new fashion solution was Daniel Craig.
Back in September, at the premiere of the film "No Time to Die", he appeared in a velvet purple jacket and a traditional "Bond" butterfly.
His example was followed twice by Prince William, who first wore a green velvet jacket at the Earthshot Prize award ceremony that did not conform to the royal dress code, and then chose a more classic version for the event in support of the Royal Variety charity.
A couple of weeks ago, Lionel Messi was on the trend.
The footballer came to collect the seventh "Golden Ball" in a velvet jacket Dolce & Gabbana.
By the way, his sons were wearing the same.
AliExpress is already seeing a growing demand for velvet men's jackets in Russia.
According to analysts of the service, which was received by "Gazeta.Ru", they began to be bought 1.4 times more often.
The most popular are warm velvet jackets with a drawn silhouette, the main colors are dark beige, burgundy, dark blue and, of course, black.
The average price of such models is from 3 to 6 thousand rubles. At the same time, men prefer to buy only jackets - they rarely choose sets of velvet suits.
You can't just buy them at online retailers.
Budget options are available at H&M, Mango, Next and Zara.
In the luxury segment, velvet jackets are represented in almost all brands this season - Brioni, Paul Smith, Etro, and Saint Laurent.
The most desirable model is the Gucci model, in which the brand ambassador Jared Leto appeared at one of the premieres of the film "House of Gucci".
When choosing expensive brands, you can be sure that the velvet is made of silk.
The special technology of weaving threads produces a dense fabric with a woolly outer texture and a smooth inner side.
The more budget-friendly options are made of cotton or polyamide, but they also serve less.
Lamoda fashion expert Ilya Vakhoshkin warns that in the case of a velvet jacket, the key is not its style or style, but its appropriateness.
"The velvet requires evening light, so it's ideal if you're going to a party or a celebration", explains Vakhoshkin.
Another important criterion for choosing a velvet jacket is the status of the buyer.
"A man in a velvet jacket should first get a proper, advanced, and well-off party", say the authors of the Telegram channel for men's fashion "Brammell the Handsome".
They are simply invited to secular events, where the dress code is always stated.
Ilya Vakhoshkin suggests combining a velvet jacket with the same elegant things: classic pants with arrows, single-tone shirts, silk ties, lofters with brushes, buckles.
Too simple and mundane things will seem inappropriate.
Fashion experts at Brummell's Pretty Boy say it's inappropriate for a corporate employee to wear a velvet jacket, but if it's "a leader among those who run the event, yes, he has that thing".
If the employee is a lower-ranking employee who wants to move up the company's complex hierarchy or to get a financial bonus, it is best not to wear a velvet jacket.
The management will definitely rate it with the phrase "not in the Shade of the hat", - the editors of the Telegram channel about men's fashion believe.
Very ambiguous voice sensations.
It's an unnatural tone, it's so draining.
And it's not at all associated with the pretty face of a young girl.
I don't know what the admiration is.
But I wish you all the best with your life.
It's all about money -- alternative energy is well lobbied, so it pays off.
Billions of dollars of investment.
Are they sad?
No, the price of electricity has gone up.
Traditional energy is also out of the question -- gas, oil, and coal were bought cheaper than they are sold.
Fuel is in high demand.
The penny's dripping.
Who's in the air?
As usual, a regular buyer.
Does the sheriff care about the Indians?
So we should not think of Western politicians as idiots who have "slept through" the energy crisis.
They did their job.
For a good wage.
I didn't see any handsome people in the pictures in the article.
Just mediocrity in the middle of the average passenger.
Maybe if these characters are so sure of their beauty that they decide to show it to the whole train, they're not going to get in.
But only because of the mental disorder and ignorance of these "pretty people", but certainly not because of their appearance.
Kazbek, "a slave who is aware of his slave position and fights against it is a revolutionary.
A slave who is not conscious of his slavery and who languishes in a silent, unconscious and wordless slave life is simply a slave.
A slave who drools when he complacently describes the delights of slave life and admires a good and kind master is a holop, ham".
An immunologist says revaccination in 4-5 months will help protect against the Omicron strain of coronavirus.
Revaccination in four to five months can protect against the new strain of coronavirus infection, Omicron.
This was stated by immunologist Nikolai Kryuchkov, who called vaccination six months later, given the emergence of a new strain, "a very long period".
"In the past, this was normal, but now it's best to have the procedure after five months, and for people with chronic diseases, after four", the expert said, urging people to revaccinate alongside the vaccination campaign.
Kryuchkov also noted that early revaccination provides a good titer of neutralizing antibodies.
"If a person has been given two vaccines and a booster, or if he is sick and vaccinated, or if he is vaccinated and sick, he has received a 'hybrid immunity,' that is, antibodies are many and neutralizing enough", the expert said.
G7 warns Russia of "massive consequences" if it invades Ukraine
The G7 countries (UK, Germany, Italy, Canada, USA, France and Japan) have issued a statement following the meeting of foreign ministers in Liverpool.
It stresses that Russia's "military aggression" against Ukraine "will have enormous consequences and cost" Moscow, but does not describe specific measures.
"We, the foreign ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States of America and the High Representative of the European Union, are united in our condemnation of Russia's buildup of military power and aggressive rhetoric towards Ukraine", the statement said.
The ministers further urged Russia to "de-escalate, use diplomatic channels and abide by its international obligations regarding military transparency", as US President Biden said during a video call with Russian President Vladimir Putin on December 7.
"We reaffirm our support for the efforts of France and Germany in the Normandy format to achieve full implementation of the Minsk agreements to resolve the conflict in eastern Ukraine", the G7 foreign ministers said.
Any use of force to alter borders is strictly prohibited by international law.
Russia should not doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have huge consequences and a serious price to pay in return", they warn.
We reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, as well as the right of any sovereign state to determine its own future.
We welcome the restrained stance of Ukraine.
We will intensify our cooperation on our common and comprehensive response", the statement also said.
Earlier in the day, British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss said Russia would face "serious consequences" if it invaded Ukraine.
According to her, the meeting showed "the united voice of the G7 countries, which account for 50% of world GDP, and which made it very clear that the invasion of Ukraine would have huge consequences for Russia".
Pfizer 's vaccine was 32 times less effective than Omicron .
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus is 32 times lower than that of other strains of the disease.
The researchers from the University of Hong Kong and the Chinese University of Hong Kong came to this conclusion, reports the South China Morning Post (SCMP).
The vaccine was found to be less effective based on a study of antiviral activity in citizens who received two doses of the COVID-19 drug.
"We see that most people had high levels of antiviral activity against the original Sars-CoV-2 variant, but this ability was significantly reduced against the omicron variant", Professor Malik Peiris said.
At the same time, the scientists stressed that vaccination remains the most reliable way to protect against the severe course of the disease when infected with coronavirus.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted the development of the coronavirus pandemic based on the omicron strain.
The authors concluded that the omicron strain could cause a new wave of virus circulation and increased mortality if no additional measures are taken.
The head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry accused Germany of blocking NATO arms supplies to Kiev
The head of the Ukrainian Defense Ministry, Alexey Reznikov, accused the government of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel of blocking Kiev's purchase of lethal weapons within NATO.
In an interview with the Financial Times on December 12, Reznikov recalled that last month Germany vetoed Ukraine's purchase of anti-sniper systems and anti-drone rifles.
It is noted that Berlin later softened its position regarding rifles, recognizing them as non-lethal weapons.
According to the defense minister, Kiev intends to acquire the above weapons as part of bilateral agreements with allies.
In particular, the United States, the United Kingdom, Lithuania and France.
Meanwhile, the FT notes that the position of the new German government under Chancellor Olaf Scholz on allowing arms supplies to Ukraine remains unclear.
Earlier on Sunday, Ukraine's ambassador to Germany, Andrei Melnik, expressed the opinion that Kiev should not expect weapons supplies from Berlin under Chancellor Scholz.
According to him, the previous leadership of Germany explained its refusal to provide weapons with the risk of military escalation of the conflict in the Donbas, despite the "occupation by Russia" of part of the Ukrainian territory.
The same "illogical" position, the diplomat is sure, Germany will maintain under the new chancellor.
In August, Ukrainian leader Vladimir Zelensky said Kiev expected help from Berlin to equip the navy.
In Ukraine, Germany is expected to "be a partner of Ukraine in a technical sense", the president added.
It was also noted that in the spring of this year, the co-chairman of the "green" party of Germany Robert Habek visited the republic, where he spoke in favor of selling defensive weapons to Kiev.

G7 warns Russia of responsibility for invasion of Ukraine
G7 foreign ministers warned of "serious consequences" for Russia if it continues its military aggression against Ukraine, according to a final statement.
The meeting participants also condemned the strengthening of Russian armed forces at the country's borders.
"Russia should have no doubt that further military aggression against Ukraine will have serious consequences and serious costs", the statement said, posted on the UK government website.
The G7 ministers and the EU's top representative noted that they were "united in their condemnation of Russia's armed buildup and aggressive rhetoric against Ukraine".
British Foreign Secretary Elizabeth Truss warned at a press conference in Liverpool of "big consequences" for Russia if it invaded Ukraine.
We've made it clear that any invasion will have significant consequences...
The G7 wants Russia to abandon aggression against Ukraine", she said (quoted by TASS).
Earlier at a summit in Liverpool, G7 foreign ministers agreed that the parties should return to the negotiating table to resolve the crisis over the Russian buildup on the border with Ukraine.
It was about negotiations in the Normandy format.
The North Atlantic Alliance also supported a dialogue on Ukraine in the "Norman format".
Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said that by calling on Russia and Ukraine to return to the negotiating table, the G7 countries "signed off in their inability to take responsibility for their own mistakes".

How to return stolen money from online stores
There are several ways to recover money stolen from online stores and avoid becoming a victim of fraud in the future.
They were revealed by information security experts in an interview with RBC.
For example, to reduce the risk of large losses when bank card data falls into the hands of criminals, it is recommended to keep the principal funds on the card or bank account that are not used for online shopping.
Some savings can be put into a savings account and withdrawn as needed.
Experts also recommend that you have a separate card for online shopping.
If money was stolen from a store that doesn't use 3D Secure security, you can start a refund process.
"In accordance with the rules established by payment systems, for unauthorized transactions carried out without using 3D Secure, the responsibility lies with the participant in the chain of payments who does not use this service", the representative of the Promsvyazbank said.
Ecommpay's expert Arthur Zaremba stressed that the buyer has the right to file a claim with the bank to challenge the fraudulent transaction no later than 120 days after the purchase.
In addition, if a criminal used the card on online resources that do not require two-factor authentication, the transaction can be contested and the money returned.
It is noted that in some cases, online stores themselves refund the customer if the order has not yet been sent for delivery.
On November 19, a member of the Public Chamber, the director of the League of Safe Internet Ekaterina Mizulina reported that in 2021 alone, 11 thousand applications were received for various cases of fraud: from the sale of fake documents to theft of personal data.
She said a solution to the current situation could be to create a single window for complaints about online fraud.
Scholz arrived in Poland to discuss Nord Stream 2 and EU legislation.
Germany's newly elected chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Warsaw for talks on the migrant crisis at the Belarus border, the independence of the judiciary in Poland, the buildup of Russian troops near Ukraine's borders and the situation with Russia's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline.
Although Scholz had stated his desire to maintain good relations between Germany and Poland for many years, the leaders of the two countries expressed unequivocal expectations of each other.
Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said he would urge Scholz to oppose Nord Stream 2, which is supposed to deliver Russian gas to Germany bypassing Ukraine.
According to Morawiecki, Russia may use the gas pipeline against Europe as a means of political pressure.
In turn, Germany supported Poland's efforts to stop the flow of migrants trying to reach the country from Belarus.
Berlin has said it will help Warsaw and Brussels to resolve this crisis.
The Polish judicial system, however, remains one of the causes of disagreement.
The European Court of Justice fined Poland, finding that the judicial reforms carried out by the right-wing Law and Justice party violated EU law.
Poland refused to pay the fine, and its highest court ruled that national law takes precedence over EU rules.
Germany's new government, sworn in on Wednesday despite demands from Poland and the United States, has not made a public commitment to stop Nord Stream 2 if Russia invades Ukraine.
U.S. officials have told members of Congress that they have reached an understanding with Germany to halt the pipeline if Russia invades Ukraine, a senior U.S. congressional official said Tuesday.
German officials did not confirm the reports, but Scholz warned on Wednesday of the consequences if Russia violated Ukraine's border, and this position was confirmed on Sunday by G7 officials.
Dmitry, look more closely.
The view from the window is the same, the size of the window hasn't changed.
We removed the wall between the kitchen and the bedroom, so you can see the second window partially.
And it's not for those who don't know the initial planning.
I know these apartments very well and I can see how they've been redesigned.
Let's make sure they're okay.
It's always surprising when they write about the means to wash the sink, the toilet, the windowsill, the faucets.
You wash them once a year at Easter, or whatever, which means you have to wash them straight.
Just don't let it get contaminated.
The Ministry of Digital wants to give writers residencies

The draft decree stipulates that the Foundation's charter should state that it is "created to promote literary activity by creating the necessary conditions for the creative work of literary writers".
"Creating conditions for creative activity" means creating a writer's residence in different regions of Russia, which would have comfortable conditions for creativity", the Ministry of Digital Affairs explained to our publication.

Doctors warn of the dangers of long-term use of blood thinners after COVID-19 and before vaccination
Doctors Irina Yartsova and Sergey Tokarev warned of the dangers of uncontrolled use of blood thinners after contracting COVID-19 and before vaccination against the coronavirus.
Therapist, immunologist Irina Yartsova said that self-prevention of possible blood clots after COVID-19 can provoke a stroke.
Yartsova explained that blood thinners are not for everyone, only if the patient has been hospitalized, has been in a hospital, has had complications.
The doctor will prescribe blood thinners (medicines that prevent blood clots from forming) as directed.
She said that she was experiencing a dark frenzy - people were drinking anticoagulants for long periods of time and were getting complications in the form of hemorrhagic strokes (bleeding into the brain).
The chief prophylactologist of the Urfa, the scientific director of the Society of specialists in preventive medicine, Dr. Sergey Tokarev told URA.RU that Russians often use anticoagulants before vaccination against coronavirus infection.
According to Dr. Tokarev, citizens are trusting questionable advice on the Internet and are starting to self-medicate.
There are people who decide to start taking anticoagulants a week before vaccination.
And when they check you before you get the shot, they notice some bleeding.
He stressed that it is extremely dangerous to take any medication without knowing the cause of any symptom.

The plumber who finds the money in the church wall will get $20,000 .
A plumber who found money in a church wall in Texas will be rewarded.
This is reported in a press release by the non-profit organization Crime Stoppers of Houston.
The incident took place at a large Lakewood Evangelical church where Pastor Joel Austin preaches a message of prosperity and wealth for devout Christians.
In November 2021, plumber Justin Coley was repairing one of the church toilets and found thousands of bags of money and checks under the insulation.
He handed the find to the church and, he said, he didn't even get a thank you from Austin.
"I wanted to hear him say, 'You know, Justin, you did the right thing.
We understand what you have done and what you could have done", he was quoted as saying by KPRC-TV.
Looks like the find is connected to a theft that happened at Lakewood Church seven years ago.
About $200,000 in cash and $400,000 in checks were stolen from a church safe.
The money was insured, so the church was spared.
Nevertheless, a reward of $25,000 was offered for information about the perpetrators.
Justin Coley was not eligible for the award because the award had expired.
Despite this, the nonprofit Crime Stoppers of Houston, which had previously offered a $5,000 reward and later received a $20,000 donation from the Lakewood Church, decided to reward the plumber's honesty.
He's going to get $20,000.
Earlier, it was reported that police were questioning Pastor Joel Austin about the money found in the wall of Lakewood Church.

A new case of bird flu in humans has been reported in China
A new case of human infection with the highly pathogenic H5N6 bird flu virus has been reported in China.
This was reported by the radio station RTHK, citing a notification from the Hong Kong health authorities, TASS reports.
The infection was found in a 68-year-old man from Hueizhou City District in southern Guangdong Province who kept a poultry.
His condition is considered critical by the medical staff.
The world's first human infection with the H5N6 strain was reported in May 2014 in the southwestern province of Sichuan.
Since then, the number of such cases in the country has reached 53.
Brazil has made it mandatory for citizens to show vaccination passports when entering the country
Brazil has mandated the requirement of a Covid passport for those entering the country, according to a decision by Brazilian Federal Supreme Court (STF) judge Luis Roberto Barroso.
This is reported by CNN Brasil.
Citizens who have contraindications to vaccination are exempt from the requirement to present a certificate of vaccination.
The list of exemptions also includes those who have come from countries where there is no proven vaccine.
"The situation is even more serious when we consider that Brazil is a popular tourist destination for New Year's, pre-carnival and carnival parties, as well as other events, which implies an increase in tourist flow", said Barroso.
Earlier, Brazilian authorities imposed a five-day quarantine on unvaccinated tourists.
The full protection scheme against COVID-19 revealed
Virologist, doctor of medical sciences, honored Russian scientist Anatoly Altstein in an interview with Ura.ru revealed the scheme of complete protection against coronavirus infection.
He said this can be achieved by injecting and using a nasal vaccine.
When administered internally, large amounts of immunoglobulin A are produced.
Immunoglobulin A protects the mucous membrane, so the virus can't get into the body.
And inside, after vaccination, you have the most immunoglobulin Gs.
And if you give both vaccines, you get a lot of immunoglobulins A and G. But there's no solution for double vaccination yet", he said.
The chief prophylactologist of the UrFO, Dr. Sergey Tokarev, in turn, stated that the main advantage of using nasal vaccination together with injection is the ability to stop being a carrier of COVID-19.
He added that this would help because the body's defenses would then supposedly be maximized.
Earlier, the Minister of Health of the Nizhny Novgorod region David Melik-Huseynov said that the spread of a new coronavirus infection among children will lead to a new surge of the COVID-19 pandemic.
He said that this is the picture in other countries where the next wave of the pandemic has come earlier.

I used to say to a mare, who's long dead, if you're willing to trade a warm home, a feeding tube, affection, love and games for a liquid bitch, go ahead.
But Pesel was educated and smart.
I chose my company and I went home.
Video is a method that works 90% of the time.
It's not from the ceiling, believe me.
I stopped a lot of owners from running after their dogs, even though they were saying, "Wow, 200,000 are running away", and I just grabbed their hand and led them the other way.
The result was that the 200,000 chose the owner, not the dog that was running around.
Europe is still experiencing mass protests against vaccination
More than 40,000 demonstrators took to the streets in the Austrian capital Vienna.
They expressed dissatisfaction with restrictive measures and the authorities' plans to make COVID-19 vaccination mandatory.
From February next year, unvaccinated people will have to pay a fine of 3,600 euros.
Spanish people, outraged by the healthcare policies of the authorities, held a peaceful march in Madrid.
Some held signs that said, "This is a fake pandemic", "I won't get vaccinated".
A major protest against sanitary passports took place in Barcelona, the capital of Catalonia.
In the Autonomous Community, a Covid certificate is mandatory for access to bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightclubs.
The decision to introduce sanitary passports was made by the authorities of a number of regions of the country in the wake of the increase in the number of coronavirus cases.
In Luxembourg, more than a thousand demonstrators protested against the tightening of restrictions and QR codes.
The action began peacefully, but then escalated into clashes with the security forces.
A group of protesters began throwing stones at the police.
Law enforcement responded with water cannons.
Nikolai S., even Wikipedia doesn't have a consensus on this.
Kashevarova-Rudneva is also designated as "the first Russian doctor, doctor of medicine", probably because she started to study earlier.

I agree with Zakharova on one thing: Americans have brought nothing but death and looting to any country wherever they have appeared.

WHO has detected Omicron in over 60 countries
The World Health Organization (WHO) said that the new strain of the coronavirus "Omicron" has been detected in 63 countries.
Some experts are already saying that the spread of the new strain could have catastrophic consequences.
The WHO said the strain was spreading at a rate of about 2 percent.
According to the organization, as of December 9, the strain has been detected in 63 countries, in all six WHO regions.
That's despite the fact that it only started spreading in late November.
The WHO also expresses concern about the high rate of spread of the new variant of coronavirus.
WHO experts fear that the new strain may outperform the Delta strain, the Indian variant of the coronavirus, which is now leading in all countries without exception.
Earlier, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that the omicron strain could have a significant impact on the course of the coronavirus pandemic.
Similar findings were made in the United Kingdom.
Experts at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) believe that Omicron will displace Delta in the coming months.
And the number of cases in Britain alone is expected to be around 1 million, despite the fact that the official count of Omicron cases in the UK is now several hundred, and estimates put it at up to 10,000.
British experts predict tens of thousands of deaths from the Omicron strain, and at peak, more than 2,000 people will be taken to hospitals daily.
Which the British healthcare system will be unable to handle.
The situation is complicated by the fact that according to recent studies, the effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against the Omicron strain is 32 times lower than that of other strains of the disease.
How the Russian Sputnik V will react to Omicron is unknown, but will become clear in the coming weeks.
The Gamalaia Center has just begun testing the Russian vaccine on the Omicron strain.

And once again, the Soviet time is called "the time of demons".
People believed in God then, and they were much more honest than they are today.
And they were raised practically according to God's laws (love of neighbor, do not steal, etc.).

Boltones like the Globe of Faith have little (or no) faith, but even if they do, the time for demons is the '90s...

Russians warned about a new scam
The attackers began to look for new ways to cheat on video messages.
This is reported by Izvestia, citing experts.
According to Zaura Abutalyov, product director at Ivideon, the main danger that is associated with the spread of video communication means is dipfake.
In this case, the fraudsters create a fake video based on real footage of the victim.
This enables the neural network to accurately replicate the behavior of a particular person.
Abutalyov added that using dipfake, attackers can call victims' acquaintances via video link or create a video with a copy of the person to be sent for blackmail.
"Such fakes can easily provoke bullying, as a sophisticated attacker can put people in ridiculous, dangerous or compromising pseudo-scenarios", said the expert.
Varonis's lead systems engineer, Alexander Vetkol, noted that psychologically, people trust others more when they see them.
He stressed that this could create specific risks when it comes to video technologies.
David, I'll add to that.
In what I wrote above, I emphasized that I bought all this in a small town where the local mentality didn't allow for too much makeup and wearing short skirts, showing stockings and tights on your legs.

That's what Dushanbe is like, it's a big city, the capital of the republic.
There's a lot of fashions, but no makeup.

Dr. Pavlova told about "weekend migraines" in workaholics
Several factors can cause a decline in well-being during the weekend .
The reason for the deterioration of well-being after working days is often "migraine of the weekend", said the well-known doctor-endocrinologist, candidate of medical sciences, senior research fellow of the faculty of fundamental medicine of Moscow State University, scientific director of the clinic of systemic medicine Zuhra Pavlova in his telegram-channel.
She says that this is especially common among workaholics, who experience headaches, crushes, and weakness on the weekends.
Dr. Pavlova noted that in addition to the fatigue accumulated during the week, there are many objective reasons for the body's negative reaction to changing conditions.
Our lives change dramatically on the weekends.
"We sleep a lot, we lie on the couch all day, we probably eat more and drink less", the doctor argued.
"Over-eating and lack of water make you heavy and frail".
A late rise also plays a role.
So if you get up three hours later than usual, you have a reaction called jetlag.
It occurs in travelers who cross several time zones.
To determine which factors play a decisive role in the deterioration of well-being, Pavlova recommended tracking what changes the most during the weekend.

South African scientists say Pfizer's Omicron vaccine is not effective
South Africa says Pfizer's vaccine against Omicron is not effective
Scientists in South Africa conducted a study and reported low efficacy of the Pfizer vaccine against the omicron strain of coronavirus infection.
It is estimated to be equivalent to the 22.5% effectiveness of the vaccine against symptomatic infections, which... casts doubt on the vaccine's ability to protect against infection, according to a study published on MedRxiv.
The doctors said the drug could save the patient from a severe illness.
Earlier, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine predicted that the omicron strain of coronavirus could trigger a new wave of the pandemic in the UK with more frequent hospitalizations than a year ago.
How much sugar is hidden in the usual foods?
Sugar is not the best source of nutrients.
Excess of it in the diet can lead to type 2 diabetes, as well as cardiovascular and cancer diseases.
Consumers should be aware that under an unfamiliar word in the product may be hidden sugar - an ingredient similar to sugar in calories, composition and glycemic index.
The label may have dozens of names that actually refer to sugar.
One of the most common and common names is glucose and fructose.
There may also be other hidden sugars, such as dextrose (a sugar obtained from corn), levulose (fruit sugar), molasses (black sugar), agave syrup, and so on.
These are all simple carbohydrates that are mono- and disaccharides, and they can be in not only candy, but also ketchup, doctor's sausage, bread, and so on.
The most effective way to reduce sugar intake, says the Food and Drug Administration, is to eat whole and unprocessed foods and to pay attention to the label and the many different names of sugar.
Sugar tastes differently, but whatever the ingredient in the product - syrup or nectar, processed or unprocessed, brown or white - it is still sugar.
It is not easy to calculate the exact amount of sugar, since not only the amount of sugar listed on the packaging but also the amount of sugar in the vegetables, fruits, and other foods must be taken into account.
So the total amount of sugar may be significantly higher than what's on the label.
German Chancellor Scholz: Gas will lose its importance in 25 years
The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said that gas imports were losing importance for Germany as the country continued to decarbonise its economy.
According to him, Germany plans to completely abandon gas, oil and coal by 2045 and become a climate neutral country.
"That is, in 25 years the world will be such that the question of gas transportation to Germany and Europe will play a different role", the chancellor said.
Scholz noted that Germany continues to maintain its commitment to Ukraine transporting Russian natural gas in the future, as at the moment this resource is of great importance for the energy transition.
He recalled that Germany and the United States made a statement in which Berlin's support for Ukraine's energy transformation was recorded.
Earlier, the German Foreign Minister Annalena Berbok said that the process of certifying the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline is continuing.
According to the minister, in the framework of the coalition negotiations and the discussion of the coalition agreement, it was stated that European law in the field of energy should be applied to energy projects.
The diplomat also said the pipeline "does not yet meet the requirements" of the European Union.
Thank you for the interesting pictures!

Hackers hacked into Indian Prime Minister's Twitter
Hackers hacked into the Twitter account of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
The hackers managed to post a fake message.
It was reported that India had allegedly recognized bitcoin as a legal tender, and that the country had already purchased the cryptocurrency.
Modi's office asked me to ignore the new messages.
The prime minister's representatives said Twitter responded quickly and restored access to the account.
The Indian Prime Minister's page was hacked in 2020 and called for donations to the fund using cryptocurrency.
In a referendum in New Caledonia , the majority voted against independence .
In New Caledonia, the third referendum, held on December 12, ended with the same result as the previous two.
According to the first partial results announced on Sunday, December 12, at noon, most of the inhabitants of New Caledonia voted against independence during the referendum.
The turnout in this third vote was significantly lower than in the previous two.
According to preliminary results published by the local authorities, 3.51% (2 755 people) of those who voted "for" New Caledonia's independence from France, while 96.49% (75 762) voted "against".
Turnout was 43.90%, with more than 80,000 New Caledonians taking part in the election.
France-Presse comments on the results, saying that "the outcome of the election left no room for doubt" as pro-independence voters urged voters not to participate.
As the initiators of the referendum, they opposed its holding on December 12, believing that the new outbreak of COVID-19 in the archipelago is preventing a full and "fair" election campaign.
Thus, this non-participation paved the way for the third victory of the supporters of French New Caledonia, after the referendums held in November 2018 and in October 2020.
In 2018, 56,7% of the population voted against independence, in 2020 - 53,3%.
The separatists have said they will not recognize the results of the latest vote and will challenge them at the UN.
As reported on Sunday, December 12, in the Elysee Palace, French President Emmanuel Macron is due to speak on the results of this referendum.
The theme of New Caledonia's independence has been a major focus of the French presidential campaign.
Several presidential candidates have expressed support for the territory remaining part of France, as it is "the last region of the European Union's presence in the Pacific".
"New Caledonia must remain French", said Erik Zemmour.
The same statement was made by Republican candidate Valerie Pecres, who in late October published a column in Le Figaro urging Caledonians to remain French.
For his part, Emmanuel Macron announced in May 2018 that he would not take the position, "because it is not his responsibility".
However, the president added: "France would be less beautiful without New Caledonia".
Prime Minister Jean Castex, for his part, expressed "a strong desire that the choice of the Caledonians be the choice of France".

WSJ readers criticized article about Russia-US relations
The Wall Street Journal readers criticized an article by Professor Christopher Hartwell in which he described his vision of Russia-US relations.
The author of the article expressed concern that the West is allegedly making Ukraine a victim of Russia.

This was reported on December 11 by the non-staff advisor to the head of the office of the Ukrainian president Alexey Arestovich.
So they can act against aerial objects, against other drones.
Even against manned aircraft.
They will have Ukrainian engines and the rest of the Turkish avionics: the body and the like", - quotes him Dialog.ua.
Commenting on the main features of the ANKA, Arestowicz said that we are talking about jet, not piston UAVs.
He said it was a new generation of drones after the Bayraktar, which surpassed him "in all characteristics".
The first batch of UAVs should be produced by the plant at the end of next year, Arestowicz concluded.
The ANKA aircraft was created by the Turkish Aerospace Agency in February 2014.
The development of the drone was carried out by the Turkish authorities in cooperation with a number of private companies since 2010.
The day before, the Ukrainian General Staff classified data on the use of Bayraktar drones and Javelin missile systems during military operations of the combined forces in the Donbas.
On December 6, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced that the country had begun construction of a plant for the manufacture of modern military drones.
According to him, Ukraine intends to use drones.
On September 29, Bayraktar Savunma and the Ukrainian Ministry of Defense signed an agreement to build a center in the Kiev region to train personnel, as well as test and maintain Turkish Bayraktar UAVs.
The press service of the Ukrainian leader's office called the memorandum "a big real step forward".
Two lions escaped from a container at the airport .
Lions have escaped from Singapore's Changi Airport.
This is reported by The Straits Times.
Two predators managed to escape from a container with seven lions that had arrived on one of the planes.
The newspaper notes that it remains unknown from which country they were brought to Singapore and where they were headed.
One of the fleeing lions lay on the roof of the container.
The animals could not get away from it because of the protective net installed nearby.
The confrontation ended after the arrival of the Mandai Wildlife Group, which runs all Singaporean zoos, at the airport.
They've immobilized the lions with tranquilizer darts and plan to take them to the quarantine facility.
Earlier it was reported that in Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia, a lion escaped from its owner and was roaming the streets of the city.
The same day, the animal returned home voluntarily, no one was hurt.
Specialists warn of cancer risk from vitamin B9
Studies suggest that too much vitamin B9, also known as folic acid, can lead to cancer.
The Daily Express warned of this.
According to experts, there is strong evidence that people who are not deficient in folic acid are less likely to develop certain cancers, including colorectal cancer.
However, exceeding the required dose, on the contrary, promotes the growth of cancer cells.
A professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, a nutritionist named Beth Kitchin, recommends monitoring your daily intake of folic acid.
The optimal dose is 400 micrograms a day.
The risk of cancer only increases if you deviate significantly from that number to a greater or lesser extent.
Kitchin recommends that you not take vitamin B9 in tablets without a doctor's prescription, be sure to monitor your dosage, and avoid cereals and other foods that contain folic acid.
Nutrition consultant Rachel Fine has previously called folic acid a substance that slows aging.
Because it's in avocados, among other things, Fine recommended that men over 50 eat avocados more often.
In the UK , by April , 75 000 people could die from the omicron strain .
British scientists predict that up to 75,000 people could die in England in the next five months from the spread of the omicron strain of the coronavirus if restrictions are not tightened in winter.
The Guardian newspaper reported this with reference to a study by experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LSHTM), reports TASS.
According to the most optimistic forecast of experts who are part of the Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies under the British Cabinet of Ministers, by April 2022 the country will record at least 25 thousand deaths due to the omicron strain, and about 175 thousand patients will be hospitalized.
At the peak of the disease, the hospital will receive more than 2,000 new cases daily.
"Serious coronavirus control measures may be required to prevent overload of the National Health Service if the omicron strain is more contagious than the delta variant and the current vaccines cannot rule out infection", said mathematician Rosanna Barnard of the LSHTM.
Earlier, the UK Health Safety Agency said that if the spread of the omicron strain continues at its current rate, there could be about 1 million cases by the end of the year.
By mid-December, the omicron strain could become dominant in the United Kingdom.
At the moment, there are 1898 cases of omicron strain coronavirus in the UK, of which 633 have been detected in the last 24 hours.
On December 9, the head of the British Health Ministry, Sajid Javid, indicated that in reality, this figure may already reach 10,000 cases.

Worldwide demand for superyachts has grown by a quarter
Superyacht construction this year and orders next year are breaking world records, despite calls to reduce the carbon footprint and fight climate change.
The world register of ships has 1,200 yachts on order, a quarter more than last year.
In an era of climate change efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, it is hard to imagine that the number of people who have the desire and money for a floating fortress of £50 million or more will not decline, the Guardian reports.
However, the number is increasing.
This year, we've ordered 25% more ships than last year.
Brokers say the market hasn't seen this much buzz in 20 years.
The first reason is that many who can afford a yacht are afraid of getting infected on land and prefer to hide from the pandemic on board their own boat.
The second reason is also related to the coronavirus.
Whereas before all these people went to the office and met with business partners in person, now the vast majority of them are working remotely and negotiating in a zoom mode.
Broker Will Christie told the paper that the shipyard is taking orders for new yachts for 2025 and beyond.
This means that customers are willing to pay more if their yacht is ready at least a year or two earlier.
"People just crave freedom, and the super rich can afford it", he says.
In Western society, many criticize this behavior of the wealthy as decadent.
The rich, say sociologists, do not want to realize that in an age of denial of space travel, life on yachts or flying their own planes is a social irritant because the elite do not want to share responsibility for climate change with the rest of humanity.
Economists are urging governments to act and to propose new taxes and regulations for the super-rich, even though they realize that with this mobility of money, it will be extremely difficult to do so.
Meanwhile, not only the number of superyachts ordered, but also their characteristics are impressive.
Of the 1,200 vessels, 27 have a stern length of more than 100 metres.
Norwegian billionaire Recke is building a 183-meter long REV Ocean yacht.
When it's launched, it'll be the largest yacht in the world.
The yacht features a "moon pool" and a submarine designed to explore the deep sea.
The existing superyachts have become commonplace with helicopter pads, open-air cinemas, and some, like the wrestler McGregor's yacht, have a wrestling platform. Richard Wilk, a professor of economic anthropology at Indiana University, says the carbon footprint of the superrich is insignificant compared to the total greenhouse gas emissions.
But it's symbolic, considering there are just over 2,000 multi-billionaires in the world.
This is just another example of overconsumption by a very small group of people.
Scientists have found that the emissions footprint of billionaires is thousands of times greater than that of the average person on the planet.
If one person produces an average of 5 tons of CO2 per year, the planet's biggest polluter, Roman Abramovich, is responsible for 33.9 tons of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere in 2018.
Two-thirds of the emission trail was on his 162.5 meter long Eclipse yacht.
Even if the owner is not on board, the crew continues to poison the planet.
The owner may call the captain and give the order to bring the boat, say, from the Mediterranean to the Caribbean.
Superyacht owners do not elicit sympathy from others when they, like Australia's richest woman, Gina Reinhardt, who owns mines on the continent, complain on YouTube that there is no place for their giant ships to dock.
It's also hard to understand her call to build marinas for ships over 50 meters.
A weekly dose of alcohol that can lead to colon cancer has been identified.
American scientists have determined how much alcohol a week increases the risk of cancer.
The Daily Express reports that the two men were killed in a car crash in the city of New York.
Experts have concluded that drinking four or more alcoholic beverages a week is associated with an increased risk of cancer.
The risk of developing the disease increases with increasing alcohol consumption.
Moreover, moderate drinkers have a higher risk of developing bowel cancer than do women.
Scientists cannot pinpoint the exact cause of this type of cancer, but they do note that certain factors contribute to the development of the disease.

Dogs can understand words and phrases at the level of a two-year-old .
Many, indeed all, dog lovers are convinced that these creatures are very intelligent.
But even they don't realize how far-flung four-legged pets really are.
For years, biologists have conducted experiments to determine for sure how intelligent animals are.
Although dogs do not have as extensive a vocabulary as humans, a new study shows that dogs can consistently respond to 89 words or phrases.
The scientists' work was published in Sciencealert.
Dogs cannot play chess or write poetry, they have no understanding of politics, economics, or art, yet they often manage to fool their owners.
Some species, experts say, have better word comprehension than others, but statistics are not yet sufficient to draw accurate conclusions.
Some breeds are traditionally considered dog geniuses - for example, Labradors.
Scientists have concluded that dogs are capable of logical thinking and are no less capable of learning than a two-year-old child.

Ukraine is preparing for trade between the US and Russia
The United States and Russia will "negotiate" on Ukraine's entry into NATO, analyst Alexander Kochetkov said in an article for the newspaper "Glavred".
According to him, Washington and Moscow plan to continue negotiations on the United States' guarantees that Ukraine will not join the North Atlantic Alliance, despite the words of American leader Joe Biden about the right of countries to "enter anywhere".
If you're offered something that's clearly unacceptable, like selling a close relative into sexual slavery, you're not going to bargain, you're just going to send the offer.
And in relation to Ukraine, there is a bargain", the analyst wrote.
Kochetkov added that Russia does not plan to attack Ukraine, but seeks dialogue with Kiev.
"The preparations are done in secret, quickly and immediately move to offensive actions, and do not wait until the group is detected and deployed by the forces of resistance", he noted.
China is boosting rail transport
China's advanced technology attracted the attention of companies from the United States, Germany, France and other countries at the 2021 China International Railway Transport and Equipment Manufacturing Exhibition held in Zhuzhou, Hunan Province (Central China).
The main technology developed by CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co. Ltd. allows trains to automatically detect and diagnose technical malfunctions, company spokesman Hou Zhaowen said.
High-speed trains running on the China-Laos railway line, which was put into operation earlier this month, are already equipped with the technology, which will improve the reliability and performance of rolling stock.
Over the past six months, China has significantly increased its railway exports, and many countries in Asia and Europe are witnessing "Chinese speed".
In May this year, the first two-deck high-speed electric trains designed in China for export to Europe rolled off the production line of CRRC Zhuzhou Locomotive Co., Ltd.
With a maximum operating speed of 200 kilometers per hour, these trains will run on the railways of Austria, Germany, Hungary and other European countries.
In November, the trial operation of the metro train, developed by the above-mentioned company for Turkey, began.
The train will run along the metro line connecting Istanbul's city center with the city's airport.
The metro line will open next year.
It will be the fastest metro line in Turkey with a speed of 120 kilometers per hour.
"China's railway equipment industry is one of the most innovative and internationally innovative", said Feng Yaoshan, head of the trade and investment department of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade.
"This industry is the main competitive advantage of China's high-end equipment production in the world market", Feng Yaoshan said.
After more than 60 years of hard work, a number of independent research and development, China has created an advanced system of production of equipment for rail transport, with a full range of auxiliary means and large-scale production activities.
According to Feng Yaoshan, the country is ranked first in the level of electrification of railways and in the operational range of high-speed and urban railways.
Biologist lists early signs of dementia
Biology candidate Semen Golosheikin, in an interview with Sputnik radio, listed the early signs of dementia.
He said that future dementia could be marked by forgetfulness, as well as a range of mild cognitive impairments, such as inability to concentrate, plan, and reduce abstract thinking.
There is now a debate about whether hearing loss may be an early sign of Alzheimer's disease or a risk factor, he said.
Goloshekin stressed that dementia can be caused by neurodegenerative disorders, head injuries, some infections, metabolic disorders, and lack of certain vitamins.
He added that Alzheimer's disease and atherosclerosis of the brain vessels are the most common causes of this syndrome.
The biologist noted that doctors do not yet know effective treatments for dementia.
Therefore, it is important to start prevention early.
He says that learning foreign languages and active communication can help reduce the risk of developing dementia.
The WHO also recommends maintaining moderate levels of physical activity, regular exercise in cognitive skills through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic thinking.
"There are recommendations for the use of various dietary supplements, but their effectiveness and appropriateness are still being debated in the scientific community", Golosheikin said.
"The World Health Organization recommends maintaining a moderate level of physical activity, regular training of cognitive skills and abilities through games and hobbies that require intensive involvement of memory and logic of thinking", said Goloshekin.
The UK's Dementia Research Charity has said the disease is increasingly affecting people over the age of 40.
The doctors called the early symptoms of Alzheimer's.
The first warning sign is a visual impairment that causes the patient to have difficulty recognizing objects.
Another sign of developing dementia is what experts call aphasia, a condition in which a person cannot find the right words to express what he wants to say.
Neurologist demands Saakashvili be sent abroad for treatment
Former Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili needs psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation abroad, neurologist Otar Toidze, who is part of a medical consortium set up by the Georgian ombudsman, told reporters.
His [Saakashvili's] neurological status is leading in his illness.
The stable problems are problems with movement, coordination, variability of character", - said the specialist, noting that this does not go beyond the normative framework and now the ex-president needs to be sent to a special rehabilitation.
"We call this neuro-rehabilitation and psycho-nervous rehabilitation, which we have not found in Georgia", said Toidze, demanding that Saakashvili be treated in a special institution that does not exist in Georgia.
On the evening of December 7, Saakashvili began to sabotage medical care after he was disciplined by the penitentiary service.
The Georgian politician quickly managed to abolish the punishment and restore himself to his former rights.

Spain protests against COVID passports
In Barcelona and Valencia, Spain, protests against mandatory COVID-19 vaccination certificates have been held, reports Europa Press.
In the Catalan capital, the number of participants was about 3 thousand.
In Barcelona, COVID passports are now mandatory for bars, restaurants, gyms, nursing homes and nightlife venues.
Many protesters came to the rally without masks.
They used slogans to accuse the state of totalitarianism and to call for respect for the choice of citizens.
In Valencia, vaccination passports will also be required to enter entertainment venues and restaurants with a capacity of more than 50 people.
The protesters in that city declared a medical dictatorship and called vaccination an experiment.
Spain has recorded more than 5.2 million cases of coronavirus since the pandemic began, and more than 88,000 patients have died.
Russia is also planning to impose restrictions on unvaccinated people.
The government introduced the draft laws on the unified system of QR codes to the State Duma on November 12.
It is expected that Russians will be able to visit places of mass events, cultural institutions, public catering and retail trade with either a certificate of vaccination or a certificate of illness or a medical guide from vaccination.
The same rules will apply to travel by train and plane.

Steep climb: how Chinese become skiers
The Olympics should attract millions of people to the slopes and help create international-level resorts in the country
China hopes the Olympics will not only attract 300 million citizens to winter sports, raising the 1 trillion yuan targeted by President Xi Jinping, but also boost the economic development of backward remote provinces.
The Taiwu ski resort in Zhangjiagou, located near the Winter Olympics, is becoming increasingly popular among Chinese.
In addition to infrastructure construction, the region is also undergoing landscaping work: workers are planting trees.
There are more than 700 ski resorts in the country, but only 20 of them are large enough to host international competitions.
Many regions of China with resorts, including Zhangjiagou, have problems with snow.
The main long-term goal is to ensure that Chinese resorts are comfortable and interesting, so that all newcomers become regulars.
But that's a long way off.
Games advisor Justin Downes says that since his last visit in 2007, the Chinese ski industry has changed beyond recognition.
Every year, more and more Chinese go to the slopes in winter.
Fiona, a snowboarder from Beijing, is one of them.
Despite the major changes, it will take many years to establish a ski culture, Downs said.
Many resorts are located in agricultural and mining areas.
These regions still need to be actively developed and the necessary infrastructure for recreation created.
Gao Makong, 70, lives in Chunli, near the Winter Olympics.
He notes that winter sports tourism has been booming in recent years.
Two years ago, the high-speed railway from Beijing to Chungli was built, and now no one is without work.
More and more shops are opening in the country selling winter sports clothing and equipment.
On the slopes, they open food stalls with national cuisine.
There is even a COVID-19 testing station in Taiyuan now.
China is striving to create a thriving winter sports industry, its athletes must become leaders in major international competitions, and the resorts and equipment must reach world standards.
More than 500 million people worldwide could face extreme poverty due to the pandemic, WHO says
More than 500 million people worldwide could be pushed into extreme poverty by the coronavirus pandemic, which has slowed humanity's progress in universal health access, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Bank (WB) said.
In connection with the International Day for Universal Health Coverage on 12 December, WHO and WHO published two complementary reports.
They said the pandemic had caused disruptions in health care, and caused an overwhelming amount of stress on health systems.
In this regard, for the first time in 10 years, the population immunization coverage has decreased, and the death rate from tuberculosis and malaria has increased.
The WHO and WHO stressed that the pandemic had caused "the worst economic crisis since the 1930s, making it harder for people to pay for treatment".
This situation pushes more than 500 million people "into extreme poverty because they have to pay for these services out of their own pockets".
In October, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the coronavirus pandemic had pushed more than 100 million people into poverty, with more than four billion people practically without social support.

Reuters: Taiwanese minister suspended from broadcasting "Democracy Summit" at White House request
Taiwan's Digital Technology Minister Audrey Tan's speech at a panel discussion at the US-hosted Democracy Summit was edited to video-free, according to a YouTube video of the summit.
Reuters, citing sources, said the picture was taken down at the request of the White House.
According to their report, the reason was the map that showed Taiwan in a different color from the PRC, which considers the island its territory.
The map Ms. Tan was showing was compiled by the South African NGO CIVICUS and ranks the countries of the world by their level of civil rights.
Taiwan was highlighted in green as "free", and China, the DPRK, Laos and Vietnam in red as "closed".
After the minister showed the map, the picture from her side was replaced with a screenshot with a note that the views of the participants in the discussion "do not necessarily reflect the position of the US government".
China was not invited to the "Democracy Summit".
Reuters sources say the map, which was shown by a Taiwanese minister, may be in violation of Washington's "one China" policy.
One of the agency's sources said that after the map was shown, the US National Security Council angrily contacted the State Department, accusing it of showing Taiwan as a separate country.
The Washington-organized "Democracy Summit" was held from December 9 to 10 with the participation of representatives from 110 countries and territories, as well as civil society and charitable organizations.
Russia was not invited to the summit.
During the "zero day" of the summit, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, chief editor of "Novaya Gazeta" Dmitry Muratov called for the creation of an international fund through which money earned through corruption would be given to charity.
Earlier today, Deputy Secretary of the Russian Security Council Yuri Averyanov said that the summit carried "an anti-Russian and anti-Chinese charge".

The New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board has made a suborbital flight .
Blue Origin's New Shepard spacecraft with six tourists on board made a suborbital flight on Saturday, December 11.
The flight, which was broadcast on the company's website, lasted more than ten minutes before the capsule and passengers descended to Earth, TASS reported.
The launch was conducted from a spaceport near the American city of Van Horn (Texas).
The ship rose to a height of just over 100 km, the space tourists were in a state of weightlessness.
The launch vehicle landed on the spaceport.
Blue Origin successfully completed the first suborbital flight of a New Shepard with passengers on board on July 20.

China strengthens COVID-19 prevention and control in cities with land border crossings
The Joint Mechanism for Prevention and Control of the State Council of the People's Republic of China issued a circular ordering to strengthen COVID-19 prevention and control in cities where land-based checkpoints are located in order to further prevent the importation of infection from abroad.
According to the circular, people leaving the listed cities must provide a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test result within 48 hours of departure.
Those arriving in cities with land-based checkpoints must take at least one COVID-19 nucleic acid test upon arrival.
The document states that these requirements will be in effect from the day the relevant provincial-level administrative units determine and publish the zones of the cities, until March 15, 2022.
In addition, cities with land-based checkpoints that meet certain conditions may consider creating buffer zones to prevent and control the COVID-19 epidemic within their jurisdiction.

The Foreign Ministry has spoken about the "sad conclusion" in the relations between Russia and the United States
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov in an interview with Izvestia evaluated the prospects of relations between Moscow and Washington.
He noted that the long journey of interaction has led to sad conclusions, and the problems between the two countries did not begin yesterday.
There's a one-sided predictability, but the prospects for improvement are completely unpredictable.
This is a sad conclusion from a long journey we've taken with the current administration, with Trump, with Obama.
The problems did not start yesterday", the diplomat said.
According to Ryabkov, the problem is the desire of the United States to impose its approaches on Russia on many issues.
The deputy foreign minister added that he would not risk making optimistic predictions about the prospects for improving relations and would not expect Washington's position to change.
He explained that with the exception of areas such as strategic stability and cybersecurity, no progress was observed.
Russia is calling on the United States to take a responsible approach to international security and hopes that the signals will be heard and Americans will listen to common sense arguments.
Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a meeting with US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken that Moscow was ready to resume dialogue with the United States.
Virologist warns of risks of COVID vaccine outside hospitals
People who have been given a COVID-19 vaccine by the nose may develop allergies and need medical attention, so first vaccination sites should not be set up at airports or shopping malls.
This was reported to TASS by a virologist, member-correspondent of the Russian Academy of Sciences, head of the bionanotechnology, microbiology and virology laboratory of the Novosibirsk State University Sergey Netesov.
It's easier to set up a nasal vaccine site at airports and shopping malls, but I would initially only do it in health facilities.
The fact is that the chance of an allergic reaction to such a vaccine is small, but it is advisable that the person sits next to the doctor's office afterwards.
Doctors have special kits of anti-allergy drugs that work in just a minute or two, which is sometimes very necessary", Netesov said.
According to the virologist, it is only when the drug has been used in practice that it will be possible to consider vaccination in shopping malls.
He also stressed that when using a nasal vaccine, it is important that it reaches the mucous membrane in the nasal cavity.
However, there is a chance that the vaccine will not reach its destination if the recipient's nose is blocked and the vaccine is inhaled.

In the UK , 1239 cases of omicron-stamm coronavirus were recorded in a day - RT on Russian
In the UK, 1239 new cases of omicron strain of coronavirus have been detected in the last day.
This is reported by Sky News.
In England, 1196 new cases of the strain were reported, while 38 people in Scotland and five in Northern Ireland were infected with the new strain.
The total number of COVID-19 cases from the new strain in the UK has reached 3,137.
Earlier, scientists at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine had predicted that up to 75,000 people could die in England from the coronavirus outbreak caused by the Omicron strain by April.
Peskov warned of the suffering of Western countries that impose anti-Russian sanctions
Russian President Dmitry Peskov's press secretary commented on the possible imposition of anti-Russian sanctions in case of continued "aggressive actions" against Ukraine, including due to the alleged "invasion" of the country's territory.
"It is impossible to impose any restrictions on Russia and not suffer for it", the Kremlin official said on the Russia 1 television channel.
Peskov claims that this is "understood by everyone in the world".
Earlier it was reported that the United States considers the possibility of imposing anti-Russian sanctions in the energy sector as an extreme measure.
In addition, Washington and the European Union plan to impose restrictions that will make it harder for Russian banks and the Russian Direct Investment Fund to convert rubles into dollars.
At the same time, the head of Sberbank Herman Gref is sure that this is impossible.

New Caledonians rejected independence from France
According to the final results of the third referendum on the independence of New Caledonia, the vast majority of participants refused to leave the French territory.
This was reported by the French BFM.TV channel on December 12.
96.5% of the electorate voted against independence.
The independence from France was supported by 3,51% of the inhabitants of the archipelago in the south of the Pacific Ocean.
Cancelled 2.99% of the ballots.
The voter turnout was very low: about 55% of the archipelago's inhabitants came to the polls.
According to experts, the low turnout is due to calls by separatists to refuse to participate in the referendum due to the coronavirus.
Paris refused to postpone the referendum.
In October 2020, New Caledonians voted against independence from France in a referendum.
In 2018, the region already held a referendum on independence.
Most of the inhabitants supported the archipelago being part of France.
New Caledonia is almost 20,000 kilometers from mainland France.
In 1853, France declared New Caledonia its possession.
About 270 thousand people live in the archipelago, the territory has a special administrative-territorial status.
A 1998 agreement between Paris and the administration of New Caledonia allows the region to hold two independence polls every two years.

WHO has said Omicron is less dangerous than Delta.
The World Health Organization (WHO) has a preliminary view that Omicron is less dangerous than the delta strain of coronavirus.
However, there is evidence of decreased vaccine efficacy in the new COVID-19 variant.
As of December 9, Omicron has been reported in 63 countries.
"Preliminary data and a significantly altered antigenic profile of the Omicron strain protein suggest a decrease in vaccine effectiveness against infection and transmission of the variant.
Preliminary findings from South Africa suggest that it may be less severe than delta", the WHO technical report said.
The organisation notes that so far all reported cases of omicron infection in the EU are mild or asymptomatic.
However, the new strain is, according to preliminary data, spreading faster than the delta.
Two cases of omicron strain infection have been reported in Russia.
They "had been previously immunized", the Gamalaei Center reported.
The head of the Rospotrebnadzor Anna Popova stated that there are no reliable data yet that the new variant of coronavirus is less dangerous than the others.

Ukraine named four scenarios for Zelensky
Ex-Victorian deputy Vadim Denisenko listed four options for the development of events for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in 2022.
According to him, the head of state may remain without Western support, and may also compromise on Donbass.
This was reported by Denisenko on Sunday, December 12, in a publication on the portal "Glavred".
The first option, which Denisenko called a "perfect storm", suggests that Ukraine will lose support from key Western countries, reaching an agreement on the country's future without its participation.
Such a development will contribute to a deep crisis that Kiev may face in 2023.
"Parallel to the decline in prices for key goods that we traditionally export <...> are internal protests and the government's confrontation with key FPGs (financial and industrial groups. - Ed.) ", - added the ex-parliamentarian.
According to Denisenko, there is another scenario of the situation - "war against all".
This forecast will come true in the case of high turbulence in world politics, in which the Ukrainian authorities will face a number of problems.
Because of this state of affairs, the Ukrainian leadership may compromise on Donbass, which may lead to confrontation within the country.
By the end of the summer, Zelensky's position will weaken, a situation that the former MP says is likely to reach 50-55%.
The third variant of the situation in Ukrainian politics is the confrontation between groups of the population that disagree with Zelensky and the president, which is likely to take control of the power bloc and implement "populist initiatives".
In this version of the crisis, Zelensky will begin "reformatting the government", Denisenko added.
Another scenario is Zelensky becoming the "father of the nation".
This may be triggered by an event that will be a major shock to society.
"The event should be large enough to cause a reaction from external partners and lead to increased support for Ukraine", Denisenko said.
Such a scenario is possible as a result of a natural disaster, a technological catastrophe or aggressive actions by Russia, the ex-deputy believes.
At the same time, the Russian side has repeatedly rejected any possibility of an "attack" on Ukraine.
Moscow noted that it was the Ukrainian authorities, NATO and the United States that were increasing military activity near the Russian borders.
Earlier, on November 11, a survey by the Rating group showed that the Ukrainian president's rating had fallen to a record low of 19.3%.
This is the lowest level since he was elected president.
Analysts predicted a situation in which in the event of the upcoming presidential elections in Ukraine, only 21.8% of the votes would be cast for Zelensky, while for the country's former president, Petro Poroshenko, 14.5%.
Among all respondents, only 19.3% expressed support for the president.

A poet arrested for a protest in Red Square: "For a quote from Yevtuchenko, they give 10 days, that's it, the power of poetry!"
At the beginning of the week, 21-year-old poet Alexander Volchenkov was arrested for ten days.
A HSE student was detained on Red Square with a poster with the hashtag #poetvrussiamorepoet.
This quote belongs to the writer Yevgeny Yevtuchenko.
Alexander was charged with repeatedly violating the public action procedure.
He was first arrested on January 23 at a rally in support of Alexei Navalny on Pushkin Square.
"The goal was to draw attention to poetry in general, now the interest in it, unfortunately, is lost, to the decline of the common culture in Russia and also a small hope to inspire unknown poets to write their poems on the Internet under this hashtag", explains Alexander.
We've contacted the young poet to find out the circumstances of his arrest and to reveal more about the message of his message.
How were you treated by the police this time and before?

They asked the standard, motive.
When they heard, they basically looked at it, if not approvingly, then understandingly.
Except for the four-way monkey, it was perfectly fine, but I knew what I was doing.
And if after the protest, even a few people start writing their own poems under this hashtag, I will do 10 days in jail for good.

Researchers have shown that potatoes help fight aging disorders
The study found that potatoes are rich in vitamins and minerals that help improve blood circulation and lower cholesterol.
The root contains vitamins of group B, vitamin C, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, riboflavine, folic and pantothenic acids.
All these elements help the body's systems to function.
Potatoes also help to combat age-related disorders.
Because of its high content of ginger, it is beneficial for the gastrointestinal tract, and if used regularly, it may also help prevent hypertension and atherosclerosis.
However, to get the most benefit, the root is best stewed or boiled rather than fried in oil.
The Daily Express has warned that potatoes can be dangerous to diabetics, as can other foods with high glycemic index.
These are foods with carbohydrates that break down quickly into sugars, such as sugar, sugary soft drinks, white rice, and white bread.
In early December, the newspaper "Kommersant" warned of a possible shortage of Russian table potatoes, noting a reduction in its production in personal support farms and an increase in processing capacities.
According to market participants, the current shortage of products can only be replaced by imports.
Lostfilm, lordfilm and other pirates will be removed from Yandex's list
Candidates for the flight
In 2015, rights holders from the RAEC/Media cluster compiled a list of the 100 largest pirate websites on the internet, and most of them have ceased to exist, says Karen Kazaryan, director general of the Internet Research Institute.
But some - Kinogo, Lostfilm, Filmix - still managed to survive, he adds, thanks to regular domain name changes.
For example, on Lostfilm, which is available in search results from both Yandex and Google, you can watch pirated copies of the Netflix series "Game of Squid" and "Tenderness" by director Anna Melikyan - the original series of Russia's largest video service ivi (which is part of the AIV).
On Kinogo, which is also available in search engines, you can watch the animated novel Encanto, but judging by the quality of the video, it is a so-called screen (a pirated copy of a movie shot in a cinema).
Filmix, which can also be found through search engines, is available the series "Univer. 10 years later" of the TNT television channel (part of "Gazprom-media").

The Dimax Micro Ultimate mattress, size 160 by 190.
The orthopedic mattress is a Micro Ultimate.
The model is convenient in that it has two different softness surfaces  high hardness and slightly more average.
The product contains only high-quality and premium fillers that have proven themselves to be the best.
Springs: a block of independent "micropakets" springs is installed in the center of the model.
That means that there are 2,000 coils per bed that are completely autonomous.
It's their functioning that gives them their unique point configuration.
The "Micropack" is the highest frequency of all the variety of "Dimax" spring blocks, so it has a pronounced orthopedic effect and is considered a premium.
Fillings: The springs are combined with layers of koi and natural latex.
The only difference is the order of the plates.
If one surface is latex, the other is coconut shell.
This tandem of fillers has long been considered classic, as it gives the mattress not only orthopedic but also anatomical properties.

Estonian scientists will search for life on Venus
The Massachusetts Institute of Technology, in collaboration with the Tartu Observatory and other research institutions and companies, is preparing three space missions to Venus to search for signs of life in the atmosphere, the Actualidad Camera reported on Sunday.
The mission, which will launch in five years, will assess the habitability of Venus' clouds and then search for life there.
For the project, Tartu scientists proposed instruments to measure the acidity and oxygen content of Venus' clouds.
Up until now, it was thought that the clouds of Venus, the closest planet to Earth, were too acidic to support life, but it is likely that Venus was originally an Earth-like planet.
The third mission is to bring a sample from Venus.
Suppose we find life there, the main question would be whether it's similar to Earth or different.
If they're very similar, then it's obvious that life on Earth didn't start on Earth.
If it is different, it may be more likely that life originated on Earth", says Mihkel Pajsala, the head of the Venus Life Finder project in Estonia.

Metas will change the Russian business
The topic of meta-obsessed people became popular this fall when Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook was turning into Meta.
For the market, this event was an important signal: the largest player confirmed the development of a new format of digital interaction between people.
This means that business in Russia, as in the rest of the world, will invest in creating their own meta-universes and their subsequent monetization.
The metaverse should be seen as a continuation of objectively existing trends.
On the one hand, the trend of remote interaction in the pandemic, because people are tired of separation and limitations.
On the other hand, it is a consequence of the desire of business to develop ecosystems and adapt operating models to them.
And the third is that they are a logical extension of the trend of asset digitization, where any rights, securities, artwork, even money, are going digital.
Anya, you're right, changing your diet is a conscious process.
When you start eating right, you don't want to eat too much fat and too much harmful food.
Of course, we'll have the traditional olivier and herring under the coat, but no one's forcing me to eat it all at once.
You can eat it by the spoon, try it, and that's it.
Because it's really 10 days of the week, and you can cook any delicious and healthy dish.
And how much hell of a job, time, resources she put into training.

And she also realizes that four years before the next Olympics she won't make it, which means she'll never be an Olympic champion.
And if you're not into sports or you can't imagine all the hell she's been through, don't judge.
British economist can 't predict 2022
British economist Jim O'Neill could not make a forecast for 2022 because he believed such attempts would fail.
He wrote about it in an article for Project Syndicate.
The expert believes that next year will be full of unpredictability and any trend can change the turnover.
The most important factor remains the coronavirus pandemic, and inflation is second, he believes.
O'Neill also admitted that he did not know whether the price increase was temporary or not.
As the expert pointed out, even before the pandemic, it was clear that "the world of the infinite generosity of central banks has already worn itself out" and it is time to return to a relationship where interest rates with inflation will correlate with the expected growth rates of GDP.
O'Neill noted that in the context of the pandemic, the continuation of the ultra-soft economic policy may, according to some experts, lead to a new spike in inflation.
In addition, productivity growth, as well as rising poverty and climate change, should be addressed, O'Neill concluded.
Earlier, the head of the Global Research Department "Investment Discovery" Mikhail Shulgin reported that positive expectations for the dollar rate for 2022 remain, while the growth potential will be less significant.
Among the risks for the dollar, Shulgin named the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve, the dynamics of oil prices and fears against the backdrop of the coronavirus pandemic.
I have to say yes.
But the good news is, if you compare yourself to us, five years ago, there were fewer containers.
It's better now.
Progress is being made, but only slowly.
There's another problem: there are many green initiatives in cities, but people don't know about them.

Russians gave auto dealers about 4.5% of the country 's GDP
According to the results of 10 months of 2021, Russians spent 2 trillion 784 billion rubles on the purchase of new cars, which is 28% more than in the same period last year, statistics from the Russian Automotive Market Research (NAPI) agency show.
To understand the scale, about the same amount (about 3 trillion rubles) was spent by the state to support citizens and the economy during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last September, at a meeting of the heads of state of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, President Vladimir Putin said that this amount was comparable to more than 4.5% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) in 2020.
The Korean brand Kia is the leading brand in Russia in terms of revenue.
In 10 months of this year, it managed to sell cars worth 325.7 billion rubles, which is almost 24% more than a year earlier.
The relative Kia brand Hyundai has a growth even more significant - more than 35%, and the revenue from the sale of cars is estimated at 279,3 billion rubles.
In the leading positions this brand and by increasing the average weighted price of the car - over the year Hyundai it has increased by almost 21%, to 1.94 million rubles - stronger dynamics of price increases was only Changan, Chery, Geely and Mercedes-Benz.
At the same time, sales of Korean brands did not grow so much: according to the statistics of the automobile manufacturers' committee of the European Business Association in Russia, in quantitative terms Kia sold over the same period by 9.4% more cars than a year earlier.
Hyundai is up almost 12%.
The top three in terms of sales in monetary terms is Japan's Toyota - the Russians spent 275.5 billion rubles on cars of this brand in 10 months, which is 14% more than a year earlier.
Mercedes-Benz follows the Japanese with a figure of 266.1 billion rubles (+ 75%) - the German premium brand has increased both sales volume (37%) and average weighted price of the car (almost 28%, up to 8.2 million rubles).
"Mercedes-Benz is seeing both good sales growth and a weighted average price - more than, for example, BMW - hence a greater growth in financial capacity", explained NAPI CEO Tatyana Arabadji.
In terms of sales growth, fantastic performance is being shown by Chinese brands, which have also significantly increased their financial capacity this year".
Russian Lada shows average market performance (plus 28%) in terms of revenue growth. The Russians spent 229.4 billion rubles on this brand of cars in 10 months.
At the level of last year, there are companies with declining sales in 2021: Volkswagen, Mitsubishi and Nissan.
UAZ is in a negative position - in 10 months, Russians spent 12 billion rubles on SUVs and pickups of this brand against 12.4 billion rubles a year earlier.
Against the background of problems with the supply of auto components and production interruptions that have covered the entire world auto industry, auto companies continue to continuously adjust prices - the same "Autovaz" has increased the cost of Lada models seven times a year, the last increase in price (by 8-10 thousand rubles) occurred at the end of November.
Other carmakers also regularly revise their prices.
The volume of the Russian car market in monetary terms will continue to increase - in addition to the car shortage, inflation and the desire of carmakers to recoup past losses are contributing to this, experts say.
In the context of car shortages, I think that many car companies have even been able to pass on to the consumer some of the costs of past periods that they could not put into the price of cars before,
According to VTB Capital's analyst on the auto industry, Vladimir Bespalov,
I think that financially the car manufacturers are feeling very good right now, maintaining high margins".
Indirect indicators of this are the growth rates of the cost of cars, which are observed throughout 2021, the prices of new cars are growing faster than inflation, the expert clarifies.
In the long term, the market will grow both in terms of quantity and money, but mainly due to inflation and the complexity of the design of the machines themselves, predicts Bespalov.
As supply increases, the opportunities for price increases will be limited.
In monetary terms, the Russian car market will continue to grow in the coming year, even if the growth in the cost of cars slows down, the automakers will be able to get their income from the volume, says independent consultant for the auto industry Sergey Burgazliyev.
Given the high demand and insufficient supply, now carmakers are trying to make the most profit from each car sold, says Burgazliyev.
The volume of production of cars is not expected to increase in the next six months, while the public's uncertainty about the future is heating up the excitement in Russia.
The expert says that in the current market situation, cars are a good investment - a car bought a year ago, even with a mileage, can now be sold for more than its original value.
Biden said the U.S. would send troops to Ukraine if Russia invaded
The U.S. leadership has never considered sending American troops to Ukraine in the event of a Russian "invasion".
That's what US President Joe Biden said.
"There have never been any such plans", the White House chief said, when asked by a reporter whether the United States had abandoned the idea.
Biden noted that if the situation escalates around Ukraine, Russia will face economic consequences.
He stressed that the US and NATO have no obligation to use military force to protect Ukraine in the event of escalation.
The American leader also said that the possibility of using American troops unilaterally to defend Ukraine is not on the agenda.
Biden explained that if Russia invades Ukraine, the United States will move forces to NATO's Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Estonia).
"We're going to have to send more American and NATO troops to the eastern flank, B9 - all those NATO countries that we have a sacred obligation to protect from any attack by Russia", Biden said.
Earlier, Russian President Dmitry Peskov stressed that Moscow has no intention of invading Ukraine.
He pointed out that Moscow sees a problem in the combat use of drones supplied by Turkey by Kiev, as well as in the fact that "American weapons are approaching our territory".
