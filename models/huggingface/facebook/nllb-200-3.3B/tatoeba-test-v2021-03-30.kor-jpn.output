️ What's the problem?
Tom threw the apple tree in the trash.
I love the snow.
️️️️️️️
It's easy.

I don't know what to do anymore.
Tom and Mary live in a smart home.
They're tired.
️️️️️️️️️️
️️️️️️️️️️️️️️
I'm a right-handed man.

おはよう トム
彼が嘘をついていることは 最初から分かっていた
こんにちは 久しぶりです
大人を尊敬する
"オーストラリアに何年?" "3年"
腰が痛い
必ず 明らかになる
野郎にそんなことをさせたら 野郎は野郎だ
知らないだろ
ありがとうございました
言語は学習しやすいのです
彼らは私を知らない
彼は自分の過ちを後悔している.
これは一週間前に撮った写真だ
ひどい扱いをする
韓国語は,英語の勉強で,
近くにあるのが良かった
わかったわね
SF映画が好きですか?
トムは今日欠席ですか?
もちろんやる
わかった
3年前にトムに教えてもらった
背中がきれい
通りでキツネが 通りかかったのを見た
彼は自分の過ちを後悔している.
止めて! 止めて!
契約して魔女になるんだ
息子は大学に通ってるの?
天国と地獄は 存在するのか?
トムは自分でフーストを作った.
コンピュータが壊れた!
顔を見て 泣いてる
パリだ どこへ行くんだ?
今日は天気が良かった.
