Rapid rate of increase in COVID-19 infection in the EU/EEA and UK, 1 January to 15 March 2020
The similar trends in the incidence of COVID-19 in the EU/EEA and the UK confirm that, despite the different stages in different countries, the COVID-19 pandemic is spreading rapidly in all countries.
Based on the Italian experience, countries, hospitals and intensive care units should increase their preparedness to cope with the surge of COVID-19 cases requiring intensive care and medical care.
On 31 December 2019, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
On 9 January 2020, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention identified the cause of the disease as the novel coronavirus, now known as SARS-CoV-2 respiratory syndrome coronavirus.
Since then, the resulting infectious disease 2-SARS-CoV has been known as the coronavirus disease COVID-19.
Evidence to date shows that 80% of COVID-19 cases develop mild, or systemic, respiratory infections with pneumonia or pneumonia with pneumonia, and most recover.
14% of COVID-19 cases require hospitalization and another 6% require intensive care.
The mortality rate among COVID-19 infected persons is approximately 4%.
In this study we assess the trends in COVID-19 prevalence in each of the EU/EEA countries and the UK and compare them with the trends in China's Hubei Province.
We also compare the current COVID-19 case numbers in EU/EEA countries and the UK with the case numbers in Italy from 31 January to 15 March 2020.
COVID-19 cases in the EU/EEA and the UK
Beyond China, COVID-19 has a more geographically distributed distribution and the global pattern of the pandemic in other countries has followed the same patterns in China.
On 11 March 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 pandemic to be a pandemic.
On 5 March, Spiteri and colleagues reported the first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Europe, as defined by WHO, according to Eurosurveillance 2020.
Within the European Union/EEA, the first three confirmed cases were reported on 24 January 2020 among people returning from Wuhan in China's Hubei province.
As of 15 March 2020, COVID-19 cases have been reported in all 30 EU/EEA countries and the UK, resulting in 39,768 cases and 1,727 deaths between 31 December 2019 and this week, including 17,750 cases and 1,441 deaths in Italy alone.
Getting the case count and case rate of COVID-19
At the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC), the number of reported COVID-19 cases in all countries of the world is only obtained from official sources such as national health ministries, regional health authorities and WHO and is updated every day at 8:00 am.
These data were used to assess the COVID-19 trends in the EU and UK and compare them with Italy.
As a function of the evolution of active cases of COVID-19, we calculated the sum of the 14-day incidence of COVID-19 and thus considered the natural cycle of COVID-19 in each of the EU countries and the UK during 1 January-15 March 2020.
We also presented the peak number of reported cases in each of our countries at 8:00 am on 15 March compared to the number in Italy between 31 January and 15 March.
COVID-19 trends in the EU and the UK
The sequence of the 14-day condensed COVID-19 case rate in the European Union and the UK generally follows the sequence in China's Hubei province (Figure 1.
In the EU and the UK as a whole, COVID-19 infection rates began to rise on 21 February and reached a significant peak on 28 February 2020 (natural causes).
This was mainly due to the rapid increase in the number of cases in Italy, but all other EU countries and the UK showed a similar increase in their COVID-19 death rate.
Figure 2 shows the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in EU countries and the UK compared to Italy for the period 31 January-15 March 2020.
This shows that at 8:00 am on 15 March, the total number of cases in the other 15 EU countries and the UK was equal to the total number of cases in Italy in 3 weeks or less.
Our results show that the number of reported COVID-19 infections in the EU and UK is increasing rapidly.
Visual trends in COVID-19 prevalence rates indicate that this pandemic is progressing at a similar pace in all countries.
This is despite the fact that countries are at different stages and not always the same in terms of national public health response, as well as in terms of case definitions and protocols for diagnosing patients for testing to rule out infection with COVID-19.
In early March 2020, doctors in Italy's affected areas described the situation as such that about 10% of COVID-19 cases required intensive care, and media sources reported that hospitals and intensive care units in these areas had reached peak capacity.
Data on hospitalizations of COVID-19 patients in hospital and intensive care units in the EU/EEA countries are currently only at 6% and 1% of cases respectively (data not shown).
However, these data will need to be collected in a systematic manner until the current surveillance data focusing on the number of reported cases and the number of deaths is complete.
A November 2010 study shows a significant disparity in the number of available intensive care and medical care beds in Europe, with 29.2 beds per 100,000 people in Germany and 4.2 beds per 100,000 people in Portugal.
This indicates that countries may have fewer or more resources than Italy (12.5 ICU beds per 100,000 people in November 2020).
Modelling scenarios associated with healthcare capacity overcapacity, with the highest levels in each of the EU and UK in terms of the prevalence of COVID-19 bed-related cases associated with a risk of over 90% of increased capacity of intensive care beds, are outlined in the sixth update of the ECDC's Rapid COVID-19 Risk Assessment.
Because cases in the EU and UK are cumulative, and hospitals and intensive care units serve a population in a given area, information about cases and intensive care units is more likely to be obtained from the regional terminology set of Level 2 (2-NUTS) statistics.
The experience of Italy and the current trends in other countries suggest that COVID-19 is spreading rapidly in the EU and the UK.
Countries, hospitals and intensive care units should prepare for a scenario of sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 within the community as well as an increase in the number of COVID-19 cases requiring health care and in some cases intensive care, as is currently occurring in the affected areas of Italy.
As also indicated in the latest ECDC rapid risk assessment, a comprehensive, proactive and rapid approach is required to delay the spread of the 2-SARS-COV coronavirus, with a shift from containment to mitigation, as the projected rapid increase in the number of cases leaves insufficient time for decision-makers and hospitals to understand, adapt and adapt their responses if necessary and not ahead of time.
The rapid risk assessment also outlines public health measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
There is now a small window of opportunity for countries to increase their containment efforts to slow the spread of 2-SARS-CoV and reduce the burden on healthcare.
If this fails, healthcare systems in other EU countries could be overwhelmed in the coming days or weeks by the number of patients requiring intensive care.
The 2019 coronavirus pandemic (19-COVID), caused by the coronavirus 2 (2-SARS-CoV) respiratory system infection syndrome (SARS) has so far killed more than 3,000 people in China and other countries worldwide and infected more than 80,000, which could cause catastrophic human consequences.
Like its cousin, SARS-CoV, which infected thousands in 2003, the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 may have been transmitted from bats and may have caused similar symptoms through similar mechanisms.
COVID-19 has a lower severity and mortality rate than SARS, but a much higher transmission rate and affects older adults and men more than younger people and women.
This article provides a comprehensive assessment of the rapidly developing research in response to the growing number of new cases associated with this emerging disease.
We will cover the main principles of pathology, causation, virology, diagnosis, treatment, prognosis and prevention of the disease.
Although many questions remain unanswered, we hope this assessment will help us understand and prevent this deadly disease.
The Spring Festival on 25 January 2020 was a memorable event for Chinese people who had to stay home for weeks on their holidays after the outbreak of a new viral disease.
The virus is very similar to the coronavirus (CoV) that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003; therefore, it was named SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus by the World Health Organization (WHO) on 11 February 2020 and the resulting disease was named COVID-19.
The outbreak originated in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread throughout the country and to nearly 50 other countries.
As of 2 March 2020, the virus had recorded 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19, of which 40,000 had recovered and more than 3,000 had died.
The WHO warns that COVID-19 is the "number one public enemy" and is more powerful than terrorism.
According to PubMed (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/), in less than two months, more than 200 articles have been published on COVID-19 covering the areas of virology, pathology, causation, diagnosis and treatment of the disease since the first case was reported on 7 January 2020, and have identified the genomic sequences of the virus in several patients.
This review attempts to summarize the current research trend in this rapidly evolving new field.
When it does, we will attempt to compare COVID-19 with SARS and other coronavirus diseases and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS, 2012 pandemic).
We also discuss what we know about the prevention and prognosis of the disease, as well as some pressing questions that have yet to be answered.
Coronaviruses are traditionally considered nonlethal pathogens of humans and are responsible for approximately 15% of common colds in general.
However, in this century, we have already seen two pandemic human coronavirus outbreaks, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which caused the first outbreak in China in 2003 and in Saudi Arabia in 2012, and soon spread to many countries around the world, with shocking rates of infection and death.
This makes COVID-19 the third largest pandemic in recorded human history.
Also shown in Figure 1.1, the outbreaks of respiratory infections of unknown origin were first reported in Wuhan on 31 December 2019 by the Chinese National Health Administration.
A week later, the genome sequence of the coronavirus was released.
On 15 January 2020, the first death was reported in Wuhan.
By then, pandemics had spread rapidly in cities, provinces, and surrounding countries.
On 20 January, the infection was reported among health workers and it was noted that the disease is capable of human-to-human transmission.
On 23 January, Wuhan was placed under quarantine and all public transportation was suspended.
On 24 December the first medical study reported that out of 41 confirmed cases of the disease, only 21 had direct contact with seafood markets and thus the first known outbreak of the disease from an unknown animal source was identified.
On 30 January, the World Health Organization declared an outbreak of a global public health emergency.
As of the time of this report, the disease had spread throughout China and to approximately 50 countries worldwide.
Because the situation is developing rapidly, the final extent and severity of the global crisis remains open.
On 11 February 2020, a multivariate study of 8,866 patients was conducted with 4,021 patients having confirmed COVID-19 infection. A new picture of the overall case is shown below (https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/UlBi-HX_rHPXa1qHA2bhdA).
SARS-CoV-2 has infected people of all ages, but most were between the ages of 30 and 65.
About half (47.7%) of the cases were over 50 years old, very few were under 20 years old and only 14 cases were under 10 years old.
The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection was higher in men (0.31/100,000) than in women (0.27/100,000).
COVID-19 outbreaks have generally developed in Hubei and surrounding areas.
COVID-19 takes on average 5 (9-2) days to be diagnosed in a person.
The median time between infection and onset is 4.8 (7.2-3.0) days.
It also kills on average within 9.5 (13-4.8) days.
The initial R0 of the disease was 3.77 (95% CI:3.51-4.05), and the adjusted R0 was 4.82-2.32.
The number of cases grew significantly before 23 December, coinciding with the mass movement of people ahead of the Chinese Spring Festival.
The mortality rate among confirmed cases was 1.44% (95% CI:1.10-1.86%) and the adjusted mortality rate among all cases was 3.06% (95% CI:2.02-4.59%).
The three main risk factors for COVID-19 are gender (male), age (over 60) and acute respiratory infections.
Coronaviruses are a family of large, single-stranded RNA viruses.
The virus can be divided into four genera, namely, alpha, beta, gamma and delta.
In SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the glycoprotein spike (S) is sequentially linked to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and its receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), and thus causes membrane fusion.
The viral RNA genome is released into the cytoplasm; after viral genome replication, the genetic RNA together with the viral glycoproteins and nucleocytoplasmic vesicle proteins form the viral vesicle that then fuses with the plasma membrane to make the virus.
The first genome sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was announced on 10 January 2020.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus with 99.98% of the genetic material from 10 samples collected at the main site of origin of the virus at the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan.
The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is genetically more similar to SARS-CoV than to MERS-CoV.
Through electron scattering microscopy, SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus particles were detected in the ultrasonic portions of the human respiratory tract.
Human ACE2 has been shown to be a receptor for both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV.
However, SARS-CoV-2 is much less susceptible to human ACE2 than SARS-CoV, which is why the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection is lower than that of SARS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 can also produce a novel coat protein encoded by orf3b and a reverse protein encoded by orf8.
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus orf3b may play a role in the pathogenicity of the virus and inhibit the expression of IFNβ; in this case, orf8 has no known functional role.
On February 18, 2020, Xu and colleagues reported the cryo-EM structure of their full human ACE2 in the A2.9 protein in combination with the amino acid B0AT1 subunit.
They found that this structure, which is bi-fold, is assembled as a dimer and the ACE2-B0AT1 complex can bind two S proteins together, providing evidence for the identification and containment of the coronavirus.
B0AT1 could be a therapeutic target for drug testing to promote the isolation of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Main building and central school
Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been found to be bats, and these viruses have been transmitted to humans via feral cats and camels.
Through phylogenetic comparisons of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus with other coronaviruses, bat was identified as the original host of SARS-CoV-2 as the new virus is 96% identical to the two other bat SARS viruses called bat-SLCoVZX45 and bat-SLCoVZX21.
In addition, how the central cell helps the virus cross the species barrier and transmit it to humans is still unknown and the route of transmission still needs to be clarified.
Ji and his colleagues, however, described the virus as a parasite that transfers from bats to humans, forming a similar hybrid with the S-type protein.
According to a study, researchers in Guangzhou, China, reported that pangolins - a mammal-eating mammal that is commonly domesticated in traditional Chinese medicine - may be the central host of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus because of the 99% genetic similarity between the virus found in pangolins and the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.
Despite this, the 1% genetic difference between the two viruses is still a large difference, so stronger evidence is expected for more definitive results (Fig. 33).
The physical and chemical properties of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus have not yet been fully determined.
The SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV coronaviruses can survive in the extracorporeal state for up to 48 hours in a dry environment and up to 5 days at temperatures below 20 °C and humidity levels of 40%-50%
The SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus may have similar characteristics.
SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be sensitive to ultraviolet radiation and temperature of 56 degrees Celsius for up to 30 minutes; acyclic alcohol, 75% ethanol, chlorine if containing antivirals, peracetic acid, chloroform, and other fatty acids, except chlorhexidine, can effectively kill the virus.
Humans are generally not immune to SARS-CoV-2 and may be susceptible to this novel virus.
Currently, no detailed studies on the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 have been reported.
Therefore, we can only refer to previous studies on coronaviruses, particularly SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (Fig. (Fig.4).
Generally, after the virus has invaded the host, it is first recognized by the host's innate immune system via pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including type C lectin receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors, and RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs).
Through various pathways, the virus induces inflammation, dendritic cell maturation and the production of type I interferons (IFNs) that limit viral spread and accelerate the phagocytosis of viral antibodies.
In the same case, the N-type protein of SARS-CoV helps the virus evade the immune response.
Soon, a well-adapted immune response comes into play with the virus.
T lymphocytes in which CD4+CD8+T cells play an important role in the cell cycle.
CD4+ T cells stimulate B cells to produce antibodies specific to the virus, and CD8+ T cells directly kill cells infected with the virus.
T helper cells produce pre-inflammatory cytokines in order to help the immune cells.
Also, coronaviruses can inhibit T-cell activity by killing T-cells.
Fluid resistance including compounds such as C3a and C5a and antibodies are also required to combat viral infection.
For example, antibodies obtained from recovered patients inactivate the MERS-CoV virus.
On the other hand, the immune system's hypertrophic response naturally releases large amounts of free radicals that can cause severe damage to the lungs and other organs, and in the worst-case scenario, multiple organ failure and even death.
SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection, which is acquired from eggs, is more likely to affect older people and pregnant women.
In general, people who are exposed to high levels of viral activity or immune system activity are at higher risk of infection than others.
According to a review of 425 first cases in Wuhan, the estimated incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is 1-14 days and at most 3-7 days.
In the same case, a study of 1,099 infected patients showed that the mean exposure period was 3 days and ranged from 0 days to 24 days.
Recent studies, also discussed above, indicate that the incubation period was 4.8 (7.2-3.0) days for a demographic of 8,866 infected.
It is important for health authorities to establish effective quarantine times based on the time of onset of the disease, in order to prevent transmission of the virus from asymptomatic to other infected persons.
As a general rule, people who are infected or exposed to other patients must usually be quarantined for 14 days.
Should the quarantine be extended to 24 days?
It is often the first and primary symptom of COVID-19 and can occur by itself or with other symptoms such as dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle pain, cough, headache, heartburn, runny nose, chest pain, diarrhea, heart palpitations, and rash.
Some patients developed respiratory distress/low blood oxygen a week after the outbreak.
In severe cases, the disease progresses rapidly to respiratory problems, impaired blood pressure and organ function, metabolic acidosis and hematoma.
Patients with symptoms of respiratory tract infection and/or high fever, even if their lung imaging does not show abnormalities, should be screened for early detection of the virus.
A demographic study at the end of December 2019 showed that 98% of patients had asthma, 76% had a dry cough, 55% had shortness of breath, 3% had asthma and 8% needed ventilation.
Two recent studies of family rest and transfer rest in asymptomatic individuals have reached similar conclusions.
In comparison, a demographic survey in 2012 showed that MERS-CoV patients also had as their main symptom (98%) a dry cough (%47), dyspnea (%55) and asthma (%56).
However, 80% of these patients required ventilation, a much higher proportion than in COVID-19 patients and consistent with a higher mortality rate of MERS than COVID-19.
Diarrhea (26%) and coughing (21%) were also seen in MERS patients.
In SARS patients, it was found that (100%-99%), dry cough (75%-29%) shortness of breath (42%-40%), diarrhea (25%-20), and bronchitis (25%-13) were the main symptoms and about 20%-14% of those infected required manual ventilation.
As of February 14, the COVID-19 death rate was 2% while the number of confirmed cases was 66,576 worldwide.
In comparison, the death rate from SARS was 10% of the 8,096 confirmed cases as of November 2002.[107]
For MERS, according to a June 2012 demographic study, the mortality rate was 37% of the 2,494 confirmed cases.
An earlier study showed that the R0 of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus was 6.47, giving a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 7.23-5.71, whereas the R0 of SARS-CoV was only between 2 and 4.
A comparison of SARS-CoV-2 with MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV in terms of their symptoms, mortality rate, and R0 is given in Table 1.1.
The above formulations suggest that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is more transmissive than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, but less lethal than the other two.
Therefore, the control of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus is much more difficult than that of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV.
The parties often start in the same household or the same gathering or vehicle, such as a cruise ship.
Patients usually have a history of traveling or staying in Wuhan or other infected areas or have had contact with infected individuals or patients in the last two weeks before the onset of their illness.
In addition, it has been reported that people can carry the virus for more than two weeks without symptoms and that patients who recover after being discharged from hospital can re-infect, which is a wake-up call to extend the quarantine period.
Patients in the early stages have normal or reduced numbers of peripheral white blood cells (particularly lymphocytes).
For example, lymphopenia with a white blood cell count < 4x109/L had a nominal lymphocyte count < 1x109/L and elevated levels of aminotransferase aspartate and viraemia were seen in 1,099 COVID-19 patients.
The levels of myoglobin, myco-enzyme and myoglobin in the blood of some patients were spontaneously elevated, and the C-reactive protein and red blood cell capture in the blood of most patients were elevated.
In infected patients, the level of D-dimer, a plasmid product of fibrin found in blood, increased and the volume of lymphocytes decreased.
Abnormal chest radiation was seen in most COVID-19 patients and appears as a spotty triangular patch on either side or a dark, fluorescent-like appearance in the lungs.
Patients often present with unusual pulmonary infections, severe lung damage, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
When ARDS occurs, uncontrolled inflammation, fluid buildup, and advanced fibrosis, endanger gas exchange.
The inactivation of type 1 and type 2 pneumocytes reduces sulfate levels and increases the absorption of substances, thus reducing the ability of the lungs to expand, and increasing the risk of lung collapse.
Therefore, the more the patient's chest X-rays show deterioration, the more likely the disease is to be malignant.
On 18 February 2020, the first epidemiological analysis of COVID-19 showed that the death of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membranes, and theft of interstitial lymph nodes, and nucleus-synchronous cells in the lungs of patients who died from the virus, coincided with the pathology of viral infections and ARDS and were similar to those of SARS and MERS patients.
The detection of SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was adopted as a key measure for the detection of COVID-19 in humans.
Although the high false negative rate of release, which may accelerate the spread, has caused the recruitment of clinical symptoms to be discontinued in China on 13 February 2020 (since RT-PCR was no longer relied upon).
A similar situation occurred with the SARS diagnosis.
The combination of the disease's prognosis, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and diagnostic findings are necessary to obtain an effective and reliable diagnosis.
On 14 February 2020, Feng Zhang's group described a protocol using the SHERLOCK or CRISPR-based technique to detect SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, which detects SARS-CoV-2 RNA in 20x10-18mol/L to 200x10-18mol/L (10-100 copies per microl) by sampling from a single drop in less than one hour without the need for instrumentation.
We hope that this new technique, if validated, could significantly increase the sensitivity and ease of medical sampling.
Due to the lack of experience with novel coronavirus, physicians can generally provide care for COVID-19 patients, although they may also use treatments previously used for other coronaviruses such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and other viral diseases.
These treatments include currently used antiviral drugs and clandestine drugs, immune suppressors, steroids, recovering plasma, chemotherapy, and psychological supports.
Even the plasma of recovered patients has been recommended for use in treatment.
Pharmaceutical companies are currently racing to develop antibodies and vaccines for the virus.
SARS-CoV-2 mainly attacks the respiratory system and may also, to a lesser extent, attack organs that contain ACE2, such as the digestive system and kidneys.
In addition, respiratory dysfunction and respiratory fatigue are the leading threat to patients and the leading cause of death in those infected.
Therefore, respiratory support is crucial to alleviate symptoms and save lives of patients, including general oxygen therapy, radiotherapy, ventilation, ventilation, mechanical ventilation, depending on the severity of the disease.
Patients with severe respiratory symptoms should be given extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a corrected cardiac and respiratory technique for treating serious respiratory or cardiac failure.
In addition, maintaining electrolyte balance, preventing and treating secondary infections and septic shock, as well as maintaining vital organ function are critical for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus patients.
Cytocin cyclones have also been found to be the result of a rapid reaction in the immune systems of SARS and MERS patients.
Cytokine catabolism is a form of systemic inflammatory response that is mediated by the release of a series of cytokines, including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IFNα, IFNβ, IFNγ and MCP-1.
These cytokines force immune cells to release large amounts of free radicals, which are the main cause of ARDS and various organ failure.
Suppression of the immune system to treat cytokine deficiency, especially in patients with severe disease.
Corticosteroids and tocilizumab, and an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody, have been used to treat cytokine cysts.
Other immunosuppressive therapies for the treatment of cytokine deficiency include suppression of the immune system's response to T-cell receptors, suppression of IFN-γ, IL-1, and TNF and inhibition of JAK; blinatumab; cytokine signaling inhibitor4; and inactivation of HDAC.
Steroids, as suppressors of the immune system, are widely used in the treatment of SARS in order to reduce the severity of infectious lesions.
In addition, steroids if taken in high doses are not useful for severe lung damage in SARS and COVID-19.
Instead, it can cause subtle side effects, especially neuromuscular osteoporosis, which can significantly affect the diagnosis of the disease.
In addition, short-term courses of corticosteroids in low to moderate doses are recommended for use in patients with COVID-19 who are unstable.
At the time of writing, no effective antiviral treatment has been confirmed.
However, the intravenous injection of remdesivir, a nucleotide analogue, had a significant effect on an American COVID-19 patient.
Remdesivir is a novel antiviral drug originally developed by Gilead to treat disease caused by Ebola and Mlb.
Later, remdesivir also demonstrated its activity in inhibiting single-stranded RNA viruses, including SARS and MERS viruses.
According to them, Gilead has provided this facility to China to test for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infections and the results were highly predictable.
In addition, baricitinb, interferon alfa, lopinavir/ritonavir, and ribavirin, are recommended as antidepressants for patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infections.
Nausea, heartburn, vomiting, liver dysfunction, and other adverse reactions may occur after the use of the combination therapy lopinavir/ritonavir.
Interaction of these therapies with other medications in patients should be carefully monitored.
Plasma from recovered patients and antibody production
Collecting blood from patients who have survived an epidemic and using it to treat patients who develop the same disease or to protect the health of individuals against the disease has a long history.
In fact, recovered patients often have high levels of antibodies to fight the pathogen in their blood.
Antibodies are immunoglobulin (lg) produced by type Β lymphocytes to fight pathogens and other external targets and detect and directly neutralize unique molecules within the pathogen.
In this way, blood plasma from a group of COVID-19 patients recovered from the disease was introduced into the blood of 10 people infected with the disease.
Their symptoms improved after 24 hours, and their infection and viral load decreased and their blood oxygen saturation improved.
However, validation and clarification is needed to recommend the form and use on a large scale before the development of specific therapies.
In addition, while considering therapeutic effects, some plasma-related risks should be carefully considered.
For example, antibodies can cause an over-regulated immune response and cause cytokine release syndrome, which can be life-threatening toxicity.
The concentration of antibodies in the blood is normally low, and the demand for plasma to treat patients is high.
The development and manufacture of a unique antibody that is fast enough to fight a global pandemic is challenging.
Therefore, isolating B cells from recovered patients and detecting their genetic code and encoding effective antibodies, or testing for antibodies that affect the viral protein, is highly relevant.
If this is done, we can easily develop the production of antibodies.
TCM has been used in China for thousands of years to treat a variety of ailments.
However, its effectiveness depends largely on a combination of several components in a formula that varies according to the diagnosis of the disease based on the theories of TCM.
Most active ingredients remain unknown or obscure because extracting and confirming such ingredients or their suitable combination is difficult.
Currently, due to the lack of effective and specific treatments for COVID-19, TCM has become one of the main forms of alternative treatment for patients with mild to moderate symptoms or those who have recovered from the acute phase of the disease.
For example, the methods of Shu Feng Jie Du and Lian Hua Qing Wen have been shown to be effective in the treatment of COVID-19.
The highest rate of COVID-19 treatment was seen in several provinces in China with 87% of patients receiving TCM, including Gansu (63.7%), Ningxia (50%), and Hunan (50%), whereas in Hubei Province, TCM was used for only 30% of COVID-19 patients, and the recovery rate was lowest (13%).
However, this is a very small comparison, as many other influential factors such as the number of patients and the severity of their illness must be considered in the evaluation.
On 18 February 2020, Boli ZHang and colleagues conducted a study on the comparative treatment of Western medicine (WM) alone.
They found that the time needed for recovery of body temperature, symptom disappearance, and the need for hospitalization in the WM+TCM group was significantly shorter than in the WM-only group.
More significantly, the rate of worsening of symptoms (from mild to severe) in the WM+TCM group was lower than in the WM-only group (7.4% vs 46.2%) and the mortality rate in the WM+TCM group was lower than in the WM-only group (8.8% vs 39%).
In addition, the efficacy and safety of TCM still require more well-controlled trials on a larger scale and more centralised approach.
It is also of interest to describe the mechanism of action and explain the effective structure of TCM therapies or their possible components.
Patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infections are more likely to experience a high risk of fatal disease or widespread epidemic, and also quarantined individuals experience anxiety, isolation, and aggression.
In addition, inflammatory symptoms such as fever, hypoxia, and cough, and drug side effects such as insomnia due to corticosteroid use can lead to anxiety and depression.
In the early stages of the SARS outbreak, a wide range of psychiatric disorders including chronic depression, anxiety, panic attacks, psychotic arousal, symptoms of insanity, paranoia and even suicide were reported.
Exposure tracking and mandatory quarantine, as part of the public health response to COVID-19, can cause more people to worry and feel guilty about the effects of the pandemic, quarantine, and its consequences for their families and friends.
Therefore, mental health care should be provided for COVID-19 patients, suspects, and those who have been exposed to them, as well as the general public.
This should include psychological support, the creation of multidisciplinary mental health teams, clear communication with regular and accurate updates on the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, treatment plans, and the use of electronic devices and protocols to prevent close contact between individuals.
Effective vaccines to interrupt the chain of transmission from infected animals and humans to the host are necessary and often complementary to antiviral therapy to control pandemic disease caused by newly emerging viruses.
Efforts are underway to develop a vaccine based on the S-type protein to create long-lasting neutral antibodies and/or protective immunity against the SARS-CoV virus.
Immunocompromised live vaccines for SARS have been evaluated in animal models.
In addition, the in vivo efficacy of these vaccine candidates in age-specific and model-specific lethal resistance and protection against the spread of animal-human co-viruses has not been determined before a clinical trial begins.
This may be because SARS emerged 17 years ago and no cases have been reported since.
Conversely, MERS cases and strains still occur in the Middle East and are spreading to other regions due to the persistence of human-animal shared resources in endemic areas.
Cloning strategies for MERS, through the acquisition of contaminated virus shells, DNA plasmids, viral carriers, nanoparticles, virus-like molecules, and sequencing protein subunits have been developed and some have been evaluated in animals.
Creating a safe and effective SARS-CoV-2 virus for unvaccinated individuals is a highly urgent and important task to control the current pandemic.
In addition, overcoming this problem is very difficult due to the long time needed to develop a vaccine (about 18 months) and the mutation of the coronavirus's mobility.
As a new disease, COVID-19 has only recently begun to demonstrate its clinical cycle among thousands of patients.
In most cases, patients can recover without recurrence.
However, like SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has also been associated with high morbidity and mortality in the infected.
Therefore, the creation of a disease prediction model for the disease is necessary for healthcare agencies to prioritize their services, especially in places where resources are limited.
According to the clinical studies reported so far, the following factors may influence or be associated with the prognosis of COVID-19 patients (Table 33):
Age: Age is the most important factor in recovery time from SARS, as it is for COVID-19.
COVID-19 is more common in people aged 65-30 years and in a study of 8,866 people, 47.7% of patients were over 50 years old as mentioned above.
Patients who required intensive medical care were more likely to have had other medical conditions and were significantly older than the others (at a median age of 66 versus 51), suggesting age as a predictor of outcome in COVID-19 patients.
Gender: SARS-CoV-2 infects more men than women (0.31/100,000 vs. 0.27/100,000), as discussed earlier.
Other conditions: COVID-19 patients who require intensive care are more likely to have hypertension or heart failure.
Cardiac events were also the leading cause of death in SARS patients.
It has been reported that SARS-CoV-2 can also bind to ACE2-positive colangiocytes, which may cause infection in COVID-19 patients.
It should be noted that age and disease are fundamentally linked and may interfere with each other.
Abnormal laboratory results: The level of C-type responsive protein (CRP) in the blood indicates the severity of the infection or tissue damage and is an implicit predictor of disease, drug response, and eventual recovery.
A relationship between CRP levels and severity and prognosis of COVID-19 has also been suggested.
In addition, elevations in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatine kinase (CK) may be helpful in predicting the outcome.
These enzymes are widely present in many organs, especially in the heart and lungs, and are released during tissue breakdown.
Therefore, these are common symptoms of heart and liver failure.
Major clinical symptoms: To predict the outcome and complications of COVID-19, radiation of the chest and the temporal improvement of clinical symptoms should be considered along with other problems.
Use of steroids: As mentioned earlier, steroids are immune system disruptors and are often prescribed as adjuvants for infectious diseases to reduce the risk of infectious damage.
Because corticosteroid supplements were widely used in severe SARS patients, many survivors suffered from bone marrow death and anaemia with disability and a deteriorated quality of life.
Therefore, if necessary, it should be taken in patients with steroid deficiency and for a short period in COVID-19 patients.
Stress: As discussed earlier, during the COVID-19 outbreak many patients experience unusual anxiety as many endure prolonged quarantine periods, uncertainties, and the death of family members and friends.
It is necessary to provide long-term psychological counseling and support to these patients to help them overcome stress and return to normal life.
According to the surface studies done so far, COVID-19 has a different mode of transmission than SARS.
Except for recurrence in the lower respiratory tract, SARS-CoV-2 can effectively recur in the upper respiratory tract and show mild or no symptoms in the early stages of infection, as can other coronaviruses that cause the common cold.
Therefore, infected patients in the early stages or during the period of latency of the disease during daily activity can produce large amounts of virus, making it very difficult to control the epidemic.
In addition, SARS-CoV is transmitted when the infection becomes contagious, whereas most transmissions are not in the early stages.
Therefore, the current pandemic of COVID-19 is much more severe than the SARS pandemic and much more difficult to control.
Currently, many efforts are being made in China in the hope of disrupting the transmission chain of SARS-CoV-2, including the closure of Wuhan and surrounding cities and the continued quarantine of all people.
These actions have however significantly damaged the economy and other parts of the country, but the number of newly infected patients is decreasing, indicating a slowing of the epidemic.
The most optimistic estimate is that the outbreak will end by March and the downturn will last for 4 to 3 months.
Despite this, some experts are not so optimistic.
Paul Hunter and colleagues predict that COVID-19, which appears to be far more virulent than SARS, will not end in 2020.
Ira Longini and colleagues developed a model to predict the outcome of this pandemic and indicated that the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus could infect two-thirds of the world's population.
A Canadian group reported that SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus has been identified in two central turbinate regions and in the skull swabs of patients who had recovered and left hospital 2 weeks earlier, suggesting that the newly identified virus could be a flu-like inflammatory event.
At the same time, there have been promising signs in China as the number of new cases has decreased, indicating that current strategies may be effective.
Initially, Ebola was expected to cause up to one million infections and half a million deaths.
However, with quarantine and isolation, the disease is eventually brought under control.
It is possible that, like SARS-CoV, this SARS-CoV-2 could become more vulnerable to infection and eventually die or be transformed into a less pathogenic virus and remain with humans.
A comparison of the prevalence of COVID-19 with SARS and MERS is provided below (Fig. Fig. 55).
SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through mosquitoes or spores, and possibly through direct contact with contaminated material.
The virus has also been found in feces, which raises new fecal-oral transmission possibilities.
A new study of 138 cases indicates that 41% of the cases may have been infected in hospitals, with 17 patients having a history of the disease and 40 being health care workers.
Therefore, great care must be taken to protect people, especially healthcare workers, social workers, family members, co-workers and even passers-by who have been in contact with patients and infected people.
The first line of defense that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection is the use of a face mask; the use of both surgical masks and N95 respirators (channel numbers 1860 and 1860) helps to control the spread of viruses.
A surgical face mask prevents the transmission of droplets from an infected individual hidden in the air or attached to the surface of the particles where they can be transmitted to other people.
Despite this, only N95 masks (catalogue number 1860) can protect against respiratory viruses as small as 10 to 80 nanometers, and only 5% of viruses can be fully transmissible; SARS-CoV-2 is similar to SARS-CoV-2 in size and is about 85 nanometers in size.
Because the particles can spread even if five surgical masks are placed on top of each other, healthcare providers who have direct contact with patients should use N95 masks (channel number 1860) rather than surgical masks.
In addition to masks, healthcare workers should wear appropriate isolation cover to reduce exposure to viruses.
Viruses can also infect through the eyes.
In January 2020, a doctor was infected with SARS-CoV-2 even though he had used an N95 mask; the virus may have entered his body through an infection in his eyes.
Healthcare workers should therefore wear face shields and goggles when working with patients.
In public areas where there are cases, it is recommended that everyone wash more frequently with antiseptic soap, stay at home to self-quarantine, and limit contact with potentially infected people.
Three feet is the ideal distance to keep away from a sick person.
Such actions are an effective way to reduce the risk of infection and prevent the spread of the virus.
Although SARS-2 was introduced to the world as a new virus, it is very similar to the SARS coronavirus described on 7/1/2020 which was a major cause of the mutation in China based on extensive data from the SARS outbreak in 2003
However, as of 19 January 2020, the Wuhan CDC did not reassure the public that the virus has a low human-to-human transmission rate and limited human-to-human replication, and that there is no problem in preventing and eliminating the disease.
The message effectively calmed the public's fears and anxiety, especially as the entire country prepared for the Spring Festival, when the momentum was lost to control and contain the disease in the lowest-level outbreak in Wuhan.
Chinese disease control agencies and institutions may take this lesson and develop it better in the future.
For example, such agencies and institutions should (1) be more vigilant when issuing public statements, as any word to their colleagues could change their decisions and behavior; (2) be more sensitive and reactive to unusual noring information, rather than waiting for official medical reports or official statements; (3) be more sensitive to limiting and controlling outbreaks in the early stages rather than appeasing the public; and (4) have more active and effective training activities to increase public awareness of epidemics and improve community response and response systems.
The outbreak of COVID-19 is caused by a new virus called SARS-CoV-2 that started in December 2019
In less than 2 months, it has spread across China and to nearly 50 countries worldwide, as of this writing.
Because the virus is similar to SARS-CoV and the symptoms are similar between the coronavirus and SARS, the spread of the coronavirus has led to the perception that SARS is coming back.
However, there are some notable differences between COVID-19 and SARS, which are key to preventing and limiting the pandemic and treating patients.
COVID-19 affects older people more than younger people, men more than women, and the incidence and mortality rates are higher in older people than in younger people.
SARS is more deadly than COVID-19 (10.91% vs. 1.44%).
COVID-19 patients transmit the virus even when they have no symptoms, whereas SARS patients do the same when they have a severe illness, making it much more difficult to prevent and limit the spread of COVID-19 than SARS.
This partly explains why SARS-CoV-2 is much more rapidly and widely distributed than SARS-CoV-2.
The usual RNA test for SARS-CoV can be negative in some COVID-19 patients.
On the other hand, recovered patients may contract the virus again.
These findings dramatically increase the risk of spreading the virus.
With the rapid progress in COVID-19 research, several outstanding issues have been addressed, including:
Where did SARS-CoV originate?
Although 96% of the genetic commonality between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is bats, it is not possible to say that SARS-CoV-2 originated from bats.
What animal was the intermediary to transmit the virus from the original host, say a bat, to humans?
Without answering questions #1 and 2, we cannot effectively stop the transmission, and the outbreak can re-emerge at any time.
Although molecular assays and biochemical tests have shown that SARS-CoV-2 is associated with ACE2, how does the virus enter air cells and subsequently cause disease-related mutations?
Does the virus also bind to ACE2-related cells in other organs?
Without clear answers to these questions, we cannot achieve a rapid and accurate diagnosis and effective treatment.
How long will the plague last?
How does the virus genetically increase its genetic material during transmission between humans?
Will it become a global pandemic, like SARS, or will it resurface as a pandemic like influenza?
It's a big deal and it may take time to explore the questions above and many more.
However, whatever response is needed, we have no choice but to stop the pandemic as soon as possible and return to normalcy.
Animal-associated subunit of the human coronavirus
Mutation and adaptation have driven the evolution of coronaviruses and their host cells, including humans, for thousands of years.
Prior to 2003, two human coronaviruses were known to cause simple illnesses, such as the common cold and measles.
The spread of SARS and MERS, known as Middle East respiratory syndrome, has been a catalyst in demonstrating how devastating and life-threatening infection with one HCoV can be.
The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in central China in late 2019 re-emerged as a coronavirus and was noted for its high transmissibility, but reduced infection rate compared to SARS-CoV-2 in humans.
HCoVs are transmitted from animals to humans, and understanding the animal-related basis of HCoVs' variants may be useful.
Most HCoVs originate from bats, while they are not pathogenic.
Medium-sized hosts of HCoVs are known.
Identifying host animals directly helps prevent human disease.
The study of animal exposure to coronavirus cells may provide important insights into human disease in coronavirus.
In this analysis, we discuss the information on the 7 types of coronavirus, their discovery history, their animal-related origins, and their transmission between species.
Importantly, we will identify the variants of the coronavirus and differentiate between them in terms of viral evolution and genetic regulation.
The current pandemic of the coronavirus (COVID-19) is discussed in that article.
However, the requirements for successful host colonization vary and the virulence factor is determined by the severity of the disease.
The coronavirus species (CoVs), including the family Coronaviridae, comprise a group of single-stranded, invertebrate RNA viruses.
They are among the largest 26 to 32 kB genes among RNA viruses, called "CoVs", because of their crown-like shape under the skin.
In essence, the coronaviruses have unfragmented and re-transformed genes that have the same structure.
About two-thirds of the genes contain 2 large open subunits (ORF1a and ORF1b), which translate as: enzyme protein polymorphism pp1a and pp1ab.
Multivariate proteins use the more common non-structural protein 16 (NSP16), denoted by nsp1~16 (nsp1~16).
The remainder of the gene contains ORFs for structural proteins, including the head of the ribbon (S), the epithelium (E), the membrane (M) and the nucleoproteins (N).
A number of the base-containing proteins have been modified by the different base-containing CoVs.
Based on the different protein sequence, coronaviruses are divided into 4 types, alpha-coronaviruses, beta-coronaviruses, gamma-coronaviruses and delta-coronaviruses, among which beta-coronaviruses have the highest prevalence of coronaviruses and are further divided into 4 subtypes (C, B, A, and D).
Multidrug evidence has shown that bats and mosquitoes share the same genetic source for most alpha-coronavirus and beta-coronavirus, while birds are the main source of gamma-coronavirus and delta-coronavirus.
For thousands of years, coronaviruses have continuously crossed species barriers and combined as human pathogens.
To date, seven human HCoVs have been identified.
These include HCoV-229E and HCoV2NL63 alpha-coronaviruses.
The other 5 beta-CoVs include HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 usually cause mild symptoms, such as fever and diarrhea and/or diarrhea.
In contrast, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and the recently discovered SARS-CoV-2 are highly pathogenic, causing severe respiratory distress in most patients and are also more likely to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and pulmonary embolism.
The first severe infection of HCoV-229E, B814, was isolated from the respiratory tract of people who had normal feces in the mid-1960s.
Since then, more information has been gathered through intensive studies on HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, both of which cause transient symptoms.
Of course, it was widely accepted that infection with the coronavirus strain was generally preventable until the SARS outbreak.
The SARS outbreak of 2003 was one of the most devastating in history, with over 8,000 people infected, and a mortality rate of nearly 10%.[5]
10 years later, the outbreak of "MERS-CoV Middle East respiratory syndrome" caused a pandemic in the Arabian Peninsula with intermittent spread throughout the world.
The 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), later named SARS-CoV-2, is the source of the ongoing pandemic of the 2019 novel coronavirus COVID-19, which has killed 3,120 people and infected more than 91,000 as of March 3, 2020.
It has been called for and the world must prepare for the next SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.
All 7 HCoVs have their animal origin in bats, mice or domestic animals.
Various lines of evidence support the evolution of the ancestral lineage of all bat HCoVs, with viruses that are highly adaptive and non-pathogenic, but with significant genetic differences.
The COVID-19 pandemic has posed major medical, scientific, social and moral challenges to China and the world.
Tracing the animal-related bases of HCoVs provides a framework for understanding the natural history, management power and the underlying causes of species mutations and extinctions.
It could be a precursor and facilitator for the domestication of SARS-CoV-2 hosts, intermediates and boosters with important and useful aids to prevent future spread.
In this analysis, we provide a travelogue on the animal-related genome, inter-species transmission and pathogenicity of H-type coronaviruses.
In particular, we will identify and describe the general form of coronavirus, which is not pathogenic in its host cell nature, but becomes pathogenic after it is transferred to a new host cell.
We also discuss the evolution of the coronavirus, where the increase in its transmission rate is always accompanied by a decrease in its infection rate.
The consequences of the continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 are discussed in the text.
Animal-derived CoVs have been known since the late 1930s.
Prior to the isolation of B814 HCoV-229E infections from the respiratory tracts of those normally infected, different strains of the coronavirus were isolated from a variety of hosts, including rats, mice, cattle, pigs, cats and dogs.
In the last century, 7 strains of coronavirus have been identified.
A summary of the history of coronavirus discovery in chronological order, Table 1 contains information and guides.
The first HCoV-229E case was isolated in 1966 from patients with respiratory tract infections, and subsequently developed from WI-38 lung cells.
Infected HCoV-229E patients had the usual capital symptoms, which included: headache, nausea, fatigue and laryngitis, with fever and cough being seen in 10~20% of cases.
Later in 1967, HCov-OC43 was isolated from the nucleus and translocation patterns of the mammalian brain.
The symptoms and symptoms of HCov-OC43 infections appear to be the same as those caused by HCoV-229E, which are symptomatically distinguished from those of patients with severe respiratory disease, such as influenza A and rhinovirus.
Both HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 are distributed globally, primarily during the winter season in cold climates.
The life cycle of these viruses is usually less than a week, with about two weeks of illness following.
According to a voluntary study, healthy people infected with HCoV-229E have a common cold.
Only a few patients with low immunity will experience severe respiratory depression.
SARS, also known as the SARS-CoV-2 mycobacterium, was initially well-documented to be the source of the first pandemic HCoV in human history and the SARS-CoV infectious agent, the third HCoV to be discovered.
The first confirmed case of SARS dates back to late 2002 in Guangdong province in China.
The SARS epidemic has resulted in 8096 cases with 774 deaths spread across several countries and continents.
Despite the rapid spread, each case was expected to increase to two cases and the life cycle was 4 to 7 days, with the peak incidence of the virus occurring on the 10th day of illness.
Patients with SARS-CoV initially experience muscle pain, headache, nausea, and dizziness, followed by nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea as the final symptoms.
Lymphopenia, patients suffering from liver failure and elevated urea nitrogen levels, is the most common cause of laboratory abnormalities for SARS.
Pulmonary ulcers, diffuse cell lesions and macrophage growth are observed in SARS patients.
Approximately 20% to 30% of patients later require intensive care and manual ventilation.
In addition to the lower respiratory system, many organs including the digestive system, liver and kidneys suffer severe burdens that are always accompanied by cytokine storms that can be fatal for patients with compromised immune systems.
The virus was first isolated from a lung biopsy of a relative of a patient who had visited Hong Kong from Guangzhou.
Since then, a great deal of effort has been spent on HCoV research.
HCoV-NL63 was isolated from a seven-month-old child in the Netherlands in late 2004.
It was initially found to be prevalent in young children and adults as well as in patients with weakened immune systems and respiratory diseases.
Corneal infections, pink eye infections, and respiratory tract infections are commonly caused by HCoV-NL63.
Another independent study described the extraction of the same virus from a lotus sample of an 8-month-old child suffering from pulmonary fibrosis in the Netherlands.
Although it was first identified in the Netherlands, it has spread globally.
HCoV-NL63 is estimated to account for approximately 4.7% of respiratory infections and its incidence peaks in early summer, spring, and winter.
HCoV-NL63 is associated with the infection of the throat, also known as the cough.
In the same year, HCoV-HKU1 was isolated from a 71-year-old man who was hospitalized with pneumonia and bronchopneumonia in Hong Kong.
However, respiratory infections and community-acquired respiratory infections of HCoV-HKU1 were found to be associated with severe malaria infections.
HCoVs such as HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 have been detected worldwide and have been implicated in pulmonary hyperparathyroidism.
All four community-acquired HCoVs are well tolerated by humans and are generally less likely to mutate and become a major cause of disease, although incidents have occurred due to unknown causes such as in the rare cases of HCoV-NL63 sub-types recently identified as causing severe pneumonia in China.
In general, when these HCoVs are able to move into the human body and repair themselves inside the human body, they are also less lethal or pathogenic.
MERs-CoV was first isolated in 2012 in Saudi Arabia from the lungs of a 60-year-old patient who had developed respiratory complications and had renal dysrhythmia.
While most laboratory confirmed cases are in the Middle East, the airborne cases that have been reported due to close exposure are in several European countries and Tunisia.
In 2015, another outbreak occurred in South Korea with 186 confirmed cases.
The clinical manifestations of MERS are similar to those of SARS, distinguished by the development of acute respiratory distress syndrome.
Unlike SARS, most MERS patients also suffer from acute renal failure, which distinguishes MERS from HCoV-causing diseases.
More than 30% of patients have symptoms of the digestive system, including nausea and vomiting.
As of February 14, 2020, there were more than 2,500 laboratory-confirmed cases with a high mortality rate of 34.4% of MERS-CoV, making it one of the most destructive viruses known to humankind.
In the latter half of December 2019, a series of pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection was detected in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.
The World Health Organization has declared the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia as a global health emergency, also known as COVID-19.
As of 3 March 2020, 9,053 cases were confirmed globally with a mortality rate of 3.4 deaths.
The official death rate in Hubei, China is 4.2% while outside the country it is 1.2%
SARS-CoV-2 like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV causes severe respiratory infections with the presence of TB and cough and shortness of breath.
Some patients develop dizziness.
A lung infection is one of the most severe symptoms and can quickly progress to a respiratory complication.
Although SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are very similar due to the high levels of the 82% hormone sequence, they are grouped together in a different phylogenetic pattern.
SARS-CoV-2 appears to be less pathogenic but more prevalent than SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV.
SARS-CoV-2 infections are reported to be asymptomatic and may have contributed to the rapid spread of the virus worldwide.
By comparing and contrasting SARS-CoV-2 with the other six covids, the similarities and differences become interesting.
First, the life cycle and survival time of HCoVs are very similar.
In this respect, SARS-CoV2 follows the general patterns of all six other HCoVs.
Second, severe symptoms of COVID-19 are associated with SARS-CoV and four community-acquired HCoVs (e.g. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63)
On the other hand, SARS-CoV-2 infection exhibits the characteristics that are commonly seen in people infected with HCoVs, including mild, moderate, and even non-symptomatic symptoms.
On the other hand, a small group of COVID-19 cases can be detected in SARS-CoV infections, although the incidence is slightly lower.
Third, SARS-CoV-2 transmission demonstrates a critical example of the characteristics of both HCoVs and SARS-CoVs that are transmitted by the community.
On the other hand, transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is as high as the rate of community-acquired HCoVs.
On the other hand, it remains to be determined whether the transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2 decreases after transmission to humans as in the cases of SARS-CoV-2 and Mars-CoV-2.
Finally, the same thing as HCoVs and SARS-CoV-2 can be found in fecal samples.
Whether oral transmission of SARS-CoV-2 plays an important role in the SARS-CoV-2 virus, at least in some circumstances, remains to be seen in future research.
It is also interesting to consider whether SARS-2 can arise in seasons as community-acquired HCoVs.
The characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 that are transmissible, infectious and persistently spreading after entry into the body will influence the final outcome of the current COVID-19 pandemic.
All four community-acquired HCoVs cause moderate symptoms that humans have adapted to.
On another note, it may also be true that humans have adapted well to these four HCoVs.
In other words, both could survive the HCoV pandemic.
HCoVs that cause disease in humans and those that are HCoV-infected are extinct.
For this to happen, HCoVs must multiply in the population and reach a sufficient level to allow the organism to adapt to jumps that inhibit cell-mediated rejection factors.
This means that the more spread SARS-CoV-2 becomes, the more human beings will have to face a lot of challenges to fully adapt to humans.
If well-adapted, transmission to humans is difficult to prevent by quarantine or other infection control measures.
For many years, all four types of community-acquired CO2 have been passed from the common stock to the population.
These viruses don't need a storage facility.
However, the causes of SARS-CoV-2 and MERS-CoV infections have not been well studied in humans and their transmission to humans is unlikely to continue.
They need to be distributed in living cells and also seek to spread out to human targets, which may be one or more intermediate and extended host cells.
SARS-CoV-2 has characteristics similar to both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV and all four HCoVs that have been identified by the community.
It is highly transmissible and is similar to HCoVs that are currently being transmitted by the Lakota people.
However, community-acquired HCoVs are more likely to cause disease.
It remains to be seen whether it will fully adapt to humans and spread throughout the human body without a host or intermediate host.
Before discussing the biological origins of HCoVs, let us discuss the definitions and characteristics of the development, nature, intermediate storage and growth of HCoVs.
An organism can develop a host for HCoV if it is infected with a nearby precursor element and exchanges homology at the level of the nucleotide chain.
The ancestors of the virus are always well adapted and not transmitted to the host.
Also, the host water is sheltered from the H-coronavirus continuously and for a long time.
In both cases, the hosts are naturally infected and naturally host for HCoV or the virus's pathogen.
Conversely, if HCoV identified itself with a host medium prior to or near its identification in humans, it would not have adapted well to the new host and the pathogen transmission.
These salty intercellular intermediates can serve as a source of live human infection and also play a role in salt cell proliferation by allowing the virus to increase in size over time and then transfer to the host to cause further human infection.
HCoVs can cross the infection barrier if they cannot support self-transmission within the host cell.
In contrast, HCoVs are also able to adapt to intermediate host cells and even establish a long-term host.
In this case, the central salt cell becomes the natural carrier salt cell.
The data is up-to-date and somehow the SARS case profile is linked to the surviving history.
Analysis of the number of cases reveals that the live anti-SAHC variant lgG is more prevalent than in the general population.
The palm-top masked cats (P. paguma larva) and raccoon dogs living in flea markets were initially shown to transmit SARS-CoV as well as viruses that are nearly identical to SARS-CoV.
This indirectly supported the fact that no SARS cases were reported after all P. g. larvae were eliminated from the markets.
Although it has been shown that P. g. larvati is a wild cat or farm cat that has no contact with market disturbances, it is more likely to be SARS-CoV negative, suggesting that P. larvati is only a host of the host, but not the SARS-CoV-2 natural store.
It is estimated that 80% of the various crustaceans in the markets of Guangzhou have been vaccinated with anti-SARS antibiotics, if there is a small mammal polyp that serves as an intermediate in the increase of the SARS virus.
All of these appear to be the end of the SARS-CoV mutations.
What distinguishes the study is that the membrane on the host cell of SARS-CoV-2 is not related to the SARS bat, the term SARS refers to the bat Rhinolpheus CoV HKU3 (SARSr-RH-BatCoV HKU3) that exists in bats in China.
These bat species are positive for antibodies against SARS-CoV and the SARSr-RH-BatCoV HKU3 gene sequence.
It and other bat-like Cove share 88-92% of the nucleotide equivalence series with SARS-CoV.
This scientific study has revealed a new idea that bats' host cells are the cause of human diseases.
Several SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoVs) have been identified in bats, but only one known as WIV1 can be isolated as a live virus.
The enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is identified as the receptor for SARS coronavirus.
WIV1 was derived from samples of the feces of bats that showed ACE2 was a parasite and the Pygmy cat used larvae and manure as a receptor for cell growth.
Most important of all, the recovery rate of SARS patients is likely to be below the WIV1 threshold.
Thus, WIV1 represents the closest pre-coronavirus relationship to SARS in bats, with a 95% nucleotide distribution in the mating sequence.
However, the high degree of similarity between the two viruses has led to the general belief that WIV1 is not the direct parent of the SARS-CoV virus and bats are not the direct host of SARS-CoV.
Genetic analysis of the Merseyside group has been carried out for the same group as the CoV-HKU4 parasite and the CoV-HKU5 parasite.
Bat-like CoV-HKU4 and MERS-CoV take advantage of the same host receptor, the DPP4 receptor, to enter the virus.
The polymeric RNA sequences from MERS-CoV are closer in biological terms to the similar bat corona found in Europe and Africa.
So far, no Martian has been able to be found in the wild.
Mars-Kov and its related variants share only 87% of the core guidance sequence with Cove-HKU25.
However, blind Saturdays may not miss a fast Mars-Cove.
On the other hand, studies in the Middle East have shown that unicorn camels have specific antibodies to the Mars-CoV virus, similar to those of camels native to the Middle East and some African regions.
The identity of the Mas-Cov virus has now been discovered and isolated from the single-coupled ostrich, which is infected by respiration, further demonstrating that the ostrich is a host unit for SARS-CoV.
It has also been observed that overall symptoms are mild but significantly increased in August due to the Mars-Cov infection.
It has been observed that infected camels transmit the virus not only through the respiratory tract but also through the faeces, which is the same route of transmission for bats.
However, there are still some cases on Mars where there have been many cases and no contact with previously symptomatic camels, suggesting the source was human-to-human transmission or the immune response of a small unknown organism that had a Mars-Cove.
SARS-CoV-2 has a 96.2% nucleotide similarity to the strain COV-RaTG13 isolated from the Rhinoceros monocytosis strain.
As with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the differential regulation between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is very good for family relationships.
As stated, blind bats may not be immediate hosts for SARS-CoV-2 until known bats are found in the future.
It is assumed that, in the future, animal hosts for SARS-CoV-2 will be sold or killed among wildlife in the Hunan seafood wholesale market, with the initial COVID-19 cases supported, indicating the full animal-to-human transmission phenomenon.
Some of the studies that have been done on the regulation of metagenomic genes have suggested that there is a group of sub-human mammals known as pangolins (Minus javanica) and that it may be related to the Javelin strain of SARS-CoV-2.
The genomes of these newly discovered CoVs show an 85-92% nucleotide-like sequence with SARS-CoV-2.
However, they are equally related to RATG13 to the 90% known level of nucleotide sequencing.
They provide two age-lineages for both SARS-CoV-2 viruses in the genetic tree, one of which releases more RBD receptors than SARS-CoV-2, with 97 percent of the amino acid sequence.
In complete contrast, the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 are very different, although higher sequence homology rates are widely available.
Previous studies of pangolin disease have also led to infection with viral DNA fragments from lung samples, which have been shown to be similar to SARS-CoV-2.
This research incorporated a variety of methods and individual attention to the genome sequence was captured in 86.3 percent of the entire viral genome.
We cannot ignore that pangolin is one of the good hosts of SARS-CoV-2.
However, there is still no evidence to know where the primary source of SARS-CoV-2 viruses in humans came from despite the presence of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 viruses in humans.
However, the distance between SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 is shorter than that between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolin SARS-CoV-2 homologs.
The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in bats, penguins and other mammal species is widely ignored.
With the highest sequence homology found in RBDs between SARS-CoV-2 and pangolins, SARS-CoV-2 related beta-CoVs, SARS-CoV-2 and RaTG13 spread the highest genome-wide sequence homology.
It is generally believed that the high degree of convergence between SARS-CoV-2 pangolin RBDs associated with SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-2 is due to overlapping selection-development.
The inverse-claiming advantage of the merger between Pangolin SARS-CoV-2 is related to Beta-CoV and RaTG13 in the third animal species.
As an evolutionary force, fusion is very common among beta-cells.
The assessment team is still outside the SARS-CoV-2 genotyping region.
In addition, a high proportion of infectious HCoVs, the zoonotic strains HCoV-229, HCo43, HC0V-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 have also been tested.
Evidence from the evolutionary history has shown that both HCoV-NL63 and HCOv-229E are derived from the bat corona, when the HCoV-OC43 family and HCoV-HKU1 were found in mammals.
A bat coronavirus, also known as ARCoV.2 (anti-coronavirus) has been detected in North America that is found on a bat form closely related to HCoV-NL63.
On the other hand, HCo-229E was long associated with another comet, Cove, named Hyposidors/Hankwan/19/2008. It was discovered in Ghana when the wasps were suspected of being a central host.
For clarity, the most recent information on the origin of the viruses known as HCoV is summarized in the form of Tables I and II.
Evolutionary history analysis has provided clues to the occurrence of transgenic transmission of HCoVs throughout history.
When HCo-OC43 passed from animals to humans to infect humans in domestic feral populations in the late 1890s, the disease was recorded to have spread from respiratory distress.
History of airborne transmission of HCoV-229E is less clear
Alpha-Covs bats are most closely related to the HCO-229E found.
Among them is the Covi-Alpa Alps.
Some evidence supports direct transmission of the virus from bats to humans.
First, humans rather than alpacas (an animal similar to sheep but larger than a goat) may have had contact with blind bats in a similar type of environment.
Instead, humans are closely related to alpacas.
Second, HCoV-229E is very different from the related bat coronaviruses and does not cause disease in bats, whereas the alpha coronavirus is the cause of respiratory disease in infected animals.
Finally, alpha-coronaviruses of the Alps have not been detected in cattle.
Therefore, the possibility that algae may have transmitted HCoV-299E-related human alpha-CoVs cannot be ruled out.
In fact, mosquitoes are a direct cause of human viral diseases such as rabies virus, Ebola virus, Navaho virus and Handra virus.
It is therefore not surprising that HCoV-229E can be transmitted directly to humans by the blind fly.
On the other hand, while the bat coronavirus alpha acts as a gene pool for the H.299E coronavirus, the algae and the host may act as a central cell that transmits viruses to humans, just as in the case of MERS-COV.
MERS-CoV serves as a prime example for the transmission of a half-breed, from bat to monkey to monkey to human.
The evolution of MERS-COV from bats is initially known to be determined and further strengthened by fossil findings.
It is clear that the aquatic blind bat is rich in viral strains for fragmentation mutation over time and translocation between species.
Aging, the ability to colonize the host, proximity, and the ability to fly are all factors that make bats "virus-preventing".
In the Triassic, MERS-COV has been identified as a single-capped camel for decades.
It is well suited to camels that have evolved from a central cell to a stable and natural cell store.
MERS-CoV is a highly contagious disease with a low rate of mutation in the DNA of the eye that is more common in these animals.
Transmission of the parasite to humans is an accident, and humans will eventually become MERS-COV's dead host cells, when transmission cannot continue.
Unlike the role of camels in transmitting MERS-COV, the role of pangolins, if anything, was different in transmitting SARS-COV-2.
In particular, Beta-Covis pangolin is a highly contagious cause of disease in pangolins.
They may eventually become dead cells for SARS-CoV-2 related beta-coronaviruses, similar to the SIVs in the SARS-CoV situation.
A range of possibilities for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from animals to humans should be explored or identified in future studies.
First, bats can host SARS-CoV-2 related viruses that are highly resistant to SARS-CoV-2.
Humans may share habitat with bats through meat markets or coal mining.
Second, pangolins may be the cell nucleus of a newly identified SARS-CoV-2 related virus.
Humans have been exposed to viruses through their meat trade and hunting.
All of these mammals, especially domestic animals, may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2.
Testing domestic and wild animals for antibodies has been discontinued.
Third, as noted above, recombination and adaptation of SARS-CoV-2 may have occurred in a third species that has had both exposure to bats and pangolins.
The search for the original SARS-CoV-2 animal is still ongoing.
In addition to the different types of animal cells, there are three main reasons viruses are equally important for facilitating crossing of organism boundaries.
First of all, the average rate of RNA transcription is high.
Compared to other single-stranded RNA viruses, the estimated replication rate of Cove is listed as "medium" to "high" with an average replication rate of 10-4 replications per year per site.[2] Cove is in the process of adapting to new host populations.
The codes have evidence-based read-on-reading of the RNA-binding enzyme oxoribonuclease, deleting any of the results from the boundaries of the highly modified and debilitating and deworming or deworming.
In particular, remdesivir nucleotide analogues are known to inhibit the coronavirus by preventing it from entering the outer nucleus and the RNA promoter and RNA promoter enzymes.
Remdesivir is one of the SARS-CoV-2 antiviral drugs being tested in a laboratory-based unit.
However, the average COVID survival rate is approximately one million times higher than that of the cottages.
In addition, the bounce rate is often higher when the covids do not fit well with the host cells.
Compared to SARS-CoV-2 with a high bounce rate, SARS-CoV-2 has a clearly lower bounce rate, suggesting a higher degree of adaptation.
It is thought to have adapted in a similar way to other cells close to humans.
However, for SARS-CoV-2, this also applies to MERS-CoV, which was well adapted to single-capped camels.
Theoretically, a different part of the genetic makeup of the virus would lead to the development of vaccines and antivirals against SARS-CoV-2 that are ineffective.
Second, the large RNA genome in the coronavirus makes it more difficult to adapt than the transgenic genome to jump and recombine, and thus more likely to evolve into a cohesive form, which is beneficial for the integration of new viruses when conditions are favorable.
This is supported by the unique parallel reading interface and the way the protein acts on coding in the final third of the genome.
Third, covids continuously change their shells randomly during RNA splicing by a specific 'selection-replication' mechanism.
In a cell that serves as a fusion vessel, jumps often occur at the end of the ribbon during copying of RNA.
RNAs that are identical in length and are subgenomic may recombine to form new covids.
Evidence of phylogenetic nature of recombination has been found in both HCOV-HKU1 and HCOV-OC43, as well as in animal coronaviruses such as bat SL-COV and bat COV-HKU9.
Host-virus mergers are spread through contact.
In addition to the three causes of viral infection described above, the integration of viruses with a cell door is another factor that affects their spread among organisms.
In this, the Sars-Kov formation is taken as a typical example, which also shows evidence for positive selection across the transmission function.
Given the comparative analysis between human and SARS-CoV-2 isolates, SARS-CoV-2 is thought to have been able to experience rapid adaptation in different cells, specifically with jumps in the RBD of the S protein.
Generally, the RBD of the S-protein covid binds to the cell membrane and is specifically selected by the cell antigen response.
In SARS-CoV, the RBD is a 318- to 510-amino acid sequence on the S1 fragment that binds to human ACE2 as a precursor to the virus's entry.
The SARS-CoV RBD can recognize ACE2 derivatives from different animals, including bats, civets, mice and raccoon dogs, allowing transmission of the virus to the host.
In fact, only 6 amino acid residues have been observed that differ from the human and virus isolates of RBD and 4 of these were stable on the receptor-interacting with the ACE2 receptor.
SARS-CoV-2 has a jump from K479N to S487T in RBD, which may increase the ability of the spike protein to interact with the human ACE2 receptor.
In other words, the substitution of these two amino acids may be critical to the virus's fitness for humans.
It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 shares the same cell line with SARS-CoV.
It shares 30% of the differences between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV-1 in the S1 protein S unit, which is the co-transcriptional adaptation of the S protein with human ACE2 that has been altered.
Indeed, cryo-analyses of EM suggest that this binding potential is 10 to 20 times higher than that of the human ACE2 and S ARS-KOVS protein.
It is also uncertain whether any co-receptors can be required for transmission of SARS-CoV-2
Surprisingly, NL63 coronaviruses also mix with ACE2 but with a different S subunit.
Other HCoV receptors exist, such as the N-aminopeptidase enzyme for HCoV-229E, and the 9-O-silicon-acid for HCoV-OC43.
They may be responsible for the successful uptake of CoVs in humans following this interspecies transmission from animals that have the disease.
Despite these cellular receptors, the outcome of transmissions between coronavirus strains is governed by other cellular factors that are independent and specific.
The spread of host proteins between humans and natural host sites of coronaviruses such as bats, camels and reptiles may pose a barrier to such transmissions between the suns.
The coronavirus must invade the host's independent host and remove the host's restrictive host in order for interstellar transmission to be successful.
In this regard, the important chemical resistance of the region, where the virus is located and exposed, is identified and described.
A broad, neutral gene-binding sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using state-of-the-art CRISPR gene technology may be produced.
The coronavirus mix: back to basics
The diversity and diversity of the coronavirus bats provides a good opportunity for HCoVs to interbreed.
Thus, the coronavirus mosquitoes do the same as CoVs.
However, rapid mutation and genetic regulation also drive the evolution of the coronavirus and serve as two important steps in the process.
For example, the acquisition or loss of protein-rich cells has the potential to alter the abundance of samples.
Among the proteins of SARS-CoV-2, the discontinued ORF8 mutation is important to humans, whereas the SARS-CoV-2 related bat virus was isolated, but it was found to mutate into the ORF8 protein.
The extinction property of the 29-nucleotide SARS-CoV, at the beginning of the pandemic, was found in isolated material.
This fading and browning, divides ORF8 into ORF8a and ORF8b and is thought to be a mutation that improves cell turnover.
In addition, SARS-CoV-2 has a history of similarity to alpha and gamma coronaviruses, which have a greater number of regulatory regions than RNA-dependent RNA polymers.
The location of these alignments has been identified in nsp9, most of nsp10, and a subset of nsp14.
Similarly, it has been shown that the MERS-CoV pandemic has experienced the same adaptation at different times, occurring in Saudi camels.
In addition to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, the arrangement was also observed in coronavirus, which was genetically mismatched with other animal coronaviruses.
It should be noted that artificial diagnosis can lead to unwanted and widespread genetic mutations, which are likely to result in viral transmission in a targeted area of the body, such as the immune system.
An example of such effects is the complete loss of ORF4 of the primary coronavirus E-229, which results in a 2-nucleotide degradation.
While the uncorrupted ORF4 can be observed in bats and the related HCoV 229 E, the alpha version of the coronavirus exhibits a complementary encyclotoid, resulting in a replication.
The latter is that the evolution of the coronavirus is controlled by its genes through identification.
Symptomlessness, or the presence of mild symptoms, was diagnosed when bats were infected with coronavirus, indicating transmission between coronavirus and bats.
It appeared that the bat was physically and biologically similar, well adapted to the coronavirus.
For example, the absence of the respiratory response in bats, in a significant proportion, was less pathogenic than the coronavirus.
In addition, the natural killer activity of the bat cell is suppressed, due to a decrease in the natural cell receptor NKG2/CD94 and a low co-reciprocity rate of the I-chain microarray.
Also, the high rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is reflected in the high rate of metabolic activity of the bat, can inhibit the growth and replication of the coronavirus and affect the enzyme acrobonuclease, thus producing a specific strain of the virus, which has a high pathogenicity rate when it enters new cells.
Other patient coronaviruses also enter the system, leading to increased protein, or protein specificity, transport into the host.
Thus, it is no coincidence that three coronaviruses have been combined in the past two decades.
Coronaviruses are not a disease and cause mild symptoms in cells such as bats and camels.
They are rapidly growing and are absorbed without any strong immune response by the host.
The mystery of why they carry and don't carry symptoms is there; and what causes the infection to be so severe in humans.
The acute symptoms are usually due to a strong immune response and activation and high protein turnover rates, the stronger the immune system, the more severe the lung damage.
Conversely, in asymptomatic carriers, the immune system response is isolated from the proliferation and immunization of CoV.
The same strategy of blocking the immune response may be useful for therapy against SARS-CoV-2).
The rate of response of the cell to the anti-viral protein is very strong in bats.
Thus, the administration of cell-derived proteins, at least in the early stages of SARS-CoV-2 in humans, should be effective.
However, the activity of the NLRP3 protein variant is not known in bats.
According to the logic, the presence of the NLRP3 protein complex with MCC950 could be useful for the treatment of coronaviruses.
The combination of SARS-CoV-2 brings the new form, where SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV arise.
While the beta-CoV has a 95% nucleotide affinity with the SARS-CoV, the parvovirus also has a 96% nucleotide affinity with the SARS-CoV-2.
While civet and other market animals have been found to have SARS-CoV-2 homologous virus, immediate and rapid intermediate host cells for SARS-CoV-2 have not been identified.
The coexistence of the corona virus in the pangolin animal with SARS-CoV-2 has been found, suggesting that the pangolin animal may act as a medium host, or that the pangolin virus may be able to transmit genetic fragments of genes to the latest version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
Although questions remain, there is no evidence that SARS-CoV-2 is man-made, either intentionally or accidentally.
The coronavirus has emerged due to the recent spread of SARS-CoV-2.
Studies on coronaviruses in bats and other animals have dramatically changed our perception of the importance of zoonotic and animal-to-human transmission of coronaviruses.
Recent evidence has shown that SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 have a primate origin and have been transmitted to humans through the medium host.
Since SARS-CoV infection arises from human-animal contact in markets, the closure of these markets and the killing of the civets would have effectively ended the SARS epidemic.
For this reason, and logically, pangolin animals should be eliminated from the markets, to prevent animal-related transmission, which is due to the discovery of the beta-CoV gene that is closely related to SARS-CoV-2.
However, whether and how SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted to humans by pangolins and other mammals remains to be determined in future studies.
On the other hand, MERS-CoV has been around for a long time.
These camels are an important means of transportation, as they are the main source of meat, milk, furs and fodder for the local population.
They are widely distributed in the Middle East and Africa.
It is therefore not possible to sacrifice all camels in order to control MERS, as was done in China's wildlife markets, in order to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2.
To stop the spread of MERS, a global effort will need to be made to develop an effective vaccine for MERS-CoV for camels, along with an infection control measure.
While we cannot escape this virus, a new genetic variant could be the cause of its spread.
Many animal-based coronaviruses are endemic in mountainous areas.
In particular, the coronavirus strain containing animal embryos is heterogeneous.
There is a high probability that the animal coronaviruses evolve and adapt, resulting in the combination of novel coronaviruses that are more likely to be transmissible and/or lethal to humans in the future.
The practice of eating wild animals in some parts of China should be banned to reduce unnecessary human-animal contact.
With the emergence of SARS, MERS and COVID-19, better preparedness and response planning will be required.
In fact, many viruses have been around for a long time on this planet.
They stay in their natural habitat until they have a chance to disperse.
Although bats have many features that help spread the virus, the chances of human contact with bats and other wild animals can be reduced if people are taught to avoid them.
Continued monitoring of mammals is required to better understand the ecology of CoVs and their natural hosts, which is an evidence of the benefits of preventing animal-to-human transmission and future spread.
Finally, the most effective way to prevent animals from transmitting disease is to keep humans away from habitats that are the natural habitat of animals that carry the virus.
A number of theories of the animal origin of SARS-CoV-2 are still missing.
First, if bats transmit a SARS-CoV-2 counterpart to pangolins, it would be good to see in what conditions bats and pangolins share the same environment.
Second, if bats play a role beyond direct transmission to humans, the nature of human-bat interactions should be determined.
Third, if a tertiary mammal behaves as a primitive host, how it interacts with different species of humans, bats and penguins, must be explained.
Finally, since many mammals include domestic animals, they may be susceptible to SARS-CoV-2, and surveillance and testing for infection should be undertaken.
It is expected that SARS-CoV-2 or ancestral viruses that are closely related to it will be detected in the future in the natural environment of vertebrates.
Ongoing research is uncovering the path of SARS-CoV-2 in animals in this area, as well as attempts to eliminate and control the coronavirus in humans.
The updated COVID-19 diagnostic criteria for "suspected case" and "confirmed case" are required.
On February 6, 2020, our team published a rapid advisory guide for the diagnosis and treatment of the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), this guide presents our experience and highlights the challenges facing the pandemic worldwide.
However, 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge is gradually increasing based on ongoing research findings and clinical experience; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
In this article, we responded to a comment about our guidelines and provided the latest diagnostic criteria for "suspicious cases" and "confirmed cases" according to the latest diagnostic and treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (seventh edition) published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China.
In December 2019, the new coronavirus 2019 (2019-nCoV) became pandemic, now officially called the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-2019) and the virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization officially declared COVID-19 a global pandemic.
In order to combat SARS-CoV-2 disease, our team developed a rapid advisory guide published online in Military Medical Research on February 6, 2020.
It has attracted considerable attention since its publication.
Note Although COVID-19 is a new disease, our awareness and knowledge are gradually increasing based on the findings of ongoing research and clinical practice; therefore, diagnosis and treatment strategies are constantly being updated.
For example, the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 published by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China (http://www.nhc.gov.cn/), between January 16, 2020 and March 3, 2020, published a total of seven issues with some contexts significantly altered.
Now our guides came up with a comment from Zhou et al., who provided a simple suggestion of their own clinical experience.
Their work provided new evidence for our guidelines and a welcome signal for this global pandemic.
We support their important work and thank them.
However, their work needs to be updated according to the latest COVID-19 diagnostic and treatment guidelines (Test Version 7) and new studies.
According to version VII (3 March 2020), to ensure that a suspected case should combine each of the characteristic items of the epidemiologic history with two items of the clinical symptom to perform a comprehensive analysis, or it should include three items of the clinical symptom if the epidemiologic history is unclear:
History of epidemiology: (1) Travel history or residence in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 cases were reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (2) history of contact with a SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive central-oxygen assay); (3) history of contact with patients with respiratory tract symptoms in Wuhan and surrounding areas, or other communities where COVID-19 was reported in the last 14 days before the onset of symptoms; (4) history of contact with a confirmed group of cases (>=2 cases with and/or respiratory tract symptoms reported in a small area, such as a home, office, school, etc., for 2 weeks).
Clinical symptoms: (1) respiratory tract symptoms and/or symptoms; (2) with features of COVID-19 disease radiation; (3) a white blood cell count that shows a normal count, a low count, or a decreased count of lymphocytes in the early stages.
The diagnosis of a confirmed case must be based on a suspected case where there is either a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 or serological evidence as follows: (1) a positive real-time PCR test for SARS-CoV-2; (2) a complete viral genome sequence showing high viral identity of the novel coronavirus; (3) a positive for IgM specific antibody and IgG specific antibody for SARS-CoV-2 in a serum test; or a change in the SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG concentration from negative to positive, or a =>4 times increase in recovery over the thirteen-fold phase.
We can see that real-time PCR testing for nucleic acid from the respiratory tract or blood sample was added to volume II (January 18, 2020) and volume III (January 22, 2020).
Diagnosis from blood samples was added in volume 4 (January 27, 2020) and volume 5 (February 8, 2020); and then serological evidence was added in volume 7.
These modifications were based on the ongoing work of researchers to search for a nucleic acid detection kit for rapid diagnosis, with respiratory tract samples including blood samples, which increased the availability of different samples, and supported the generation of positive antibody specific to the assay parameters.
In addition, there is increasing evidence to suggest that we should be aware of both typical asymptomatic and asymptomatic disease.
Therefore, the chart of Zhou et al. should be updated, as they considered the person who had no clinical symptoms as "low risk".
The diagnostic system should also be further explored in clinical practice and research.
As a result, we hope more direct evidence will be available and ask readers to comment.
To identify "suspected cases" and "confirmed cases", we recommend tracking and adhering to the latest guidelines for their own countries.
Our team will update our guidelines for providing assistance in a timely manner.
Bangladesh reports five new COVID-19 deaths, the highest daily number
Finally, Bangladesh confirmed five new deaths from COVID-19 that day.
This is the highest number of deaths in a single day from the virus.
Yesterday, the Bangladesh Institute for Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) reported the number of infected cases, with 114 active cases and 33 recovered cases remaining at home.
A total of 17 deaths were recorded.
In an online statement, the IEDCR director, Mr. Mirza Sabrina Flora, said the deaths were four men and one woman.
According to Dr Mirzdar, two cases were over the age of 60, two were between 51 and 60 years and one case was 41-50 years old.
He also said that the victims were from Dhaka.
The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 a global pandemic on 11 March.
A health official told Anadolu Agency, a local news agency, that one of the dead was Jalal Saifur Rahman, the director of the Bangladesh Committee to Combat Corruption, who was being treated at the Kuwait Matri Hospital.
On Friday, in an online video announcement, Minister of Transportation, Roads and Bridges, Obaidul Khader, said that public transportation will be suspended for longer than planned, until this coming Saturday.
The suspension of public transportation initially began on March 26 and was scheduled to end on Friday, April 4.
The transportation of essential supplies -- medicine, fuel and food -- is still going on.
The first recorded case of COVID-19 in Bangladesh was on 8 March, in two people who had returned from Italy, including the spouse of one of them.
By March 19, the three had recovered.
SARS-CoV-2 has caused more than one million infections worldwide
As of Thursday, the total number of cases of the novel coronavirus disease SARS-CoV-2 worldwide has exceeded one million, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.
At least 52,000 deaths have been linked to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
The significant change came on the same day that Malawi reported its first coronavirus infection and Zambia reported its first coronavirus-related death.
On Friday, North Korea claimed to be one of the few countries in the world without a coronavirus outbreak.
As of yesterday, the World Health Organization reported 1,051,635 confirmed cases, including 79,332 cases in the twenty-four hours before 10 a.m. central European time (0800 UTC) on 4 April.
In the United States, more than 244,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported, with at least 5,900 deaths.
CBS reported that more than 1,000 deaths in the United States were attributed to the coronavirus on Wednesday, citing data from Johns Hopkins University.
Around the world, countries have announced more drastic measures to stop the disease from spreading.
On Thursday, Moscow's ruler, Sergei Sobyanin, extended his stay in his home until May 1.
On a national level, President Vladimir Putin announced that Russians will be paid without going to work until April 30.
The Portuguese parliament voted to extend the national emergency for 15 days; the vote was passed by 215 votes in favour, ten against, and one abstention.
Saudi Arabia extended the curfew in the holy cities of Mecca and Medina for the whole day; previously, the curfew was only from 3pm to 6am.
Thailand planned to implement a curfew between 10 pm and 4 am.
Ohio Governor Mike Dewayne announced that the state had extended the stay-at-home order until May 1.
Shops in Australia are reducing the amount of toilet paper per transaction.
On Monday and Friday evening, Australian retail chains Woolworths and Coles reduced their purchase limitation for Clinique Towels to two packs and one packet per transaction across all stores nationwide.
ALDI also imposed a clean-up curfew on Monday.
These restrictions were posted as messages on the doors and the series' Facebook page.
It was reported that consumers were buying more due to fear of COVID-19 in the event that people needed to self-isolate.
On Wednesday, Woolworths restricted the purchase of Clink's toilet to one package per order.
These changes followed the previous four-pack restriction announced by Wolverines and Coles on March 4 and 5.
Coles, in his media release on March 8, stated that the effectiveness of the four-pack restriction, "still sells out most stores within one hour of delivery", and called the requirement "unpredictable", while ALDI, in a Facebook post on Tuesday, called it "unpredictable".
Sales last week were "on the rise", according to Woolworths spokesman.
Last week, Costco in Canberra changed the recommended amount to two packages.
To compensate for the shortage, Coles ordered more packages from suppliers and increased delivery times, and Valuers ordered more items, while ALDI delivered equipment for an early delivery scheduled for Wednesday.
Russell Zimmerman, CEO of the Australian Retailers Association, said retailers are trying to increase the quantity of goods, but local council restrictions on truck delivery times are making it difficult.
It predicts rising production costs, as suppliers try to meet demand, and with less precision.
On Tuesday, ALDI announced that following the early availability of the items, some stores will not be able to offer special Wednesday nights.
In a News.com.au report, Dr. Gary Mortimer, a retail expert at the Queensland University of Technology, said that stores are stocking up every night.
He noted that the toilet clamp is a bulk item, which results in a small amount of items in terms of quantity, and, when sold, makes a very empty shelf, making the feeling of scarcity difficult.
According to ABC News, Russell Zimmerman said that Coles and Woolworths have an opinion [that] if there are too many on the shelves, if products like toilet cleaners and cleaning products [are] bought and quarantined, then you might reduce the risk.
The manufacturer of the recycled toilet clothing Who Gives a Crap said Wednesday that it was missing.
Kimberly-Clark, which makes the Kleenex toilet clamp, and Solaris Paper, which makes Sorbent, insisted they worked 24/7 to protect supplies, according to a News.com.au report.
Domain.com, a real estate website, reported that some home sellers were offering free toilet clutches to the first add-on providers in Melbourne, when fewer add-ons were made as sellers had more time throughout the Labor Day weekend.
The Thursday edition of NT News, Darwin's daily print newspaper, contained eight pages of text to be cut out and used as toilet paper.
Stores were hesitant to impose restrictions, as reported by ABC Australia on 3 March, which said they had no plans to impose restrictions on purchases.
Russell Zimmerman also said that other products are in high demand, such as masks, detergents, detergents, liquid soap and irons.
Also, outside Australia, British online supermarket Okado was noted on Sunday evening to have limited sales of Andres' toilet clutch to two 12-packets.
COVID-19 is declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization
On Wednesday, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the ongoing spread of COVID-19 - the disease caused by the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 - as a global pandemic.
Although the term "pandemic" refers only to how widespread a disease is, not to how dangerous specific cases are, the WHO notes that governments should take action:
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that all countries could still turn the tide of the pandemic.
If countries can diagnose, screen, treat, isolate and monitor their own people, they will respond.
We are very concerned about the high levels of transmission and severity and the high level of non-adaptation.
According to Dr. Tom Friedan, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the pandemic is "not predictable".
He said, in a CNN article in February, "Except for influenza, no other respiratory virus has been traced from its origin to its continued global spread".
Gebreyesus shared a similar view, saying "We have never seen a pandemic caused by a coronavirus before".
And he said, "And we've never seen an epidemic that can be controlled simultaneously before".
The new status as a global pandemic follows the WHO's decision in January to declare the pandemic a public health emergency of international concern.
The director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the outbreak, "In short, it looks like it's getting worse".
As of Thursday, the Associated Press reported that there have been at least 126,000 cases of COVID-19 worldwide, resulting in more than 4,600 deaths.
The 2019-20 coronavirus pandemic is an ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) caused by infection with the respiratory system of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS-CoV-2).
The outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China in January 2019, declared a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, and recognized as a global pandemic on 11 March 2020.
As of 10 April 2020, approximately 1.61 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, resulting in approximately 97,000 deaths.
About 364,000 people have recovered.
The case fatality rate has been estimated at 4% in China, while globally it ranges from 13.04% in Algeria to 0.08% in New Zealand.
Common symptoms include cough, shortness of breath.
Complications may include pneumonia and concomitant respiratory symptoms.
The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is generally five days, but may range from two to fourteen days.
There is no known vaccine or antiviral treatment.
Primary treatment is symptomatic and complementary. Recommended prevention procedures include hand washing, covering the mouth during coke, maintaining social distance from others, and monitoring and self-isolation for people who suspect they are infected.
Authorities around the world have responded by implementing travel restrictions, quarantines, traffic bans, trace risk controls, and facility closures.
The pandemic has caused severe global socio-economic disruption, postponement or cancellation of sporting, religious, political and cultural events, and widespread shortages of equipment due to over-purchase.
Schools and universities are closed either nationally or locally in 193 countries, affecting an estimated 99.4 percent of the world's student population.
Misinformation about the virus has spread online, and there have been incidents of xenophobia and discrimination against Chinese citizens, other people of ethnic background in eastern and southeastern China, and people in areas where the virus has been reported.
Due to reduced travel and the closure of major industries, there has been a decrease in air pollution and carbon emissions.
Health authorities in Wuhan, China (the capital of Hubei Province) reported a series of cases of pneumonia on 31 December 2019, and began an investigation in early January 2020.
Most of the cases were linked to the Huanan seafood market and so the virus is believed to have an animal origin.
The virus that caused the outbreak is known as SARS-CoV-2, a newly discovered virus related to the bat coronavirus, pangolin coronavirus, SARS-CoV. The first known person to have symptoms and subsequently become ill was on 1 December 2019, the person had no visible contact with the fresh meat market.
Of the cases reported in the first batch in January 2019, two-thirds were associated with the fresh meat market.
On 13 March 2020, an unconfirmed report in the South China Morning Post suggested that a case dating back to 17 November 2019, in a 55-year-old man in Hubei Province, may have been the first.On 26 February 2020, the World Health Organization said that, with the decrease in new cases in China, but the sudden rise in Italy, Iran, and South Korea, the number of new cases outside China exceeded the number of new cases in China for the first time.
Many cases may go unreported, especially among those with symptoms of stroke.
As of 26 February, relatively few cases were reported among young people, those aged 19 and younger accounting for 2.4% of cases worldwide.The UK's chief scientific adviser, Patrick Valance, predicted that 60% of the UK population would need to be infected before a mass-transmitted immunity became available.
Cases refer to the number of people who have tested positive for COVID-19, and whose test has been confirmed to be positive according to official protocols.
As of 23 March, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, and most countries had official policies to screen those with only mild symptoms, such as Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Switzerland.
A study published on March 16 concluded that in China, as of January 23, an estimated 86% of COVID-19 cases had not been detected, and these unreported infections were the source of 79% of reported cases.
A statistical analysis published on 30 March predicted that the number of cases in Italy was much higher than the reported cases.
Initial estimates of the R0 for COVID-19 were 1.4 to 2.4.
A study published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found a rating of 5.7.
Most people with COVID-19 recover.
For those who did not recover, the time from symptom onset to death ranged from 6 to 41 days, with 14 days being the most common.
As of 10 April 2020, there were approximately 97,000 deaths from COVID-19.
In China, as of 5 February, 80% of the deaths were people over the age of 60, and 75% had other health conditions such as heart disease and diabetes.The official total death toll due to the COVID-19 pandemic generally refers to people who have tested positive for COVID-19 according to official protocols.
The actual death toll from COVID-19 may be much higher, as it may include people who have died from screening - for example, in elderly cells, etc.
Partial data from Italy indicate that the number of deaths during the pandemic exceeded the COVID-19 death rate by 4-5 times.
A spokesperson from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said that "we know that [the number of reported deaths] is a low estimate", a statement with the first consecutive report of undercounting in the United States. Often this undercounting occurs during epidemics, such as the 2009 N1H1 pandemic. The first confirmed death was in Wuhan on 9 January 2020.[106][107]
The first death outside China occurred in the Philippines on 1 February, and the first death outside Asia was in France on 14 February.
As of 28 February, outside of China, more than a dozen deaths had been reported each in Iran, South Korea and Italy.
As of 13 March, more than forty countries and territories had reported deaths, from every continent except Antarctica.Many measures are in place to reduce the death rate.
These numbers vary by region and time, and are influenced by the quality of testing, the quality of the healthcare system, treatment options, the time since the initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, gender, and general health.
Based on data from Johns Hopkins University, the global death rate was 6.0% (97,039/1,617,204) as of 10 April 2020.
The number varies by region.
In China, the expected case fatality rate decreased from 17.3 (for those with onset of symptoms on 1-10 January 2020*) to 0.7% (for those with onset of symptoms after 1 February 2020). Other measures include case fatality rate (CFR), which represents the percentage of diagnosed people who die from the disease, and case mortality rate (IFR), which represents the percentage of infected (diagnosed and non-diagnosed) people who die from the disease.
The statistics are not chronological and follow the population of the particular case through the treatment of the case.
A number of academics have attempted to calculate these numbers for specific populations.
The Oxford University Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine estimates the overall mortality rate for the pandemic to be between 0.1% and 0.39%.
The above estimate is consistent with the results of the first randomized clinical trial for COVID-19 in Germany, and a statistical study that analyzed the impact of the trial on the CFR predictions.
The World Health Organization confirms that the epidemic can be controlled.
The peak and end times of the outbreak are unclear and may vary by location.
"Without testing, the epidemic is generally high and then begins to decline when the disease is no longer a viable option", said Boone Fisher of Penn State University.
But it is not possible to predict when that will be right now".
The Chinese government's senior medical adviser Zhong Nanshan argued that it "might be over by June" if all countries were prepared to follow the World Health Organization's advice on measures to stop the spread of the virus.
On 17 March, Adam Kucharski at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine said that SARS-CoV-2 "will be gone for one or two years".
According to the Imperial Leadership College study by Neil Ferguson, social distancing and other measures will be necessary "until a vaccine is available (perhaps 18 months or more)".
William Schaffner of Vanderbilt University said, "I think it's unlikely that this coronavirus - because it's so transmissible - will go away completely", and that it "might become a seasonal disease, returning every year".
The difficulty of the turn depends on the resistance to the mass and the rate of jump.
Symptoms of COVID-19 can be relatively uncontrolled, and infected individuals may not have symptoms.
The two most common symptoms are fever (88%) and dry cough (68%).
Other less common symptoms include fever, shortness of breath, loss of taste, shortness of breath, joint and muscle pain, coughing, sore throat, cold, coughing, runny nose, coughing blood, diarrhea, or blue skin. The World Health Organization says that about one in six people are severely ill and have respiratory problems.
The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classifies the symptoms as acute respiratory distress, persistent chest pain or pressure, sudden paralysis, difficulty walking, and facial or blue-grey lips; immediate medical attention is required if these symptoms are present. Further diagnosis of the disease can lead to pneumonia, congestive respiratory system infection, blood poisoning and death.
Some of those infected may be asymptomatic, with no clinical signs but with test results that confirm the infection, so researchers have advised that those who have close contact with confirmed infected people should be closely monitored and screened to prevent the disease.
The Chinese estimate for the rate of asymptomaticity is slightly predicted at 44%
The survival period (time between infection and onset of symptoms) is from 1 to 14 days; the most common is 5 days.As an uncertain example, the estimate of the proportion of people with COVID-19 who have lost their sense of smell was initially 30% but then dropped to 15%.
Some details about how the disease develops are still being determined.
The disease is believed to have been primarily spread during close contact and small lesions may have been spread by coughing, sneezing or talking; close contact may have been 1 to 2 metres (3 to 6 ft) in length.
Studies have concluded that cocaine injected causes the particles to be transported up to 4.5 metres (15 ft) to 8.2 (27 ft) away.
Some have suggested that the virus may be transmitted by small droplets that remain in the air for long periods of time, which may be formed during speech. Respiratory droplets may also be formed during respiration, including speech, although the virus is not normally transmitted through the air.
The drops can be injected into the mouth or throat of people close to them or into the lungs.
Some medical procedures such as pulmonary and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause the pulmonary excretions to be released into the air, thus causing airborne transmission.
It may also be common when someone touches a dirty object, touches skin, and then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth.
While there is concern that it may spread through the feces, this risk is believed to be low.
The Chinese government has denied the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 being transmitted via the mouth.The virus is most prevalent in the first three days after the onset of symptoms, although outbreaks may occur before the onset of symptoms and in later stages of the disease.
People tested positive for the disease up to three days before the onset of symptoms, suggesting that the outbreak may have occurred before the onset of significant symptoms.
Only a few reports of asymptomatic confirmed cases have been reported, but asymptomatic transmission has been detected by several countries during post-contact investigations.
The European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (ECDC) says that while it is not entirely clear how easily the disease spreads, it is common for one person to infect two to three others.The virus can survive on surfaces for hours.
Specifically, the virus has been detected for three days on plastic (polypropylene) and 304 steel, for one day on cardboard, and up to four days on copper.
However, this depends on humidity and temperature.Pets and other animals have been infected with COVID-19.
There is no evidence that animals can transmit the virus to humans, although UK authorities advise washing hands after touching animals, such as after touching clothing that infected people may have touched.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel virus, first isolated from three people who had acute respiratory infections to a group of acute respiratory illness cases in Wuhan.
All features of SARS-CoV-2 are inherited from the related coronavirus. Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which dissolves its protective coating. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
He is believed to have an animal ancestry.
The overall analysis revealed that the coronavirus is genetically identical to the beta-coronavirus, in the subgenome of the sarbicovirus (line B) along with two strains derived from bats.
It has a 96% similarity to the genetic level of other bat coronavirus strains (BatCov TaTG13).
In February 2020, Chinese researchers concluded that there is only one amino acid difference in several parts of the molecular chain between viruses in penguins and those in humans.
To date, a total gene comparison has reached about 92% of the genetic material shared between the coronavirus pangolin and SARS-CoV-2, which is not enough to prove that pangolin was the host.
Diagnosis of viral disease can be based on symptoms, although confirmation ultimately comes through the reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) of infected tissue or CT scans.
A study comparing PCR to CT in Wuhan suggested that CT is significantly more sensitive than PCR, less specific, and has characteristics of cross-exposure with other pulmonary infectious processes and other diseases.
As of March 2020, the American College of Radiology recommends that "CT should not be used for screening or as a first-line test for COVID-19".
The World Health Organization has published several RNA testing protocols for SARS-CoV-2, the first of which was published on 17 January.
The test uses the real-time reverse polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR).
The test can be performed on a breath or blood sample.
Results are usually available within a few hours to a few days.
Generally this test is performed on a nasal-throat swab although a throat swab may also be used. A number of laboratories and companies are developing serologic testing, which detects antibodies.
As of 6 April 2020, none of these have been cleared for widespread use.
In the United States, the serological test was developed by Cellex and is approved for emergency use by only authorized laboratories.
Features of special radiographs and computed tomography (CT) images of people with symptoms include irregular underlying glare and lack of lateral emission.
The Italian Radiological Society compiles an online database of the radiation results of confirmed cases.
Due to the interference of other diseases such as adenovirus, non-assessment radiation by PCR has limited efficacy in the diagnosis of COVID-19.
A large study in China compared CT results to PCR and showed that although CT is less specific for infection, it is faster and more sensitive, suggesting it could be considered as a screening tool in epidemic areas.
Artificial intelligence-based neural networks have been developed to detect the properties of radiation with radiographs and CT scans.
Strategies to prevent transmission of the disease include maintaining personal hygiene, washing hands, avoiding touching the eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, spraying clenx or clenx and directly spraying clenx in the saliva.
Those who have the disease themselves are advised to wear a mask in public.
Physical distancing measures have also been recommended to prevent the spread.Many governments have restricted or advised against all non-essential travel and to avoid countries or areas where the disease has spread.
However, the virus has reached the stage of community spread in high places around the world.
This means that the virus is spreading within the community, and members of some communities do not know where or how they were infected. Healthcare providers caring for a person who may have been infected are advised to use standard pre-warning and contact precautions and eye protection. Contact tracing is an important way for health authorities to identify the source of the disease and prevent further transmission.
The use of location data from mobile phones by governments for this purpose has raised privacy concerns, with international Amnesty and more than 100 other organizations providing explanations and calling for restrictions on such surveillance.
Numerous mobile applications have been implemented or proposed for voluntary use, and as of 7 February 2020, more than a dozen expert groups were working on feature-friendly solutions, such as using Bluetooth to record nearby user calls from other phones.
Users will then receive a message if they have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19.There is widespread misconception about how to prevent infection; for example, washing the nose and mouth with a hand sanitizer is not effective.
There is no vaccine for COVID-19, although organizations may be working to develop one.
Hand washing is recommended to prevent the spread of the disease.
The CDC recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the toilet or when hands are obviously dirty; before eating; and after using a nasal swab, cocaine or psyllium.
This is because outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which destroys its active ingredient.
The CDC further recommends the use of a laxative containing at least 60% laxative when soap and water are not available.
The World Health Organization advises people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, or mouth with unwashed hands.
The surfaces may be cleaned with a number of cleaning agents (within one minute of contacting the cleaning agent to the steel surface), containing 62-71% ethanol, 50-100% isopropanol, 0.1% sodium hydrochlorite, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide and 0.2-7.5% iodine-povaediene.
Other compounds, such as benzalkonium chloride and gluconate of chryohexadiene are less effective.
The CDC recommends that if a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed in an institution such as an office or day care, all premises such as offices, bathrooms, common areas, shared electronic devices such as tablets, tablets, tablets, remote controls, and ATMs used by the person with the illness should be disinfected.
Health organizations recommend that you cover your mouth and lips with a cloth or clinch when you coke or urinate, and discard the clinch immediately.
Health masks are recommended for those who may have been exposed to the virus, as wearing a mask reduces the size and range of airborne particles inhaled during speech, sneezing, and coughing.
The World Health Organization has issued guidelines on when and how to use masks.
According to Stephen Griffin, a virologist at the University of Leeds, "Wearing a mask can reduce the rate of contact between people and their faces, which is a major source of infection without proper hand hygiene".
The World Health Organization has recommended the wearing of masks by healthy people if they are at high risk, such as those caring for a COVID-19 infected person, although it acknowledges that wearing masks may help people avoid losing their faces.
Many countries have begun encouraging the use of masks by the general public.
In the United States, the CDC recommends wearing non-physical masks made of cotton.China specifically recommends the use of disposable medical masks by the healthy general public, especially when in close contact (1 meter (3 ft) or less) with other people.
Hong Kong recommends wearing surgical masks when using public transport or staying in crowded areas.
Thai health officials are urging people to make cloth masks at home and wash them daily.
The Czech Republic and Slovakia have banned outdoor activities without wearing a mask or covering the face and nose.
On 16 March, Vietnam asked everyone to wear a mask when entering public places to protect themselves and others.
The Austrian government has ordered that anyone entering a shop must wear a face mask.
Israel has required all citizens to wear a mask during public gatherings.
Taiwan, which has been producing ten million masks a day since mid-March, requires passengers on trains and buses to wear masks from April 1.
Panama has mandated the wearing of masks when going out, while recommending the making of masks at home for those who cannot afford to buy masks.
Masks are also widely used in Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and Singapore.
Social distancing (also known as social distancing) refers to disease control practices aimed at slowing the spread of a disease by reducing close contact between people.
The measures include quarantining roads, restricting travel, and closing schools, parks, playgrounds, theatres or shopping centres.
Individuals may practice social distancing methods through staying at home, restricting travel, avoiding crowded places, using the do not-contact greeting, and physical distancing from each other.
Most governments are now mandating or introducing social distancing in areas affected by the outbreak.
The maximum size of the gathering was reduced by the US government and health organizations from 250 people (if there is no known COVID-19 outbreak in the region) to 50 people, and later to 10 people.
On 22 March 2020, Germany banned public gatherings of more than two people. Older adults and those with medical conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, respiratory disease, hypertension and immune deficiency are at higher risk of infection and are advised by the CDC to stay indoors where community outbreaks are occurring. In late March 2020, the World Health Organization and other health authorities began changing the use of the concept of "social distancing" to "physical distancing", to clarify the goal of reducing physical exposure during social interactions, rather than physical or distance.
The use of the concept of "social distancing" has led to people having to engage in complete social distancing, rather than being encouraged to stay in contact with others through alternative means.Some authorities have issued sexual health guidelines for use during the pandemic.
These include recommending that you only have sex with a partner who is free of the virus or symptoms.
Self-isolation at home is recommended for those with COVID-19 and those suspected to be infected.
Health agencies have issued detailed guidelines for proper self-quarantine.Many governments have mandated or recommended self-quarantine for entire populations living in affected areas.
The strongest self-quarantine guidelines are for those in high-risk groups.
Those who may have been exposed to someone with COVID-19 and who have recently traveled to a country or region with high transmission are advised to self-quarantine for 14 days following the last exposure.
Strategies to control an outbreak include containment, containment, and mitigation.
The goal is to contain the early stages of the outbreak, to detect and isolate those infected, and to introduce other disease control measures and vaccines to stop the disease from spreading to other parts of the population.
Once the spread of the disease is no longer controlled, efforts will move to the mitigation phase: measures will be taken to slow the spread and reduce its impact on health care systems and communities.
Combination prevention and reduction measures may be considered at the same time.
Prevention requires much more than measures to reverse the spread of disease from person to person to person. The management of and response to an infectious disease outbreak is to try to reduce the peak of the disease by correcting the curve of the outbreak.
This reduces the risk of over-supporting services and gives more time for vaccine and treatment development.
Non-pharmaceutical actions that may control the outbreak include individual protection measures, such as hand sanitizing, mask wearing, and self-isolation; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and refusing large gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation of such actions; and environmental measures such as cleaning up surfaces.More concrete actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China before the outbreak, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing travel restrictions.
Other countries have also taken a number of measures to limit the spread of the virus.
South Korea has implemented mass screening and self-quarantine, and has issued warnings for the movement of infected people.
Singapore has offered financial support to those infected who have quarantined themselves and has imposed severe penalties for those who do not comply.
Taiwan has increased the production of masks and imposed penalties for the mass purchase of medical supplies. The same goes for Great Britain and the United States, indicating that mitigation (slowing rather than stopping the spread of the epidemic) and containment (stopping the growth of the epidemic) are highly challenging.
Good mitigation policies may reduce the need for health care by two-thirds and deaths by half, but they still cause hundreds of thousands of deaths and the collapse of health systems.
Cupping may be considered acceptable but should be avoided until the virus is eradicated from the human community (or until a vaccine is available, if that is the case initially), as transmission is increased when measures are relaxed.
Long-term action to contain the epidemic will incur social and economic costs.
There is no specific antiviral therapy for COVID-19, but efforts are being made to develop, including testing of currently available therapies.
Taking anti-cold medication, drinking fluids, and rest may help alleviate symptoms.
Depending on the severity, oxygen therapy, intravenous fluids, and respiratory support may be required.
The use of stimulants may worsen the outcome.
Several compounds previously approved for the treatment of other viral diseases are being investigated for use in the treatment of COVID-19.
The World Health Organization also said that some "immunotherapy and local treatment" could provide relief for symptoms of SARX-CoV-19.
Improving access to and availability of health care for COVID-19 patients is described by the World Health Organization as a measure to reduce the spread of the virus.
ECDC and the WHO European Regional Office have issued guidance to hospitals and primary health care services to shift resources to multiple levels, including focusing on laboratory services to COVID-19 testing, rejecting elective procedures whenever possible, isolating COVID-19 positive patients, and increasing intensive care capacity through staff training and increasing the number of available artificial respirators and crops.
There are several theories about where the first case (the so-called disease number zero) originated.
The first known case of the novel coronavirus may have been on January 1, 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China.
Within a month, the number of coronavirus cases in Hubei gradually increased.
These were mostly related to the Huanan seafood market, where live animals were also sold, and one theory is that the virus came from one of these animals; or, in other words, has an animal origin. An unknown cause of pneumonia was observed on 26 December and treated by Dr. Zhang Jixan at the Hubei Provincial Hospital, who alerted the CDC to the outbreak in Wuhan on 27 December.
On 30 December, a group of doctors at Wuhan Central Hospital alerted their colleagues to a "coronavirus similar to SARS".
Eight of these doctors, including Li Wenliang, were severely reprimanded by the police for spreading false information, and another, Ai Feng, was disciplined by his superior for raising the alarm.
The Wuhan Municipal Health Commission later issued a public warning on 31 December and alerted the World Health Organization.
A significant number of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were reported to the health authorities in Wuhan to begin an investigation in early January.In the early stages of the outbreak, the number of cases doubled approximately every seven and a half days.
In early and mid-January 2020, the virus spread to other regions of China, aided by the Chinese New Year holiday and the fact that Wuhan is a transportation and railway hub.
On 20 January, China reported about 140 new cases, including two in Beijing and one in Shenzhen.
Later official data showed that as of 20 January 2020, about 6174 people had been diagnosed with the disease.On 26 March, the United States was ranked ahead of China and Italy as having the highest number of confirmed cases in the world.As of 9 April 2020, more than 1.61 million cases were reported worldwide, more than 97,000 people had died and more than 364,000 had recovered.
There are about 200 countries and territories with at least one case.
Due to the pandemic in Europe, many countries in the Schengen area restricted free movement and imposed border controls.
National responses include containment measures such as quarantining (also known as stay-at-home orders, shelter orders, or self-quarantine) and curfews.As of 2 April, approximately 300 million people, about 90% of the population, are under some form of stay-at-home in the United States, more than 50 million people are under home confinement in the Philippines, about 59 million people are under home confinement in South Africa, and 1.3 billion people are under home confinement in India.

Initially, China's National Health Commission claimed that there was no "clear evidence" for human-to-human transmission.
In late January, the Chinese government launched a grassroots campaign that was later described by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of China as the "People's War" to contain the spread of the virus.

Methods of testing included mandatory self-reporting by international newcomers via mobile apps, in-vehicle testing for the virus with the result available the next day, and increasing testing capacity to allow 20,000 people to be tested daily.
South Korea's program is considered a success in controlling the outbreak despite not quarantining entire cities. South Korean society was initially divided in response to President Moon Jae-in's response to the crisis.

On 28 February, Scope Ratings GmbH confirmed the average earnings of Sen, but reported a negative review.
The financial crisis resumed amid fears of the coronavirus, with the largest losses at 16/3
Many believe that the economic downturn is imminent.
Economist Mohamed A-Erian thanked the central bank and the central government for their efforts in this emergency.
Central banks have been much more reactive than they were in the financial crisis of 2008.
Travel and tourism is one of the worst affected sectors due to travel bans, closure of public places that contain travel requests, and government advice against all forms of travel around the world.
As a result, a large number of flights were cancelled due to declining demand, including British Airways, East-Sea Airways, and Qantas Airways, while the Flybeys Sky Zone was closed.
The impact on the supply and demand of industrial production was at a level never seen before.
Many train stations and transport ports were also closed.
The pandemic also affected the Chuniuni festival, as well as many seasonal trips associated with the holiday of the Chinese New Year.
A number of events with large crowds have been cancelled by national and regional governments, including the annual New Year's Festival, and private companies have suspended tours of Hong Kong Disneyland and Shanghai Disneyland.
Many Christmas celebrations and travel have been suspended to prohibit public gatherings, for example the Forbidden City in Beijing and the traditional holiday parade.
In 24 of the 31 provinces, municipalities and regions of the Senate, the government extended the annual observance holiday until 10/2, urging businesses not to open until that date.
It employed 80% of the country's productive labor force and 90% of its experts.
Hong Kong raised its response to the outbreak to the highest level and declared a state of emergency, closed schools until March and cancelled New Year's Eve celebrations. Its retail sector was affected globally, with reduced market hours or temporary closures.
Business travel from Europe and Latin America has declined by 40%.
Businesses in South America and the Middle East suffered losses of 50-60%.
This also led to a 33-43% reduction in pedestrian traffic in shopping centres in March compared to February.
Mall managers around the world have announced other proposals, such as increasing the number of vacuum cleaners, providing temperature checking devices to customers, and people congregating at events.According to the United States Economic Commission for Latin America, the pandemic could cause poverty for 14 to 22 million people in Latin America who would not have been in this situation without the pandemic.
In January and February 2020, during the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan, nearly 5 million people lost their jobs in China.
Most of the rural laborers in the Sin of about 300 million were sent home to water areas or were protected in Hubei province. In March 2020, more than 10 million Americans stopped work and asked for government assistance.
The coronavirus pandemic has put 47 million jobs in the United States out of work and the unemployment rate is at 32%. According to estimates by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, the travel ban in India has left 10 million migrant workers unemployed (with daily wages). An assessment by the Black Lives Matter Institute found that 44% of Canadian households were unemployed.
During the second half of March, 4 million French workers applied for unemployment benefits and 1 million British workers applied for a universal pay scheme. Nearly half a million companies in Germany sent government money to their workers under the short-time working scheme known as Kurzarbeit.
The German part-time pay scheme was implemented in France and the UK.
Aspects of the arts of working and urban heritage were severely affected by the pandemic, as well as the practices of organizations, and individuals affected both by employers and by global self-reporting.
Organizations on the arts and civic side sought to raise public funds to provide access to civic relics to the community, extend the preservation of their facilities and support artists where appropriate.
In March 2020, universities, museums, libraries, performance venues and other civic institutions were closed without notice and exhibitions, events and performances were cancelled or postponed.
In response to the strong efforts to serve through digital platforms, the newly emerging pandemic has threatened religious services and numerous sporting and social events, such as music festivals and concerts, technology conferences, and fashion shows.
The film's production was also hit hard, with the Vatican declaring Holy Week in Rome, which falls in the last week of Christian repentance in Lent, to be cancelled.
Many pastors have told their elderly followers to stay home and not attend Sunday services; some churches have broadcast their services on radio or live online or on television, while others have streamed services.
With the closure of the Roman Catholic Church in Rome, churches, branches and places of the Christian faith were closed, and people of other faiths continued to hold services and gatherings in synagogues, synagogues, Jewish places of worship, synagogues and Sikh temples.
Iran's health minister announced that Friday prayers and mosques in the affected areas were closed, and Saudi Arabia suspended foreign pilgrims from Mecca and Medina.
The pandemic has been the most significant impact on the sporting activities worldwide since World War II.
Most sporting events were either postponed or postponed, including the 2019-20 UEFA Champions League, the 2019-20 Premier League, the 2019-20 NBA season, the 2019-20 NHL season.
The outbreak caused problems for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which were scheduled to be held in July. The National Olympic Committee announced on 24 March that the Games had been postponed beyond 2020 but not beyond the summer of 2021, with sports venues across the world shutting down and gambling tournaments being suspended or postponed.
This has led to online gambling, many gambling websites have seen a huge increase in new subscribers, public places have suffered, and bands have postponed or cancelled concerts with the virus.
Many regional theatres such as Broadway have postponed all their activities.
Some artists have experimented with new ways to promote their work and publish their work online as an alternative to live performance, such as creating online concert venues or creating festival websites for solo artists.
Online, several comic articles about the coronavirus were published that included many jokes, suspicions, and problems.
Since the COVID-19 outbreak, there has been a lot of hatred, fear of neighboring countries, and racism observed among the people of China and Southeast Asia, and against people from the European political regions, the United Nations and other countries.
Incidents of fear, suspicion, and hostile behavior have been observed in many countries, especially in Europe, Southeast Asia, North America, and the Asia-Pacific region.
Reports in February (when most cases were still in China) were a reflection of racist sentiment by virus groups around the world who claimed that the Chinese people deserved the virus or had taken what they were asked for as punishment.
Some African countries also had strong feelings against the Sinhalese.
Many residents of Wan and Hubei have declared separation due to their regional origin.
There was support for seniors, both directly and offline, bringing their help to the areas affected by the virus.
The spread of the virus has progressed to developed countries. People in Italy, the first European country to report a series of COVID-19 cases, have been the subject of suspicion and fear. People in Malaysia, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea have protested against the entry ban on Chinese nationals to their country, as an attempt to contain the disease.
In Japan, the hashtag #Sini_s_me_for_Japan has taken over Twitter.

The Bharatiya Janata Party leader in West Bengal declared that the Sikhs have destroyed nature and "this is God's revenge against them".
Later the dissidents were beaten up by the consul of the House of Sin in Kolkata, called "false information". In Sin, hatred, xenophobia and racism against the foreign settlers of Sin was felt due to the plague, the foreigners were described as "foreign remnants" and the goal was to expel them.
Several journalists with private accounts have deleted their stories from the internet due to the spread of the coronavirus.
Several scientific publishers have prepared scientific papers related to the outbreak with the news entry being published.
Some scientists have chosen to publish their results quickly online, such as the online website bioRxiv.
The emergence of disease transmission - the emergence of the causes of disease transmission, the difference in the way they spread and are transmitted.
Globalization and disease - A general assessment of globalization and disease is given.
List of epidemics - a list of deaths from a specific disease.

Laboratory tests for respiratory distress associated with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and related SARS-CoV-2 include those that test for the presence of the virus and those that test for the production of antibodies against the infection.
The presence of the virus in the samples was determined by RT-PCR which studies the corona virus RNA.
This test is specifically designed for the analysis of RNA of SARS-CoV-2 virus only.
This is used to detect very new and active infections.
Antibody research can be used to diagnose disease and monitor populations.
Antibody tests indicate how many people have had the disease, including those who were too weak to report symptoms and those who were asymptomatic.
An accurate mortality rate and population-level mortality can be determined from the test results.
Based on limited testing, as of March 2020, no country had reliable data on the spread of the virus in its population.
In 23/3, no country had tested more than 3% of its population, there are differing opinions on how to conduct testing in countries.
This difference is becoming an important proportion of severe cases, which are starting to be assessed as high-risk in some countries.
The use of rRT-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) assays can be performed on samples of respiratory problems received by the virus strain. This includes nasal and throat examinations and leakage samples.
Results are usually available within an hour to two days.
The RT-PCR test administered with a throat test is the only reliable test in the first week of the disease.
The virus can then disappear from the throat while continuing to multiply in the lungs.
For people who have been diagnosed in the second week, a sample of the substance can be taken later from the deep breathing tube by a medical examiner or a leak can be used.
One of the first PCR tests was developed at the Charité University of Berlin in January 2020 using the polymerase chain reaction reaction (rRT-PCR) and produced 250,000 medical devices for distribution by the World Health Organization (WHO).
The UK developed a test on 23/1/2020.South Korea-based company CogenyBioch discovered a new medical gateway, PCR based on the SARS-CoV-2 virus (strong coronavirus detection) on 28/1/2020.
The test was for the "E" material gene that is distributed across all coronavirus receptors, and the RdRp material gene specific to SARS-CoV-2.In the US, the BGI group was one of the first companies to receive emergency emergency kits from the Department of Health and Human Services, PCR based on the SARS-CoV-2 research kits, in the US and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) released the new 2019 coronavirus test (RT-PCR) test panel for public health laboratories through international discovery sources.
One of the genetic testing versions of the test kit caused a false positive result due to the use of faulty material and glass test glass at the CDC in Atlanta; this resulted in an average of fewer than 100 samples being successfully administered per day throughout February 2020.
The tests using different elements were not rated as reliable as of 28/2/2020. Until then, local and state laboratories were allowed to conduct the tests.
The test was approved by the Food and Drug Administration under the government's Emergency Infrastructure.The United Nations Laboratories began testing in early March 2020.
On 5/3/2020 LabCorp announced the availability of nationwide COVID-19 testing based on RT-PCR
The Diagnostic Testing Service also published a national COVID-19 diagnostic test on 9/3/2020.
No specific quantity was reported, and sample collection and follow-up should be done as required by the CDC.
In Russia, the COVID-19 test was developed and produced by the Virology and Bacteriology Research Center VECTOR.
On 11/2/2020, the test was registered by the Federal Health Care Administration.On 12/3/2020, Mayo Clinic announced that it had developed a test to investigate COVID-19 infection.On 13/3/2020, the Roche Disease Institute received FDA approval for a test that can be performed in 3.5 hours in severe infections, thus allowing a single device to perform 4,128 tests in 24 hours.
On 19 March 2020, the FDA officially granted EUA approval to Abbott Laboratories for a trial on Abbott's 2000 m system. The FDA initially granted the subsequent approval authority to Hologic and LabCorp and Sermo Fisher Scientific.
On 21 March 2020, Cefed also received EUA approval from the FDA to perform a 45-minute test.
The FDA approved a test that used nucleic acid fusion technology instead of PCR.
Since this does not require a series of temperature changes, the method can give a positive test result in as little as 5 minutes and a negative test result in 13 minutes.
There are now about 18,000 of these machines in the United States. Abbott expects to increase the rate to 50,000 tests per day.A test that uses antibody data and tightly binds to the N protein of the new coronavirus is being developed in Taiwan, with the hope that it can deliver results in 15 to 20 minutes as a rapid influenza test.
A literature review in March 2020 found that "X-rays of the lung play a minor role in diagnosing the disease in its early stages. Whereas CT (numerical image) detection may precede even the initial symptoms".
Common uses for CT include a dual multi-lens machine, a geometrical imaging machine, and a splitting machine.
Suppleural dominance, manic disorder and rigidity are treated as developmental disorders.
A scientific study comparing PCR to CT in the city of Wuhan at the epicenter of the current outbreak has suggested that CT is more sensitive than PCR, although less precise, with isolation behavior modeled with disease symptoms and disease processes.
In March 2020, the American College of Radiology announced that "CP should not be used to screen for COVID-19".In March 2020, the CDC announced the approval of PCR for primary diagnosis.
Part of the body's immune response to infection is the production of antibodies including IgM and IgG.
These can be used to conduct studies on people within 7 days of infection onset or after the onset of early symptoms to determine immunity and in the diagnosis of disease in children. The tests can be performed in a clinical laboratory setting (CLT) or by point-of-care testing (PoCT).
High-performance automated systems are available in some medical laboratories to perform these tests, but their availability depends on the average productivity of each system.
For CLT a peripheral instrument blood test sample is usually used, however a sample series can be used to delay the shortened reaction.
For PoCT a blood sample is usually taken by a skin puncture.
Unlike the PCR step, a pre-test extraction step is not required.On 26/3/2020, the FDA published the names of 29 authorities who had submitted their notifications to the breaker as requested and are now available to distribute their test antibodies.
On 7/4/2020, only one test was approved by the FDA under the Emergency Use Authorization Regulations.In late March 2020, the European Diagnostic and Epidemiological Laboratory received European approval for their laboratory equipment, which can test for IgG and IgA antibodies against the virus in blood samples.
The test is capable of performing 100 samples per hour and is therefore faster than the standard PCR test for viral RNA.
Antibodies are usually detected within 14 days of the initial infection.By early April, the UK had no laboratory antibodies, so it purchased the antibodies that were good to use.
Hong Kong has introduced a plan where suspected patients can stay at home, the emergency department gives the patient a sample-taking syringe, licks it and returns it, and then receives the results of the tests. The British NHS has announced plans to test a test for suspected cases at home, which risks infecting others by the patient if they are taken to hospital or need to use an ambulance.
Delivery centers have helped South Korea, carrying out some of the fastest and most extensive screening in the country.In Germany, the International Union of Physical Health Insurance Regulators said in 2/4 that it was able to carry out 12,000 tests per day in mobile work, and 10,700 tests had been carried out in the previous week.
The costs are covered by the health insurance when the examination is requested by the doctor.
According to the president of the Robert Koch Institute, Germany has the capacity to conduct more than 160,000 tests per week.
On 19 March, roadside checks were introduced in several major cities.
As of 26 March 2020, the total number of tests performed in Germany is unknown, as only positive results were reported.
The first measuring laboratory reveals that as of week 12/2020 overall at least 483,295 samples were tested and between week 12/2020 and 33,491 (6.9%) samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2, in Israel, researchers from the Technion Rambam Hospital developed and tested a new method to test samples for 64 patients at the same time, by collecting samples and testing details of the positive probability of the mixed sample.In the city of Kassam a temporary 2,000 m3 research complex called "O-Ho" was opened on 5/2/2020 by BGI, which can test 10,000 people a day.
Through monitoring by BGI founder Wang Jian and by 5 days, the actions showed that cases in Hubei would have been 47% higher and the cost of the quarantine effort would have been doubled if the testing capability had not been available.
The laboratory was directly contacted by the Hu-yan laboratories in Shenzhen, Tianjin, Beijing and Shanghai, in total 21 cities in China.
As of 4/3/2020 maximum daily testing was 50,000 tests per day, open source chemistry maps were released, reported by Origami Tests to be able to test for 1122 patient samples for COVID-19 using only 93 tests, these replacement maps can be used in small labs without the need for fluid testing equipment.
In March, the scarcity and lack of chemical glass, mulberry glass for strong screening were used in Europe and the UK.
This allowed the authors to study the protocol for preparing samples to be tested, which includes taking 98 °C (208 °F) samples for 5 minutes to extract RNA material for detailed testing. On 31 March it was reported that the United Arab Emirates was testing for coronavirus per capita more than other countries, and were attempting to increase the level of testing to the highest level of population.
This was according to the combined mobile testing capabilities and laboratory equipment purchases of 42 groups and BGI (followed by the Hu-Wan Emergency Research Laboratories in Xi'an).
With a 14-day maintenance period, the lab has the capacity to perform 10,000 ST-PCR tests per day and the first case is recorded outside of China.
Different receptor tests to detect different genetic variants of the coronavirus were developed in China, France, Germany, Hong Kong and the United States.
The World Health Organization (WHO) took the German idea to create testing kits and send them to poor countries that do not have the resources to develop their own kits.
The German idea was published on 17/2/2020, the protocol developed by the United Nations Centers for Disease Control was not available until 28/2, the delay in the availability of tests in China and the United Nations had problems in validating test kits at the beginning of the outbreak, these countries and Australia could not provide enough test kits to meet the demand and orders for tests by health professionals.
Conversely, experts say South Korea's widespread availability of testing has helped to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.
Test beds, especially laboratory beds, were built for over a decade by the South Korean government.
On 16 March, the World Health Organization called for increased testing programmes to better reflect the progress of the COVID-19 pandemic.The high demand for testing due to the widespread spread of the virus has led to hundreds of thousands of unnecessary tests being carried out in United Nations laboratories, and the preparation of test kits and chemical swabs.
In March 2020, Sen reported that he had problems with the accuracy and precision of his equipment.
In the United States, testing kits were developed by the CDC that contained errors and then the government removed legal barriers, which prohibited specific tests. Spain purchased testing kits from Sin-Shen Bioz Biotech Co Ltd, but found that the results were not accurate.
The company explained that the incorrect results could be the result of sample collection errors or incorrect use of the alopecia.
The Spanish Ministry of Health announced that it would return the equipment that had given false results, and replace it with different laboratory equipment supplied by Schengen Bioscience. 80% of the laboratory equipment purchased by the Czech Republic from SIN was giving false results. Slovakia purchased 1.2 million laboratory equipment from SIN that turned out to be inaccurate.
Slovak Prime Minister Matović suggested that they be moved to the Danube. Atis Kara of the Turkish Ministry of Health said that the laboratory equipment Turkey had purchased from Sin was "highly defective", and "not used". The UK purchased 3.5 million laboratory equipment from Sin but announced in early April 2020 that they were not for use.
Screening, quarantine of those who tested positive and identification of those who were in contact with SARS-CoV-2 infected and infected since infection.
The researchers were working in the Italian town of Voi, where the first confirmed death from COVID-19 was reported.They conducted two tests of the entire settlement, which is estimated to have 3,400 residents, over a ten-day period.
About half of those who tested positive had no symptoms, and all detected cases were quarantined.
By traveling to the excluded areas, the new cases were not completely eliminated.
With strict checks, restrictive travel rules, and testing and quarantine, the 2020 coronavirus pandemic in Singapore spread much more slowly than in other developed countries.
Several events were cancelled, and Singapore began advising residents to stay home on 28/3 but schools reopened on time following their holiday on 23/3.
Most countries have implemented isolation, travel bans, and testing and quarantine measures to deal with the pandemic, but without the strict travel restrictions of Iceland and South Korea.
A statistical study found that countries with high testing and related mortality rates have lower mortality rates, so these countries may be better prepared to conduct studies on people with very mild or no symptoms.
The World Health Organization (WHO) advises that countries without testing capabilities and national laboratories with experience with COVID-19 to send samples of the first five positive cases and ten negative cases of COVID-19 to one of the 16 WHO laboratory sources to be tested.
Of the 16 laboratory sources, 7 are from Asia, 5 are from Europe, 2 are from Africa, 1 is from North America, and 1 is from Australia.
In the lists, the column "Thirty percent positive test rate" is developed by the country's testing police.
A country that only tests those who are admitted to hospital will have a higher positive rate than a country that tests the entire population, whether they have symptoms or not, all other things being equal.
Hand washing (or hand washing), also known as hand hygiene, is the act of cleaning hands to remove dirt, grease, microbes, and other unwanted substances.
Handwashing with soap to ensure "risk-free times" during the day prevents the spread of many diseases, such as asthma, cholera, which are transmitted through feces.
People also get respiratory illnesses such as influenza or common cold, for example, if they don't wash their hands before touching their eyes or mouth.
The five critical times during the day that handwashing with soap is important include before and after a bath, after cleaning a child's underwear or changing a baby's diaper, before feeding a child, before a meal and after preparing food or preparing meat, fish, poultry.
If soap and water are not available, you can cover your hands with a hand sanitizer.The World Health Organization recommends hand washing in:
Before and after preparing food
Before and after caring for a sick person.
After changing a diaper or cleaning a child who has been in the toilet.
After the death of Lut, Kokin and Peshmin.
After handling animal and feed waste and animal waste.
Health hygiene refers to hygiene practices related to medical products.
Handwashing before performing medical procedures or undergoing medical care can prevent or reduce the spread of disease.
The primary medical purpose of hand washing is to disinfect the hands from microbes (bacteria, viruses, or other microbes that can cause disease), and chemicals that can cause harm or disease.
This is especially important for people who prepare food or work in a medical setting, but is also an important function for public spaces.
Hand washing has many health benefits, including reducing the incidence of influenza, coronavirus and other communicable diseases; preventing the transmission of diseases; and reducing respiratory toxicity.
The reduction also includes home birth mortality.
A 2013 scientific study found that improved hand-washing function may help to increase growth in children under 5 years of age.
In developing countries, infant mortality rates are associated with respiratory diseases and diarrhoea that can be reduced by introducing different behaviors such as hand washing with soap.
This simple action could reduce the mortality rate in these countries by almost 50%.
Medical advice states that hand washing can reduce about one-third of the range of diseases of the stomach, this is achieved by providing clean water to the poor.
48% reduction in diarrhea episodes can be attributed to hand washing with soap. Hand washing with soap is one of the most effective and inexpensive ways to prevent acute respiratory arrest syndrome (ARI), as it is practiced as an automatic practice in homes, schools and communities around the world.
Acute respiratory infection, a component of ARI, is the leading cause of death in children under five years of age, with an estimated death rate of 1.8 million per year.
Diarrhoea and pneumonia combined cause the deaths of about 3.5 million children annually.
According to UNICEF, the practice of washing hands with soap before eating and using a hand sanitizer can save more lives than all vaccines and medical treatments combined, preventing deaths from diarrhea by 50% and preventing deaths from severe respiratory illness by one in four.
Hand washing is often associated with other medical cleaning as part of water and sanitation (washing).
Hand washing also protects against skin infections that are transmitted directly through physical contact.
A minor side effect of hand washing is that too much hand washing can lead to skin damage due to dryness of the skin.
A 2012 Danish study found that excessive handwashing can lead to dry, scaly skin conditions known as hand encephalitis, or hand rash, which is especially common among health care workers.
Frequent hand-washing is seen as one of the symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).
There are five times a day that hand washing with soap is important to reduce the risk of transmission of infectious diseases through the environment: after bathing (washing and rinsing), after cleaning a child's underwear (changing clothes), before eating and before and after preparing food or preparing meat, fish and poultry.
Other instances when proper handwashing techniques should be implemented to prevent the transmission of disease include before and after treating wounds, after exfoliating or wiping the face, after handling animal waste or handling animals, and after handling feces.
In many countries, there is a low rate of access to soap.
A 2015 study of handwashing in 54 countries found that an average of 38.7% of people at home use soap. A 2014 study found that Saudi Arabia had the highest handwashing rate at 97%, the United States had a median of 77%, and China had the lowest handwashing rate at just 23%.[citation needed] There are now many different behavioral changes to increase the practical rate of handwashing with soap when needed.
The health care-based program implemented in the European part of the Philippines is a practical example of child health development and education.
Exfoliation twice a year. In addition to hand washing with soap daily, tooth brushing daily with a toothpaste and washing, is the most important part of this international program.
This was successfully implemented in Indonesia.
Microbial laxatives on the skin were developed by adding soap or detergent to water.
The most important function of soap and tape is to reduce the impedance of the shot and increase the power of the shot.
Water is the only necessary cleanser for skin because of the fat and protein, which are the source of impurities and are not directly absorbed.
Cleaning is somehow assisted by a flow of water.
Solid soaps, due to their reusable nature, contain the bacteria desired by previous users.
A small number of studies that have worked on the bacteria in the soap remove mucus have found that the bacteria grow in the opposite direction to the mucus.
The CDC still says "Liquid soap with hand control is acceptable for cleaning".
Antibacterial soaps were expensive to obtain for public health care.
At this time, there is no evidence that the use of antibiotics or predictive microbial agents is indicated for the antibacterial resistance of organs in nature.
However, antibacterial soaps include common antibiotics such as antibiotic-producing agents, which have an extensive list of organ-resistant strains.
So, even if the types of antibacterial resistance are not specific to antibacterial soaps, it may not be as effective as advertised.
In addition to soaps and skin-protective products, complex formulations may include acids (acetic acid, ascorbic acid, lactic acid) as pH regulators, benzoic acid and active skin auxiliaries (alone vera, vitamins, menthol, plant extracts). A comprehensive analysis at the University of Oregon School of Public Health found that soap, like regular soaps, has antibacterial properties that include antimicrobial activity and disinfection of the hands.
The warm water that is soothing to wash your hands with is not strong enough to kill bacteria.
Bacteria grow faster at body temperature (37°C).
However, hot water and soap are more effective than cold water and soap in removing natural grease that holds dirt and bacteria.
Contrary to national beliefs however, scientific experiments have shown that using hot water has no effect on the microbial decomposition of the hands.
A hand sanitizer is a hand sanitizer that does not use water.
In the late 1990s and early 21st century, water-free alcohol hand sanitizer (also known as alcohol hand sanitizer, alcohol hand sanitizer, hand sanitizer) became available to the general public.
Most rely on isopropyl alcohol or ethanol in combination with microbiological detergents such as carbomer (polymer of acrylic acid) for a solution, or amektantane such as glycerine for a liquid, or a coating that is easy to use or to reduce the effect of alcohol breakdown.
The addition of oxygen to the zinc oxide increases the antimicrobial activity. Hand sanitizer contains a minimum of 60% to 95% alcohol, which is an active microbial killer.
Alcoholic cleansers kill bacteria, bacteria that carry many antibiotics (MRSA and VRE), tuberculosis, and some viruses (including HIV and genital herpes and RSV and rhinovirus, vaccine virus, influenza and hepatitis) and fungi.
Alcohol-based hand sanitizer is composed of 70% alcohol, 99.97% (3.5 logarithm reduction, equivalent to 35 reduction units of the sound scale) of bacteria on the hands 30 seconds after application and 99.99% to 99.999% (4-5 logarithm reduction) of bacteria on the hands one minute after application, hand sanitizer is more effective against bacteria and less effective against virus.
Alcohol hand sanitizers are not effective against the common virus (or norovirus) strains, which can cause stomach infections, and adequate hand sanitizers or hand sanitizers should be used to thoroughly clean or cover the hands.
The front and back of both hands and the middle and ends of all fingers are wiped for 30 seconds until the liquid, the cavity, or the liquid material is dissolved.
The tips of the fingers should be cleaned and the soles of the feet should be covered. The United Nations Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends hand washing before hand sanitizing, especially when hands are exposed to dirt.
The increase in these substances depends on their ease of use and the speed at which they kill microbes, however, they should not serve as a substitute for hand washing unless soap and water are readily available.
Excessive use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers can cause dry skin unless skin creams or moisturizers are added to the process.
The effects of alcohol desiccation can be reduced or eliminated by adding glycerin cream or other skin creams to the action.
In medical treatments, alcohol-based hand sanitizers contain skin creams that are less likely than soaps and anti-microbial agents to cause skin irritation or dryness.
Transmission allergies of hand-washing, surgical enhancement agents or hypersensitivity to alcohol or other added cleaning agents are rare.
Less preparation for adding the gravy to the broth was more effective than washing hands with soap and water.
Despite their effectiveness, waterless hand sanitizers do not completely clean all parts of the hand but simply sanitize them.
This is because hand sanitizers such as soap and water are not effective in preventing the spread of many pathogens, so the pathogens are still on the hands.
Alcoholic hand sanitizer performance relies heavily on formulations and formulas, and has historically been unsuccessful.
More recently, formulations using benzalkonium chloride have been shown to have sustained and cumulative antimicrobial activity after use, in contrast to alcohol, which has been shown to have reduced efficacy after reuse, possibly due to its high skin irritation response.
Many people in poor countries cannot afford soap and use dust or ash instead.
Dust or dust may be more effective than water alone, but may be less effective than soap.
One concern is that if the dust or ash is contaminated with microorganisms, it may increase the spread of the disease rather than slow it down.
Like soap, dust and ash, microbicides are absorbed by mixing with water, forming a sticky mixture.
The World Health Organization recommended ash and dust as a substitute for soap when it was not available.
Proper handwashing techniques recommended by the United Nations Centers for Disease Control to prevent transmission include:
Wash your hands with warm, cold running water.
Running water is recommended as it can be contaminated by staying in the water, while the temperature of the water is not shown to make a difference.
Hand hygiene includes washing with soap, the back of the hands, and between the fingers and under the nails.
Soap removes microbes from the skin, and studies show that people prefer to wash their hands with soap than with water.
Hand washing with soap for at least 20 seconds.
Hand-washing creates a soap-like scrub, which helps remove microbes from the skin, and the more you scrub your hands, the more microbes are destroyed.
Wash well with running water.
Hand washing on the table can make hands dirty.
Dry it with a clean cloth or let it air dry.
Wet, dry hands are prone to dirt, and the most common places where dirt is at risk are horse manure, the muzzle, the area between the fingers, and the base of the fingernails.
Artificial fingernails and toenails may be a meeting place for microbes.
Dermal fillers are recommended to protect hands from dryness, as dry skin can cause skin damage that can increase transmission of infection.
Anti-viral alternatives can be developed to facilitate handwashing when tap water and soap are not available, for example, storing water in a jacket or condom jar in a pre-made container or using a clay bag if necessary in developing countries. In some water-limited situations (such as schools or rural areas in developing countries), water-holding solutions such as "water-in-jacket" are available. Other affordable alternatives are available.
Water softening is a simple technology that uses a suspended tablet to soften a liquid, and a soap dispenser to pour a small amount of water on the hands and a bowl of soap.
The drying effect of hands is an essential part of the hand sanitizer function, but there are some opinions on the drying effect of hands in public restrooms.
A growing body of research suggests that Clinic toilets are much cleaner than the electric hand dryers found in some of the public toilets.
In 2008, a study was conducted by the University of Westminster in London, and sponsored by the toilet toilet cleaning industry's European manufacturer Cotael, to compare the cleaning rates of toilet cleaning products, and the thermal information of hand dryers and hand dryers models.
After washing and drying hands with a hand sanitizer and a hot air dryer, the total number of bacteria on the surface of the fingers increased by 194% and on the palm by 254%.
Hand drying with advanced air-conditioning equipment showed that the overall number of bacteria on the surface of the fingers increased by 42% and on the palms of the hands by 15%.
After washing and dehumidifying hands with a toilet flush, the total number of bacteria was reduced to 76% on the surface of the fingers and 77% on the palms of the hands. The scientists also conducted experiments to detect possible contamination of other toilet contaminants with the room climate as a result of the hand washing methods.
The advanced hand-washing machine, which emits air at a speed of 180m/s (650km/h; 400 mph) was able to remove microorganisms from the hand and the part and covertly contaminate other users of the hand washer and the environment of the washroom by 2 meters.
Using a hand-held hot air dryer will disperse microorganisms up to 0.25 m from the machine.
The toilet cleaning showed that no microbial organisms were transmitted. In a 2005 study by TUV Proct and Umwelt, methods of hand-washing were evaluated.
Changes in bacterial counts were observed after washing hands:
There are many different professional hand dryers, and hand dryers have been compared to flushing a toilet with a toilet paper.
Washing with a hand sanitizer is a good alternative to using soap or water when traveling.
Alcoholic hand sanitizer must contain at least 60% alcohol.
Medical hand washing became mandatory after the Hungarian physician Ignaz Semmelweis discovered its effectiveness (in 1846) in controlling disease in hospital environments.
There are electrical devices that allow hospital teams to wash their hands when they are awake.
One study found that handwashing reduced the rate of infection.
Handwashing is a medical procedure that lasts at least 15 seconds, using a small amount of soap and water or a liquid to rinse and wash all parts of the hands.
The hands must be washed by mixing and matching the parts of the hand with each other.
If there is dirt under the fingernails, a sharp nail brush can be used to remove it.
Since microbes can live in the water on the hands, it is important to wash and dry them thoroughly with a clean cloth.
After flushing, the toilet flush should be used to remove the water (or open any closed doors if necessary).
This protects the hands from re-contamination by the plant.
The purpose of handwashing in health care organization is to remove the causes of disease.
The New England Journal of Medicine reports that hand washing is unacceptable in the medical community and that most doctors and nurses forget to wash their hands before touching a patient, thus transmitting germs.
A study showed that regular hand washing and other practices can reduce microbial infections in the blood by 66%, the World Health Organization developed a demonstration scale of hand washing and hand hygiene for health care providers.
A guide to hand washing by the organization can be made available on the website for the public.
A proper investigation was conducted by Hitby and others.
Commercial machines can clean and verify the initials, if a demonstration of the adjuster's arrangement is required.
The WHO has five "time zones" for hand washing:
After contact with blood fluid.
Before a microbial cleaning mission, and
After patient care. Soap additives (disinfected or antimicrobial soap) provide a detergent action to wash hands.
As an act of killing, it may be prescribed for surgical procedures or in settings where there is a high level of antibody resistance.
All microbes should be removed.
This procedure requires hand-washing and washing of the arms to the ankle, usually in 2-6 minutes.
Long-term hand washing (10 minutes) is not necessary.
When washing, water from the sink should be prevented from returning to the hands.
After washing is finished, the hands are dried with a cleansing cloth and a medical dressing is put on.
To reduce the spread of the microbe, it is best to wash hands or use a hand sanitizer before and after caring for a sick person.
For the control of microbial infections in hospitals, it has been found that the greatest benefit of hand sanitization is in the initial 20% of washing.This benefit is less when the number of washings is increased to 35%.
Washing with plain soap results in three times the average rate of bacterial infections transmitted to food compared to washing with antibacterial soap. A comparison of handwashing with alcohol and handwashing with antibacterial soap for a 30-second statistic shows that alcohol hand sanitizer reduced bacterial contamination by 26% compared to antibacterial soap by 26%.
However, soap and water are more effective than alcohol-based handwashes for reducing influenza H1N1 virus and Clostridium bacterium fungus in hands. Efforts to improve hand hygiene in health care settings can be promoted by education for hand washing teams, increased availability of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, and writing and memorizing orders for the team.
More research is needed on the most effective practices in different health care settings.
In developing countries, hand washing with soap is recognized as an effective tool for achieving good health, and even for good nutrition.
However, the lack of reliable bottled water, soap or hand washing facilities in people's homes, schools and workplaces has led to calls for universal hand washing practices.
For example, in most rural areas of Africa, hand washing tubs are not available near private or public toilets, although there are cheap options to produce hand washing tubs.
However, low hand washing rates can be the result of a compulsive habit due to lack of soap and water.
The increasing prevalence of hand washing with soap could influence political decisions and increase awareness of the benefits of hand washing as a long-term habit in the population.
For this to work effectively, monitoring and evaluation are required.
A systematic review of 70 scientific studies found that social measures are more effective in promoting handwashing in LMICs, while social marketing campaigns are less effective. An example of the rise of handwashing in schools is the Three Star Method by UNICEF which encourages schools to take, for example, sensible steps to ensure that students start washing with soap among other clean and hygienic requirements.
When the lowest score is recorded, schools can be changed from one to three stars.
The construction of the handwashing station could be part of the initiative to increase handwashing implemented to reduce child morbidity and mortality.
World Handwashing Day is another example of a handwashing awareness campaign that seeks to change attitudes, as a result of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic, UNICEF released a handwashing emoji.
Some studies have identified the value of hand washing in underdeveloped countries in relation to DALY.
However, one review suggests that adding soap and water to handwashing is more effective than other cleansers.
The impact of hand washing on human health - especially for people in vulnerable situations such as mothers with children or wounded soldiers in hospital - was first reported in the 19th century by two discoverers of hand hygiene: Hungarian physician Ignace Semmelweis who worked in Vienna, Austria and Florence Nightingale, the discoverer of the English nursing method.
At the time, most people still believed that infections were caused by a foul odor called "myasma".
In the 1980s, the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention of the United States recommended hand washing as a prevention method to stop the transmission of infections.
The outbreak of swine flu in 2009 and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 has led to increased awareness of the importance of hand washing with soap in many countries to protect individuals from chronic diseases.
For example, posters of "hand washing techniques in proper proportion" next to hand washers have been hung in public toilets and in office toilets in high-rise buildings and airports in Germany.
The phrase "washing hands" means to declare a healthy person to take responsibility for or participate in the matter.
This comes from a fragment of the Gospel of Matthew where Pontius Pilate washes his hands after deciding to crucify Jesus, but it has become a widely used phrase in some English communities.
In Shakespeare's Macbeth, Macbeth begins to wash his hands in an attempt to cleanse himself of a tainted idea, feeling guilty about the crimes he has committed and persuading his wife to do so.
It has been found that people who have an unethical thought process, they resort to hand washing more than anything else, they resort to hand washing equipment more than anything else.
In addition, those who are trained to wash their hands after deep meditation are less likely to engage in other purifying practices, such as volunteering.
Religions describe hand washing for both ritual and symbolic purposes, the use of water rather than soap to wash hands is part of the hand washing tradition in many religions, such as the Baha'i faith, and Hinduism, and the Tivilah and Neilath Yadaim in Judaism, and the Lavabo in Christianity, and the Wadada in Islam. Religions and rituals of the Purification of the Hand wash especially after performing rituals.
Hinduism, Judaism, and Islam all require hand washing after using the toilet.
Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Judaism, and Islam also require hand-washing before and after meals.
Workplace risk controls for COVID-19
Workplace harm controls for COVID-19 is a program that establishes safety and health measures for harm control to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
The appropriate workplace risk controls depend on the location and task of the work, the risk of exposure to the workplace resources, the severity of the disease in the community and the risk factors of individual workers who may be vulnerable to COVID-19.
According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), exposure to workplace hazards is the least relevant to the general public and company workers, so basic infection prevention measures were announced, including hand washing and encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick or have respiratory problems, and routine cleaning and disinfection of the workplace environment.
Central risks of the workplace include those who request to be quarantined from people who are not known or suspected to have COVID-19, but may have been infected through social transportation or international travel.
This includes workers who have contact with the general public such as schools and high-level industrial work environments, engineers and some high-level flight organizations.
Risk management for this group, as well as basic infection prevention measures, including ventilation with advanced air filters and protective masks and the availability of personal protective equipment if a person has COVID-19.
OSHA considers health-care and morgue workers at risk of COVID-19 to be at high risk, and the risk is increased if the worker uses ventilators or collects samples of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases.
The appropriate damage control for workers in the engineering control section such as negative pressure air exchange rooms and personal protective equipment appropriate to the task.
The spread of COVID-19 can have many impacts on the workplace.
Workers may be absent from work due to the risk of illness and the need to care for others or the fear of contracting the disease.
Business partners may change the demand for goods and the reason for ordering those goods (such as marketing at the time people come to buy or delivery or sales by the order).
Recently, cargo ships in geographic areas affected by COVID-19 may have been stopped. Preparing for an infectious disease and contingency planning can be used to perform safety tasks.
The plans disseminate risk levels related to the virus's workplaces and work tasks, including sources of infection and adjustments to household and community-based risk factors and individual risk factors such as age or chronic disease conditions.
They also outline the necessary controls to address risks and contingency plans for situations that may increase the spread.
Disease preparedness and plans may be subject to national and international regulations.
Goals for outbreak response include reducing the spread of disease within the team and protecting those at high risk of health complications and minimizing the impact on other diagnosed individuals through their support chain.
The severity of the disease in the community where the burden is high has been taken into account in the responses.
The rise of loss control is a concept widely used in the practice of safety and security for the group of loss control by the activity.
When the effects of COVID-19 cannot be controlled, the most effective controls are engineering controls followed by quality controls and personal protective equipment.
Engineering controls involve the avoidance of workers' exposure to hazards independent of the worker's behavior and can be the most active solution to the implementation.
Managerial controls are changes in the workplace or actions that require action by workers.
Personal protective equipment (PPE) is considered less effective than engineering and management controls, but can help prevent infection.
All types of PPE must be selected based on worker safety, appropriate classification such as applicable (e.g. breathing difficulties), proper care, legal dressing, extended, replaced, as appropriate, appropriately removed, cleaned, stored or prepared to avoid contamination.
According to the United Nations Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), occupational hazard exposure is least common among individuals and corporate workers.
Basic infection prevention measures were recommended for all workplaces to include frequent hand washing and encouraging workers to stay home if sick and have respiratory problems including coughing and wheezing, provision of clothing and dust mites, preparation for remote contact or swapping of blades if necessary, advising workers to use more tools and equipment and extending the factory's cleaning and disinfection routines.
Promoting the identification and avoidance of infected people is an important step in protecting workers, customers, visitors, and others in the workplace.
The United Nations Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that workers with symptoms stay at home until they recover from the stroke, stroke symptoms and any other symptoms for at least 24 hours without the use of antipsychotics or other medications, and until the disease condition subsides, allow workers to stay at home to care for sick family members, and workers who have been informed about the measures.
According to OSHA, workplace central risk includes those who are in close or frequent contact with a six-foot (1.8 m) tall person who is not a suspected or probable COVID-19 carrier, but may be infected with SARS-CoV-2 through community transmission or because the individual has traveled internationally to a COVID-19-infected location.
These include workers who are connected to public places such as schools, industrial workplaces or retail establishments. Engineering controls for this and high risk groups include the installation of advanced air filters and increased personal ventilation rates and the installation of medical barriers such as plastic surge protectors and the installation of a delivery window service for customers. Transport controls to prevent this and high risk groups include encouraging sick workers to stay home, setting up more face-to-face contact points with doctors, setting up other emergency equipment and procedures to prevent unnecessary travel to places where COVID-19 may spread, developing a workplace safety plan, using a safety net to protect workers from COVID-19 and other health and safety hazards, providing training and training on how to protect workers from COVID-19 and other health and safety issues, and providing appropriate training and guidance to employers and supervisors on how to protect workers from COVID-19 and other health and safety risks.
Workers in this risk group are rarely required to use ventilators.
If a person becomes ill at an airport, appropriate controls may be put in place to protect workers and passengers, including separating the patient from others by 6 feet and assigning one of the group to care for the patient, providing a face mask to the patient, or requiring oral protection and a glove when the patient coughs or sneezes.
The crew must wear protective medical gloves when handling a sick passenger or handling a body fluid or contaminated air and add personal protective equipment if the sick passenger has a persistent cough or severe respiratory distress.
Hands and protective gear should be provided in a plastic bag and dirty items should be cleaned and disinfected. For bulk markets, which includes shopping and cruise ship traffic, damage controls that delay travel when sick or quarantined individuals and direct notification to the ship's medical center if a person has a cold or other symptoms on board.
Ideally, medical care should be available in the quarantine room.For schools, child care units and the CDC will announce a temporary closure for cleaning or disinfection if an infected person is in a school building considering the social spread.
When there is little effort to reduce social transport, social distancing methods can be implemented such as avoiding travel and other large gatherings such as medical education or religious gatherings or mass dining in a cafeteria, increasing the time between tables and organizing trips and student holidays, limiting unnecessary travel, and using medical office space for children with flu symptoms.
When there is a significant outbreak in the local community, despite the availability of social distancing measures, an extended school holiday may be considered.For the Executive Board's mandate to implement routine daily activities, the immediate health risks are underestimated by the CDC.
Law enforcement officers who must contact infected or suspected COVID-19 patients are advised to follow the same medical emergency techniques, which include appropriate personal protective equipment.
If there is close contact during the dangerous load, workers should clean their vehicle belts and tires and recycle them, using household cleaners and hand dryers, and using standard cleaning procedures.
OSHA assures health care and morgue workers that they are at high risk.
High-risk work involves the delivery of health care and support and the medical laboratory and transportation of workers known or suspected to have COVID-19.
These workers are at increased risk if workers use ventilation equipment or collect samples from patients or suspected COVID-19.
Air exchange devices include the airway into the throat of the patient, and the intravascular and the tracheostomy devices, and some dental devices and tests or examination of samples.
High-risk mortuary work includes workers preparing for funerals who were infected with COVID-19 at the time of death; these workers are at high risk if they become infected.Additional engineering controls for these risk groups include quarantine rooms for patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, when respiratory exchange equipment is used.
Negative pressure devices for respiratory problems may be appropriate in some health care settings and in the afterlife.
Samples should be processed with a Level 3 inspection device.
The World Health Organization (WHO) advises patients to stay away from the waiting area for testing for suspected cases of COVID-19.
In the United Nations, NIOSH advanced filtered N95 masks are best used in intensive care, prescribed respiratory protection program that includes breathing tests and training and medical examinations.
Other respirators offer protection and enhanced comfort to workers.The World Health Organization does not recommend a medical vest as a respiratory illness for COVID-19 but rather it is transmitted through fluids.
The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends only surgical masks for medical examination.
For those who collect samples of respiratory problems in the care and transportation of COVID-19 patients without ventilators, WHO recommends surgical masks, eyeglasses and face shields, and medical masks and gloves.
If a respirator exchange machine is used, the surgical mask is converted to N95 or FFP2.
Given the separate PPE support approved, WHO recommends that the need for PPE be reduced to information dispatch, medical barriers such as medical windows, allow only those with direct contact with care to enter COVID-19 patient rooms, use only PPE supplies for special purposes, continue to use the same respirators without removal during patient care in the same way as in diagnosing the disease, monitor and manage the PPE support chain, and recommend the use of masks for those without symptoms.

We find ourselves in a particular situation this month.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it impossible to maintain our global social connections and responsibilities to one another.
We have no precedent for its challenges, but we know that our best response depends on our teamwork and team building, which is the most important part of this organization.
We've seen the compassion and the fire among all our friends in emails and phone calls and chat, and it's an incredible humanity that we're happy to work with.
I couldn't be more grateful and happy to have you as a partner.
Last week, some people complimented me on our work.
They thought about how much it means to the world to have Wikipedia now, how powerful it is to be seen as an online resource and to be accessible to everyone.
It makes your work happen, whether you're contributing to the site or paying our contributors or supporting our communities.
The world needs the information that Wikipedia provides, now more than ever.
Now is not just the time for what we do, but how we do it, to make a meaningful impact on the world.
Because of the importance of this mission and your role in it, we're making some important adjustments to how we work together, starting this week.
The adjustments to our work and schedules
As Robin mentioned at the beginning, last night Team C met to discuss our roadmap for the next few days and months.
In this conversation, we considered that our ideas would be a critical response to what we were facing and would be the best way to continue our organization at this time.
For the most part, we wanted to keep the pressure on and to support our mission for the long haul.
If you need a reduction, that's fine.
To the entire team, the promoters, the promoters:
We work about 4 hours a day, or at most 20 hours a week.
We do not announce a holiday. If you can work more than the normal hours, the mission can use you.
Anyway, the world is in an unprecedented state, and whether you need to take care of your loved ones, go to a health club or go to a doctor, your health is our top priority.
We won't waste your time.
If you are sick, do not work.
It should be done without saying, but we say it.
No sick days or sick pay are required, just call your manager and help your team change the schedules and tables to ensure that the work area is managed properly.
(If you have COVID-19, please call Bryan's T&C Ops team, T&C can help you with support and ensure your condition is being appropriately monitored by supervision)
People are getting paid full price for every hour.
We have said and we will repeat it with pride to our delegates, our contractors and our fellow staff.
Everyone is paid for their work based on the hours they work under normal circumstances.
This includes those who are sick or unable to work.
If you want to work, we support you.
Most people use work as a way to escape the stress of the world around us.
What incredible rewards we can give, especially in times like these.
Again, this is about looking after yourself.
We request that you speak to your manager, so we know what to expect and what we can arrange accordingly.
Some works are considered to be basic.
There are some things that we have to keep doing.
SRE, HR Ops, Trust&Safety, Fundraising (and others) teams are doing important work that may need support.
We will begin a process with all departments to align our current goals and focus on the collaboration that is essential to our mission.
We all have so much to do, we're just focusing on the basic projects.
Slow now won't hurt you later.
We don't plan to "try something twice" once the pandemic is over.
We don't do any more work to get the license, which is now an ugly and inappropriate act.
We accept that the situation has changed, and we are working to identify new targets and timing.
What's happening with APP?
To accommodate our new workload and daily work hours, we need to adjust the timetable to deliver our 2020-2021 annual plan.
We intend to propose a revised 2019-2020 plan that will give us more time to raise funds to allow workers to do the hard work and care for themselves and our loved ones while helping those in need to reduce their work schedules for the next several weeks.
This additional schedule greatly reduces the burden of the current work schedule and puts pressure on all organizations.
We will present our proposal to the board next week and update our representatives and teams.
Thanks to the APP team for leading this.
Office of Situation, Hazard and Cleanup
Last week, we learned that one of our FS-based friends may have been infected with COVID-19.
Anyway, without much notice, we hired a virus-cleaning team to clean up all the surfaces in our San Francisco office.
They used the hospital's anti-virus solution to disinfect all surfaces, as well as the waiting rooms and elevators in our rooms.
The building has its own health care officers who support the safety of their tenants.
We feel comfortable that the office is well prepared for the time when we decide to return.
Our DC office is located in WeWork, which has provided COVID-19 medical guidelines to us and all DC staff members.
In the past week, our DC office has moved completely to the newly expanded Safety Line location in San Francisco.
As some of my NYS-based friends know, we're in talks to rent a place in Brooklyn.
These discussions are ongoing but may be delayed.
Some of our friends are working from home for the first time.
Long-term employees working from home know that it can be a hassle, and we wanted to give you some advice:
Limit the duration of visits to no more than one or two hours.
If a long-term meeting is required, consider how to complete the course in a few days.
Describe the meeting clearly, have a working plan, and send an introduction to the topic of study.
Problems are discussed in video, using Google Docs and Xoom tools to facilitate collaboration and live communication.
Have a moderator facilitate all meetings, have someone monitor the chat for questions and record the list of speakers, and have someone take notes (or help take notes).
Email tech support if you need a comfy headset.
Use safety equipment for small meals.
Use Stack's electronic channels to talk to your employees about distributed work.
The HR functional team is looking for a scientific e-work protocol to help increase collaboration within the organization.
This past week, we asked all donors and recipients to withhold all public contributions to Wikimedia, such as data recovery, until WHO declares the pandemic over.
We tell them that we understand that our requests for rejections and other appointments may make it impossible to complete their donation activity, and that no one is responsible for delaying or changing their goals.
Over the next week we will be implementing additional policies for Wikimedia and regional conferences and other articles.
The public at the global organization seems to be saddened by the situation's deterioration but relieved by the delivery and ability to focus on their organizations and Wikimedia and vice versa.
Continuing, the CRT works to put a page on Meta-Wiki to provide a forum for the organization to monitor the impact and publish our contacts with them.
Working absences related to COVID-19
We will send an invitation to your account on Thursday at 14:00 UTC or 07:00 PT for a special staff meeting.
We will use this time to post updates, answer your questions and spend some time networking.
We are here together and here to help in any way we can.
At the appropriate time, we can continue to find information in this email, and all basic information related to COVID-19, in the Wikia office.
The CRT continuously updates these pages and information in one place.
We are also working to extend legal contacts with staff who will be based in countries currently affected.
If you have any questions about travel, events, electronic work types or the average of challenges or anything else you might need help with, please feel free to contact and work with CRT.
We are here to help provide support and assistance as needed.
If you have a confidential or sensitive problem, please email Brian Noonan - Global State HR Operations Manager.
None of these changes should be seen as a forced exit from our jobs.
Rather, they will remember that in this time, our work and our efforts are needed to match a situation that we did not have before.
These are the steps that we believe are necessary to support each other, so we can continue to work, to provide the assistance they need, and the service the world depends on.
Our planned work will be done on time.
For now. It's time to collaborate and provide space for the important work that will be done in the days and months ahead.
We need all of you to do this, and so we need you to take care of yourselves and your families so that you're in the best shape when we need you.
Now, please wash your hands and don't touch your face.
The team is led by Katherine, the CRT (Amanda K, Amy V, Bryan J, Doreen-D, Gergory V, Jamine V, Lynette L, Ryan M, and Tony S), and the other team managers (Grant I, Heather W, Jaime V, Janeen U, Lisa S, Ryan M, and Toby N).
Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an enzyme that is found on the outer surface (cell membrane) of cells in the lungs, arteries, heart, kidneys, and intestines.
ACE2 is inhibited by the activity of the related enzyme angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) by reducing the amount of secondary angiotensin and increasing Ang1-7, making it a promising drug for the treatment of cardiovascular disease. ACE2 is also useful as a cell entry portal for some coronaviruses.
The human reaction to the enzyme is often expressed as hACE2.
Zinc-containing zinc metal angiotensive enzymes are expressed on the inner surface of the cell membrane and other tissues.
The ACE2 protein consists of the N-terminus of the M2 peptide protein and the C-terminus associated with the dominant amino acid.
ACE is a single type of I-type protein, with the enzyme active on receptor cells on the surface of lung cells as well as other tissues.
The stem cell membrane isolated from ACE2 is transported to the stem protein, an enzyme called p-shidis, and becomes a polar protein in the blood cells and is significantly isolated and transported to the urine.
ACE2 is found in many organs: ACE2 is found in the cell membrane, especially in the cells of the cyclic diploid type C, the cells of the small intestine, the cells of the internal walls of arteries and veins, and the soft tissue cells of the arteries in most organs.
ACE2 mRNA expression is also found in the frontal lobe, in the midbrain, in the deep cerebrum, and in the cerebrospinal fluid.
The primary function of ACE2 is to balance the balance of ACEs.
ACE converts the hormone aniotensin I to angiotensin II in the blood.
ACE2 is formed by the double displacement of the carboxyl-termial amino acid phenylalanine from anigotensin II (Asp-Arg-Bal-Tyr-IIe-His-Pro-Phe) and hydrolyses into the vasodilator angiotensin (1 - 7, (H-Asp-Arg-Val-Tyr-Lle-His-Pro-OH).
ACE2 can also duplicate a number of other peptides in the cell such as -[des-Arg9] bradykinin, apelin neurotensin, dynorphin A, ghrelin.
ACE2 also regulates the naturally occurring amino acid metabolite SLC6A19 and has also been found in Hartnap disease.
As a transport protein, ACE2 serves as the main entry point into cells for some coronaviruses, including HcoV-NL63; SARS-CoV (which causes SARS); and SARS-CoV-2 (which causes COVID-19).
More specifically, the co-transcription of the S1 subunit of the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 proteins into the coagulation enzyme ACE2 on the cell surface, results in a large-scale transformation of the transcription and localization of both the virus and the enzyme into the endosome within the cell.
It is hypothesized that reducing the level of ACE2 in cells may help fight the disease.
However, some professional associations and bodybuilders recommend continuing standard ACE reduction and ARB therapy.
The formulation and analytical development published in the April 11, 2020 issue found "the use of ACEs developed with a significance of 34% reduction in risk of adverse events relative to controls".
Furthermore, "the risk of acute pulmonary disease was reduced in patients treated with ACE inhibitors in patients at increased risk of developing pulmonary disease, especially those who had a stroke and heart failure".
Use of ACE inhibitors has been associated with the management of acne-associated pneumonia, although the outcomes were less healthy than the overall risk of pneumonia.
Human-made ACE2 (rhACE2) has been proposed as a new treatment for severe lung injury, and has been shown to be effective for pulmonary embolism and hypoxia in small amounts with lipopolysaccharide-containing symptoms of severe hyperventilation.
The half-life of ErhACe in humans is about 10 hours with one action being 30 minutes plus the effect lasting 24 hours.
Some of the findings have led to the development of rhACE2 as a potential drug for those with pre-existing systemic protease angiotensin disorder (RAS blockade) or with a breakdown in the clinical setting for treatment of severe pulmonary disease.
COVID-19 apps are mobile apps designed to help track people who may have come into contact with the 2019-20 coronavirus outbreak, for example, identifying people (contacts) who may have come into contact with an infected person.
A large number of programs have been developed and made available, with official government support in some jurisdictions.
Some of the workbooks have been developed to build the relationships between the programs.
Specific concerns have been raised, especially about systems based on geographic location tracking of software users.
Minimizing the use of personal devices and steps such as using Bluetooth signals to access personal devices and other mobile devices.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple announced that they would be teaming up to support Bluetooth installed apps that run fully on Android and iOS.
In China, the Chinese government, together with Alibaba, has developed an app that allows citizens to check whether they have been with people who have had COVID-19.
It is used in more than 200 cities in China. In Singapore, a program called TraceTagger is used.
The app was developed, prepared and will soon be made available to the government by the IT Association. A North Macedonian initiative "Stop Corona" Bluetooth is the leading app for finding infected people and providing rapid response to health agencies.
The app was developed by the Ministry of Communications and Technology and the Ministry of Health.
As of April 14, 2020, the app was available for free download from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.
On 12 April, the government announced that the vaccine program is the latest best of its development, and will be available to consumers within a week. Similar initiatives are planned in Ireland and France ("Covid Stop").

Identifying concerns about the loss or spread of harmful "coronavirus" software, Apple has restricted the types of organizations that can add coronavirus-like software to its App Store. The restrictions are only for "normal" or otherwise well-known organizations.
Google and Amazon have also jointly imposed similar bans.
The specific attackers raised concerns about the potential problems of surveillance using the coronavirus program, particularly whether the surveillance infrastructure built to deal with the coronavirus would be disrupted once the threat was over.
International lobbying and 100 organizations have announced what they call a call to limit such scrutiny.
The organizations announced eight conditions for government projects:
Precision should be "the whole of the law. Necessary and equal".
The extra care and attention must be after sunset;
Use of data should be restricted due to COVID-19
Data security and privacy must be maintained and demonstrated to be protected;
The digital observer must avoid exacerbating discrimination and exclusion;
Any transfer of data to a third party must be explained in the law;
There should be security men to respond to harassment and protect their civil rights;
Significant participation is required by all "relevant stakeholders", including public health experts and disadvantaged groups. The computer network of the German Council of the CCC (Correspondents Without Borders) (Correspondent Eon Grönzin) (RSF) and the Dantaboo for the Campaign are also involved.
The proposed plan by Google and Apple was to address the problem of persistent surveillance by removing the monitoring mechanism from the mobile operating system when it was no longer needed.
Some countries use location-based Internet monitoring instead of software, removing both requires the software to be downloaded, and the ability to disable monitoring.
In Israel, the Internet is censored.
The Internet-based solution for accessing data from empty spaces has the problem of accurately hiding its properties.
However, not all systems and server centers need to be able to access personal location data; a number of privacy-preserving systems have been created that use only server centers to communicate with each other (see section below).
In South Korea, a non-software-based system was used to carry out the communication monitoring.
Instead of using a specific program, the system collected surveillance information from a variety of sources such as mobile device surveillance data and transaction card data, and combined these to form a note in written letters to the alleged victims.
In addition to using this information to inform covert communications, the government has also made its data locations available to the public, some of which are still allowed due to changes in privacy laws since the MERS outbreak in the country.
This information is available to the public through a number of programs and websites. Countries such as Germany use both data collection centers and privacy protection systems.
It's April 6, 2020, and the details haven't been released yet.
Monitoring the maintenance of private connections is a good idea for the establishment, with a large body of literature research dating back to at least 2013. As of April 7, 2020, more than a handful of expert groups are working to address the specifics of the friendship, such as the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
However, PEPP-PT is a protocol that includes both a central accumulator and a central disconnect pathway, and does not have a single protocol. The central disconnect protocols include the close monitoring of the protection of specifications (DP-PPT/D-3t), the number of temporary connections (TCN, FKA, CEN), the protocol and method of operation of the sensor specifications for mobile phone connectivity monitoring (PACT), and others.
In these protocols, personal identification data is never removed from the device; all synchronization occurs in the device.
The privacy group at the MIT Media Lab is developing "safety routes", a platform for applying privacy-preserving techniques to the collection and use of location data or shortcuts to monitor the spread of COVID-19.

On 9 April 2020, the Singapore government announced that it had declassified the source code of the BlueTrace protocol used by the official government software.
On April 10, 2020, Google and Apple, the companies that control the Android and iOS mobile platforms, released a protocol for intrusive surveillance, which they believed would protect privacy, based on a combination of Bluetooth Low Energy and preserving cryptography.
They also published specifications and details of the core technologies used in the systems.
According to Apple and Google, the system is set to play out in three phases:
See the role of the device so that the government can falsify an official surveillance program to protect the coronavirus patient
The scale of this work is directly related to ISO and Android, and Apple's plan is to take the title to upgrade and continuously monitor issues closely by first installing the system into the new Apple browser, and then patching it in the same way when the threat has passed.
Alternative medicine (also called re-purposing, re-engineering, re-use or treatment-altering medicine) is the re-purposing of an accepted medication for a different disease or condition, from the one for which it was originally developed.

The COVID-19 vaccine is a proposed vaccine against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).
Although no vaccine has completed clinical trials, there are several attempts at advanced levels to develop a vaccine.
In late February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced that it expected a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus, to be available in less than 18 months.
Five vaccines were selected in Phase I of the safety studies in April.
COVID-19 was identified in December 2020.[1]
The multiple outbreaks around the world in 2020 will trigger investment and research activities to develop a vaccine.
Several organizations are using established genomics to develop suitable vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.
In April, the CEPI Development Team announced key requirements for the development of the vaccine, including speed, manufacturing capacity, materials management and global accessibility.
In April, CEPI scientists announced that 10 different platform technologies were under research and development during early 2020 to create an effective vaccine against COVID-19.
Several target platforms are advanced in the area of safety research including:
Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) (Developed and selected vaccine type 1: moderna, mRNA-1273)
Targeted virus (stage 1 developer and selected vaccine: CanSino Biologics, adenovirus type 5
As reported by CEPI scientists in April, a total of 115 vaccines were selected in the early stages of development, with 78 of them designated as active projects (79 according to the Milken Institute), and 37 more announced, but with little public information available (which is either planned or sketched).
Phase 1-2 trials produce a baseline safety and immunity test, normally testing for a proven, safe drug to be administered and in both cases, prescribing the drug in a more accurate, effective manner.
Phase 3 trials typically involve more participants, including a control group and testing the effectiveness of the vaccine to prevent the disease while monitoring for adverse effects of the drug intake.
Of the 79 selected vaccines in active development (as of early April 2020), 74 were not at human assessment level (still in research).

In March 2020, the United Nations, industry, and three universities joined forces to acquire the IBM Advanced Computing, combined with computing tools from Hewlett Packard Enterprise, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.
Some vaccines have different effects, also called hidden effects.
This means they can benefit after the disease stops.
A massive random recruitment in Australia is looking to recruit 4,170 healthcare workers.
Improvement vaccines may not be safe or effective.
Early detection to determine efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines use animal-specific samples, for example in mouse extracellular matrix (ACE2), a requirement for biosafety level 3 approaches to handle live viruses, international management to ensure safety measurement of trials.
Vaccines against SARS and MERS were tested on animal models rather than humans.
As of 2020, there is no cure or vaccine for SARS that has been shown to be either safe or effective in humans.
According to research papers published in 2005 and 2006, the identification and development of new vaccines and drugs to treat SARS was the top priority of governments and public health officials worldwide. There is also no proven vaccine against MERS.
As MERS became a common disease, it was believed that the availability of SARS research could provide a useful framework for the development of vaccines and therapeutic practices against MERS-CoV infection.
As of March 2020, there was one DNA-based MERS vaccine that had completed Phase 1 clinical trials in humans, and three more in development, all virus-targeted vaccines, two adenovirus-targeted (ChAdOx1-MERS and BVRS-GamVac), and one MVA-vectored (MVA-MERS-S).
Media network publications have published theoretical plans to create a virus behind COVID-19 that a vaccine was previously known to be available.
The inventions were prompted by viral signals posted on social media, with the invention of a genetic function and a vaccine for other strains of coronaviruses such as SARS coronavirus.
2019 coronavirus disease b (COVID-19) is an infectious disease that causes severe symptoms of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
Common symptoms include coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath.
Other symptoms may include fatigue, sore throat, diarrhea, throat swelling, loss of smell, and stomach pain.
The time of onset of symptoms is usually around five days but may vary from two to fourteen days.
While most cases result in mild symptoms, some develop into pneumonia and bi-organ infection.
As of 17 April 2020, more than 2.24 million cases have been reported in 210 countries and territories, causing more than 153,000 deaths.
More than 568,000 people have recovered.The virus is particularly spread among people during close contact, often by small respiratory droplets due to coughing, wheezing, and talking.
While these tiny droplets are produced during inhalation, they mostly fall to the ground or to surfaces and are otherwise contagious over long distances.
People also become infected from touching dirty surfaces and then touching their eyes, nose, and mouth.
The virus can survive on surfaces for more than 72 hours.
Transmission is most common during the first three days after initial symptoms, although spread may occur before the onset of symptoms or in later stages of the disease. The standard method of diagnosis is due to the timely reversal of the polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) in nasal and throat imaging.
The use of masks is recommended for those suspected of having the virus and their caregivers.
Medical recommendations for the use of masks by the general public vary, with some governments recommending against their use, some recommending their use and others requiring their use.
Currently, there is no vaccine or specific treatment for COVID-19.
Local transmission of the disease has been reported in most of the countries in the six WHO regions.
Those infected with the virus may be asymptomatic or have flu-like symptoms such as fever, cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath.
Symptoms include sudden difficulty breathing, persistent chest pain or tightness, confusion, difficulty waking up, and blue facial or lip swelling: immediate medical attention is advised if these symptoms are present.
Less commonly, symptoms of upper respiratory problems such as shortness of breath, fever or sore throat may also be seen.
Symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea are noted in the statistics.
Some cases of sinusitis initially occur only in acute sinusitis and rapid heartbeat.
In some, the disease may progress to a disability, damage to two limbs, and death.
This is called the duration of symptoms.
Five to six days may change to two to 14 days.
So within 11.5 days of infection, reports indicate that not all those infected with the virus will have their symptoms improve.
The role of asymptomatic carriers in transmission is not yet fully understood, although preliminary evidence suggests that they may be the cause of disease transmission.
The proportion of people who are asymptomatic is currently unknown and under investigation, with the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) reporting that 20% of confirmed cases remained asymptomatic during their hospital stay.
The International Commission on Stereoimmunity (ICS) began tracking asymptomatic cases daily at 1⁄4: 166 infections that day, 130 (78%) were asymptomatic at diagnosis.
Both lice and ticks can carry large viral load
Loud speech produces more small droplets than normal speech.
A study in Singapore found that uncoated cocaine can deliver small droplets of cocaine over a distance of 4.5 metres (15 ft).
Although the virus is not generally airborne, international academic science has suggested that bioairborne transport may be appropriate or that airborne particles in the pathways of people's rooms produce positive samples of RNA viruses.
Some medical procedures such as aerial ventilation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) may cause the respiratory tract to be ventilated and thus cause airborne transmission.
While there is speculation that it may have spread through facial contact, this fear has been ruled out.The virus is most vulnerable when people are symptomatic; while outbreaks may occur before symptoms appear, the risk is low.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) says that while it is generally not clear how quickly the disease spreads, one person infects two to three others. The virus can persist on plants for hours to days.
Specifically, the virus is detectable for one day on cardboard, for more than three days on plastic (thermally softened polymer) and clear steel, and for more than four hours on 99% copper.
However, heavy loads depend on humidity and temperature.
Soaps and detergents are effective if used properly, soap products break down the protective levels of viral fat, neutralizing them, as well as releasing them onto skin and other surfaces.
Other treatments, such as chemical cleansing and antiviral cleansing (antibiotic therapy), are less effective. In a study in Hong Kong, leakage samples were collected from a patient two days after the start of hospital stay.
Five of the six patients, the first example showed the highest viral load, and the sixth patient showed the highest viral load on the second day of testing.
SARS-CoV-2 is a new severe respiratory syndrome virus, first isolated from three people with severe respiratory illness associated with severe respiratory distress in Wuhan.
All of the motifs of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus are derived from related coronaviruses in nature.
Outside the human body, the virus is killed by household soap, which inactivates its protective spores. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to the original SARS-CoV.
The lungs are the organs most susceptible to infection by COVID-19 because the virus enters the cells of the lungs via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enzyme, which is the most common type of alveolar cell type 2 in the lungs.
The virus uses a special surface of the virus called a "peplomer" to bind to ACE2 and enter the host cell.
Severe cardiac failure was found in 12% of hospitalized patients in Wan, Si, and more frequently recurred in severe illness.
Symptomatic rates of cardiovascular disease are high, leading to systemic inflammation and immune system disorders, but impaired heart muscle may be associated with ACE2 receptors in the heart.
ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the heart and are involved in cardiac regulation.
High rates of bleeding (31%) and clotting (25%) have been found in ICU patients with COVID-19 infections and may be associated with lower recovery probability. Analysis of people who died from COVID-19 found that the spread of alveolar damage and swollen lymph nodes was higher in the breast.
Although SARS-CoV-2 is biased towards ACE2 and expresses respiratory epithelial cells, patients with severe COVID-19 infection have symptoms of bronchitis.
In particular, pathogenic GM-CSF-containing T cells have been shown to bind to the complement of single-cell IL-6-secreting infections and severe C-disease in COVID-19 patients.
Lymphatic receptors of cells are also reported in the autopsy.
The WHO has published several screening protocols for the disease.
The standard method of testing is the reaction of the polymerase chain reaction of antibodies during synthesis (rRT-PCR).
The test was normally performed on breath samples obtained by a nasal and throat sample; however, nasal or bladder sampling may be used.
Results are usually available within a few hours to two days.
Blood tests can be used, but they require two blood samples taken two weeks apart and the results are valid immediately.
The scientists were able to isolate a coronavirus strain and release its genetic sequence so that laboratories around the world could independently develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests to detect infection.
As of 4/4/2020, antibody tests (which may detect active infections and whether a person has been infected in the past) are in development, but are not widely used.
Experience with the sinuses has shown that the accuracy is only 60% to 70% accuracy.
The United States FDA approved the first point-of-care test on 21 March 2020 for use later that month.The diagnostic guidelines published by the Zhongnan Hospital of the University of Wuhan recommended methods for identifying infections based on medical conditions and epidemic risk.
The double-glazed instrument with a latch, a counterbalance and a backward statistic was also used in the early development of the instrument.
Respiratory control, radiography (disease of the lungs with altered alveolar filling) and rigidity may appear as progression of the disease.
There is limited information available about the risk of micro-morbidity and viral infection from COVID-19.
The most commonly found patients in anatomy are:
Opinions: Pneumonia, congestion, pneumonia and pneumonia.
Four strongly-linked viral strains can be distinguished:
Mild bronchitis: abdominal bronchitis, bronchitis of the lungs, unusual large bronchitis, inflammation of the middle with lymph nodes and a large cell structure without a membrane.
Severe respiratory: Distributive alveolar damage (DAD) with diffuse released aviary.
DAD is the cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hypoxia.
Pulmonary circulation: The organs of secretion from the alveolar glands and the central canal of the lung.
Blood: DIC: low response of red blood cells.
Prevention measures to reduce the risk of infection include staying home, avoiding crowded places, washing hands with soap and water for 20 seconds, practicing proper breathing and avoiding contact with eyes and nose, and washing hands with unwashed hands.
The CDC recommends covering the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, and recommends using a sanitary towel if a sanitary towel is not available.
A proper hand sanitizer is recommended after each cochineal or pacemaker.
The CDC has recommended the use of a face mask in public places, to limit movement by people without symptoms.The social distancing plan aims to reduce contact of infected people with large groups by closing schools and workplaces, suspending travel and avoiding large public gatherings.
Distancing rules include that people must stay at least 6 feet (1.8 m) away from each other.
No medical treatment has been found to be effective in stopping COVID-19.As a vaccine is not expected until early 2021, a critical part of managing CODIV-19 is trying to slow the peak of the epidemic, known as "testing the curve".
The CDC also recommends that people wash their hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after using the toilet or when hands are visibly dirty, before eating, and after snorting, using cocaine or painkillers.
It further recommends using hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol, but only when soap and water are not available.For areas where hand sanitizers are not available, the WHO offers two guidelines for local production.
In these laws, the antimicrobial activity is increased by ethanol or isopropanol.
Hydrogen peroxide is used to help remove bacterial spores in alcohol; it is "not an active ingredient in hand sanitizer".
Glycerine was added as a moisturizer.
People are administered supportive care, which may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and organ support to other infected individuals.
The CDC recommends that people suspected of carrying the virus wear a plain face mask.
Extended oxygen coverage (ECMO) has been used to diagnose respiratory distress, but its benefits are still under investigation.
Personal hygiene, healthy lifestyle and dietary precautions are predicted to improve immunity.
Supportive care may be useful for people with mild symptoms in the early stages of infection.The WHO and the International Commission on Health have published medical recommendations for the care of people hospitalized with COVID-19.
Medical observers and pulmonologists at the United Nations have compiled treatment recommendations from viral fragments in a free resource, the IBCC.
As of April 2020, there is no specific treatment for COVID-19
For symptoms, some medical professionals recommend paracetamol over ibuprofen for the first line of use.
Precautions should be taken to reduce the risk of transmission of the virus, especially in health care settings where the implementation of procedures can create aerosols, such as the introduction of air vents or hand ventilation.
For healthcare professionals treating people with COVID-19, the CDC recommends placing the infected person in an air-in-one room (AIIR) and using standard precautions, contact lenses and air-in-one ventilators.The CDC plans to establish a protocol for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) during the pandemic.
Recommended items: PPE, respirator or face mask, eye protection, and medical gloves. Where available, respirators (instead of face masks) are recommended.
N95 respirators are intended for industrial use, but the FDA allows the masks for use under the Emergency Use Authorisation (EUA) guidelines.
They are designed to protect against airborne particulates such as dust, but their effectiveness against specific biological causes is not guaranteed for non-prescribed uses.
When masks are not available, the CDC recommends using a face shield, or homemade mask, as a last resort.
Most cases of COVID-19 are not severe enough to require ventilation or exchange, but a few do.
The type of respiratory support for COVID-19 associated with respiratory arrest is actively being researched for people in hospitals, with some evidence that the use of a ventilator can be avoided by a positive airway or air pressure.
Whether either has the same benefit in people with severe disease is unknown.
Some doctors recommend staying with a rapid ventilator if available, as this method limits the spread of aerosol particles relative to the lungs. Severe cases are more common in older people (those over 60 years of age, especially those over 80 years of age).
Many developed countries have insufficient hospital beds for each patient, limiting the ability of health systems to cope with the sudden increase in the number of people with severe coronavirus who require hospitalization.
A clinical trial in China found that 5% were admitted to intensive care units, 2.3% required ventilation support, and 1.4% died.
In Sindh, about 30% of people hospitalized with COVID-19 end up in the ICU.
Air-conditioning devices are becoming more complex due to the progression of symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in COVID-19 and the oxygenation process is becoming increasingly difficult.
Air conditioners are capable of pressure control modes and high PEEP is required to enhance oxygen delivery while reducing the risk of air pollution associated with air entering the lungs.
High PEEP may not be available in the airways of older people.
Research into advanced therapies began in January 2020, and several antiviral drugs are in clinical trials.
Antiviral drugs appear to be the most effective.
Although new therapies take until 2021 to develop, many breakthrough therapies have been approved for other uses or in advanced trials.
Antiviral therapies may be tested in humans for severe disease.
The WHO has recommended that volunteers abstain from trials of safety and efficacy of the treatment.The FDA has granted temporary approval for plasma therapy as an experimental treatment in situations where a person's life is directly or indirectly at risk.
It does not require clinical research experience to demonstrate efficacy and safety for the disease.
In February 2020, Sin developed a mobile app to reduce the spread of the disease.
Participants are asked to enter their name and ID number.
The software is capable of identifying "close contacts" using patient care information and high-risk infections.
Each user can check the status of three other users.
If a high risk is identified, the app not only recommends staying at home, but also alerts local health officials.A lot of mobile data analytics, facial recognition technology, and smartphone location tracking are used to locate infected people and their contacts in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore.
In March 2020, the Israeli government enabled security officials to apply mobile phone data on people who may have coronavirus.
The method was used to enforce quarantine and protect those who might have been in contact with infected people.
Also in March 2020, Deutsche Telekom deployed a mobile app that collects location data with the German Federal Government's Director of the Robert Koch Institute for Research and Prevention.
Russia has developed facial recognition technology to identify those who are breaking quarantine.
The health unit of the Italian region of Giulio Galera was informed by the mobile phone developer that "up to 40% of citizens continue to be concerned in any way".
The German government announced a 48-hour weekend in Huxley with more than 42,000 participants.
The President of Estonia, Christti Kaljulaid, also announced a global call as a smart first step against the spread of the coronavirus.
Individuals may become depressed as a result of quarantine, travel restrictions, adverse drug reactions, or fear of infection
He heard Roy O'Connor say that "more than one set of social isolation, loneliness, health scares, depression and economic downturns are all contributing to poor internal health and well-being".
It may have a mild course with few or no symptoms, as with all other severe respiratory illnesses such as the common cold.
Moderate cases usually recover within two weeks. Severe or severe cases take three to six weeks to recover.
Pregnant women are more likely to develop severe COVID-19 infection than those with other commensal viruses, such as SARS and MERS, but less is known about COVID-19.
In severe cases, COVID-19 can rapidly progress to severe depressive symptoms of C-Severity Syndrome (ARDS) that can cause shortness of breath, oxygen deficiency or prolonged organ failure.
Problems common to COVID-19 include organ failure, blood clotting and damage to the heart, kidney and liver.
Blood clots, especially those caused by the timed increase in pro-serumbin (a protein in the plasma of the cell) were reported in 6% of those hospitalized with COVID-19, while abnormal renal function was seen in 4% of those with the condition.
With about 20-30% of people diagnosed with COVID-19, the enzymes are prescribed.
According to the same report, the median time between first symptoms and death was 10 days, with five isolated cases.
However, patients being referred to the ICU had a median time to seven days between death and survival.
In a study of pre-existing conditions, the median time to onset of the first signs of death was 14 days, with a six-level range to 41 days.
In a study by the National Health Commission (NHC) in China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8% while the mortality rate for women was 1.7%.
An experiment to study changes to post-mortem C samples showed that the spread of alveolar (human upper respiratory tract) infection was caused by the deterioration of the cellular fibromycosid (animal laboratory) in the lungs.
The song was a lullaby and was observed in the cells of the nemosytes.
The following are the symptoms of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
In 11.8% of the deaths reported by the National Board of Health, heart damage was noted in high protein levels or cardiac arrest.
According to May data from the United Nations, 89 percent of those hospitalized were those with pre-existing conditions.The availability of medicines and the socioeconomic status of a region also influenced the mortality.
The death toll varies by region because of differences between regions, but also because of the difficulty of formalising them.
The number of moderate cases can be a factor in overestimating the mortality rate
However, the fact is that deaths are the result of those who were infected in the past and the current death toll is unknown.
Smokers are 1.4 times more likely than the average person to have severe COVID-19 and approximately 2.4 times more likely to require special care than those who do not smoke. Concerns have been raised about the long-term outcome of the disease.
Hong Kong government hospitals have developed a drug that can save 20 to 30 lives of some people who have recovered from the disease, and 30 lives of those who have been affected by it.
This may also lead to the importance of careful medical care in recovery.
As of 5 January 2020, it was unknown whether people infected with the disease had active, long-lasting immunity in people who recovered from the disease.
Resistance to this strain is thought to be dependent on the behaviour of other viruses, but other cases that have recovered from COVID-19 have been associated with positive coronavirus test results that were revealed in the following days.
These conditions are thought to be worse with long-term infection than with double infection.
The virus is thought to be naturally occurring and originated from an animal, from Spilovirus disease.
Its initial origin is unknown, but by December 2020 the disease had become fully transmissible from person to person.
Research on the first 41 COVID-19 cases, published in the January 2020 issue of The Lancet, estimated the earliest time of symptom onset to be 1 January 2019.
Official publications published by the WHO list the main symptoms as of 8 December 2019.
A set of criteria is commonly used to calculate the mortality rate.
These numbers vary by region and time period, and are also influenced by the size of the screening, quality of the health system, treatment options, time from initial outbreak, and population characteristics such as age, sex, overall health.
In late 2019, WHO signed the ICD Patient Diagnostic Ballet with code U07.1 for laboratory deaths and U07.1 for deaths in medical units or clinics without the presence of a SARS-CoV-2 laboratory.
According to Johns Hopkins University statisticians, the global mortality rate per case was 6.9% (153,822/2,240,191) as of 17 April 2020.
The number varies by region, with other metrics such as case fatality rate (CFR), which shows the proportion of diagnosed people who die from the disease, and infectious fatality rate (IFR), which shows the proportion of infected people (diagnosed or undiagnosed) who die from the disease.
These counts are not time-sensitive and do not look for specific populations of infected individuals when deciding on cases.
While not all infected people develop antibodies, the presence of antibodies can provide information about how many people are infected.
In the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy, Castiglione d'Adda, a small village of 4,600 people, 80 people (1.7%) died.
In the "Gangelt" episode, the disease spread through a carnival festival, spreading among younger people, causing a lower mortality rate, and not all COVID-19 deaths can be categorized as such.
Moreover, the German healthcare system has not yet been overwhelmed.
In the Netherlands, 3% have antibodies, which are obtained from donors.
69 (0.004% of the population) were confirmed to have died from COVID-19.
The impact of the epidemic and its mortality rate are different for men and women.
Deaths are higher in men according to studies done in China and Italy.
It is the most feared by men in their 50s.
In China, the mortality rate for men was 2.8 percent and for women 1.7 percent.
The exact cause of the sex differences is unknown, but genes and genetic traits* may be involved.
Based on the scientific evidence of intersex resistance, the lower prevalence of smoking in women and the increase in co-morbid conditions in men such as hypertension at a younger age than in women, it is possible that higher rates of mortality in men are the cause.
In Europe, 57% of those infected were men and 72% of those who died from COVID-19 were men.
As of April 2020, the U.S. government has not tracked gender-related data for COVID-19 infection.
Studies have shown that viral diseases such as Ebola, influenza and SARS affect different men and women.
Women health workers and nurses are particularly high, and they have a better chance of being exposed to the virus.
The World Health Organization announced on 11 February 2020 that the official name of the disease would be "COVID-19".
WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus explained that CO is the symbol for coronavirus, VI for disease, and 19 for the time of the outbreak when it was first diagnosed: 31 December 2019.
The name was chosen to avoid denoting a specific geographical area (e.g. China)....
WHO uses "COVID-19 virus" and "virus responsible for COVID-19" in most public discussions.
Both the disease and the virus are commonly referred to as "coronavirus".
During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and the disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan coronavirus".
In January 2020, the WHO recommended that 2019-nCov and 2019-coronavirus be used as the two permanent names for disease and virus in conjunction with the 2015 guidelines against the use of place names in diseases and disease names.
The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were released on 11 February 2020.
Due to the size of the blockage according to Chinese ink standards, some digital fabrication engineers print health-critical items such as ink cartridges and ventilator parts.
For example, when an Italian hospital urgently requested ventilatory ventilation equipment, and the parties involved were unable to deliver the equipment in time as requested, a local re-start was made to turn the patient on and off to meet the demand for 100 ventilatory ventilators per night.
Since the beginning of COVID-19, theories, rumors, and misinformation have been circulating regarding the source, measurement, isolation, medication, or other aspects of the disease and it has spread very quickly online.
It is thought that humans may be able to transmit the virus to some animals.
Scientific follow-up failed to find evidence of replication in pigs, rats and chickens.
No medication or vaccine is approved for the treatment of the disease.
International research on COVID-19 vaccines and drugs is being conducted by government organizations, academic groups, and industry researchers.
In March, the World Health Organization began evaluating the 'SOLIDARITY Trial' to test the therapeutic efficacy of four antiviral compounds that have been found to have promising efficacy.
There is no vaccine available, but various parties are actively developing candidate vaccines.
Previous work on SAES-CoV has been useful because both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 use ACE2 derivatives to enter human cells.
Three of the four suspects were tracked down.
One. The goal of the research is to create a template for every virus.
The use of viruses that are inactive or dead, for the purpose of a rapid response of the human immune response to a new infection with COVID-19.
The second strategy, by-product vaccines, is to create vaccines that make the immune system more sensitive to specific parts of the virus.
In the case of SARS-CoV-2, these studies focused on the S-spike protein that helps the virus enter the ACE2 enzyme pathway.
The third strategy is nucleic acid injections (DNA or RNA injections, a new way to make cutan).
Experimental vaccines in each of these strategies need to be tested for safety and efficacy. On March 16, 2020, the first clinical trial for a vaccine began on four Seattle volunteers.
The vaccine contains the harmless genetic code carried by the virus that causes the disease.Antibody dependent enhancement has been suggested as a major obstacle to the development of a vaccine for 2-SARS-CoV, but this is debatable (disputed).
More than 300 active clinical trials were conducted as of April 2020.
Seven trials have been evaluated and approved therapies for the treatment of malaria, and four studies have been conducted on hydrochloric acid or chloroquine.
The majority of China's drug trials were expected to be antiviral, with nine phase III trials of Redivivir across some countries due to report by the end of April.
The development of a medical unit for mobile review of COVID-19 vaccines and drug candidates is ongoing, as of April 2020.The availability of some antiviral drugs has been evaluated for the treatment of COVID-19.These include remdesivir and hydrochloricoquine, lopinavir/ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir are combined to produce beta-blockers in the body.
There is tentative evidence for efficacy by remdesivir, as of May 2020[update]
There has been an increase in the number of patients who have been treated with remdesivir for their emotions.
Phase III clinical trials have been conducted in the US, China and Italy.Chloroquine has been used in the past to treat malaria, with studies conducted in China in February 2020 with significant preliminary results.
However, there are links to the review's review of the study.
Korean and Chinese health officials have recommended the use of chloroquine. Chloroquine is a malaria agent.
However, the Wuhan Institute for Virology, while recommending a daily intake of one gram, notes that eating two meals of food per meal is extremely dangerous and fatal.
On May 28, 2020, the FDA announced that it has approved the use of hydrochlorothiazide and chloroquine in the medical decision-making process for people with COVID-19.The seventh edition of the Chinese Interferon (body's natural immunity against the virus), Ribavirin or Amfibinovir for use against COVID-19.
Early evidence suggests that a diet high in ribavirin is necessary for SARS-CoV-2 to survive in the wild.
Nitazoxanide is recommended for further in vivo pathogenesis following the demonstration of low SARS-CoV-2 immunity. Studies have shown that the primary pathogen protein produced by the muscular proenzyme transporter 2 (TMPRSS2) is essential for entry into SARS-CoV-2 by interaction with the ACE2 receptor.
Trials of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine with or without antibiotics have several limitations that have prevented the medical community from recommending these treatments without in-depth research.Oseltamivir does not inhibit SARS-CoV-2 and has no known role in the treatment of COVID-19.
Cytokine release fluctuations can be a complication in the later stages of severe COVID-19.
There is evidence that hydroxychloroquine may have anti-cytokine disrupting properties. Tocilizumab was removed from the treatment regimen by the International Commission on Drug Safety after a small study was completed.
It was the pilot phase of two randomized controlled trials at the international level in Italy after the results showed people were infected with severe disease.
Combined with blood test samples to determine cytokine deficiency, this means a response to the advances, which can be the cause of death in some infected humans.
Cytokine-6 receptor antagonist was approved by the FDA based on preliminary research for the treatment of symptoms of steroid disruption cytokine occurs with heavy Hocker, CAR T cell therapy in 2017.
At this time, there is no randomized or controlled evidence that tocilizumab is an effective treatment for CRS.
The purified and synthesized antibodies collected by the immune systems of those who have recovered from COVID-19 for people who need to be screened as a non-vaccine means of immunization.
This function was tested for SARS without any definite results.
Viral conjugation is the predicted mechanism of action by which treatment-deficient single antibodies can control immunity against SARS-CoV-2.
Other mechanisms however, such as antibody-dependent cytotoxicity or bacterial decomposition function may be viable.
Other forms of slow-treatment antibodies, for example, the use of monolonal probiotics is in progress.
The products include the collection of the yellow blood plasma, which consists of the protein plasma of the blood of recovered patients and the specific antibodies of the virus that can be added to accelerate its spread.
Coronavirus diseases are a group of diseases with common symptoms.
Li Wenliang was a doctor at the Wuhan General Hospital, who later contracted COVID-19 and died after heightened awareness of the virus's spread.
