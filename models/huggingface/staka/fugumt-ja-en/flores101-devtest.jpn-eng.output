This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also conveys detailed points that are not commonly found in fossils, such as color and stereoposition.
According to scientists, the feathers of this animal were of amber color on the outside and warm color on the inside.
This discovery was also a clue to explore the evolution of feathers in birds.
Although dinosaur feathers don’t have a well-developed axis known as axes, the researchers speculate that the axes were more likely to have evolved later than other features, due to other feather features, such as cotton feathers and flakes.
The structure of the feathers suggests that it was used not for flight purposes, but for body temperature regulation and visual effects. The researchers suggested that, despite this being the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers and is not the feather of a leopard.
The researchers suggest that the specimen, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, has grown adult feathers rather than chick feathers.

This community frustration has led to current efforts to draft policies around sexual content on sites that host millions of open licensing media.
Most of the content was theoretical, but the written program simulates the observations made in the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for was the effect of the tidal force working between the dark matter of the Milky Way and the dark substance of the Milky Way.
The Milky Way also exerts its power on the Sagittarius galaxy, so that the moon’s gravitational pull will cause the Earth to be full of tide.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter has the same effect on other dark matter as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter around the galaxy is made up of a lot of small particles that surround the galaxy like a kind of halo.

In France, voting is traditionally carried out in old-fashioned equipment, where voters are isolated at the booth and a sheet of paper showing pre-printed candidates is placed in the envelope.
The voter will post the envelope in the ballot box and sign the electoral register after the employee confirms the identity of the voter.

Candidates can have representatives present in any part of the procedure; in the evening, they will be opened by volunteers under strict scrutiny, following certain procedures.

Later he moved to Adenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has since appeared in the Sheriff's Court of Edinburgh for the murder of his son.
She has been imprisoned from prosecution to trial, but her photos are open to the public so that evidence from witnesses can be compromised.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but the Scottish judicial system is different, and the court sees the publication of photos as potentially negative.
Media playback is unsupported on your device Media captionProfessor Pamela Ferguson at the University of Dundee says journalists who publish photos of suspects are crossing a dangerous bridge.
The royal court detective in charge of the prosecution has expressed his intention not to comment further on the reporters, at least until they are prosecuted.
According to leaked information, the document refers to border disputes, and Palestinian hopes are based on the pre-Middle Eastern War borders of 1967.
In addition, it is reported that the issue of the future state of Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley, which are sacred to both countries, is being dealt with.
Israel says it will require the agreement to continue its ten-year stay in the canyon, while the Palestinian government agrees to stay for only five years.
Auxiliary harmful biological extermination tests were monitored and evaluated for their effectiveness, so the shooters participating in this test were closely monitored by the ranger.
The partnership between NPWS and the Australian Sports Shooting Association (NSW) recruited qualified volunteers for the Sports Shooting Association’s hunting program.
According to Mick Offlin, deputy director of the Park Conservation and Heritage Bureau, who works with the NPWS, the four gunners who were selected as the first firefighters were guided by comprehensive safety and training.
Yesterday, Martery swore an oath at the new Temporary Election Management Committee (CEP), composed of nine members.
It is the fifth CEP in four years for Martery.
Last month, the Presidential Committee recommended the resignation of its predecessor, the European Commission, as part of a move to move the country towards a new election.
The committee was a countermeasure that President Martery took against the widespread spread of opposition protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent, this protest was triggered by the absence of the planned election, which has occurred since 2011.
There have been about 60 reported problems with the faulty iPod heating, with a total of six fires and four minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry has announced that 27 accidents related to the device have occurred.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had reported 34 additional overheating incidents that were “not serious.
The ministry responded by saying that it was “really sorry” about Apple’s postponement.
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 a.m. local time (GMT at 9:19 p.m. Friday).

According to the Pacific Tsunami Alarm Center, there are no signs of tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, hijacks the bus to keep tourists in Hong Kong hostage.
Roland Mendoza fired at tourists on the M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued, but at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, and Filipino photographers were also released.
The photographers were replaced by elderly women who wanted to go clean, and Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins took over his father's place and went on the medical path.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Riggins used his spare time to start researching premature births.
His research shows that administration of hormones accelerates the maturation of the fetus’ lungs.
Xinhua reported that a government investigator had recovered two Black Box flight recorders on Wednesday.
The fellow wrestlers also respected Luna.
Tommy Dreamer says, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. She was my first manager. She died on the night of two moons. It was a pretty unique night, just like her. She was a strong woman."
Dustin "Gold dust" Ronells commented, "Luna was as unusual as me...or maybe even more... she loves her and she'll be lonely without her... if she can, I want her to be in Heaven."
A poll of 1,400 people conducted prior to the 2010 federal election showed that the number of people opposed to Australian republicanization increased by 8% from 2008.
provisional Prime Minister Julia Girard argued that Australia should move to a republic once Queen Elizabeth II's reign is over during the 2010 federal election campaign.
A poll of 34% agrees with this opinion and hopes Queen Elizabeth II will be Australia's last monarch.
Opinion polls show that 29% of people think Australia should be a republic as soon as possible, and 31% think it should not be a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was scheduled to swim in 100m, 200m freestyle and three relays in the Commonwealth game, but his health is suspected due to the symptoms he complained of.
He could not take the medicine necessary to reduce the pain because it was forbidden in the tournament.
On January 25, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
The discovery was confirmed by several people using different hardware and software by early February and announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for the Earth, forming proteins, carrying organic matter that supports life.
Scientists want to understand how planets have formed since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago, and especially how the Earth has formed.
Kuomo, who served as governor earlier this year and signed a law to legalize same-sex marriage last month, is 53 years old.
He called the rumor "political talk and stupidity."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that NextGen is a system that allows aircraft to fly on short-distance routes, save millions of gallons of fuel per year, and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It employs satellite technology in contrast to conventional ground radar technology, allowing controllers to identify aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No special transportation is provided, the ground train does not stop at Wembley, and there is no parking lot or park and ride facility on the ground.
Concerns about the lack of transportation has led to the possibility of being forced to play in a closed venue without the support of the team.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the birth of new species of birds in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, but the process was thought to take longer because it was hybridized breeding of the eigenspecies Galapagos finch and the imported species Osabonten finch.
Gold is a metal that can be processed into any shape, and it can be rounded down to make it smaller.
It can be pulled and made into a wire, twisted and knitted, and if it is stretched or rolled, it becomes a board shape.
It can be stretched very thinly and pasted on other metals, and can be so thin that it is sometimes used for hand-painted illustration decorations called "colored manuscripts".
This is called the pH of chemical substances, and it is possible to make test paper with the squeezed juice of purple cabbage.
Cabbage juice reacts to chemicals and changes color depending on whether it is acidic or alkaline (basic).
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (h of pH) contained in the inspected chemical substances.
Hydrogen ions are protons that remove electrons (because hydrogen atoms are composed of protons and electrons one by one).
When two dried powders are rolled together, it is kneaded and gripped with a clean wet hand.
The moisture on the hand reacts with the outer layer, creating a strange feel, forming a kind of shell.
In the cities of Halappa and Mohenjodaro, sewerage was maintained and there was a flush toilet in almost every dwelling.
The remains of sewerage have been found in the houses of the cities of Crete and Minoa on Santorini, Greece.
There were toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia and China, as well as in Roman civilizations, which were part of mixed public bath facilities.
If you call someone thousands of miles away, they will automatically call you through the satellite.
Satellites in space receive calls and reflect them almost instantly.
The satellites were sent to space by rocket, and scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth’s atmosphere distorts some of the light and scenery that enters the human field of view.
In order to launch satellites and telescopes and deploy them to space, you first need a giant rocket with a height of more than 100 feet.
This wheel has changed the world unbelievably, and the biggest achievement that this wheel has brought us is that it has made transportation much more comfortable and faster.
Trains, cars and many other means of transportation were born from them.
Below that, there are many medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey from rabbits to seagulls and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including stray cats) that feed on much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards and birds.
The secret to its success is the concept of a niche, in which there is a special task for each cat, so as not to compete with other cats.
Lions are the most social cat-family animals and live in a large group called Prides.
Pride consists of one or three blood-related males and more than 30 females and children.
Usually, the females are connected to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion pride shows action similar to a flock of foxes and dogs, and animals are surprisingly similar to behavioral lions (although other large cats) and keep their prey intact.
A really well-balanced and highly athletic tiger can climb, swim, jump a long distance, or pull five times as much as a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group of animals as lions, leopards, and jaguars (the genus Leopard), and only these four large cat species can be hatched.
The tiger's jealousy is not like a lion's yell, but rather an intimidating threatening jealousy.
Othellots like small animals. They catch monkeys, snakes, rodents and birds if possible. Most of the prey that Othelot hunts are much smaller creatures than you.
Scientists believe that Otherot will find and chase where the animal (prey) that feeds on the ground smells.
High night vision is very effective, and it is good to move quietly, Otherlot blends into the surroundings, jumps into the prey and hunts.
When a small group of creatures (a small number of individuals) is separated from the large group they belong to (e. g. , moving across mountain ranges or rivers, or moving to a new island that cannot be easily returned), they often find themselves in a different environment.
Because there are different resources and different competitors in this new environment, new groups need different features and adaptations than previously needed, and can be a powerful competitor.
The original group hasn’t changed at all, and it still needs to be adapted the same way it used to be.
As new groups begin to adapt to new environments, over time, they begin to appear different from other groups.
Ultimately, in thousands or millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they can’t be called the same species.
This process is called seed formation, which simply means the formation of a new species; seed formation is an inevitable result, and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that humans suck, and take in carbon dioxide that humans vomit (as a breath).
Plants produce nutrients from the sun through photosynthesis, as well as shades.
We build houses with plants and make clothes from plants, many of the ingredients we eat every day are plants, animals cannot live without plants.
Mossaurus was the top predator of that period, so there was no other person to fear than Mossaurus.
The long jaw is lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, and the palate has another row of teeth, which means that if you go through here, there is no escape path.
I don't know for certain, but it may have been a bivalved tongue, which could have eaten turtles and large fish, co-eating, or other mossasaurs.
In addition, it will attack anything that comes into the water, and huge dinosaurs such as Tyrannosaurus will not be hostile.
Most of their food is familiar to us, but the Romans ate bad things and delicacies, such as boars, peacocks, snails, and a kind of rodent called rats.
Another difference is that poor people and women ate while sitting in chairs, while rich men liked banquets where they slept and relaxed.
In ancient Rome’s diet, ingredients from the U. S. and Asia to Europe could not have been incorporated during the following centuries.
For example, there were no corn, tomatoes, potatoes and cocoa, and there were no ancient Romans who tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built the first temple in each of the gods, which was regarded as the house of the gods.
People gave birth to the gods, and the priests tried to meet the wishes of the gods through rituals and festivals.
In each temple, there was an open courtyard, and after that there was a shrine where only Shinto priests could enter.
As part of the temple, a special pyramidal tower called Gigrad was sometimes built.
The top part of the tower was a special sanctuary for God.
Houses were not so important to people living in the warm climate of the Middle East.
The Hebrew family mostly lived outside.
The women cooked in the garden, and none of the shops were just stalls facing the street, and stones were used for the building of the house.
Wood was very expensive and valuable because there was no large forest in the land of Canang.
Greenland was a deserted area. According to Norse tradition, the redheaded Erik was expelled from Iceland for murder, and when he headed west he discovered Greenland and named it Greenland.
However, regardless of his discoveries, the Eskimo tribe had already lived there at the time.
Every country remains a Scandinavian, but there have been significant differences in the nationality, royalty, customs and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.
If you’ve ever seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there’s a treasure map behind the American Declaration of Independence.
But that wasn’t the case, something was written on the back, but it wasn’t a treasure map.
What was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence was the title of the original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776, and the title is written upside down at the end of the document.
We don’t know who wrote it, but we know that this large parchment (measured to be 29.75 inches x 24.5 inches) was stored in a wrapper around its early days.
Therefore, it tends to be added simply as a label.
In the D-Day landing campaign and subsequent battles, the northern part of France was liberated, but the southern part was not yet liberated.
The rulers were the French of "Bicie," who in 1940 made peace with the Germans and cooperated with the invaders rather than fighting the invaders.
On 15 August 1940, the Allies invaded South France, which was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the American and Free French forces liberated southern France and headed to Germany.
Civilization is a culture that is shared by a large group of people who live and work together, i. e. society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin adjective civilis, meaning citizen, and is related to the Latin noun civis, meaning citizen, the noun civitas, meaning city or city state and defining the scale of society in some way.
A city state is a precursor to a state: a civilizational culture means the succession of knowledge over generations, the survival of cultural footprints, and fair dissemination.
Culture that is out of the mainstream often disappears without being recognized as a formal civilization, so there is no historical evidence left.
During the Revolutionary War, 13 states first formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, and Congress was the only component of it.
The legislature had no authority to tax, no national executive or judicial authority, so all the actions of the legislature were dependent on the state authorities, but the state authorities were often uncooperative.
There was no authority to disable interstate tax laws or tariffs.
Revising the provision required unanimous consent from all states, but each state was disregardful of the central government, so representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, alongside the German national team, was the second most successful team in the world, winning the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motor racing.
In the northern region, winter sports are prosperous, and Italian players competing in international games and the Olympics are produced.
There are about 7,000 islands in Japan, the largest of which is the Honshu Islands, the seventh largest island in the world.
Since Japan is a gathering of islands, it is often called "group islands" geographically.
The beginning of Taiwan began in the 15th century when European sailors called the island "Ilha Formosa" (beautiful island).
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company, based in the southwestern part of Taiwan, changed the way natives produce grain and hired Chinese workers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) declared that the army would occupy the coasts of western and northern Taiwan, and in 1885, Taiwan would be the province of Qing.
In 1895, after the defeat of the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki and handed over the sovereignty of Taiwan to Japan.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: the sun clock (Intiwatana), the Temple of the Sun (the Great Tower), and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can learn more about the past.
Machu Picchu has been restored up to 30% as of 1976 and is still being repaired today.
For example, the most popular still image film format in the world is 35 mm, which was the mainstream film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but more importantly, its aspect ratio inherits the format of the image sensor of the digital camera.
It is confusing, but 35 mm is actually 36 mm in width and 24 mm in height.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this form (divided by 12 to find the simplest total ratio) is said to be 3:2.
Most common recording formats (e. g. APS-based recording formats) are equivalent or close to this aspect ratio.
The “three-division method” seems to be a simple example of creating dynamism while maintaining the order of the video.
The most effective position where the main subject should be placed is the part surrounded by intersections of lines that divide the image into three-thirds of the length and width (see example).
The Catholic Church, which has become economically rich and powerful in European history, has become increasingly severe in this period.
Christianity has been connecting European countries with different languages and customs for over a thousand years.
Its universal power had affected everyone, from the king to the commoners.
One of the main doctrines of Christianity is that wealth should be used for the purpose of reducing suffering and poverty, and the church’s fund is a special presence for it.
The central power of the church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and the concentration of power and funds has led many to question whether the doctrine has been fulfilled.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, the United Kingdom began a blockade against Germany.
This strategy was effective and blocked the supply of important military and private goods, but the blockade violated international law, which was codified and generally accepted by several international agreements of the past two centuries.
The United Kingdom used mines in the open sea to prevent ships from entering the entire ocean, putting even neutral ships at risk.
Because the response to this tactic was limited, Germany assumed a similar reaction to its unlimited underwater warfare.
In the 1920s, the ideas popularized by most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolationism.
Seeing the tragedy and brutality of war during the First World War, the countries hoped not to fall into such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the U. S. to work for Edison, New York.
With a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (the former parent) to Thomas Edison, he went to the United States almost innocuously.
In ancient China, there is a unique way to show the period difference, and it became a dynastic characterized by each stage in Chinese history, or a family that held power.
There was also an unstable period in the divided provinces between the dynasties, the most well-known of which was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years, between the Han and the Qin periods.
In these times, many aristocrats fought fiercely over the throne.
Sankokushi was one of the bloodiest times in the history of ancient China, with thousands of warriors fighting for the highest place in the Great Palace of Xi'an.
There were many social and political influences, including the adoption of metric law, the transition from absoluteism to republicanism, patriotism, and the belief that the country is not a sole ruler but a nation.
After the revolution, the profession became a public recruitment system, and all men were eligible to apply, and those who were most motivated and won were able to take the job.
The same can be said for the military, because it has become not a class based on the military class but a class based on ability.
The French Revolution inspired many working class in other countries that have been suppressed, and the revolution began in each country.
Muhammad had a deep interest in problems beyond everyday life, and he often visited a cave called "Heila" in the mountains of "Nur" (light) for meditation.
The cave, which has survived the times, clearly reflects the spiritual inclination of Muhammad.
The cave is located on the mountaintop north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the outside world.
In fact, it is not easy to find even if you know the presence of a cave; when you enter the cave, there is a completely isolated space.
You can see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many mountains around you, from the cave, you can hardly see the outside world and you can not hear the sound of the outside world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only existing one of the seven wonders.
Built by Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many great Pyramid buildings built to enshrine the dead Pharaoh.
There are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid of Giza), several small tombs, temples, and great sphinxes on the Giza Plateau (the cemetery site of Giza), which extends into the valley of the dead in Egypt.
The Great Pyramid is a huge tomb built in honor of King Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the small pyramids, tombs and temples around it honor the wife and family of King Khufu.
The mark of the raised bow looks like a V shape, and the mark of the lower bow is a shape that lacks the needle of the scissor or the bottom of the rectangle.
Up is to start with the tip and press the bow, and down is to start with Frog (where you hold the bow with your hand) and draw the bow.
A raised bow usually produces a softer sound, while a lowered bow produces a stronger and more assertive sound.
You can write the sign freely with a pencil, but remember that there is a musical reason for the marked bow-shaped notation; usually you should follow the sign.
On October 6, 1789, King Louis (16), Queen Marie Antoinette, two young children (11-year-old Marie Terres and 4-year-old Louis-Charles) and Queen Elizabeth, the king's sister, were forced back from the Palace of Versailles to Paris by the market women who became mobs.
On the carriage they returned to Paris, surrounded by mob yelling at the king and the queen and squeezing the words of threat.
The mobling crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage window.
One day, in front of the terrifying queen, one of the mob waved the head of a royal guard killed in the Palace of Versailles.
The Filipinos were responsible for the cost of conquest of the Philippines in the war of American imperialism.
They were forced to pay the bond interest, which was sold under the name of the Philippine government through a Wall Street bank, without prognosis for tax payments to the U.S. colonial government to cover most of their spending.
Of course, the excess profit from the long-term exploitation of the Filipinos would have been the fundamental benefit of American imperialism.
To understand the Knights of Temple, it is necessary to understand the context in which their order was born.
The period in which this incident occurred is called the era of the middle ages, and generally the period of 11th century, 12th century, and 13th century (1000 to 1300 AD) in European history is equivalent.
It is customary to think that the Middle Ages were a historical period between the Middle Ages and the Late Middle Ages, and that the late Middle Ages had ended by 1500.
Technology determinism is a term that actually encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technology promotion and technical norms, to the strict meaning that human fate is driven by the underlying logic associated with its manifestation in scientific law and technology.
Most interpretations of technology determinism share two general theories: the development of technology itself follows a path that far exceeds the cultural and political influences, and the second is that technology is not socially conditional, but rather "impacts" on the inner society.
For example, automobiles may inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, since only a handful of cars do not account for the national road network, a new production method is being developed to reduce the cost of ownership of the car.
The increase in the number of car owners leads to an increase in the rate of road accidents, as a result of which new technologies are developed in the medical field to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism was a major element of cultural determinism formed by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography formed an individual, and over time the customs and cultures associated with the geography were born, which in harmony with the place of society was superior to the law that was pressed freely.
As Paris is known as the center of fashion in the modern world, Constantinople flourished as the center of fashion in the feudal era in Europe.
The fame as the center of the magnificent costume started around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, its status declined mainly due to the return of crusade soldiers with gifts such as silk and spices, which are more valuable than the Byzantine market.
It was at this time that the title as a fashion center moved from Constantinople to Paris.
The heyday of the Gothic style was from the 10-11th century to the 14th century.
The original costume was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to the slow communication route, Western styles may be delayed for 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style; one of the greatest advances at the time as a result of the Crusade was the start of using buttons to close clothing.
Self-sufficient farming is a form of agricultural agriculture in which only the amount of food necessary for agricultural workers and their families.
Self-sufficient farming is a simple system for maximizing yields by combining preserved seeds native to ecosystem regions with wheelwork and other relatively simple technologies, often organic farming.
Historically, the majority of farmers run self-sufficient farming, which is still seen in many developing countries.
Subculture is a culture that brings together fellow players who feel that they are disregarded from the standards of society so that they can develop their own individuality.
The characteristics of subculture may depend on the age, ethnicity, class, location, gender, etc.
The nature of determining the characteristics of a subculture may be a combination of language, beauty, religion, politics, sex, geography, or elements thereof.
Subculture members often show themselves to be part of it in a symbolic and distinctive style, including fashion, humanism and jargon.
One of the most common ways to show the importance of socialization is to capture the few unfortunate cases of childcare abandonment, unfortunateness, or deliberate abuse that prevented adults from adapting to society during the growth process.
Such children are called "wild-child" or "feral-kid"; wild-children may be imprisoned by people (usually their parents), and parents may have refused to raise children with severe intellectual and physical disabilities as a cause of such abandonment.
Wildlings may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before being thrown away or run away.
Some people are said to have been raised by animals, while others are said to have lived on their own in the wild.
Wildlings raised and grown up by non-human animals show almost the same behavior (in the physical range) as animals, such as fear of humans or indifference to humans.
Project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, but scaffolding is one step ahead.
Scaffolds are not a way to learn, but to support people who are using new computer programs, starting new projects, or experiencing new learning.
Scaffolding has both virtual and real, in other words, teachers are a form of scaffolding, as are clip dolls from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are built into the software, which aims to make it possible for students to ask questions, instructions, and explanations about procedures that are considered difficult by themselves.
The reasons why children are left in the foster care system range from abandonment of childcare to abuse and even fear.
Any child should be raised in a well-prepared, well-educated environment, but a wild child is raised in an environment where it is not.
We recognize that the foster parent system is a safe area for these children.
The foster parent system provides safe homes, loving parenting, reliable education, and reliable medical care.
In the foster parent system, it is supposed to provide all the necessities that were insufficient in the home before being taken.
The Internet is an environment where both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication are combined.
The remarkable characteristics of the Internet lead to further dimensions from the point of view of use and satisfaction approach.
For example, it is suggested that "learning" and "socialization" are important motivations for Internet use (James et al. , 1995).
Personal engagement” and “continuous relationships” were identified as new motivational aspects when Eighmey & McCord (1998) investigated the reaction of viewers to the website.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in interpreting micro facial expressions that last for a few milliseconds, i. e. , facial movements.
In particular, he argues that by interpreting micro-expressions accurately, one can find out whether the person is lying or not.
In his "President's Speech," Oliver Sax points out that even those who are brain-impaired and don't understand the speech can correctly evaluate their sincerity.
He even suggests that the ability to interpret human behavior is common to animals such as dogs.
A 20th-century study has shown that genetic mutations have two gene pools, one hidden and one expressed.
Sudden mutations add a new genetic mutation, which is removed from the pool of mutations expressed by the bladder.
Scattering and recombination shuffle mutations between two pools per generation.
For primates with digestive systems such as humans, it is difficult to ingest essential amino acids from plant resources available in the environment of Savannah.
Moreover, if you neglect it, it will lead to serious situations such as growth inhibition and malnutrition, eventually leading to death.
The most accessible plant resource was the protein contained in leaves and beans, which is a nutrient that is difficult to digest unless cooked by primates like us.
On the other hand, animal foods (ants, termites, eggs) are easy to digest and are a good protein source that contains all essential amino acids.
In all respects, it is no wonder that our ancestors have solved the "protein problem" as well as the chimpanzees that live in today's savannah.
Sleep interruption is the process of knowingly awakening during normal sleep hours and falling asleep after a while (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a relatively quiet alarm clock and calling back consciousness without awakening completely.
If you notice that you unconsciously stop the alarm, you have a way to put your watch on the other side of the room so that you won’t be able to stop if you don’t get out of bed.
Other methods based on biorhythm include taking a lot of water (especially water or diuretic tea) before sleep and making it compulsory to urinate.
The degree of peace of mind of a person is the opposite of the degree of tension of the body and the spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force will be, with the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction for everyone.
Anyone can open up enlightenment, and the only thing that prevents this goal is their own anxiety and negative feelings.
Tibetan Buddhism is a belief based on the teachings of Buddha, but it has been expanded by incorporating many techniques from the mercy of Mahayana Buddhism and Indian yoga.
As a rule, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple: it consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that cherishes everything.
Kundalini Yoga aims to awaken Kundalini (the soul of oneself) by combining yoga poses, breathing, mantras, moudra, etc.
The center of Tibetan meditation is Divine Yoga, which visualizes various gods, purifies energy channels, activates chakra, and creates a sense of enlightenment.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, leading to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States, and after the war, the two countries were confronted by conflicts of institutions, processes, and cultures.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
That’s been going on for 40 years, with real battles between Africa and other battlefields such as Asia, Afghanistan and Cuba.
By 17 September 1939, Polish defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became a thing of the past almost overnight, when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after they invaded the eastern region of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-violent Treaty, and other international treaties (both bilateral and multilateral).
Transporting goods by ship is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the ocean.
More than ever, the task of the Navy was to maintain the ability to transport their own people and supplies, while also surely interfering with the ability to transport enemy citizens and supplies.
One of the most notable recent examples is the Operation North Atlantic of World War II, in which the United States tried to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy was mainly using U-boats to try to block this transport.
If the Allies had been defeated, Germany would have been able to conquer the United Kingdom just like the rest of Europe.
It is said that the domestication of goats began about 10,000 years ago, and its center was in the western part of the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to have goats that were easy to pick up milk, hair, meat and skin.
In general, livestock goats were grafted in hills and other pastures, but goats, which tend to take care of groups of goats, were mostly boys, and this practice continues today.
In the United Kingdom, in the 16th century, freight lanes had already been laid.
The freight road was laid in parallel with the board, but the horse pulled it, and it was able to transport the luggage larger than the slightly rougher road at that time at a high speed.
Pillow trees were introduced at a fairly early stage to fix the track to a given position, and over time, it gradually became clear that an iron tip at the top would be more efficient.
This became common, but iron became the cause of the abrasion of the wooden wheels of the carriage.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels; in 1767, the total iron rail was introduced for the first time.
The first known means of transportation was walking, and mankind’s upright walk began 2 million years ago when Homo erectus (meaning “upright human”) appeared.
As a direct ancestor, Australopithecus had no habit of continuing to walk upright for more than a certain time.
Saherantlops may have walked with two legs as early as 7 million years ago, but the characteristics of bipedal walking are confirmed by the fossils of Australopithecus 390-4.2 million years ago.
You can start a more eco-friendly life, participate in an environmental movement, or become an activist to reduce some of the suffering in the future.
In many cases, this is a form of symptomatic therapy, but it is necessary not only to seek a temporary solution, but also to find the root cause of the problem and inactivate it.
It is clear enough that the world has changed greatly with the advancement of human science and technology, and the problem has expanded due to the excessive population and luxury of life.
After being adopted by Congress on July 4, a handwritten draft signed by President John Hancock and Secretary of State Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's printing office in a few streets away.
150-200 copies were replicated overnight, and now it is called "Dumrap Broadside".
The first public reading of the document was made on July 8th by John Nixon in the garden of the Independence Memorial.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th and read to the army in New York on July 9th, while the other arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap Broadsides that are known to exist are the oldest copies of the existing literature, and no original handwritten manuscripts exist.
Today, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs survive and are still alive, and we call them birds.
Many people don’t think they’re dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly in the sky.
However, the appearance of birds still resembles dinosaurs in many ways.
Holding legs with nails and nails, it is an egg embryo and walks with two hind legs like Tyrannosaurus.
In effect, all computers used today are based on the operation of information encoded in binary numbers.
The binary number is represented by either two values (0 or 1), and in order to use the computer terminology, these numbers are called binary or bits.
Internal addiction may not be immediately revealed; such as vomiting is a common symptom, so it is not possible to make a diagnosis immediately.
The most obvious sign of internal addiction is the opening of containers of drugs and toxic household chemicals.
Look at the poison label and see if there is a first aid instruction for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the name insect in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This name is derived from the fact that Tokojirami has been spreading to bed since ancient times as a pest parasite that parasitizes people with high adaptability.
Both sashigami and tokojirami are nesting habits that have adapted to living in the nests and residences of the host.
In the United States, the number of known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) is said to be about 400,000, and is known as a representative neurological disease for young and middle-aged people.
MS is a disease that affects the nervous system of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Studies have found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) as men.
There will be couples who judge that raising a child will not be beneficial to both parents and children.
Such couples can use the adoption system for the baby.
In adoption, the real father and mother lose parental rights, and another couple can become the parent of the child.
The main purpose of science is to elucidate the mechanism of the world through scientific methods, in fact this method has become a guideline for most scientific research.
But that's not all. Experiments are tests that are used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses. Asking questions or observing them is also a guideline for scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical books, especially the Bible written in Latin.
What was accepted was Aristotle’s view on all aspects of science, including psychology.
As the knowledge of Greece declined, I realized that Western countries were separated from the Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend decisively on the existence of endogenous cycles and how they are engraved through internal clocks.
Periodic rhythms are recorded for most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, not just responses to periodic signals from the outside.
The internal clock is an independent oscillator that continues to circulate freely for a certain period of time even if there is no signal from the outside.
Hershey and Chase's experiments were one of the leading experiments suggesting that DNA is a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages (viruses) to transplant their DNA into bacteria.
They tried two experiments, one to mark phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus, and the other to mark phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
Sudden mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the meaning of the fragments of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are reproductive cells.
Only mutations in the reproductive cells are inherited by the child, and mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism, which emphasizes contact with nature, attracts people who are interested in visiting the natural area for the purpose of enjoying the scenery including wild flora and fauna.
Examples of local activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, park tours and informational surveys of ecosystems.
Examples are going to meet orangutans on Borneo to take pictures and learn.
Every morning, people who leave a small rural town and go to work are different from those who have a workplace near their hometown.
In this dynamic round-trip transportation, everyone is connected and supported in some way with a transport system based on a private car.
Science now shows that this massive carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its stable states that have supported human evolution over the past 2 million years.
Anyone who runs a social life uses transportation, almost everyone is dissatisfied with the transportation system.
In developed countries, we rarely hear complaints about water quality or the collapse of bridges.
Why does transportation make such a complaint and fail on a daily basis? Are transportation engineers just incompetent, or are there more fundamental problems?
Traffic flow research is the study of the movement and their interaction of individual drivers and vehicles between the two points.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study the flow of traffic because it is not possible to predict the behavior of the driver at 100% probability.
Fortunately, the driver tends to act within a reasonably consistent range, and therefore the traffic flow tends to have some degree of reasonable consistency, which can be mathematically roughly expressed.
In order to better represent traffic flows, relationships are established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships will help you plan, design and operate road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the sky, and the ability to fly in the sky helped to avoid enemies and to find food and companions efficiently.
Most insects are now able to fold their elbows along the body.
This expands the width of the narrow place to hide from predators.
Currently, only dragonflies and lizards are insects that can’t be folded back.
Thousands of years ago, a scholar named Aristarchus said the solar system was moving around the sun.
While some accepted his theory as correct, many believed that the Sun (and other stars) were moving around the Earth in the solar system.
It doesn’t feel like the Earth is moving, so this seems to make sense.
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on the planet, with water volume more than 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on the planet, and there are places with a width of six miles.
Twenty percent of the water pouring from the rivers on Earth flows out of the Amazon River.
The main stream of the Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long, which collects water from thousands of small rivers.
The construction of the Stone Pyramid continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, but the Pyramid of Giza was surpassed by its size and technical excellence in construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the predecessor monuments built more than a thousand years ago.
The population of the Vatican City is about 800, the smallest independent country in the world and the least populous country in the world.
The Vatican City uses Italian for legal and official communication.
The language most of the people working in Vatican City use on a daily basis is Italian, and Latin is often used in religious rituals.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
It has been known that basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been valued by people since ancient times, and both of them can be found in natural shapes in the natural world, and they can be mined relatively easily with primitive tools.
Philosopher Aristotle advocated the theory that everything consists of more than one of the four elements: soil, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four forms of solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, but his theory also preached that they would transform into new substances and form what appears in this world.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more kinds of metals, remember the many elements on the periodic table.
Elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course there are also metals such as silver and gold.
In addition, those that contain very small amounts of nonmetallic elements such as carbon are classified as alloys.
Everything in the universe is made of matter, all of which are made of tiny particles called atoms.
Because the atoms are so small that they are unimaginable, the last period of the sentence could contain trillions of atoms.
In this way, the pencil of the time that came out to the world was a good friend for many people.
Unfortunately, the status and application of pencils decreased with the advent of new calligraphy.
Now, more and more people are typing messages on the screen of their computers, and there is no need for pencil shaving.
I wonder what will happen to the keyboard if there is a new one.
Nuclear bombs act on the principle that it takes energy to collect many protons and neutrons in a single nucleus.
It's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill, and when we split the nucleus again, some of its energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, and those nuclei tend to split up without doing much.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust, the outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is about 70 km at the front side and about 100 km at the back side.
It is thin under the sea and thick under the highlands.
Because the crust is thin, the sea may increase in the vicinity, and lava was easy to float.
Content theory focuses on finding things that tickle people’s minds and appeal.
These theories suggest that people have a specific need or desire that has become inherent as they mature in their adulthood.
In these theories, we look at the motivations that some people want to do specific things on a daily basis, and the environmental factors that make them do certain things or don’t.
The popular two-content theory is Maslow's phase of desire theory and Hertzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, if the manager is to lead his former peers, there may be two possible behaviors: one that tries to remain "one of his peers."
Admins of this type are not good at making decisions to buy unpopularity, disciplinary disposition, performance evaluation, assigning responsibilities, and confirming the location of responsibilities.
On the other hand, it’s about transforming everything the team has done into individuals that people who feel they need to change with their own hands can’t recognize.
After all, leaders are ultimately responsible for the team’s failure to succeed.
This behavior often leads to cracks between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams require the same level of excellence as traditional teams, but with subtle differences.
Virtual team members often act as contact points for direct physical groups.
Virtual teams sometimes hold meetings in time zones, which are hard to understand by the local management team, so members often have higher autonomy than traditional team members.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique element of the virtual team.
An "invisible team" is a management team that is the senior manager of each member, and an invisible team sets a standard for each member.
Why does an organization want to go through the time-consuming process of establishing a learning organization?One of the objectives of practicing the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively utilized across the functional sector of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can be created.
As a result, the process of working together to overcome impediments can lead to a new and innovative process to meet the needs of customers.
In order for an organization to be innovative, leadership must not only share knowledge and learn from the organization, but also create an innovation culture.
Angel described a continuum approach in 2006 as a way to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to cognitive research, so that the area of research is narrowed and more accurate research is possible.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It has long been known that various types of brain injury, trauma, lesions and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some of the mental functions.
With the rise of new technologies, we can now look at and examine the structure and processes of the brain that have not been revealed before.
This gives us a lot of information and materials to help us build simulation models to understand human mental behavior.
While AI has a strong sci-fi meaning, it forms a very important field in computer science that processes behavior, learning, and intellectual adaptation with machines.
AI research involves the creation of machines that automate tasks that require behavior that requires intelligence.
Examples include control, planning, schedule management, the ability to respond to customer diagnostics and questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
That’s another area that focuses on solving real life problems.
Currently, AI systems are incorporated into some of the home computer and video game software, but are frequently used in economic, medical, engineering and military fields.
Most of the classes are suburban, and teachers often try to take them to places they can’t go on a bus trip.
The technology provides a way to learn through virtual sociology tours, where students can watch museum crafts, visit aquariums, and watch beautiful art while in the classroom.
Also, virtual sharing of out-of-school learning is a great way to look back on your trip and share your experiences in future classes.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina make a website about their trip to the state capital every year, and the website is revised every year, but the old site is stored online so that it can be viewed as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help students improve their writing skills, and students who are just starting to write blogs tend to be more grammatical and sluggish, but having a reader can change that.
Students are often the most critical reader, so blog writers begin their efforts to improve their sentences to avoid criticism.
Also, writing a blog will “enable you to be more familiar with the world around your students.” The need to attract audience interest will make your students smarter and more interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to expand the range of learning beyond the range of traditional classes.
Using blogs properly “enhances students’ analytics and critiques. By actively responding to Internet materials, students can define their position in the context written by others and present their own views on specific issues.” (Oravec, 2002)
Ottawa is an attractive Canadian capital with two languages, with many museums and museums presenting the past and present of Canada.
In addition, there is a Niagara Falls in the south, and in the north there are untouched natural beauty such as muscoca.
All of this makes Ontario stand out, and it is considered by third parties to be a truly Canadian state.
In addition, the large area to the north has a small population, and there are some native areas where almost no people live.
A lot of people are surprised by the population comparison: the number of African Americans living in the United States outnumbers the number of Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island in the world, and it is a unique continent as a habitat for wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent or related to France, and there is also a famous luxury beach resort.
Also, the Arabs brought Islam to this place, which was widely accepted in Comoros and Mayachts.
In the 15th century, Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope, where European influence and colonialism began.
It is bordered by Sahel in the north and surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean in the south and west.
Women: It is advisable for female travellers to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marriage.
It is effective to keep rings (not very expensive ones).
Women should be aware that cultural differences can lead to acts called harassment, and it is not uncommon for them to be tailed or grabbed.
When you refuse a man's invitation, don't be jealous and relentless in your position (whether it's a cultural difference or not, you don't have to reluctantly invite him!).
The foundation of the modern city of Casablanca was built by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was called Ampha, after which the Phoenicians, Romans and the Merenidian used it as a strategic port.
The Portuguese destroyed it, rebuilt it and named it Casa Blanca, but eventually abandoned the city after the earthquake in 1755.
The city was rebuilt as Dalul Badia by Sultan of Morocco and was named Casablanca by a Spanish trader who established a trading base.
Casablanca is one of the hardest places to shop in Morocco.
In the old Medina area, you can easily find places to sell traditional Moroccan goods such as tazine, pottery, leather products and hookers, but they are all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and is located in the Far East near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Niragongo volcano, and most of the streets, especially the center of the town, were buried.
The sesame is quite safe, but if you are visiting a place other than the sesame, you need to investigate and understand the situation of the battle that continues in North Kib.
The city is home to the Niragongo volcano and is one of the cheapest places to track mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can use a bodaboda (bike taxi) to travel in Goma, the usual (local) fee is about 500 congo francs at a short distance.
The name "Timbuktu" came to be used as a metaphor for exotic and distant land, in combination with being a place that is not easy to go.
The present Timbuktu has become a tourist destination due to its reputation and there is also an airport, but it is a poor town.
In 1990, it was added to the list of dangerous World Heritage Sites to protect against the threat of desert sand.

Buying a wild card can be a good deal, and you can enter the main parks in South Africa or all the national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island, as its name implies, is the territory of Hong Kong, a place where many tourists visit as a tourist attraction.
The building lined with Hong Kong’s horizons is likened to a glittering bar graph by the presence of Victoria Harbour’s waters.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, get out of the island and head to Kowloon’s waterfront.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is where the British colonial rulers took their territory, so if you’re looking for proof of colonial times, it’s a good idea to start here.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove area in the world and spans 80 km (50 miles) from the coast to the inland region of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarban Mountains are listed as UNESCO World Heritage Sites, and some of the forests in India are called Sundarbans National Park.
This forest is not just a swamp where mangroves grow, it also includes the last place where there is a vast jungle that once covered the Hindustan Plain.
Sundarbans has an area of 3,850 km2, about a third of which is covered by water/wetlands.
Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, now estimated to be home to 400 Royal Bengaltras and about 30,000 Axis deer.
Buses leave the inter-district bus station (crossing the river) all day long, but most buses, especially buses heading east and those heading to Jacquard/Bumtan, depart between 6:30 a. m. and 7:30 a. m.
Since the section bus is often full, it is recommended to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.

The upper space under the bridge is 15 meters, completed in August 2011, and did not open until March 2017.
The entire bridge is scheduled to open in September 2017, and it is expected to be around the end of the Brazilian customs inspection.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous peoples in the eastern part of present-day Paraguay, who lived as hunters of semi-nomadic peoples and also ran self-sufficient farming.
The Chaco region was home to groups such as the Guaicle and Payagua, other indigenous peoples who survived hunting, gathering and fishing.
In the 16th century, the encounter with Spanish conquerors and indigenous peoples led to the birth of Paraguay (formerly known as the Great State of the West Indies).
The Spanish colonial period began, which lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has retained a great deal of originality and originality.

The official currency of Falkland is the Falkland Islands Pound (FKP) and 1 pound is fixed equivalent to 1 British Pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the island in Stanley (on the opposite side of FIC West).
The UK pound is generally available anywhere on the island, and Stanley credit cards and US dollars are also well available.
In remote islands, you can use British and U. S. currencies, but probably you can’t use your credit card, so be sure to check with your owner in advance for possible payment methods.
It is first and foremost impossible to exchange the currency of Falkland after leaving the island, so let's exchange it before leaving the island.
Montevideo is south of the equator, so it becomes summer when the northern hemisphere is winter, and winter when the northern hemisphere is summer.
Montevideo is in the subtropical, and in summer it is common to have temperatures above 30°C.
The temperature is rarely below the freezing point, but it may feel colder than the temperature indicated by the thermometer due to the relationship between wind and humidity.
There are no "rain season" or "dry season" in particular, and the amount of rain is almost constant throughout the year.
Many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, but even so, wild animals are only wild, so do not feed or surprise.
According to the park authorities, it is necessary to keep at least 100 yards (100 meters) from bears and moss and 25 yards (25 meters) from other wildlife!
Even if it looks like an adult, bisons, lizards, American lizards, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of travelers are injured because they haven’t kept the right distance, and these wildlife are large and potentially dangerous, so make sure they don’t get in line.
In addition, the smell attracts wild animals such as bears, so avoid carrying and cooking odorous food, let's keep a clean camp.
