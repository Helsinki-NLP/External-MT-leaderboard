Croatia plans to build a nuclear plant.
On Friday, hundreds of people gathered in a town in northwestern Bosnia to protest the plans of neighboring Croatia to store some of the waste from the region's only nuclear power plant near the border with Bosnia, near a river known for its beautiful natural beauty.
The protesters gathered in the Bosnian town of Novi Grad vowed to demand and fight Croatia for the rejection of the plan to make the site of the Turgovska Gora barracks a storage facility.
The facility will store the waste from the nuclear power plant in Kurshiko.
The Bosnians who had a cross-cutting sign that read, "Don't rob us of a healthy future". "Strictly stop the Uuna River needs us", said that the nuclear waste treatment plant could threaten the lives of the Uuna River and its surrounding area of about 250,000 people.
We must oppose it.
The head of the municipality of Novi Grad, Miroslav Dryak, said to the crowd:
We must fight to protect our lives and the Ouna River.
The Krusko nuclear power plant, which began operation in the 1980s, is located in Slovenia and is jointly owned with Croatia.
The two governments are scheduled to open talks next week to discuss the expansion of waste treatment facilities.
Croatian state broadcaster reported on Friday that Croatia has not yet decided whether to build its own storage facility or whether Slovenia should pay for the costs of the waste in Croatia being processed in a newly constructed facility.
The Minister of Environment and Energy, Tomislav Čoric, told the announcer that Croatia has problems with the disposal of waste from schools, hospitals and prisons, and that it wants to find a comprehensive solution.
In Bosnia, activists, officials, residents of all ethnic groups in the country, and Croatia, they insisted that they look for another site to build on their side of the country near the nuclear power plant.
"Why would a Bosnian trouser pocket, or Turgowska Gora, be the best place in all of Croatia?"
We will not let it hurt our self-esteem!

I'm going to be there.
You know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you, you know, you know, you know, you know, you know, you, you know, you, you, you know, you know, you, you know, you, you know, you, you, you know, you, you know, you know, you, you, you, you, you, you know, you, you, you know, you, you, you, you know, you, you, you know, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you know, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
I'm going to get a little bit of a buzz.
The point is to contrast the use of highlights that gather light in the middle of the face with shading that creates a natural shadow.
And you can control your skin texture, your facial depth.
I'm not a big fan of this.
I'm a merely a merry face born of two textures.
It may be a reaction to live batch re-make-up, but for me, personal makeup is very natural.
And one of the things I've been enjoying lately is making changes.
I'm looking at the pink chick I got from Juice-Juice's Lightning, and I'm looking at it a little bit more inside than usual, and I'm looking at it like it's getting red, and I'm looking at it like it's getting red, and I'm trying to find the wrong place to put it.
It's amazing to see your face change in one place and place and it's amazing to feel like you have to do more makeup research and try!
My makeup teacher, Hirosei Yuichi, is from the same group.
And when they're at an event, they say, "I want to make up for Miss Cotton!" and they're asking me to do makeup, and I'm teaching them makeup and techniques.
I'm not sure what I'm wearing.
I like to make the summer pop color really cool!
And I'm not going to be in the same mood as you when you're playing Ban Live.
I'm going to put a little bit of a tin on my ass, and then I'm going to put a little bit of a tin on my eyelid, and then I'm going to put a little bit of a tin on my eyelid, and then I'm going to put a little bit of a tin on my eyelid, and then I'm going to put a little bit of a tin on my eyelid, and then I'm going to put a little bit of a tin on my eyelid, and then I'm going to put a little bit of a tin on my eyelid, and then I'm going to put a little bit of a tin on my eyelid.
The pink chick is from Mr. Lightning.
I like the yellow pink.
The skin is a bright, whitish powdered candy, a sparkling, sparkling,
I'll clean the fur and the teak.

Increased consumption taxes starting in October.
And that's what the country is starting with, cashless points reimbursement.
And the only way to do that is to reduce the cooling down of our consumption by a maximum of five percent, and the only way to do that is to be cashless.
Just before the tax increase you see in the shots, the store and the businessmen were running cashless.
So what's happening right now is the "run-in" approach.
It's cashlessness in a store that used to be a cash-flow store.
I'm stuck in the field of implementation.
The "run-in" of tax increases...
"The house of the wise, the wise, the wise".
It's a popular bakery that runs bamboo sweets, and there are over 100 different kinds of baked goods in the store.
The first person to visit the site was Mr. Ananda, of PayPay, a mobile payment service with 12.5 million users.
PayPay: "Is there any other way to pay for anything besides cash?"
The president of the newly created bamboo company, Ms. Sims: "No, we only have cash, old fashioned"...
PayPay: "I think it's easier than cash if you get used to it, because you don't have to take money and you don't have to take it".
We've already launched a campaign to give 20 percent of the money back in points.
And while we've grown our numbers explosively, Andana is the salesman who sells PayPay to our stores.
It was a cash deal, a "shopper's crush".
And I heard from Mr. Ananda and decided to join PayPay.
PayPay, Mr. Ananda: "I think the rush is really high, because if you could do a little shopping or consumer reimbursement business together that you didn't want to talk about before you jumped in, you're in the middle of a wave of affiliate registration, and you're in the middle of a wave".
The country's consumer reimbursement system is going to be a "cashless wave".
And the reason for this is that Ananda gave us the country's consumer reimbursement program.
The country has introduced a tax increase from October to prevent consumption from cooling down, which will allow consumers to pay back up to 5% of their purchases, but the condition is cashless payments.
There are few small retailers who, like the "Cashless Retailers", are thinking about introducing cashless payments before taxes.
And then I got a taste of "Wow, Whoa", and then I got a taste of "Festival", the 29th anniversary of the show.
The 18th annual "Kisanong-Yong-Yong Festival" is being held in the city of Nūkou, in the tenth district of the city of Nūkou, in the place of the new Yūkou-Yong-Yong.
This year, the newly-produced NHK television series "The Horror" is set to premiere, with a talk show featuring actor Fujitsu and a showcase of toys used in drama.
The hall is the square in front of the town health and wellness centre.
Ten restaurants in the town, like a sandwich shop, are selling a cup of fresh sandwich for 300 yen.
And there's also a bunch of booze and crab boots.
The talk show, where Fuji, the eldest daughter of the Tashiida family, tells the story of her ten-year-old rookie.
In the neighboring town hall, the cast also exhibits a picture of the horse of Yamada Tianyang, played by actor Jizawa Liang, and an old car that Fuji drove in the drama.
What is the proxy Munich-Hausen syndrome that appeared in Netflix's The Politician?
The symptoms are parents, parents, healthy children who pretend to be sick.
The Politician is on Netflix today.
The drama is about Peyton Hobart, who is running for president of the United States, but first, he's the first step to becoming the president of his own high school.
It was produced by American horror and Glee creator Ryan Murphy and stars Gwyneth Paltrow, Ben Pratt, and Lucy Boynton.
While it's as uninformative as possible for viewers who haven't yet had the opportunity to watch the show, the show also features a proxy for Munich-Housen syndrome - a mental illness that pretends to be a physical or mental illness even though the guardian or the person under his or her protection isn't actually ill.
There are many different types of the condition, but they also include Munich-Hausen syndrome, which is a form of pretending to be sick.
But the proxy Munich-Hausen syndrome is clearly pretending that someone else is sick under your protection.
It's also known as FII, faking or induced illness, and it's also a form of child abuse.
It's a rare symptom, but usually, parents exaggerate the symptoms, cause symptoms, and make their children look sick.
So what are the signs of the proxy Munich-Hausen syndrome?
The signs of the disease vary from case to case, but the NHS is paying attention to the following:
They're trying to convince doctors that they're healthy and not fit.
I'm not going to tell you anything.
They're making tests that make them think they're sick, like mixing grape sugar in a urine sample and pretending they're diabetic.
It can cause symptoms of disease, such as overdosing on medications or other drugs.
How common is the proxy Munich-Hausen syndrome?
It's hard to know how prevalent this syndrome is because there are so many cases that haven't been reported.
In a study published in 2000, it was estimated that 89 cases out of 100,000 people developed in two years.
What should you do if you suspect that a child has been harmed?

Nigeria: Police force search of Kaduna school, rescue of 300 children
Kaduna State Police conducted a forced search yesterday at Imam Ahmad Bun Hambal School in Raine Meidubun Tunma, in the Igbo Governorate, arresting seven teachers and rescuing about 300 children.
Police say the children were placed in an inhuman environment, but the school denies this claim.
The local priest, who goes by the name of the school's chief, says, "The kids are all in school with their parents' consent, so their claims are not true".
"Before they were admitted, parents signed a consent form.
And the parents came to deliver food to their children every day, so they know what kind of environment they're in.
I was so surprised when the police came and evacuated the children, took away all the food that their parents had received, and closed the school.
And it's unfair to parents who can testify that they put their children in a horrible environment, as the police say".
He adds that former police chief Abdulman once visited the children to see what kind of environment they were in, but he never complained at all.
And they say, "They're just learning the Koran, that's all".
But the head of the police press room, Jacob Sabo, said that the children will be reunited with their parents once they are handed over to the state government.
"They were placed in an inhuman environment in the name of learning about the Qur'an.
Many of the children had some sort of bruising on their backs.
So we're looking into the school to find out who owns the facility".
We have a foreign staff that can't influence China's development.
The One Belt, One Road Initiative (BRI), the Greater Hong Kong-Macao Bay Area (GBA), and Shenzhen, with a new role as a test-demonstrating district, are all attractive.
The Southern Media Group interviewed seven foreigners, ages 10 to 70, living in Guangdong province.
Born during the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou, Yash, a Singaporean, said he wanted to pursue his dream of becoming a doctor of science in Guangdong province.
Nikita Nikandrov, a Russian student at MSU-BIT in Shenzhen, said, "Russian and Chinese students can study together at BRI".
We can work together to create new ideas and businesses.
Rachel Romswinkel, from the United States, started her career as a beauty blogger in East Hokkaido, but now she has over a million fans on Billiards and Weibo.
Rachel said she will continue to share Chinese traditions, culture and technology through her own videos.
Leticia de Lauss, director of the JJB International MontessoriAMI Center in Guangzhou, France, says, "Educating children is like pushing a button on a dress".
And if you change the first button, the rest of the buttons will be different.
Henry Shaw, a Chinese-American, realized that GBA had a lot of benefits for his company, including new policies, government policies, capital, and access to a great brain, especially.
Korean producer Sean Choi, who is also a producer of the Nanto Show, said that the cuisine of Guangdong is world famous and he is happy to be promoting the Nanto Show in Guangdong province.
Stefan Moeller, the technical quality manager for the Pearl River Piano, from Switzerland, thinks that the best way to do a simple job is to make a high-quality decision.
And Moeller is amazed that so many talented Chinese youth are learning to work hard and make good products, and they're always uplifting their minds.
The three-county high court's gender filing has been removed, and the minority sex is being addressed.
In the wake of the recent decision to remove gender barriers for transgender students, such as transgender people whose minds and bodies are not compatible, the Tri-State Board of Education has decided to remove the gender bar from the prefectural high school entrance application on 28th November.
The prefectural education commission approved the inclusion of gender fields in the 18th year of the entrance examination, but removed the items from the 20th year.
For classroom and sports group divisions, we use the research books that our high schools produce.
I'm just going to use the gender field to describe what I was doing as a choice, so I can fill it out freely in the study books, depending on the student's situation.
According to the education committees, the gender of public high petitions has been eliminated by Osaka and Fukuoka prefectures from the 19th year, and by Hokkaido and Kanagawa prefectures from the 20th year.

Sabarenka, 21, is the world's number one, and she's the second-ranked tennis player in the world.
Wuhan is open.
The Women's WTA Open was held on 27th, the single semi-final, and the ninth seed A-Sabalenka beat the first seed A-Berti Australia 7-5, 6-4 straight to advance to the second straight final.
He's 20 years old, Sabarenka, and he's in the top 10.
Last year's champion Sabarenka scored 75 percent of the points this day when he entered the first service.
He broke into the world's number one Bertie service game for eight double-forts three times, winning in one hour and 43 minutes.
The Women's Professional Tennis Association (WTA) has posted Sabarenka's comments on its official website.
"I'm glad we made it to the final, of course. It was a very tough game. I can't say we played a great game today, but I'm glad we found a way to win".
"I think this win means a lot to me, and I feel more confident than last year, because last year was my first ever Premier League final, and I feel like this is a really tough season, and I feel like I'm enjoying coming back to this level".
Sabarenka, 21, will be in the final with A. Riske, the 35th-ranked American, for the second straight year.
Riske was in the semifinals, defeating fifth-seeded P. Kvitova of the Czech Republic straight to win.
The Central Coast rapist, dressed in the "extreme crime" costume, is ordered to confront the victims in court.
In May 2017, a man in a pale-colored leafy gilli suit grabbed a 12-year-old girl from behind her while attending a school on the Central Coast of the state and dragged her into a bush.
Then he stabbed her to a tree and sexually assaulted her.
A search warrant was issued shortly after his arrest, and police seized numerous items related to the investigation.
The man pleaded guilty to seven counts of assault and three counts of sexual abuse, including grooming and sexual assault against another 11-year-old girl, between August 2016 and April 2017.
The 12-year-old victim, while walking down the alleyway, pretended to be a big tree branch and saw a man armed with a knife suddenly emerge from the bush.
When she said, "Stop, stop, stop!" he put a headlock on her and forced her into the bush.
The man said to her, "Don't yell.
I said, "If you make a big noise, you're gonna have to hurt me".
The man held a knife in his right hand and tied her legs with a cable tie, then beat her to a tree and abused her for about an hour.
When the man pulled the cable, the girl ran to school crying like crazy.
The man received several emails and phone calls from his coworkers, but he didn't answer, and he arrived at work around 9:30 a.m.
He claimed that he was standing outside wearing mud, grass, trees, and other clothes, and that he was being bullied on the street, and that he was chasing the driver to the bushes, and that he was hitting the ground.
The men's sentencing proceedings will continue on Tuesday.
The Pope warned that AI development should be based on public interest and that IT companies should be represented.
Pope Francis warned on Friday that unless ethical evaluation of public interest is followed, competition for AI and other digital developments could increase social inequality, among IT representatives, diplomats, and investors.
The Pope spoke at the Vatican conference, where government diplomats, Facebook and Google representatives, philosophers, physicists and ethicists met in a meeting.
The conference, entitled "The Public Interest in the Digital Age", was attended by a small number of scholars and Catholic bishops.
The three-day conference was the latest evidence that the Vatican is willing to participate in the discussion of the future and the dangers of AI development.
The conference discussed the future of wartime technology development and increasing machine work, as well as the case-control of the shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, and the response of social media companies to the brutal video streams.
In his speech at the conference, the Pope praised the progress of technological progress, mentioning how machines liberated workers from danger and simple labor at the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.
But he warned that if we rely too much on robotics for our own gain, we could rob people of their dignity in the workplace.
"If technological progress is the cause of the increasingly prominent inequality, it is not the right real progress", the pope warned.
If what we call human technological progress is against the public interest, unfortunately, we're going to be heading back to a kind of barbarism based on the theory of the powerful.
The conference organizers said they wanted to use the expertise of the participants to find the people who could be the future advisers of the Catholic Church in high-tech fields.
Come and play the G-song for the Nagano Surprise!
Teacher, thank you.
Hiroshima-Nagoya, the first Japanese fighter to take part in the 27th Battle of Matsuda, was the fourth left-wing.
The first time the two-man show was "September" by Earth Wind & Fire, a character from the legendary superhero who announced his retirement for the rest of the season.
The result was a mid-range, but the sensitized fans who noticed the long-running surprise show were shouting, "Oh!"
For Nagano, the elder brother has been a senior in the family since he was a professional.
The giant, who was the hero of the retirement game, DeNA, was also given flowers with a message to the Tokyo Dome that read "To the Master".
I'm a fan of the Real Madrid loan player Martin Wodegauer, the assistant of the team.
Martin Wodegahl was surprised by the precedence of Michael O'Reilly and revealed his assistant.
Real Madrid won 2-0 against Osasuna, updating their domestic record this season, and topping the La Liga standings.
But even though he hasn't lost a single game in La Liga this season, with a fierce opening game and a clear disagreement with Wales star Gareth Bale, manager Jennedy Didan is under tremendous pressure.
At the time Real Madrid was humiliated by PSG in the Champions League, the pressure seemed to have reached its limits.
But it seems that both the manager, Jennadin Zidane, and Real Madrid have real talent, and there are players who are not in the current manager's plan.
Vinicius Jr. is one of the stars who has such a future for Real Madrid, and he's playing for the team now.
But another young Norwegian, Martin Wodega, who is transferring rent to Real Sociedad, is also providing and helping out in La Liga.
Martin Wodegauer, who played in the Real Sociedad vs. Arabes, was surprised by the lead of Mikel Oyalsabal, the assistant of the Sky, and Real Sociedad won 3-0 on home soil.
Martin Wodegauer, who got the ball from the right, drilled the ball out of the other players' thighs, sent the incredible pass through the inside of the other two to the Oyal Sabar, and he got this perfectly accurate scoring ball.
The second goal, a remarkable one, from the third penalty spot of the Oyal Sabal, ensured Immanol's overwhelming victory for the Arabesque midfielder Manu Garcia just before he was to leave five minutes before the end.
Martin Wodegauer joined Real Madrid in 2015 at the age of 16, but has struggled to make a name for himself.
This 20-year-old Norwegian seems to be finally exercising his right to rule.
The name of Sharad Power came up in the Anna Hazare, Maharashtra Co-operative Bank Fraud case.
Anna Hazare said, "When I got in touch with this case, Sharad Power's name wasn't on the list".
Social activist Anna Hazare expressed surprise that the name of the National Congress Party (NCP) leader Sharad Power had suddenly surfaced in the Maharashtra Co-operative Bank Fraud case involving tens of millions of rupees.
The ED has filed a money laundering lawsuit against Sharad Power and his nephew Ajit Power, former Maharashtra deputy ministers, in connection with the fraud.
The report of the executive branch, which is equivalent to the first police report, was registered by the central authorities under the Anti-Money Laundering Act.
The case is based on the first Mumbai police report, in which the names of former bank president Ajit Poor and 70 former union bank employees are indicted.
When I got in touch with this case, Shard Power's name was nowhere to be found.
Asked about the lawsuit by the executive branch and the suspicion that Sharad Power was involved in the fraud case, Anna Hazare said on Thursday that "only they know how Sharad's name came up and who mentioned it".
Anna Hazare, a critic of Sharad Power, expressed hope that the executive branch would investigate the fraud case in detail and find out the truth.
Anna Hazare, a veteran of several anti-corruption campaigns, said: "The executive will know how his name came up in this case".
Sharad Power denied any wrongdoing and claimed that the joint bank had nothing to do with it, questioning the timing of the filing of the lawsuit just weeks before the Maharashtra assembly elections on October 21.
The former Union minister, clearly referring to the Indian People's Party-led government, insisted that he would not bow to Delhi's "kingdom".
The NCP called the lawsuit by the executive branch a political one.
South Africa: A 20-year-old man was arrested for the murder of UKZN student Sinecenba Endrobe.
According to the NPA, a man arrested for the murder of a student at the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN) in connection with the murder of Sinecenba Endrob is expected to apply for bail next week.
The suspect appeared in the Msingha Security Court on Thursday on suspicion of murder.
The statement by the Prosecutor's Office in KwaZulu-Natal, Natarsha Karla, told News24 that the case was postponed to October 2 after the bail application.
He added that the state government is likely to object to the suspect's bail.
According to the spokesman of the KwaZulu-Natal police, Colonel Tembeca Mbere, a 20-year-old suspect was arrested on Monday.
Androve was stabbed in the lower left side and abdomen this week, police said.
Androve was reportedly a guest at the Musinga Drifkarna motor sport event on Saturday evening.
In a statement issued that day, the organizers of the motorsport event said that they quickly learned that the receptionist coefficients were still there after the event.
Unfortunately, one of them was attacked by strangers on the way, and died in hospital, the statement said.
UKZN, after hearing about Mr. Androbe's death, said, "We need to think more deeply about the complexities of life and the atrocities that often occur in this society as a community".
The Badminton China O.P. Cherry Tenda won the fight!
Takamatz is the runner-up, Bad X-Spi!
It's been a while.
On September 22, the BWF World Tour in Badminton, China Open, is the final day of the tournament.
The final was held in Japan, with the men's singles and women's doubles events taking place.
Men's singles singles champion Tereshida Sheng-du won the final of last year's tournament against Indonesia.
Following the semi-final the previous day, he won the match by 2-1 and won his first tournament.
The women's doubles title, held by Hachiko Miyazaki (Japanese Unicef World Ranking No. 3) was won by the fourth-ranked Chinese pair.
There was no last year's sequence.
The Mayan company, the Epiphanes settlement, agreed to pay $30 million.
Melan agreed to pay $30 million in settlements for a case in which it did not disclose information about the U.S. Justice Department's investigation into the existence of an overdue medical treatment charge against Medicaid.
On Friday, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission announced that Myron had classified epipen as "generic" in its Medicare drug rebates program.
And that's what we found, the payments from pharmaceutical companies to the government were extremely low compared to when they classified epipen as a branded drug.
Melan announced in July that it had reached a principled agreement with the SEC on the matter.
The company's statement released on Friday did not confirm or deny the SEC's claims.
I'm gonna get rid of the stepping accident on the accelerator!
The first is the automatic transmission.
I'm surprised you can buy me a safe haven.
Traffic accidents caused by a faulty driving.
Accidents due to brake and acceleration errors by older drivers are on the rise.
And when you're going fast, you're going to panic, and you're going to try to hit the brake pedal, and you're going to keep the axle on.
There are new cars that have safety support features that cover these types of driving mistakes, but there are also rear-end devices that can be installed on uninstalled cars.
And the system is a rapid prevention and prevention system that is being developed and sold by these after-parts manufacturers.
I want to show you what each of these features have.
The accelerator and brake pedal spacing are narrow and they're all on the same foot.
The e-ACCEL ALARM, developed by Pivot, is a new way to tell pedal errors.
It's a way to avoid pedal footsteps with a warning.
The mechanism is that when you stop or run at low speed, you step on the brakes and you miss the brakes and you need to step on the accelerators, and you get a "alarm" sound.
It's about reacting to sound, encouraging the accelerator to turn back, and quickly recognizing the error of the step, and avoiding the acceleration.
It's also effective for older drivers who have difficulty understanding and hearing the changes in engine noise caused by acceleration errors.
The outfit is inserted into the OBDII connector, and the body is glued to the two-sided tape.
It's also very affordable, and it's easy to set up.
And I'm looking forward to seeing it, because World Wing started launching it in mid-September with the accelerator brake-stepping error-prevention device, "I'm looking forward to seeing it".
Not only forward, but back and forth.
In the forward and reverse of the accelerator pedal from the time of the stop (and less than 10 km/h), the accelerator detects the speed signal and brake signal on the side of the vehicle when the accelerator pedal is stepped on a fast pace, electrically suppressing the accelerator opening and slowing down the acceleration.
When you accidentally step on the accelerator pedal, you don't give the signal from the accelerator, you instantly put the clip on the brake.
It also has the ability to detect a vehicle speed of more than 5 km/h in reverse and to force the vehicle to shift to a creepy state.
And you can just install it with a simple wiring process.
The actual price is 37,000 yen (excluding taxes).

Tapia and drink specialty shop opened on 1st Street in downtown Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture
The number of open shops in the center of Fukuoka City, Fukuoka Prefecture, reached 39 at the end of August, and seven have decreased in the six months since March, according to a study by Fukuoka City's third sector development.
In a short time, the succession of new tapio-drink shops led to the liquidation of the empty shops.
The number of vacant stores, the "Beauty City Project" that appealed to shoppers for beauty and the renewal movement, improved to the next level in February 2016.
The survey was conducted in a store on the first floor.
In the six months since last year, we've opened 15 stores, 12 of which are open.
And then, in the same way, five new stores were opened.
The total number of stores was 320, and the vacancy rate was 12.2%, down 1.9 points from the previous one.
Five of the 15 new shops are specialty tapio shops.
It opened in June on the northern side of the street, and on the southern side of the street before the Fukui station.
According to the company, after the investigation, another tapioca specialist shop was opened in the empty shops on the train path before the Fukui station.
The official said that "the heat has calmed down after a long parade, but there are still many women walking with their heads in one hand".
And if you look at the situation in the area where we plan to redevelop, we have four shops -- two of them are tapio shops -- and one is a warehouse.
The company's survey found that the number of open stores on Central 1st Street increased the most in August of this year, with 78 stores (20-3 percent).
And then it got better, and then it got back to 40 houses after February 16, and then it got back to 46 houses in February.

Serra Valas, 35, pleaded guilty to the murders of Tristan Valas, 13, and Blake Valas, 14.
The brother died at the hospital on May 24 at around 7.30am, after police were called near Sher Green in South Yorkshire, Sheffield, the first died and the second died 12 minutes later.
The investigation was conducted, but the results were not released at the hearing in Sheffield Criminal Court on Friday.
The exact circumstances of the boys' deaths are still unclear.
Varas and his family appeared in court with co-defendant Brandon Matin, 39.
Two of the guards who accompanied them pleaded guilty to two counts of murder and conspiracy to murder six children.
During a 20-minute hearing, the two pleaded guilty to five other counts of attempted murder.
The conspiracy to murder is alleged to have been committed between May 14 and May 20.
Four attempted murders involve four children, including Blake and Tristan on May 23.
The fifth assassination attempt took place on May 24.
All the children who survived were under the age of 13.
The judge, Jeremy Richardson, the defendant, told the two of them, "I cannot describe the immorality of your actions.
I'm telling you frankly what I've done.
Murder of two children.
Attempted murder of four children and conspiracy to murder them all.
And I'm pretty sure that in the near future, we're all going to get a couple of life sentences".
Where the sentence is to be imposed is up to the judge.
The verdict is scheduled for November 12.
The government of Nepal, the minister of agriculture and forestry, has been monitoring the recycling of bird feathers.
The Dawa Agricultural and Forestry Minister of Nepal is visiting the recycling facility.
The Dawa Dorche Rama and 10 other ministers of agriculture and forestry visited the city of Bird Bird in the prefecture of Tirugawa and the recycling park in the city of Makongo for 26 days, and inspected the fertilization techniques of raw waste.
The country used to fill and process most of its life waste, but with the introduction of the waste composting technology that Japanese agricultural college lecturer Hashimoto M. (67) is studying in Tsunoki, Japan, through foreign students, we started efforts to promote organic agriculture without pesticides, and to turn the city of Timi, Kathmandu, into a model city, and to introduce waste recycling.
The first inspection of the city of Tōhyang was carried out in February 30th, as the technology was used in the same facilities in the city of Tōhyang, which were established in the year of formation 19.
The first minister to attend the visit, Dawa, interviewed the mayor of Nakamura, Shinzuru, at the city hall, and said, "Japanese technology is advancing in the world, and we want to advance efforts not only in Timi but also nationwide".
The mayor of Nakamura said, "I am surprised that we are still not reaching the whole population of Nakuru.

"Beichi-tachi Child Support Circle is Going On" (Tandōkiyo representative) held a conference on 27 days to share experiences and lessons from the Soka-raju disaster at the Miyami Civic Hall in the same town.
About 20 mothers who were raising their children came together to think about the appropriate forms of disaster prevention, to draw attention to them, and to make recommendations to local authorities.
A 32-year-old boy from the northern city of Wu-Shui, who loved the nursery, said that after the flooding, he suddenly wanted to go to the nursery and became sleepy at night.
And she said, "I don't think adults have enough time to clean their homes, because they don't have enough time to deal with it". And she said, "I want to be prepared for disaster so that adults can not rush and tell their kids, 'It's okay.'"
Mr. Shani, 36, from the Whitestone Township, spent the night at the town hall of the refuge with his family of four, including a three-year-old child.
"When you have kids who can't be quiet, they care about their surroundings".
A woman in the centre of Sago with five children aged between 4 and 12 years old (45) was flooded around her house.
"I can't run away with five people", and I'm willing to stay home as much as possible, with food and a clean toilet.
"It's not right to be prepared. It's different in family structure and in the living environment".
Kawasaki, a mother of six and eight children in Whitestone, said: "The primary school had a vacation email the day before, but the nursery has no contact network or email system.
And they also wanted to build a system that could share the flooded roads in real time.
Kawasaki said, "The weather has changed before, and it's not going to work out, 'It was okay last time.' I want to take care of small businesses and people and prepare for disasters".
The representative of the Tendai government said that "we will consider communicating the opinions as a group to the administration".
I'm looking into the police department's relationship with Mr. Boris Johnson and businesswoman Jennifer Arculi.
The IOPC will consider whether the mayor of London should investigate whether the alleged misconduct is a criminal offence.
The Greater London Administration (GLA) said in a statement that the GLA supervisor had recorded "things about the Prime Minister's conduct" regarding allegations that Mr. Arquely had received preferential measures from his friendly relationship with the Prime Minister.
"Actions exist when there is information that suggests a crime may have been committed", says GLA.
This is not proven.
The IOPC will consider whether or not we need to investigate this.
The problem was handed over to the IOC, but the IOC is the agency that responds to the charges filed by the police in England and Wales.
The problem was brought to the attention of the police department because Johnson was in the same position as the police commissioner at the time.
Mr. Johnson denies any wrongdoing involving his relationship with Mr. Arquely.
Earlier, Johnson had said that he would follow orders from the London Parliament to provide detailed information about Mr. Arquely's relationship, while claiming that he had "a wrong view".
The statement was reported by the Sunday Times, but reports say that Mr. Arculi, an American who moved to London seven years ago, was given a £126,000 public grant and was given three times to join a foreign trade delegation with Mr. Johnson during his time as mayor of London.
The government has since frozen 100,000 pounds of subsidies to Mr. Arculi's company, the hacker house, under investigation.
The company will be asked a confusing question about the investigation process that took place before the subsidy was paid.
And the digital minister, Matt Warman, in the House of Representatives, said that the digital ministry is doing "normal proper evaluation", and that the company owns a British phone number.
But according to many reports, the phone number was transferred to the California office where Mr. Arquely, 34, is now based.
The relationship between the prime minister and the businesswoman was "a secret between the staff".
The GLA's move to hand over the Prime Minister to the police oversight agency has sparked outrage at the Prime Minister's Office.
Government officials say this was a "politically motivated attack" and that the timing of the Conservative Party convention was "too partisan".
"The supervisory authority has not provided any evidence on any allegations, and the prime minister has not been given the opportunity to respond to the supervisory authority before the press release was issued late Friday night", the source said.
The public and the media will see the political madness that is being made public.
Earlier, the Standard reported that Johnson's relationship with a California businessman, who was sponsored by the London Department of Tourism and Community Promotion, was a "public secret" between the staff.
A former London and Partners (L&P) employee, who at the time thought Mr. Arquely's company was "unreliable", said he wanted the privilege of accompanying Mr. Johnson's trade-related meetings abroad during his time as mayor.
A safe fund for the common people to use to build property.
I'm in the 20th year of the fund, Morning Star.
I've heard from the chairman of the board of directors, Mr. Zhao Long, about the future.
- The "Snow Fund" celebrated its 20th anniversary in August.
What do you think about the last 20 years?
And first of all, there's been a lot of thought and effort in the 20 years of history.
I want to thank everyone involved, not just the history of the Fund for Knowledge.
The idea behind the fund was to support the wealth creation of the common people.
I've been foolishly pursuing this spirit for 20 years.
And I'm working with the whole company to get rid of the worry about money, and I think the world will be brighter from the ground up.
In the long run, operations don't perform well unless they're working with the beneficiaries.
And when there's a recession like the LeMans shock or the IT bubble collapse, the "knowledge fund" makes a lot of money.
I feel like you're getting the message that we've been saying all day, "We're going to support the companies that need it in the world".
I think that's why we've been a long-term fund for 20 years, and we've continued to be a direct selling system that delivers messages directly to a lot of people.
We've been doing a monthly report on all the investment companies, the amounts and costs.
And generally, the only thing that's going to tell you what you're buying is a black box, but the "know-how" fund is all out.
And this is why you can trust me.
The Mac Miller murder, the third drug-related arrest, the key.
L.A. (AP News) A third man was arrested and charged last year for drug-related crimes involving the death of rapper Mack Miller from a drug overdose.
According to court records, Miller was accused of selling a fake pill containing oxycodone, a combination of cocaine, alcohol and fentanyl that Miller accidentally overdosed on before he died last September, but fentanyl is a potent opioid drug that has been a problem in the United States for thousands of deaths.
Walter is charged with supplying drugs to another man who sold drugs to Mr. Miller, Cameron Petit.
According to court records released Tuesday, Petit was getting drugs from Walter through August.
Ryan Levis, who was arrested earlier this week in Lake Hubbs City, Arizona, is charged with delivering drugs to Petit as Walter's "dealer".
None of the three have been charged with any direct offences in the Miller death case, and they are still defending themselves in individual cases.
Walter, who is currently in custody, has already been sentenced to five months in prison for violating his probation in a 2005 drug case.
Prosecutors in charge of the case, first reported by the celebrated website TMZ on Thursday, have asked Walter to be detained until the trial begins, citing the high possibility of his escape abroad.
I didn't get a reply to the lawyer's phone call.
Petit was indicted by a federal grand jury on September 4, but his lawyer declined to comment.
Miller's lyrics are based on his candid talk about depression and drug use, and he's gained a cult following as one of the biggest names in hip hop.
Miller, originally from Pittsburgh, known as Malcolm James Myers McCormick, had a two-year relationship with singer Ariana Grande, but broke up in early 2018.
After Miller's death, Grande posted a video of her falling in love on her Instagram account and released a song about her, "Sank You Next".
Miller is also one of the musicians who died of opioid drug abuse in recent years.
Matthew Roberts, guitarist of the rock band Three Doors Down, died of a drug overdose in 2016, and fentanyl and hydrocodone were detected in his body.
In this article, I corrected the spelling of Walter's name to Stephen instead of Steven.
We've been developing more than 30 mobile games for nine-year-olds in Nigeria.
This nine-year-old is using Scratch 2 as a free programming app to create a bunch of games.
And with Scratch 2, you can create games, anime, stories, and so on and so forth offline.
Basil has used this app to create over 30 mobile games.
Today's game is a game programmed to hide bats.
The player gets points when they catch a bat that comes out of hiding.
I learned how to make games in a short concentration class.
Basil told CNN, "I spend my time making games when I'm bored".
In March, my father offered me a five-day short-term concentration class for children ages 5 to 15.
This course, organized by Codfest International, was introduced to give children like Basil the opportunity to learn about new technologies such as robotics and virtual reality.
Basil Okpara Sr., his father, says that Basil grew up playing a lot of mobile games.
"Basil always played games with his cell phone, so I bought a tablet when I was four.
Candy Crash and Temple Run were pretty good".
But when I was told that I was playing games a lot, I got interested in making games at age seven.
"One day, I was on a tablet like usual, but I was so obsessed with the game, I got a little angry", he said.
And I was so upset, and I said, "I'm always playing games, but why don't I make games for myself so that others can play them?"
I was angry when I said that, and I didn't think Bazil was serious".
Since then, Bazil, who has been learning how to make games for himself, has asked his parents to buy a laptop and enroll him in a game-making class.
Basil, who wants to be a scientist in the future, is giving his game the same name.
One of the games, Mosquito Mash, is available on the Google Play Store.
Africa has the highest youth population in the world, and when it comes to Africa's innovation, it's young people like Basil who are leading.
Recently, two 12-year-old Nigerians were honored for creating a robot that can use program code to clean up their homes.
In May, the women's high school team from Ghana, Akrobots, who programmed boxes of robots, won the 2019 RoboFest competition.
And the big tech companies like Google and Microsoft are investing more in Africa, and Basil and his kids are trying to be the future programming stars.
Former North Carolina Republican chairman, pleaded guilty to perjury in a bribery investigation.
According to court documents filed Friday, the former North Carolina Republican chairman is likely to admit to giving false testimony to federal investigators who conducted a corruption investigation involving major political donors.
In the Federal Court's list of cases, Robin Hayes is scheduled to plead guilty next Wednesday.
According to a document prepared as part of a legal settlement, based on facts signed by Hayes' lawyer, Hayes was aware that he was making false statements to FBI agents in a bribery investigation in 2018.
The actual judicial transaction documents are sealed, and the fact-based documents do not specify which charges Hayes admits to.
Hayes was initially charged with conspiracy, bribery, and making false statements.
Prosecutors accused former Senator Hayes of involvement in a plan to overthrow the insurance company that tried to make an election donation to the state's insurance superintendent in return for special treatment.
Greg Lindbergh, the principal and two co-owners, are charged with attempting to bribe Mike Cozy, the state insurance commissioner.
Lindberg is the founder of an insurance and investment firm, and since 2016, he has donated more than $5 million to state and federal election candidates and committees, and in recent years has been the state's top political donor.
Lindbergh supported Republican ideology and politicians, but he also contributed to the Democratic Party.
I asked Lindbergh's lawyer for comment on Friday, but he didn't reply.
On Friday, Hayes' defendant, lawyer Caan Davis, asked for additional comments via email, but no response.
The court documents filed Friday state that Hayes made a false statement to an FBI agent in August 2018, but Hayes said he never spoke to Cozy about the State Insurance Department staff.
But according to the fact-based documents, Hayes was actually talking about a transfer request from the state insurance superintendent and Lindbergh's insurance agency.
Prosecutors said Hayes had helped Lindbergh request a meeting with Cody and had discussed direct bribery with the supervisor.
The indictment, released in April, claims Lindbergh was seeking special treatment for his insurance business and was planning to spend up to $2 million on Cozy's 2020 re-election campaign.
According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved a request for a change of officers who were investigating Lindbergh's company.
The Republican Cody reported the allegations of a bribery attempt to federal investigators and helped prosecute.
Corgi is not suspected of anything.
The indictment states that in a conversation involving Lindbergh and Cozy, a co-owner of Lindbergh instructed Hayes to send $250,000 to Cozy's re-election campaign.
According to the indictment, Hayes initially objected to the idea that he would be noticed if he moved that much money, but he broke down in the end.
The indictment says Hayes said, "I'll do whatever you want".
"I'll do it for you".
I asked a U.S. Attorney's Office spokesman for details about the legal transaction via email, but he didn't respond.
And we're doing a lot of non-disclosure testing on Facebook, and we're doing a lot of non-disclosure testing on Facebook, and we're doing a lot of non-disclosure testing on Facebook, and we're doing a lot of non-disclosure testing on Facebook, and we're doing a lot of non-disclosure testing on Facebook, and we're doing a lot of non-disclosure testing on Facebook, and we're doing a lot of non-disclosure testing on Facebook, and we're doing a lot of non-disclosure testing on Facebook, and we're doing a lot of improvements on our users' happiness.
And in the first attempt in the world to increase the happiness of users, some users will soon be unable to see how many people have seen the posts, the reactions, the videos.
This change follows the launch of similar tests on Instagram in Australia in July, and, well, it's for personal use and only for postpers.
The new Facebook trial is set to begin on Friday and will begin in Australia soon.
Facebook Australia's policy director, Mia Garrick, said the change was based on feedback from mental health experts who believe that happiness research or, well, numbers could be a cause of social comparison.
Garrick said, "We've had very positive feedback from a lot of bullying groups and mental health organizations we're working with".
It's not about the number of reactions, it's about the number of people who can delete the numbers, so that the quality of the interaction and the quality of the content can be appreciated.
Garrick said that users are expected to be more confident about sharing on this platform than they feel competitive.
Garrick claimed that even business owners who use Facebook will receive the same metrics and insights as they ever did.
It's too early to say that in countries where Instagram has conducted tests like Australia, Canada, Brazil, New Zealand, Japan, Italy, and Ireland, it's too early to say that they're going to do the same test.
Facebook's Instagram account has not announced when the test will end or remain unchanged.
"We had a positive feedback about our experiences on Instagram at first, but now it's a stage of listening to and learning", Garrick said.
Garrick, who is from Australia, the world's leading technology company, said that Australia has a very active Facebook and Instagram user base.
He said Australia is a great country to get really good feedback on whether or not this is a valuable experience for people.
Rugby World Cup, the Miracle!
"Weeping" was a big hit in Osaka.
In Osaka, the Japanese planet Venus was roaring with joy.
A company member who was watching the outdoor monitor at the Dautong Tower in Osaka, Minami, said: "A miracle happened!
"I thought I was going to be out of the game because I lost the first half, but I was surprised by the upside.
A company employee who was attending a sports bar near Daotong-kun, Sugizuma, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, Japan, and Japan, is a social rugby player and a rugby player.
"It's like a cat's victory over a tiger, a big Venus, a moment of victory, and tears of excitement", she said, "I'm so happy to be able to compete at the top of the world, and I'm sure you'll win".
For the World Cup, his wife and the next day's New Zealander Tony Lynn (50) dressed in Japanese uniforms in a pub in Osaka.
"It was a tough game, but Japan was very good at it.
I'm so much higher than I was eight years ago, so it's not a surprise".
I'm going to self-fix a broken bag of jewelry in a pot.
One day, I took my mother's favorite gold bag and I lost it.
It's a good thing that if your favorite bag of jewelry breaks down, you want to fix it and keep loving it.
And the only thing that helped me was a handmade candy.
And then I gave up and said, "Maybe you're not selling anymore".
My mother's broken bag is the ultimate pickle.
So when I asked the store for repairs, it was much more than the actual price.
And I was so sad, and I said, "I'm gonna throw it away".
So we started with the home center, and we looked for a replacement for this connector.
But even if you have rings, they're all silver.
I didn't see any gold.
I went to Kandu and I finally found it!
I was so moved when I found it in the artisan corner.
And I'm going to do it all.
It's like a key holder or a DIY piece.
I was going to use one on each end of the bag handle, and I bought two.
And if you put the rings in a small size, and you put them in a bag with the rest of the bags on one side, you make exactly the same thing.
And that's what opened the door to bag repairs.
I'm going to put it right there.
You little...
The opening of the ring is a kind of inside folding, and it's strongly pulled outwards.
I put it in my bag.
The gold color of the jewelry is good for the gold system, but because of the small size of the ring, it's not moving well.
So I thought, "Well, I'm going to do this ring in two rows".
We've got more tools, but we're not at all in trouble with the weight of the lightweight parts.
I feel like I've got more shiny pieces, and I've got a design level.
The national railway's rush, the Asus, is on a temporary train, Hiroshima, Kumamoto, a 10-hour journey, and the Shibuya newspaper, the Ates.
The temporary train, which depicts the arrival of the railway as a "Asu" in Japan, is 28 days away from JR Hiroshima.
And the people who enjoy the transit train ride, which is a snapshot of the Asus, during the railroad era, are 28 days.
A temporary train, which depicts the rapid transit of the railway era, was operated for 28 days between Hiroshima and Kumamoto.
About 240 railway fans took the bus from Hiroshima Station that same morning, taking the blue 12-car, and travelling for about 10 hours to Kumamoto Station.
Asuka had a night train that connected Kumamoto and Tokyo in the 1950s and 1980s.
The trip is limited to one round trip (two days), and as part of a tourism project called "Kumba-Bōno Destination Campaign" by JR companies, Japan Travel organized a tour.
The train is composed of seven passenger and locomotive lines running along the Yantai, Tōjō and Kagoshima lines.
I had a special headmark painted by Asus.
His brother was sentenced to life imprisonment for the honor killing of Pakistani SNS star Kandir Barochi.
Candir Barochi, who became famous for his social media photos, was strangled in July 2016.
Pakistani social media personality Kandir Barochi's brother was convicted of murdering his sister on Friday and sentenced to life in prison for the most high-profile "honor killing" in Pakistan.
The famous self-portraitist, who was never seen as a great photographer by Western standards, but was considered provocative by a very strong Pakistan of contempt for women, was strangled in July 2016.
My brother, Mohammad Wasim, was arrested.
He told a press conference a few days later that he "of course" killed her, that she "didn't forgive" him, and that he didn't regret what he did.
His lawyer, Sardar Memud, told AFP that a court in the eastern city of Murtagh had convicted Wasim and sentenced him to life in prison in a pending verdict.
"Inshallah, God willing, you will be acquitted by the Supreme Court", the same lawyer said.
Before that, Baruch's mother, Anwar May, told AFP that she wanted her son to be innocent.
"My son is not guilty.
My daughter and my son".
As Mr. Barrow's murder becomes the news all over the world, and as the rules of a patriotic society are ignored, the victims, mostly women, are again calling for action against the spread of so-called "honor killings".
Women, who choose their own spouses, in the case of Mr. Barrow, have been burned, shot, stabbed or strangled for crimes such as praising their sexuality and humiliating their families.
Murder is usually carried out by close relatives.
Under Pakistan's Kaisaar (Retribution for Murder) and Deia (Retribution) laws, the offender can then ask forgiveness from the victim's relatives.
Three months after Mr. Barrow was killed, Congress passed a new bill requiring life in prison for honor killings.
But whether murder is a felony is up to the judge, and the killer can theoretically claim a different motive and be pardoned.
In Mr. Barotchi's case, the parents initially insisted that they not forgive their son.
But the parents, who were saddened by the loss of their son, asked him to change his mind and forgive them.
In the face of international hatred for the killing, the Pakistani government took an unprecedented step to declare itself the heir, along with its parents, but the case was continued.
Barouch's famous actions include offering to show off his strip show to the Pakistani cricket team and wearing a wide-open red dress on Valentine's Day.
Although he was criticized and threatened, he was recognized by many, including young people, as having opened up a new world in a country where he was seen as a bold, political activist who promoted women's status.
The root of honor killing is a national social norm that is still prevalent throughout South Asia, particularly in women's behavior, where men are victims.

The cold seat box is located in the old Pearl Kan-chan Ground, the first shelter in the Rue-Kanga district of Yokohama.
The Yamashita newspaper company donates 1,600 aluminum shell casings for evacuees and storage of heat and cold to four municipalities in the Wankhede region of Okinawa, which were damaged by the June earthquake that devastated the province.
We'll have to set up a first-place shelter in every coastal area for the tsunami.
On 2nd of next month, we will be presenting at the Old Pearl Kancho Ground, the first shelter in the Rat Ke Kan district.
The city of Okan, which has signed a cooperation agreement, will be affected by the earthquake and will give cold protection seats to the local authorities in the warm seas region nearest the earthquake's source.
The donor is ▽温海 (400) ▽小岩川 (500), two storage boxes (▽早田) ▽300, one storage box (▽鼠ケ関 (400), two storage boxes) ‒ each of the municipalities.
When the earthquake struck off the coast of the province, many residents of the Japanese coast were evacuated in fear of the tsunami.
In the city of Okan, they fled to a second shelter, which is set up on the slopes.
Although there were no major tsunamis, most of the refugees did not move to secondary shelters with facilities and facilities, many of the first shelters were called outdoors because of the cold.
One of the challenges was to prepare for similar disasters, including severe winters and storms.
A blanket that can cover the whole body during evacuation to withstand the cold and rain.
It also has a heat-resistant system in the hot weather.
The seat is about 1.3 meters by 2.1 meters, and when you fold it, it's 9 centimeters by 12 centimeters.
The four-layer structure, which uses gold and silver surfaces and backs, covers the body to provide protection against cold and heat in hot weather.
The first shelter outside is a metal box for seats.

The opening of the "Kirobōshi Art Exhibition" in Osaka, Japan, is a celebration of the artistic works of people with disabilities.
A painting from the "Skining Art Exhibition" in front of a store in the town's central business district.
The third "Ribbon Art Exhibition" (Okasan Disabled Cultural Arts Association, Sanyang newspaper and social enterprise group, co-organizer of the exhibition executive committee) was held in the Tokyo Shopping District of Osaka City on the 27th day.
It's a collection of free ideas and expressions that are not built on existing concepts, and they're attracting shoppers.
The Osaka Festival will be held from October 3 to October 14, at the Yūjō Festival Hall (Yūjō City Industrial Promotion Building).
The exhibition features 50 paintings, 17 motifs and 15 photographs from all over the province.
The paintings are in front of every store, the design is in the attic, the underground town art space, and the photos are in line with the Asano camera.
Some of the pieces are printed on a banner, and displayed above the arcade of the shopping street.
The paintings were bold, colorful, and impressive, and they were painted with delicate penmanship.
The shape of the surrounding material, such as a drum, clay, umbrella, is also unique, and the four seasons of the year, like the red leaves and the Himalayas, are also very interesting.
The chairman of the executive committee, Mr. Hoshi, said: "I want to make it more fun for many citizens to get involved in nature and art in a way that brings their work into the city".
The exhibition, which has been running since 2017, has been given the opportunity to rate the works of artists who have not received formal art training as "Art of All Brut, Life and Art".
This time, the opening of the "Okasama Art Exchange 2019" will be held at the same time as the support program of the "Seisuke International Art Festival", which begins on 28th August.
On the 28th and 29th, we have guided tours of the works, live painting, which is open to the public, and on the 29th, we have workshops where you can experience making small things like earplugs with the ends of the coconut leather.
The partnership was signed by the ASA Academy of Athletics from left.
The NPO Corporation, ASA, NAMES Sports Academy (Okayama City) and the NAMES Sports Club (ELOVE) have signed a partnership to promote and support sports on the island for 25 days.
The two organizations will actively cooperate in activities such as training training in various competitions, and provide mutual support in health care and injury prevention, such as when children on the island go on expeditions outside the island.
Both organizations will mediate, send and share information with dedicated trainers and lecturers when they conduct sports-related lectures.
When the off-island team goes to an off-island competition, they also work to solve challenges that make it difficult for trainers to keep up with the cost of travel.
Specifically, during regional competitions such as the Prefectural Games, we will work with the "General Corporation Corporation, Kagoshima Prefectural Sports Promotion Center", in partnership with the ASA, to provide support to prevent performance declines of players due to boating and overnight fatigue.
We also work with local orthopedic and hospital staff to support athletes from outside the island during the tournaments on the island of Kyushu and Okinawa.
On the 25th, the signing ceremony was held in the famous town of Elaboco, where the two presidents of Yandada and Pratama shook hands.
Then, the two organizations co-hosted a taping workshop by athletic trainer Yang Kaohsiung-kyou.
Local sports boy bands, local community leaders, and local guards learned how to use taping properly and how to prevent injuries.
The president of Yandandanda, 52, said: "The objectives of the activities to eliminate the island handicaps in terms of sports environment are mutually shared and there are many areas where we can cooperate.
The former president of the board of directors, 43, said: "It is very exciting to partner with such established organizations as ASA if we are to absorb the good for the children's sports environment on the island".
Maumuki, I'm in a time when traditional wisdom is breaking down.
And I'm a man who can change who he is".
As a brain scientist, Maumuki Kage-ryou has actually given people a second thought about Motte.
It's a surprisingly brain-scientific theory that uses a lot of knowledge and the latest insights.
I'll send you the paper.
In the previous issue, the moths were clinging to the traditional "man's fantasy" and had a huge lack of pattern learning to moths.
And in the next episode, I was talking about how to get away from that bad guy and become a cool, fat guy.
It's hard to live if you're caught up in what you should be doing.
In the previous installment, I talked about how coolness is evolving all the time, and we need to look at the different pieces and the behavior of people and learn patterns every day.
And if you learn patterns, you're thinking, maybe this is the best time to do it, and maybe your brain can organize your behavior, and you can live like a camel.
I think I'm still evolving every day, whether I'm a mole or not.
That's why we live.
I've taught at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and Tokyo Art School, so I talk a lot with young people and I learn a lot about how to interact with them.
But if you're in that position of being a university professor and you're stuck with that old pattern of, "A university professor has more dignity", it might be a little bit difficult.
I don't want to be stuck with that, so I'm having fun every day.
And I know that it's hard to say, "This is how it should be", or "This is how it should be".
Because you don't have to change yourself, you have to change society.
I've been talking about this in my recent book, Living - In a Terrible World.
Seriousness and authority are things that come naturally and acknowledge you.
I don't think he's that light.
It's hard to be around people.
You were a comedian at the Cannes Film Festival.
He's a lightweight, but he's going to be treated like a great filmmaker.
And that means that people with a reputation don't have to be great.
I mean, you can't be too lightheaded to be caught up in the "slowness".
And I've heard from a lot of women that any man, regardless of his position or age, is "cute" is a sign of guilt and salvation.
I'm not sure what this "cute" is.
I mean, "cute daddy".
The number of illegal refugees in northwestern Nigeria has doubled to 40,000: UNHCR
According to a United Nations statement on Friday, the number of refugees from northwestern Nigeria has doubled to about 40,000 in the past four months due to the escalation of violence.
According to the UN refugee agency, this disorder has created a new humanitarian crisis, and it will require a new $35.5 million in funding by the end of this year.
UNHCR spokesman Babar Baruch said Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist group that has been fighting the government in northern Nigeria for 10 years, was not involved in any recent armed attacks.
Rather, the violent incidents that have taken place in Socot, Zamfara and Katsina states in Nigeria over the past 10 months have been carried out by organized armed groups.
"It's a good representation of the horror of the illegal and unstable situation", Baruch told reporters Friday.
Kidnapping, torture, robbery, murder and sexual violence are frequent, and the attackers are destroying homes and stealing, its spokesperson said.
The military and police are being deployed to fight the criminal organizations in the region.
But the military is tired of fighting Boko Haram and the West African branch of the Islamic State, which split from the old organization in 2016.
"Refugees don't come in groups", says Baruch.
And what they bring with them is a terrible story.
Most of the refugees are going to neighboring Niger.
UNHCR said in a statement that the security situation in Soweto, in particular, is deteriorating and that the number of refugees arriving in Niger is expected to increase in the coming months.
A new trial date has been set for the man who killed a woman and two children.
The deadline for the trial of a Guatemalan man accused of murdering an Iowa woman and her two children has been set.
According to court records in Pock County, Marvin Escobar O'Learyana, 31, was charged with three counts of first-degree murder under the false name Marvin Eskibel Lopez, who was initially identified as a police officer.
He claims his innocence.
According to police, on July 16, at his home in Des Moines, he shot and killed Mrs. Rossibes Flores Rodriguez, 29, her daughter, 11, and son, 5.
The court records indicate that the new trial date of January 27 will give both the plaintiff and the defendant time to prepare.
According to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, Escobar O'Learyana was illegally in the United States and was deported twice before the shooting.
He was convicted of illegally entering the United States in 2010.
Sonnet Media Networks (SMN) has started distributing ads in the Logicad for Publishers (LFP) by Prebid.js.
LFP is a service that allows you to create and plan your own advertising frameworks that meet the needs of each advertiser.
This service, in partnership with media companies, provides an effective advertising framework through DSP Logicad.
Header bidding is a method of bidding that allows multiple bidders to bid fairly and give priority to the media companies that run the media.
And we're seeing a shift in the media as a solution that's more transparent and more revenue-friendly for media companies.
Logicad has been providing advertising frames with an SSL.
In recent years, we've been working with media companies to respond to the demand from advertisers to deliver ads to specific ad frameworks that are more in-line with individual merchandise and brand image, and to directly buy ad frameworks that are more in line with advertiser demands.
This time, the response to header building will expand the introduction of LFP.
As a benefit for advertisers, the LFP's header bidding capability allows them to participate directly in the bidding for the header bidding frame, and they can expect to see an increase in the opportunities for ad delivery.
The media companies are limited, so they also provide a pre-distribution advertising framework that is consistent with individual merchandise and brand image, and prevent brand value loss.
The advantage for media companies is that LFP's collaborative "rapper" solutions, which combine and manage the code of bidding companies, allow for the same initiatives that media companies are hoping to implement.
They sell small business products, support jets, and sell them on overseas retail sites.
The Japanese trade promotion organization, JETRO, is working to expand the sales of small and medium-sized businesses through its overseas Internet marketing sites.
It's an attempt to create a Japanese corner on a foreign site, to bring together products from all over the world and sell them directly to foreign consumers.
The company's applications have surpassed 1,000 and are doing well in China and Southeast Asia.
It was called the "JAPAN MALL" business, and it started last year.
The main focus is on small and medium-sized enterprises that have no overseas sales channels, and they are encouraging global expansion of cosmetics, beverages and processed goods.
It's available on 24 major sites in the West, Middle East and Asia, all of which are partners with JETRO.
Two months of suspension of the mountain assistant in powerhala, 30 year old man working on the mizawa campus
As a result of the pressure from the students, the school announced that it had suspended a 30-year-old male assistant at the Misowa campus for 27 days and two months.
The date of the order.
According to the Department of Defense, male assistants have been subjected to intense emotional and emotional stress since October 2017 when they were teaching multiple students in their lab.
And I'm not sure what I'm saying.
In a survey conducted in September 18, several students complained.
In addition to interviewing students and assistants, the administration of the engineering school conducted an investigation by faculty members of the Mizawa campus in December of that year, which resulted in a complaint from one student about harassment.
Following the results of the committee's investigation, the board of directors of the chairman and the director of the board decided on the punishment.
He said that even after the survey, the male assistant continued to be educated, but that through the interview, his behavior improved and he said, "I'm sorry".
The school's director said: "I offer my deepest condolences to the victims and their families.
The university is also conducting an internal investigation into allegations of sexual assault against female students led by male faculty members and is planning to publish them if they are punished.
The rebels demanded that the cabinet reduce its demands for EU membership and compromise with the EU.
With only three weeks left until the final EU summit, there is growing concern that the prime minister is running out of time to make a major concessions.
Boris Johnson is facing a cabinet rebellion that wants to lower his demands to leave the EU and make a compromise with it.
Negotiations over a new tariff system to replace the backstop clause on the Irish border are in the throes of a deadlock, and the EU considers Johnson's alternative "impossible".
The senior ministers hope that the EU's black cabinet, led by German Prime Minister Angela Merkel, will come forward on the platform to propose a compromise to this overwhelmed Conservative leader, such as setting a three-year deadline for backstop.
The Sun has heard from three ministers who plan to meet the prime minister after the Conservative Party's annual general meeting in Manchester next week.
They will demand that the Prime Minister abandon the "radical" strategy of threatening the EU with a no-deal exit devised by senior adviser Dominic Cummings and that the EU accept the offer within the deadline.
One minister called Tuesday's Supreme Court ruling that the parliament shutdown was illegal "a warning", adding, "At the moment, compromise is the only way we can leave on October 31".
We're not going to win the House of Representatives by any number, and they're against us.
The Prime Minister must use what he can use rather than walking.
Excessive work is not working, and Cummings' plan is clearly failing.
I can't fight in so many fields.
Another minister, however, promised Mr. Johnson that if he did not, he would talk to former Prime Minister Theresa May about implementing the agreement.
The senior minister added, "If necessary, I'm going to talk to Boris about bringing Theresa's bill back to the House".
There's a lot of people out there who are trying to stop it anyway.
If we don't delay, Boris is over, and we are all over.
Sir John Major accused Boris of not taking the negotiations seriously.
The former Conservative leader gave a harsh speech saying, "The Prime Minister told us he wants to make a deal with the EU.
But we don't see the Prime Minister sitting in the negotiating table with the EU and passing a deal.
Instead, we've seen the prime minister in Scotland fighting cows, testing eggs in Wales, arguing with the public on the streets, as if the campaign were going to be standardized".
The prime minister's spokesman acknowledged yesterday that the agreement was still far ahead, and said, "Don't be mistaken, if we can achieve our goals, we have a long way to go".
But the spokesman also said that the Ben Bill, which would require a three-month extension if we leave without agreement, would "much weaken our negotiating position in Brussels".
The spokesman said: "The bill is undoubtedly hindering our negotiating position, but the Prime Minister and his colleagues are working hard to keep moving forward despite the passage of the bill".
EU Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, Stephen Barclay, is returning to Brussels today for further talks with EU ministers Michel Barnier.
They will discuss a document on how the regulation of the whole of Ireland's regulation of food and livestock is working.
LK: I was told in Glasgow that you would never succeed in the world of television.
Lauren Kelly revealed that she was told by the TV executives that she was "not going to succeed" as host at the Glasgow show.
Before she first appeared on television, she was "very nervous", and Kelly, 59, said, looking back on her 35 years in the broadcasting industry.
"I was only 25, and I was so nervous", she says.
I was working as a detective for the BBC Scotland, and my boss told me that your Glasgow job was not going to be a success in the television industry.
I went to London to meet the whole TV-am team before the show went on the air in the Glasgow office.
I will never forget that morning when Anne Diamond and Mike Morris were interviewing the legendary actress Betty Davis.
I couldn't believe I was in the same room as the living legend.
I realized that this is where I wanted to be.
Kelly started working as a local newspaper reporter in East Kilbride, Scotland, and in 1984 became a reporter for TV-am Scotland.
Kelly also hosted shows like GMTV, ITV's Breakfast and Daybreak, and then started her own show, Lorraine, which bears her name.
To mark her 35th birthday, we're going to be broadcasting a special show that looks back at Kelly's most memorable moments and interviews.
Passion, passion, and curiosity were the key to survival in the television industry, and the host said, "We have to put that to work".
You have to be honest and honest.
I'm just doing what I have to do, getting people interested in me, and getting people interested in me.
Looking back at the news that shocked her, Kelly said that the interview about the Dunbrain shooting was "very hard".
I never thought that the day after that terrible incident where 16 students and teachers were killed, we would see so many families of children killed or injured broadcasting live from Dunbrain.
Pam Ross, who was killed by one of her mothers, her five-year-old daughter Joanna, asked me to meet her personally, so we had to talk for hours at her house.
I didn't get all of that on the show, so I went to Joanna's funeral, and Pam and I have been friends ever since.
Kelly also interviewed the couple when Kate and Gary McCann's daughter Madeleine went missing in 2007, but she said it was "extremely difficult", and she said, "I really respect the strength and courage of the couple".
A couple must endure the painful and horrible Internet exposure of not knowing what's happening to their beloved daughter.
I'm not going to make a husband and wife feel sorry for you.
Lorraine's 35th anniversary show will be broadcast on ITV from Monday, September 30th at 8:30 a.m.
Zimbabwe, the Chienga, who was afraid of the trap.
According to government officials, Vice President Costantino Chienga has declined an offer from the late former president Robert Mugabe during the political upheaval, fearing it could be a trap to track down military actions in November 2017.
During the coup, as negotiations continued between Mugabe and the National Defense Forces, Mugabe offered to hand over the presidency to Chienga, the Zimbabwe Independent newspaper reported last week.
But Chienga's refusal was not due to fear, but because Mugabe's intention to use Chienga to inform world leaders and the African Union that the coup had taken power, officials said on social media.
A series of tweets from Jamwanda 2, which officials confirmed was a senior official in the presidential cabinet, said that "the Mugabe, who has been in power for 37 years, is more than willing to hand over power to Chewenga than to Emerson Munanggawa".
The government officials said Mugabe, who realized he had lost power, had made contact with the Chewenga through an envoy.
According to government officials, the arbitration between the military command and the former president was carried out by three men.
President George Chalanba, then the chief deputy of the Central Intelligence Agency, Aaron Nepela, and Roman Catholic priest Fidel Mukhonori were involved in the negotiations, officials said.
Gideon Gono, former president of the Zimbabwe Reserve Bank, was one of the people who was commissioned by Mugabe to deliver the presidential transition to the commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Force (ZDF) Chienga alone.
Mughabet, who became a symbol of Africa after his death rather than alive, tried to condemn the military actions of the African Union, but failed, seeking the intervention of African leaders.
The offer to give the post to the former CDF commander, Chienga, was not the choice of the former president, Mugabe.
"It was a self-sacrificing act to save a family of the late president from a dangerously rapidly expanding situation", wrote its senior official Jamwanda.
But there was a little bit of political intent, at least diplomatically, to change the course of the former president.
If anything were to break the constitutional order, it would have been in conflict with the views of the African Union on the coup, but I would like to remind you that the commanders declared that they did not break the constitutional order and that they did not intend to do so.
Mugabe, therefore, expected the commanders to back up the claims that Chienga, the then head of the military, was trapped and did not violate the constitutional order.
So Mugabe hoped that the African Union, which was still not fully aware of the situation and was deciding whether to place it as a coup, would eventually call it a coup and consider the demand for military intervention justified.
That was the intention and calculation behind this offer.
The authorities say Mugabe moved when he realized he was not being protected by the defense forces.
He was warned by the military that he would be executed like Gaddafi, and he said Mugabe had to resign.
The military commanders told Mugabe that even if they entered the presidential palace called the Bullough, they would not point guns at civilians.
At that point, Mugabe wanted two things: to protect his family and prove his military deprivation of power.
The commanders and commanders of the time were reading the intent exactly.
The words of the president's urgent message, the envoy Gono, were used in a powerful metaphorical way: "Is-Tili-Bekhwapa-Makhwapa, we belong to the camouflage group, or the military, we are not politicians or in the midst of political competition", the official said.
The army told the other commanders in the region, through the military officers stationed in Zimbabwe, that the goal was not to defeat Mugabe but to remove the "criminals" around him, officials said.
Mugabe also tried to recall the Mnangagwa, who had been in short-term exile in South Africa, using the same method to talk about coups and successors.
In addition to negotiating with the army, Mugabe needed regional support.
Not only was the economic and regional power of President Jacob Zuma, then president of the Southern African Development Community, the key to the process, making it clear that South Africans, who refused to intervene, and repeatedly threatened to invade the presidential palace, would immediately be sent to Harare if the military did.
"It just didn't happen because it wasn't supported by President Putin or African leaders", the source told The Independent.
The second bombing at the United Nations called for a nuclear ban, and the treaty was ratified by 32 countries.
The 26th United Nations Headquarters in New York held a meeting to address a world without nuclear weapons, where the granddaughter of the director of the Hiroshima Red Cross Hospital during the atomic bombing, the bombed Ms. Bakkeneda II, 63, spoke in support of the nuclear weapons treaty.
On this day, five new countries ratified the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, which has been ratified by 32 countries and regions.
The treaty needs ratification by 50 countries and regions.
The meeting and ratification coincided with the 26th International Day for the Total Elimination of Nuclear Weapons, which was established by the United Nations.
Secretary-General Guterres also addressed the recent move to counter nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation.
"We don't want to do it", he said.
China needs a strong leadership, or it will collapse.
China needs a strong and united leadership of the Communist Party, or the country will "crash", the Chinese government said in a policy document released on Friday ahead of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
In a white paper, the State Council of China said that the success of the Communist Party since it came to power 70 years ago was due to its leadership.
China is vast and complex, but there are few problems with governance.
Without a unified, strong leadership, China will be divided and collapsed, and it will be a disaster for the world".
The Chinese authorities have long justified tackling the problem in a tough way, as necessary for national stability, like the repression of the democratic movement in Beijing in 1989.
Xi Jinping, the powerful president who will be the main protagonist of the memorial ceremony for the world's second largest economy, will take office in late 2012 and will further strengthen the party's control and severely curb those who oppose the party.
Xi also oversaw the military modernization program that threatens the region.
China is not going to export its own development model, or adopt other countries' models, or seek peace, not hegemony, but only peace.
In the genes of the Chinese people, there is no invasion or world domination.
In modern times, China has been harassed by the great powers, and war and chaos have left deep scars with their pain; China will never blame others for the pain it has experienced.
China is also facing difficult challenges such as the economic downturn and anti-government movements in Hong Kong, where it has been unable to move forward in a fierce trade war with the United States.
China will never "abandon" its core interests, nor will it allow its security and sovereignty to be undermined, the White Paper says.
"The threat of a trade war and the rising tariffs will not solve any problems", the White Paper says in connection with the trade dispute with Washington.
China is a mature economy with a complete industrial system, a complete industrial chain, a large market space and a strong economic development momentum.
"Trade war will never weaken", the White Paper added.
I'm confident that China has the power to face challenges, turn crises into opportunities, and open up a new world.
He added that China has no intention of opposing the United States, and it has no intention of replacing the United States, so the United States should keep China's development cool.
The United States cannot control China, and it is less likely to stop China's development.
If we do things like suppress, suppress and move our own contradictions abroad, America will not stay strong.
High school baseball team, Yokohama High fired the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, the head coach, and the head coach, and the head coach, and the head coach, and the head coach, and the head coach, and the head coach, and the head coach, and the head coach, and the head coach, and the head coach, and the head coach, and the head coach, and the head coach, and the head coach.
The high school baseball star Yokohama Hake, who has won five national championships in the spring and summer, announced that he has fired the same day, director Pitakachi (36) and director Kimono Aya (42).
In the future, I will appoint the head coach, and the head teacher, who will be responsible, will decide quickly.
The local newspaper reported on 26 May that there were allegations of abuse against the baseball team.
When the school heard from two people, the school principal admitted that the student was holding the pupil's neck, and the school principal admitted some of the allegations.
And after hearing from 66 students, I re-confirmed the facts of the case, and I was fired on the 28th, largely because they admitted it was true.
Yokohama was renamed after the former director of the Japanese film festival, who raised the Matsushaki Daisuke (now Mid Japan) in the summer of '15.
It was the regime of the director of the plateau, the director of the gold mine.
For the third year in a row, he has been at the Summer Garden since the summer of '16.
But this summer, when we lost to the provincial team in the quarterfinals, and the fall to the Sunshine Academy in the quarterfinals, the next spring's Sembat outing was hopeless.
After the Spice Girls' Mel C, the fight against eating disorders, they banned the subject of diet in the home.
Melanie Chism of the Spice Girls admitted that she had been prohibited from eating at home because of her own experience with eating disorders, which she had not eaten for many years except fruits and vegetables.
Sportspees, under the pressure of being a member of the world's pop group, had been eating poorly for years and exercising too much, and was later diagnosed with depression and eating disorders.
Chizom said that his own experiences also affected the upbringing of Scarlett, and that "all talk about diet in the home is forbidden".
"Scullet is now 10 years old, and she's starting to take care of her appearance", Mel says.
But it was because of my eating disorder that I was able to be very careful about my words when talking to my daughter.
It's a positive word, and it's a habit now.
When she first came to prominence as a member of the Spice Girls in the 1990s, even before the rise of the social networking site, "ugly" comments about herself in the media led to physical problems, Mel said in an interview with Women's Health magazine.
"I was so self-conscious, I was so obsessed with exercise, I was so thin, I was so out of certain foods".
I was in bad shape, and I was in bad shape for years".
The same-sex marriage justice system is an opportunity to spread diversity:
In a lawsuit that argued that "factual marriage" was consistent with marriage, the Uttomiya District Court's Yuuka Branch ruled in favor of this.
More than 20 countries allow same-sex marriage, even if they are not legally valid, but municipalities such as the city of Sapporo have a system to certify same-sex partnerships.
The verdict, based on this, recognized the actual marriage of two women.
It's the first judicial decision to grant legal protection to same-sex couples.
The law on civil and family law prohibits same-sex marriage, which is unconstitutional, and is being challenged in five district courts in Sapporo and other parts of the country.
I want to break the rules, deepen our understanding of the rights of sexual minorities, and discuss how the legal system can recognize diverse families.
The women lived together for about seven years and obtained marriage licenses in the United States, but broke up after being found guilty of adultery, and the plaintiff demanded damages from their former partners.
The verdict, based on the record of two cohabiting couples, recognized that "the actual marriage between a man and a woman is nothing like the actual marriage".
It's a groundbreaking decision that extends the recognition of actual marriages with marriage rights, such as social security, to same-sex couples.
More importantly, he has interpreted Article 24 of the Constitution, which says marriage is based on "only consensual consent".
The two-factor approach is that "the idea of same-sex marriage was not conceived at the time of its enactment, so it's not even understood as a denial of same-sex marriage".
The Constitution does not provide for same-sex marriage, but it is expected to be a catalyst for the civil rights movement in the country, which does not say whether it prohibits same-sex marriage.
But the problem was that the same-sex marriage was not recognized, and the benefits of legal protection were different from those of men and women.
It's not fair to discriminate against the rights that men and women have to protect, even if we recognize that they are equal.
And the national trend survey of married women, where more than 70 percent of people say same-sex marriage should be legal, is changing.
As lifestyle diversification continues, laws are bound by traditional family images, and we're going to take away the rights of people who don't fit in.
In fact, marriage is not a legal "spouse", so there are no tax incentives, no shared custody, and no restrictions.
When considering same-sex marriage, we need to look at the family law from a variety of perspectives, not just from the same-sex marriage but from the extension of the legal rights to actual marriage.
The former athlete accused of raping multiple women is on trial and a jury trial.
A jury trial is underway in the trial of a former University of Delaware baseball player accused of sexually assaulting multiple women.
On Friday, after 10 days of testimony and comment, the jury began deliberating on the fate of Clay Conway, 23.
A 21-year-old woman admitted to sexual assault after driving Conway home.
They met three weeks later on the dating site Bumble, when Conway was sending her nude photos to a woman.
Conway is accused of sexually assaulting six women between 2013 and 2018, but she is one of them.
Prosecutors claimed that the embrace of consent escalated when Conway tried to rape the woman, and she resisted.
The defense argued that the woman's claims and inconsistencies in her memory were contradictory and that she regretted having a physical relationship.
The director of the anime, Kimiro Ishiba, has been quoted as saying about his departure, "Next season is the penalty".
Third place Hiroshima lost in the final game of the season and lost the chance to advance to CS on its own.
If the 4th Osaka wins all three games, the ranking changes.
In the after-game ceremony, director of the Oshima City (50), "I'm sorry I didn't win the final game, I couldn't determine the ranking. This result is the responsibility of the director", and apologized.
I got a bounce from some of the fans.
And at the end of the greeting, he said, "I'm going to try to get the penalty for next season".
But when the press was asked about the ceremony, they said, "It's not over yet, so it's all over", and they said, "I'm leaving after the end of the season".
After his transfer, Spongee Takeda took over the teaching of his first fourth, self-made number 20, retired real Matsu & G: Hokkaido newspaper, how to get an electronic version.
It was a "bullet of retaliation" to his superiors.
Four times with a one-point lead, he's the lineman on the left wing and he's hitting his 20th home run this season.
I reached my goal, and I said, "I'm gonna try and make a big mistake, and I'm gonna accept that number".
I totally ignored the director's intentions.
First four starts after transfer.
"I was in fourth place to be moved".
And he said, "I was so excited about it, and I went into the game, and I spent the day with a whole lot of excitement".
One of the ideal fourth figures is the giant grandfather, who is retiring this season.
"Fourth is the core of the victory. Every day you get results, you're fourth on the team.
And I'm thinking, "I think of you as the most important person I've ever seen, a very kind person, and you look at your back and you see that it's your style".
The new sports book is published on September 27.
And it's obviously a very serious pollution in a popular tourist spot.
Among Sydney's tourism resources, which generate $219 billion a year to the Australian economy, Sydney Harbour is the largest source of income with its opera house, Circular Key, Luna Park and its famous Harbour Bridge.
But underneath the bridge is an ugly truth.
Sydney's famous port is one of Australia's worst waterways, with about 15 glasses of pollutants flowing into the Olympic pool every year.
And because of these terrible statistics, one of our biggest tourist attractions is one of the dirtiest.
A new video, from top to bottom, from Sydney Harbour, shows the most popular waterways around Australia's most popular cities, with their shells, vinyl bags, pet bottles, shoes, clothes, and even animal carcasses that someone has lost, all flowing into Sydney Harbour from the streets of the rain.
The biggest factor that fills the waterways is plastic.
And by chance, in a video released on World Tourism Day, September 27, Dr. Catherine Duffon, deputy director of the Sydney Harbour Research Program, says, "This is a paradox".
It looks beautiful, but it's one of the most heavily modified and polluted waterways on our coastline.
According to the CSIRO, an estimated 1,560 kilograms of plastic is poured into the waterways every hour, most of it flooding into Sydney Harbour via rainwater drainage.
"It rained a few times, and then Sydney Harbour was pretty tragic", said Dr. Duffon.
Two-thirds of the pollution comes from rain that flows down the streets.
But it's like a corner of an iceberg, and under the water in Sydney Harbour, 70 percent of the plastic that flows into the ocean is deposited on the seabed.
"I don't really know what's there if you go underwater", said Richard Nichols, owner of the dive center Manley, which collects about 500 kilograms of plastic waste each year, himself and his team.
And I think that if a lot of people knew what was under the water, they would be really horrified.
And it's overwhelming -- more than half of what we find is vinyl bags.
The other half is at least somewhere in the world using plastic.
It's amazing how beautiful Sydney Harbour is, and how all this plastic and garbage is flowing right under the surface.
Jeremy Brown, one of the founders and director of Ocean Protect, said there was something we could do to reduce plastic and garbage flowing into waterways, for locals and tourists alike.
"We should start with the source", he says.
We need to be more aware of what's flowing into the sewers, because we're going to reduce plastic use, recycle it better, and eventually flow into the ocean.
Because 50 percent of the oxygen we inhale comes from the ocean, hurting the ocean will kill us.
The ocean absorbs 30 percent of carbon dioxide, and it's a food source.
But we can restore Sydney Harbour to its original state, and it's very simple.
To kill the ocean is to kill people.
This month, coinciding with the release of this video, funded by recycling company TOMRA, and coincidentally released this month, a new study on plastic and mental health was released to raise awareness among Australians about environmental protection and the impact of reducing the impact of drinking containers that are left in the natural environment.
A new study shows that 82 percent of 546 children aged 12 to 18 are desperate about plastic waste, and 25 percent think that the problem of disposable plastic waste is caused by adults.
The study also found that the issue of plastic waste was the fourth most important concern for parents, and 93 percent of the 551 parents surveyed said they were increasingly concerned about the amount of plastic waste that was being dumped into the ocean.
Most of the participants said they wanted to do something about plastic waste, but they didn't know how to change it, and it led to environmental anxiety.
The old Tang Tsun power plant was demolished on 10th of this month.
The old Tang Tsun power plant, two-story, will be demolished in October.
Kyushu Electric announced on 26 October that it will begin demolition of the chimney at the old Tangtsun power plant in Tatsuo City.
The project is expected to be completed by the end of March 2021.
The two pieces used to emit gas during the power generation process are about 180 meters high.
It was originally three, and one was removed in 1991 because of decay.
The chimneys are broken down one by one, and then divided upwards by a torch lane.
The plan is to take nine months to decompose each one, and then 18 months.
The timing of the demolition of the remaining turbine and boiler buildings is unknown.
A man in his 60s who ran a restaurant nearby said, "When I come back from a long drive, it's like a symbol that makes me feel like I'm back in Tangxiang, and it's gone".
The old Tangtsun power plant started operating in 1967, the first in 1989, and the second and third in 2015.
It is located in the corner of the eastern port of Tangxiang, with a land area of about 225,000 square meters.
Because the prefecture's Yot Harbour and JR West Tangtsin Station are nearby, the prefecture and city want to use the site.
The third to add nine electricity, they have signed a land use agreement in 15 years.

The students who are PRing for a fish snack and Thai cooking are at the Tacoan High School in Kowloon, Tacoan City.
Four students of the Prefectural Taobao High School Information Business Department in Taobao Prefecture, developed fishnaught and Thai cooking dishes using local water-fried fish.
I sold it at the school's cultural festival on the 26th.
The three-year project is part of the East China University Satellite High-level Partnership project to work on the revitalization of the land-based industries such as water and forestry in the East China region.
The products we developed were fish nuggets with the flesh of the fish that we caught on the beach in the jungle, and cooking dishes with the breeding di of the tailfish.
I'm not sure what the target is.
We've developed three types of fish nuggets: tofu added, tofu and tail fin gas.
The Panda Fisheries Co-op is working with the Panda Fisheries Co-op to build a factory in the town of Yumumi, in the city of Panda.
Thai cooking is a combination of chicken and nymphs.
The cooking is being handled by the "Make a Fish" (Kubuo Min) of the Taobao City Lining, a local fish processing company.
The class started in June.
I've been to a tailings factory and I've been to a water industry.
In the workshops, we discussed consumer needs and sample samples.
He also invented an adjective for an adjective, but he used a mustard because it smelled like fish.
Yamuko Yamuko, 17, said, "Fish is a good food for the poor, and I'm glad to have so many people eat it".
They're negotiating with tourist facilities in the city to sell their products.
And it's because of the love and encouragement that I have, that I'm here now.
This time, as a free announcer, the CBC television commentator on Monday, Chanto, spoke about the master.
The advice of a teacher who saved him from his decay.
I think that the actor, Hachizaki, is more than a father, he's a teacher.
I'm in the same industry, my father's an actor, and I'm an announcer.
I'm not doing this, but it's my dad who taught me how to work hard in the industry, how to be smart, and what's important to me as a social person, as a person.
And when I finally got a job as a TV announcer after 120 percent of my work, and when I was beaten up and told I was a con or a busbike, and I was so hurt, my dad said, "I thought I was a con, but I wasn't.
And then, in my second and third year of college, when I was just saying, "Whatever you want to do, Anna, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, and whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, whatever you want to do, and whatever you want to do, and whatever you want to do, and whatever you want to do, and whatever you want to do, and whatever you want to do, and whatever you want to do, and whatever you want to do, and whatever you want to do, and whatever you want to do, and whatever you're going, and you're going, and you're going, and you're going, and you're going, and you're going, and you're going, and you're going, and you're going, and you're going, and you're going, and you're going, and you're going, and you're going, and you're going, and you're going, and you're going, and you're, and you're, and you're, and you're, and you're, and you're, and you're, and you're, and you're, and you're, and
I learned naturally from my father's acting.
And many of you may not have seen me read the news, but I've been touching the news on the news ever since I joined the network.
I thought that the personality and the sensation of the announcer would be something that would come out when I read the news, and I was happy and confident that Mr. Dellack would say that he was good at reading the news.
When I read the news, the thing that makes me feel important, that makes sense, is "intermittent".
The way I breathe through the lines and the lines and the spaces I've developed from watching my father's stage and movies and TV and stage plays as a child.
And I think it's because of my dad, because I've been living through all of this, and I think it's because of the way I've been doing it and the way I've been doing it and the way I've been doing it in my childhood.
The three-hundred-year history of the dance is a campaign to spread education.
Workshop in the mirror.
The 26 days of workshops on the role and effects of the five instruments played in the ensemble.
The 2019 "Combination and Education Promotion Project" (Combination Workshop) was organized by the Prefectural Education Commission (Education Agency) and took place in the Mirror Plain Middle School for 26 days.
And all the students were there, and they learned about the 300-year history of dance, the origins of dance, the sound effects and how to use the instruments they played.
In the workshop, members of the O.B. Department of Cuban Performing Arts at the Prefectural College of Arts, played the flutes, trumpets, tambourines, bowls, and drums, and each instrument played a role in the ensemble.
The event was hosted by Kawamun Chan-do, a director of the O.B. from the city of Miyako, who introduced the charm of the dance.
In this workshop, I learned about the three components of dance -- music, singing, and ballroom dancing -- and I picked up the music and I learned about how five different instruments are represented in dance.
The three-line structure, along with the song, is a component of the character's emotional and emotional movements, and the bow is the way the melody of the three-line structure is played.
And by the end of the day, the students were actually touching the instrument and feeling the sound, and they were also feeling the charm of the instrument.
This initiative is designed to get students familiar with classical music through instruments and to get more students interested in the dance, which is the first time in Miyako.

Ghana: A businessman in Kanesi is helping Accra psychiatric hospital.
Members of the Kennesaw Market Association donated 30,000 ceddis worth of food to the Accra Mental Hospital in a ceremony yesterday in Accra.
This is part of the 40th anniversary of the Kanesi Market Complex.
They donated all kinds of food, fruits, soft drinks, biscuits, clothes, yams, plant bananas, cassava, bag water.
The members also interacted with patients and patients at the hospital as part of their visits.
The executives of AccraMarket, the executives of the association, the Queen, were present.
Madam Marcie N'Neige, president of the Women's Association of the Greater Accra Market, said the donation was part of a regular charitable effort that the association is carrying out to fulfill its social responsibility.
The president pointed out that the hospital needed care to make patients feel loved and part of society.
Madame Nijan pledged support to the hospital and urged other organizations to follow suit.
In receiving the donation, Dr. Pinaman Apu, the hospital's director, praised the association's support and promised to make the donation available to the patients.
The council and other organizations also called for hospital support.
The World Rally Championship (WRC) is scheduled to be held in Japan in November 2020.
The first event in the state in Aichi, Japan.
The World Rally Championship will be held in Japan in November 2020.
The FIA has announced the FIA World Rally Championship (WRC) Japan Round, which will be held on November 22, 2020, in Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture on September 27, 2019.
I'm looking back on the last WRC World Rally Championship with pictures!
I'm going to take a look at it.
The last time the event was held in Japan was in 2010 in Hokkaido.
What is the WRC going to be like in 2020?
The WRC World Rally Championship, along with Formula One and the World Endurance Championship (WEC), is one of the four world championships governed by the International Automobile Federation (FIA).
The World Rally Championship, held annually since 1973, is the world's highest rally championship with history and tradition, and is considered the toughest automobile championship for running at high speed on all roads, including paved roads and gravel and snow.
In the 2018 season, Toyota won its second season back in the World Championship, its first WRC Manufacturers title since 1999.
We have a Japan Round of Invitations Preparatory Committee to hold this year's mourning in Japan.
As a result, the World Motor Sport Council, the highest regulatory body of the International Automobile Federation (FIA), decided to hold the 2020 WRC Japan round.
The governors of Aichi Prefecture and Gifu Prefecture, and the general representative of Toyota GAZOO Racing WRT, Mr. Toyota, the president of Toyota Automobile Corporation, are speaking about the Japanese round:
• Governor of Aichi Prefecture, Nagira Shioka
"We warmly welcome the 2020 FIA World Rally Championship (WRC) in Japan, and we will work with our stakeholders to make it a global motorsport hub and a successful 2020 autumn event".
• Governor of Gujarat
"I am very pleased that in 2020, when the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games are held, the Japanese round of the FIA World Rally Championship will be held here, in the city of Ningbo, for the first time in the history of the province, and I am very excited to see you all here".
• Toyota GAZOO Racing WRT General Representative, Mr. Toyota Chairman and President of the Toyota Automotive Executive Board
"I'm very happy to be running the Yaris WRC in Japan.
I'd like to welcome all of you fans to my support".
There are also many commentators on the Japanese round, including the president of the Motor Sports Promotion Council, Mr. Guguichi.
The Japanese round of the WRC World Rally Championship will be held from November 19 to 22, 2020.
The area is the highway in the city of Nagoya, Osaka, Toyota, New City, Longkyo-san, and Asekura, Aichi Prefecture, and the city of Erina, Tsutsuku, Chichi Prefecture.
The main exhibition space will be the "Aim-Gio-Bō Memorial Park" (Moricolo Park) opened on the site of the 2005 Japan International Exhibition.
The Japan Round-Invitation Preparatory Committee will also hold a meeting at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019 and will hold a test event, the Central Rally Aichi/Gifu 2019, on November 9 and 10, 2019.
I'm not sure if Tasmania is the key to cancer treatment.
Tasmania Devil may hold the key to cancer treatment, and researchers are opening a breakthrough that could bring about major changes in patient care.
Medical researchers have figured out how some cancer cells camouflage.
Researchers found that the same process occurs in Tasmania and humans.
And this discovery is expected to lead to new treatments for cancer.
What do Tasmanian Devils and humans have in common?
It's a cancer cell that you can't see.
A team of researchers, including researchers at the Peter McCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, has made a major discovery that if you have a cancer that doesn't respond to immunotherapy, it can significantly change the treatment for that cancer.
It may hold the key to tackling the deadly facial tumors that threaten the future of the endangered Tasmanian devil.
This study found that some cancer cells in humans and mammals use a series of proteins called PRC2 to camouflage, so that the markers don't respond, and the immune system doesn't attack the cancer.
This is a major challenge for treating a type of skin cancer called small cell lung cancer, neuroblastoma, and mercury cells.
Professor Mark Dawson, a researcher at Peter McCallum, told AAP, "What's really important about this project is that for patients who are resistant to immunotherapy, we might be able to reverse the process".
And we could reuse the traditional treatment, and we could re-activate the markers, or proteins known as MHCs, and the immune system could identify cancer cells.
"It could have a pretty big impact on lung cancer patients", said Professor Dawson.
"Plung cancer is a disease that is spreading around the world.
And we could treat it in a much better way.
Researchers hope that this finding will eventually be used to treat facial tumors in Tasmania, where cancer cells are also missing their target.
"Surprisingly, the exact same process happens in humans and Tasmanian devils", says Professor Dawson.
"It was very difficult to treat a tumor in Tasmania.
But if we could use a drug that works on humans, it might be useful in controlling tumors".
Scientists are also puzzled by the enormous planet orbiting a very small star.
Scientists have discovered and surprised the solar system that overshadows our current understanding of planet formation, that is, that a giant Jupiter-like planet orbits a small red dwarf star 30 light-years from Earth.
On September 26, 2019, an artistic image of the giant gas planet GJ3512b orbiting its host red dwarf star was released.
Stars are usually much larger than the largest planets that orbit them.
But in this case, there's no big difference between the size of the stars and the size of the planets, the researchers said Thursday.
The star, called GJ3512, is about 12 percent the size of the Sun, but the planets that orbit it have at least half the mass of Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system.
"Yes, that's amazing". Said Juan Carlos Morales, a celestial physicist at the Catalan Institute of Space at the Spanish Space Science Institute, who led the study published in the journal Science.
The theoretical formation model shows that stars with low mass usually become the main stars of a small planet, like Earth or a small ocean planet, so this discovery was surprising.
In this case, we found a giant gas planet that looked like Jupiter, around a very small star".
The planet, like Jupiter, is mostly made up of gas, and was discovered using the telescope of the Spanish Color Alta Astronomy.
The planet orbits its star for 204 days, drawing a tightly elliptical orbit.
Red dwarfs are small and have relatively low surface temperatures.
GJ3512 is not only much smaller than our sun, but it's about the same size as the giant planet, and it's only about 35 percent larger than Jupiter.
It's darker than the sun because it has less energy, and its surface temperature is about 3,800 degrees Kelvin.
And that's why I'm wearing red".
While there are signs that a second planet is now orbiting the star, a third planet may have been released from that star system in the past, explaining the elliptical orbit of the Jupiter-like planet, Morales said.
Planets are made from the same disk of interstellar gas and dust that they created, and they create their own orbiting stars.
The most powerful planetary formation model, called the "core integration model", is that objects are formed from solid particles in the disk, and the gravity that makes the planet's eggs makes the surrounding gas into the atmosphere.
We could use a counter-model called the self-gravity unstable model to explain this unusual planetary system.
"In this case, the primordial planetary disk surrounding the newborn star may have been a little larger than we thought and had a little lower temperature", Morales said.
And this is the case when the disk becomes unstable, and there are some areas that are more dense.
These blocks can grow and form planets until they collapse.
He's charged with making his colleagues eat soybean dip mixed with stimulants.
Marion County Sheriff's Office, Cassandra Medina Hernandez, 38, is charged with feeding a colleague a dip of soybeans with a stimulant.
On Thursday, Cassandra Ani Medina Hernandez of Albany, 38, was charged with possession of a class B methamphetamine transfer and controlled substance.
The charges stem from an incident that occurred Sept. 9 at a Slipway grocery store in Jefferson County.
According to the Oregon Live.com affidavit, a colleague of the suspect, 27, who went to Delhi to have lunch, saw Medina Hernandez making a bean dip and asked for a taste, she told Marion County Sheriff's deputy.
According to the affidavit, the victim told the detective that he had never taken methamphetamine before, "I thought I would taste weird after eating a few mouthfuls, but I didn't think it was a drug".
When she went back to work, her stomach was bad and her feet were full.
According to the Albany Democrat Herald, the first local hospital where the woman was admitted, it was determined that the soybean dips may have been mixed with methane phytamine.
According to The Smoking Gun, another Slipway employee said Medina Hernandez "told her to put drugs in the victim's food", while a third employee said the suspect had mistakenly sent a message that he had put methane phtamine in the bean dip.
According to Oregon Live, a surveillance video seized from Delhi shows Medina Hernandez turning her back on the camera, leaning behind the electron waves, and pulling something out of her bra.
And then he got up and wiped his nose, and he walked to the table, and he dipped the beans in a little paper plate.
The police said they put the stuff they took from the blazer on the plates.
According to the Oregon State Journal, the sheriff said he doesn't think any customers have been released contaminated food so far.
Medina Hernandez is being held in Marion County prison instead of $520,000 in bail.
According to The Smoking Gun, Medina Hernandez's longstanding arrest record has so far been a record of assault, robbery, extortion, transfer of methamphetamine, theft, possession of methamphetamine, and possession of controlled weapons.
The game is currently under development, with the game being released in Japan.
I'm going to take a look at the one on the challenge hole.
In the first round of the 2019-20 season, Matsumoto started from 73rd place in the afternoon group, and was eliminated in the preliminary round as a two-bardi, two-bogie "72".
The interim cut-line at the end of the round (up to 65th tie) was the two-way tie, and the round was completed outside the qualifying area.
The Yankees took the fifth and fifth in the first half, but the third and eighth were three-balls.
I've made a lot of chances throughout the round, but I've been struggling to see Pat's exit scene.
He came out 28th in the morning group, collapsed with "77", and fell to a three-over lead and fell out.
The decline in the qualifiers is strong.
When the Monsoon ended, Bryson Deschambeau extended the number 64 to the number one spot on the 12-inch single.

The issue of the Niagara River is "management of the problem".
In a press conference on the 27th, JR East Sea President Jin Jin-shin said that the problems of the decline in the flow of the Daiichi River associated with the Linea Central Highway South Alpstonnel project and the challenges presented in the consultation with the Prefecture of Shibuya "should be separated from what needs to be organized before work begins and what needs to be done from the beginning of work", and reiterated his stance on prior installation.
And I'm going to talk about it in the meeting room and in the front of the meeting".
"I think it's a very difficult task to sort out a lot of problems, and I think that sort of division is possible".
And he said, "This is our idea. We have to talk to the province".
The provincial side is concerned that the flow of water that was released during the tunnel work will not be fully returned to the Daiichi River.
He said that when it comes to changing the way we work, we can do something that is realistic, but we find it difficult to do from a safety perspective.
Governor Kawasaki Pintao denied the route change he had mentioned as "impossible".
The opening hours were affected by the fact that the president of the company, Mr. Gold, cited three of the South Alpstonnel, Preakash, and Nagoya stations as the most time-consuming places to build, and said, "I can't say that we have the money, but I'm most worried about the Shibuya district".
Mr. Johnson, you're backing the closure of Congress.

I didn't immediately understand how the vehicle was discovered.
Thank you for your attention to the NHK Chairman, former Deputy Chief of Staff, Vice President of Post:
In October, following protests from the Japanese Postal Group over NHK's program reporting the fraudulent sale of life insurance, it was discovered that the NHK Management Committee had sent a letter of appreciation to the management committee from the Japanese Postal Service's senior vice president, Suzuki Kon-Myo, in response to the issue.
According to the sources, Mr. Suzuki sent a letter to the Management Committee last November to thank the chairman for his strict attention.
He appealed to the NHK Executive Department to strengthen governance and corporate governance, and asked the Executive Committee to "please guide and supervise".
These were reported to the management committee.
So, what's the big deal?
The next big star in the West End might be there right now, but they're not going to be too far behind.
The producers of "Jamie the Rumor" are looking for the next Jamie to audition.
Leighton Williams, who is now the lead, is about to embark on a UK tour of the musical, looking for a "young actor with outstanding talent who has not yet been discovered" to take over his role.
The London audition is scheduled for the 10th of October at the Apollo Theater, where candidates will need to prepare a resume and a face photo and be able to sing the opening verse of Don't Even Know It.
Another audition is scheduled for October 8 in Sheffield, and the next stage of the audition will begin the following week.
Producer, Nick Burns, says, "Thanks to the amazing audience, I'm honored to be extending my show at the Apollo for the third year in a row".
I found some of the great young actors on the tour with Leighton Williams and Shane Ritchie.
And with the spirit of this musical, when we're looking for a new Jamie, we're opening the door to the young professional actors and the unnamed actors.
In February, Williams, who took over from John McCarey and now plays Jamie New, tweeted, "All boys should send me demo tapes".
The West End show will be extended until August 29, 2020, with the tour beginning in February.
The musical tells the story of 16-year-old Jamie New who wants to go to her high school prom dress.
He doesn't know what the future holds, but he's confident he'll be a star.
With the help of her mother and local legendary model, Rocco Chanel, Jamie began to realize who she really was, and she was able to face her prejudices and get the attention of the public.
The show, which features music by Dan Gillespie and Sells and script and lyrics by Tom McLean, is inspired by the BBC documentary, "Jamie, 16 Year Old Drag Queen".
The following day, the coach of the World Cup will be visiting six small teams:
To help rebuild the rainfall in western Japan, seven coaches from Scotland and Wales, who are coming up for the Rugby World Cup, visited six primary schools in the Midtown area of Kwarawara City for 27 days, sharing the fun of rugby with children.

The government has announced that the government will reorganize the hospital in the province of Sago, which includes five medical institutions, two administrative and social institutions, and a new government agency, the LiVE.
The Ministry of Health and Labour announced the name of the hospital on 26 March, when it was reorganized and integrated.
The 13 healthcare institutions surveyed account for 38 to 5 percent, the 10th highest in the country, and three have already been merged or relocated.
The hospital in the prefecture is known as the National Hospital Organization, East Sago Hospital, Tsuyuki County, Tsuyuki Town, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuy City, Tsuyuki City, Tsuy City, Tsuy, Tsuyuki City, Tsuy City, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuyuki City, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, Tsuy, and Tsuyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
The city hospital and the small town hospital have been merging to build a new hospital in the city of Longkoku.
The Tasa Hospital is the center of the city's comprehensive community care system, and it's been a shortage of services for years.
The mayor of Yongyun Hyoshi Shōji emphasized that "as a town, we have a mindset to operate alone and collaborate with hospitals in neighboring towns.
The director of the hospital said that "we have not heard from the province", but that "we will actively participate in the regional health planning coordination conference in the province and respond based on the objectives of the discussion".
The Regional Health Promotion Agency (RHC) that runs the Iwanri Matsunpo Hospital, Tokyo, said it "accepted the publication as not a mechanism to determine the direction of public hospitals, but a request to review the regional health plan coordination conference in each metropolitan municipality".
The provincial health department, which explains the country's thinking to the medical institutions, says, "I want to hear from the parties about the future of hospital operations.
In some cases, we may ask for a review of the clinic, or for further reductions in the number of patients".
Thirty suspected assaults, three men falling, dying, and the Shitoku newspaper, Atse.
A third committee investigating the situation of bullying in the city of Gifu City, which is investigating the alleged suicide of a 3-year-old male student who allegedly committed bullying in July, has found that there were about 30 alleged acts of bullying against male students.
We're going to be looking into whether it's true or whether it's being bullied.
The third committee held its fifth meeting on the same day, and a panel of two lawyers and a committee of three lawyers shared the results of the hearings with their classmates.
According to the third committee, the students were forced to sit on the toilet or were asked to pay cash.
The secret of the royal family: surprisingly frequent users of royal aircraft revealed
The royal family must travel the world hundreds of times in their lifetime as part of their public service.
It's usually easy to use a personal plane, a royal plane, to travel the world with royalty for important events or performances.
Of course, you have the privilege of having your own machine.
It doesn't have to be in long queues of arrivals, there's no limit to the number of bags, and it seems the royal family can invite guests to board as many as they like, sometimes even unexpected passengers.
According to a recent Channel 5 documentary, it seems that the Queen and Her Majesty Philip are not the only frequent users of royal aircraft.
In the Royal Flight Secrets show, the Queen's former pilots and her family revealed that there were many, many hairy guests on board.
Bob Seals said, "Sometimes, like the most important royal guests, we have very important royal dogs to ride".
It's no wonder the Queen's Coggy Dogs ask her to take a famous, cute pet on a trip with them.
Queen Elizabeth is said to have had over 30 dogs since she was a child and was a queen.
In 2007, they were said to have five dogs: Monty, Emma, Lynette, Willow, and Holly.
And then there were five of them, including a cocktail Spaniel, a Beast, an Ox, a Flash, a Speak, a Sponge, and then there were five of them, plus a Duck Funt, a Cogi Mix, a Cider, a Berry Balcan, and four candy.
The staff on the Royal Aircraft must be very busy.
We've seen royal staff ask to leave their dogs on the lawn before they board, Seals continued.
I'm glad I've never been in an accident before.
The show also revealed that the Queen's public transport baggage was known to be shocking.
According to the broadcaster, "In a 44,000-mile tour of the United States in 1953, the Queen's luggage was 12 tons".
And that's pretty much the same as two large elephants, you know.
But it's not just the queen who likes fashion.
The Marquess of Cambridge is said to have a particular preference for carrying his own clothes, and is rumored to take one seat for every dress.
The first of these is the T.T.T.T.T.T. (Aiki University of Industry)
For the 31st time, I'm going to introduce the gear of the Matsumoto Yuji, who won the Inter-High Championship at Aichi High School, the Incar Championship at Aichi Industrial University and the top of the student chess world.
The chess gear of Matsumoto Yu-young
Right-back warhead shake racket inner force layer ALC FL butterfly Labar forward: Dignix05 Special thick butterfly Back: Dignix80 Special thick butterfly Back: Dignix80 Special thick butterfly Back: This is the list band Gear as of July 2019
Matsumoto Yuji (Matsu Yamaguchi, 21) has been running the top of the student chess world.
He led his team to a championship in each of the high school and middle school categories.
He also finished second in the men's doubles at the 2019 All Japan Championship, and is scheduled to compete in the T.T. Yellow Tams second season, which opens at the end of August.
The equipment used in the MTS is the Inner Force Layer ALC FL, front: Dignix05 Special thickness, back: Dignix80 Special thickness.
I'm going to take a rally from the stage.
He used tenage before, but he changed his raber after the Dignitx came along, which allowed him to play aggressively, focusing on the ball holder when he was hitting.
And the one thing that I love about the Matsuchi is the roster band I wear during the game.
"There was a time when I had a big back swing on my world tour, and when I put on a ribbon, it was so tight that I felt like I was not going to be able to fit it, so I wrapped tape around my wrists and I made sure that it wasn't going to bend at all during the game.
The winner of the rally is Matsumoto.
I'm looking forward to the explosive game in the second season of T-League.
Former Alabama congressman Jack Edwards has died at the age of 91.
In the first wave of Republican gains in the Deep South, retired Alabama state senator Jack Edwards, who served 10 terms as a U.S. senator, passed away Friday.
Edward died at his home in Fair Hope after a battle with pancreatic cancer, his family announced through an agent.
While the Republicans were gaining momentum in the Deep South, many Republicans in Alabama were elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, but Mr. Edwards was one of the first to be elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1965.
Mr. Edwards served as a member of the Federal Congress for 10 terms.
According to the family's statement, when asked recently what kind of world he wanted to leave to his grandchildren, he said he wanted to return to the ritual.
According to his family, he said, "I want my grandchildren to grow up in a country where they have regained their dignity in their daily conversations and in their efforts to solve their country's problems".
Governor Caye, Alabama, said that Edwards was the highest ranking person in the state and the nation.
I also said that I would raise a half-flag in the Alabama House of Representatives.
"Mr. Edwards was a true public servant, the greatest politician in Alabama.
My state has lost one of the best politicians in the world".
The first day of the accident, the deputy minister of defense posted a "Broken Birds are delicious".
The post of the Deputy Minister of Defense of Yamamoto on Twitter on the night of the 26th.
I deleted it around 11:30 a.m. on the 27th.
In the city of Kobayashi, in February last year, the last report of the accident in which a combat helicopter of the Armada Self-Defense Force crashed into a house, the deputy minister of defense of Sambo-Panggu who had entered the province of Sagoga for explanation and apology, ate at a burning bird shop in the province on the night of the 26th, and posted on Twitter, "Taste delicious".
I deleted the post after meeting the governor on the 27th.
Mr. Yamamoto tweeted: "Tonight, I went on a trip to Sago Prefecture!"
I wrote along with a photo of the Minister of Defense and the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives who were at the meal: "It's delicious, you too, when you come to Sagoya, chicken per prefecture!"
Mr. Yamamoto then added on Twitter that it was a "chicken error".
He asked the Minister of Defense, after the cabinet meeting on the morning of the 27th, what he thought of the post, and he said, "Let's look at the tweet".
After completing his presentation to the three municipalities concerned, he said in an interview with the press that he was "not willing to be uncomfortable with my message".
I emphasized that I deleted it in my own judgment, and I avoided making it clear that the tweets were inappropriate.
One of the municipal officials who was briefed by Mr. Yamban on the 27th said, "What are you thinking about?
Mr. Yamban was elected to the House of Representatives four times in the South Kantong proportional election.
He took office this month in the Cabinet reshuffle.
Two of the crew members on the helicopter were injured and killed.
Michelle Obama on Instagram praised Meghan Markle as "the inspiration".
Michelle Obama on Thursday, on Instagram, praised Meghan Markle, calling her "a thoughtful leader who breaks the cycle and makes the world a better place".
The Princess and Prince Harry, along with their son, Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Winder, have been on a 10-day official visit to South Africa, attending a youth reception this week and meeting with the Obama Foundation executives.
The former First Lady posted a very positive post: "My friend, Your Honour, the Duchess of Sussex, a thoughtful leader who will break old customs and make the world a better place. Thank you very much".
Mrs. Obama posted a photo of Miss Meghan posing with the Foundation's executives, and she added, "Whether you're interviewing the Obama Foundation's executives, or supporting girls around the world seeking a decent education, you're inspiring a lot of people".
Former "Suit" actress Meghan was a guest editor on the September issue of British Vogue and interviewed Mrs. Obama.
In that frank conversation, the former president's wife recalled how motherhood and motherhood had changed her.
In an interview, Mrs. Obama said, "Being a mother is like being in the upper class and letting go".
My job, as a mother, is to keep a reasonable distance from my children to find who they want to be and grow up.
It's not about the childhood ideals or childhood aspirations of parents, but about finding out who they really are.
Mrs. Obama, who knows the pressure of the spotlight in the world, gave her little advice in an interview with Good Housekeeping magazine.
"Sometimes, the pressure from ourselves and the people around us is too great".
So my biggest advice is to take the time to do nothing.
So, in the first few months of my time in the White House, instead of working hard, I made sure my daughters were getting along well at school and making new friends.
I think it's a good thing, though.
Janice Jr. and the boys and Galloway are arriving and performing the music for Storm & SMAP!
The girls' awards are broadcast live on the "Beauty" stage.
The six-piece group of Jeannis Jr. Beauty and the Beast performed the Rakuten Girls Award 2019 AUTUMN/WINTER live performance at the Kiyama Tchan Messe.
I'm looking at the photos of the frog.
Fujitsu is a real idol smiling.
The event is the largest fashion and music event in Japan held annually since its first edition in 2010.
I've been doing a lot of models and artists, and I've been doing fashion show and live shows.
And when a young boy is introduced as a secret artist, there's a yellow cheer in the audience.
When the six people who climbed the stage, including Nazoo-shi, Sato-Ron-mi, Golden Finger I, Fujitsu, Fujitsu, Fujitsu, and Iwasaki, came down the stage, they walked down the middle of the stage and walked down the runway to the fans.
The applause is still going on, and it starts with "FIRE STORM".
The next group's cover song, "Janice Medley", will be a popular song for the storm, "A-RA-SHI" and "One Flower in the World" by SMAP.
And finally, the beauty boy finished with the original song "Cosmic Melody", and the six-man show "The Idol" ended with the royal circus.
The Trump Hotel owner has a complaint about the suitability of the liquor license.
Washington, DC - The Washington State Alcohol and Beverage Regulatory Commission has rejected a complaint that Washington should review the liquor license of a local Trump International hotel due to questions about the owner's eligibility.
The committee filed a complaint Wednesday by three members of Congress, two former judges, and two Jewish leaders that most of the applicants were not residents of Washington State or had no fixed assets in the state.
According to the Washington Post, this is the second time the state has filed a lawsuit to revoke the hotel's alcohol license, which requires an applicant to be "qualified" to obtain a liquor license.
In his first lawsuit filed last summer, he said he violated state law by repeatedly accusing Trump of assault and fraud.
The complaint was dismissed because the license had already been granted.
This is the second appeal to be filed in conjunction with the renewal of the license.
The first honey harvest from Bentley's Flying Bees!
What do you think of the honey bees that flying bees have gathered at the knees of the Flying B?
In May 2019, on the grounds of the crew factory in Bentley, England, a permanent bee farm was started, and honey was harvested for the first time in September of that year.
The worker bees, who were the best of the crew at the factory, collected more than 100 bottles of honey from just two nests.
Why did Bentley start to be a beehive on the grounds of a factory where they build their own pollen?
I want to taste this!
I'll give you the honey Bentley is making.
Peter Bosch, the manufacturing executive at Bentley, comments:
"In order to contribute to the conservation of biodiversity in the region, we set up our first nesting site on the large grounds of the crew factory earlier this year.
And the bees were watching the bees gather a variety of flower honey from the wild flowers they planted on the land and the surrounding hills.
And I found that this place is great for beekeeping, and it's amazing that we get this much in the first year.
Bentley has been working extensively to become a leading manufacturer of sustainable high-end automobiles through its crew plants and our businesses, and this is part of the honey bee industry.
And the staff is actively cooperating.
We're very happy to have the first harvest safely, and we plan to build more nests next year and increase the yield of Bentley honey.
And taking a small step can help preserve the biodiversity of the region.
We're going to do a lot of different things to play our part and continue to do that". In May 2019, we started the flying bee breeding of 120,000 bees.
And then, one summer later, in September of that year, we finished removing the nest frame from the nest, and we put the nest frame in a centrifuge, and then we filtered the dropped honey and bottled it.
And you can see the bottle of honey and the packaging of it as a bentley.
The design for the label was done by Louise McCallum, the designer of Bentley's interior.
And the bottled honey is not only given to the staff, but also to the valuable customers and guests who visit the factory.
Britain is a country that values timing.
And the honey-like pheneltie, of course, is a combination of flying bees and honey, like a scorn, and you want to enjoy afternoon tea.
The Sun, the worst British newspaper in the world, has a report on Cleveland police and corruption.
The police were given the badge of the worst in England by the inspector.
The Cleveland Police Department has been rated inadequate in every field in a report that exposes fraud.
The Cleveland Police Department is "developing a serious deterioration", says Phil Gomley, a police inspector.
In this police force, five police chiefs have been replaced in six years, and now they're facing a new demand for a new body.
According to the report, they were lacking in efforts to stop crime, arrest suspects, and protect the socially vulnerable.
Police Superintendent Phil Gomley said, "We've been doing a lot of serious damage since we last did it".
Police Chief Mike Will resigned in January, less than a year after taking office, but was subjected to "serious" but unpublished investigations into his actions.
Deputy Director Adrian Roberts was suspended after being arrested on suspicion of aggravated assault.
Sheriff Simon Harwood was on the wrong-way investigation committee last year for having hired a colleague to engage in sexual activity.
He resigned from the police.
The Conservative mayor of Tees Valley, Ben Hutchin, said: "This means that the police have been officially verified to be in a state of collapse.
Now is the time for the Interior Department to intervene".
Police Chief Richard Lewis said, "I've made improvements, but I'm responsible for all the reforms".
Nancy Pelosi: William Barr is a criminal, and the impeachment hearing needs to be closed.
No one knows what's going to happen.
Now, we think we're involved in a cover-up case, and it could take some time to investigate", Pelosi told CNN in a federal congressional interview.
"I'm going to do the work I started based on the relationship and the time it takes to find out the facts", Perosi said.
In the White House's filing released this week, we learned that Trump asked Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, the 2020 US presidential candidate.
According to the phone records, Trump also asked Zelensky to work with Mr. Barr and his personal counsel, lawyer Ludi Juliani, on the matter.
Mr. Trump denies the fraud.
CNN reported on Thursday that the first person to notice the whistleblowing about Trump's actions involving Ukraine more than a week before the official censorship was the Justice Department's national security lawyer.
The Justice Department, accused of being a spy by intelligence officials, decided that Trump's phone conversation was not a political financial violation investigation.
Asked whether Bar should testify, Pelosi said Friday that the Special Intelligence Committee would decide who to call as witnesses.
But Mr. Pelosi added that he thought Mr. Bar had become a criminal.
Sure, the bar was a long time ago.
"The name of the final bar was given", Perosi said, referring to Trump's naming of Bar as Attorney General in connection with his July phone call with the Ukrainian president.
It's interesting that Mr. Bar will have to make a decision about the outcome of this indictment.
Perosi said he was "very concerned" about the source of the whistleblower, when Trump on Thursday attacked the accused as a spy and said he had previously been treated differently.
I think the president's remarks are too irresponsible and dangerous.
Mr. Perosi said whistleblowers play a key role in exposing and disclosing corruption in the U.S. government and that "what the president says about people who may have provided whistleblowers with information is a significant blow to the government".
Mr. Perosi announced on Tuesday that he would officially hold a impeachment hearing against Mr. Trump over allegations of trying to pressure foreign leaders for political gain, marking a historic step.
The phone call was contained in a statement released Thursday, in which whistleblowers claimed that Trump abused his powers to "call for Ukrainian intervention" in the next 2020 presidential election.
The whistleblower also alleged that White House counsel instructed the officials to remove the call logs from the cabinet-level computer system and transfer them to a system of special classified information.
Crystal Palace forward Christian Benteke, driving ban for speeding
Premier League star Christian Benteque, who was arrested for two speeding violations in two months, is now on a driving ban.
The 28-year-old Crystal Palace forward admitted on January 20 that he was driving his Bentley and was driving at a speed limit of 50 miles per hour on the A3 in Richmond, southwest London, at 80 miles per hour.
The Belgian was then caught in March in London's southwest Patney, running at a speed limit of 40 miles per hour, more than twice the speed limit of 89 miles per hour, by a speed limiting camera.
Benatek, who lives in Kingston Hill, Surrey, doesn't have to appear in the security court at Lavender Hill this morning.
In a single-entry procedure that was held in early July, where a security judge heard a verdict for a minor crime, Bentecke pleaded guilty to both of these offences.
And the number of high school students in Taiwan, 9.2 percent of them, is "experienced".
(Taipei, 27th) Ministry of Health and Welfare (MHS) National Health Service (MHS) announced the results of a survey on Taiwanese high school students' sexual experiences on September 26th, in conjunction with World Contraception Day.
And this shows that 9.2% of the students who answered that they had experience.
And it turns out that about one in five of them doesn't have contraception.
The survey was conducted in 2017 among students enrolled in high schools, vocational high schools and higher vocational schools.
Compared to the previous 15 years, the percentage of students who had sex decreased slightly from 11.1% in the previous 15 years.
And 22.6 percent of 15- to 17-year-olds said they had not contracted during their recent sexual intercourse, up from 19.2 percent.
The internal translation shows that the trend is increasing at 28.8% of men (the previous 22.6%), and 16.2% of women (the same 14.5%).
The agency notes that today's teenagers have a lot of opportunities to get information on the Internet, and they're more likely to get biased when they get the wrong information.
We're calling for the right knowledge to be gained not only because abortion is not a pregnancy, but because the risk of infection and other diseases is increasing.

Ghana: Mr. Kofi Manu, concerns about the composition of the jury.
Kofi Manu, the football administrator and executive of Second Division, has expressed concern about the composition of the GFA's next election review committee.
He questioned whether it included Chairman Frank Davis, and expressed his displeasure.
In an interview with GNA Sports, Manu said the chairman had an interest in the outcome of the review process and that it was fair or unfair to include the chairman.
The review committee should be composed of fairly neutral members from outside who are not affiliated with each committee or who have no prior interests.
For example, Davis signed a contract with NC as an attorney and wrote a letter to Mr. Osei Quak Parma about his 10 percent salary.
He is also known as an Olympic supporter.
For these two reasons, he has interests, and the role of the jury should not be allowed, Manu argued.
Manu said that if Olympic Director Fred Pappe were on the committee, there would be a conflict of interest on the part of the president, but he suggested that if Palmer was on the committee, he would be prejudiced and unfair to him.
The committee members were scheduled to begin their activities yesterday after taking office at the GFA Accra Secretariat on 19 September and end on 4 October.
The chairman, Frank Davis of Corporate Governance Consulting, and the commissioner, attorneys Marian Bernor and Emmanuel Darkward.
The other members are Reginald Lalier, marketing and sales manager, and Richard Akpocavi, sports director and lawyer.
The Fukuoka Business Council survey found that 54 percent of small and medium-sized enterprises in Fukuoka prefecture believe that the minimum wage should be at least 1,000 yen.
In 2018, 90% of companies hired, while the percentage of new graduates and middle-level full-time employees who "made it" in 2018 was only 30% in the past and 30% in the post-regular recruitment, and there were images of companies struggling to secure personnel.
Companies that responded "yes" to the hourly wage increase to 1,000 yen had information-related industries (100 percent), construction industries (70 percent), wholesale industries (61 percent, 7 percent).
The majority of those who said "no" were in manufacturing (51-9%) and services, including food and accommodation (60-9%) and transportation were the same.
The conference's spokesperson said: "While there is a high rate of opposition in the part-time and full-time industries, there are more companies that are finding it difficult to get staff and are looking to increase staff costs".
The companies that said "no" were able to raise the average hourly wage of 895 yen (Fukui Prefecture 829 yen from October 4).
When we heard about the recruitment status of the company on March 19, 61% of new recruits were employed by regular employees, 54% were employed by intermediate employees, and 15% were employed by non-formal employees.
And the only thing that didn't work was 8 percent.
The percentage of companies that were able to set a schedule -- 44 percent of new graduates, 50 percent of middle-aged graduates, and 31 percent of non-formal graduates -- remained.
The transportation industry, in particular, suffered from a high rate of graduation (13%; middle school (37%); construction industry, in particular, from a high rate of graduation (24%; middle school (38%); middle school (38%).
And 86 percent of the total had job challenges, and many of them were: "Low number of applicants", "low company profile", "unable to offer favorable wages".
The government has been calling for more recruitment and information for second graduates, and for interim recruitment.
There were also suggestions to encourage the approach to students, such as providing opportunities for PR to students from outside the province and supporting a variety of internships.
And when it comes to the side jobs and part-time jobs that our country advocates for in its growth strategy, 15 percent said, "We've already agreed".
And when we included 20 percent of those who said, "I'm going to admit it", a third of the total responded.
The companies that said "no" were 64 percent, the construction industry was 82 percent, the retail industry was 73 percent, the manufacturing industry was 72 percent.
The survey was conducted on July 19 and August 2 across 1,000 member companies.
I got a response from 298 companies (29.8%).
The JR Nagasaki line was damaged by the typhoon.
The JR Main Line, which was watching the train being damaged by Typhoon 17, resumed its operation from the start of the morning of the 27th.
The JR-Makura line, the direct line between Sazo and Nagasaki, started operating normally on the morning of the 27th.
The JR Main Line was built between the river shed and the Piyū Station, and the shoreline was blown up by the typhoon, causing the base to flow.
In addition to the driving coincidence between the stations of Yamatsu and Takayama, the number of JR trains in Nagasaki Prefecture was declining and the diamond ripples continued.
According to JR Nagasaki, the restore works were completed on the 26th day, and the train was restarted on the 27th day after the unknown test drive.
The voice that is leading the final battle against Tiplik and Ho.
"Now is the time to show off". Justin Tiprick said as Wales hosted the World Cup against Australia, which will determine the course of the tournament.
If Wales wins the Wallabies, it will be the hottest winner in Pool D, probably France or Argentina.
On the other hand, if Australia, which has played 15 matches in the past, wins their 14th win against Wales, Tippick and his team will be the eighth best match against England.
"Of course, I want to challenge both teams and win the group stage", said Frank and Tiprick of Wales.
We've had some tough results in the past, but we won last fall.
I think Australia will blame you for paying off the debt, but not until we try to win it again.
I knew this game was going to be a mountain before I came here.
And now I'm here, and now I'm here to show you the real thing.
Wales have won only one World Cup in their history against Australia, New Zealand and South Africa, and the Wallabies' win is the third final in the last 32 years.
And under coach Warren Gattland, the overall score against the three Southern Hemisphere heavyweight teams is only seven wins out of 41.
Wales ended their Test match against Australia last November with a 13 to one defeat, but Tippick was among the few to win the match 9-6, and is one of the players to play at the Tokyo Stadium this Sunday.
When asked if he still didn't feel like he was winning before that victory, Tiplik said, "It's hard to answer.
I'm sure the game was tough, and I probably thought that maybe not everyone would win, but I don't know.
And as a result, I got about 15 points in the final game, and it looked like it was a lot less than it actually was".
The key to Wales' victory is a breakdown battle with the Australian Convoy, Michael Hooper, David Pocock and Tipper, who are revered as the backrow.
Tiplik, who has played 67 international matches, has played a few matches or both in the past, and he knows what's in store for him.
"They're definitely world class boxers", he says.
You know, when you're playing against the back row of the World Cup, you always know you're going to have a tough game coming up.
They're always the best in the world.
So I know exactly what the game is going to be.
Pocock is one of the best boxers in the world in defensive combat, and Michael is an aggressive boxer, but he's probably more rugby-minded in the sense that he's going where he needs to go when he needs to.
I'd rather fight the best players in the world than fight the weakest backs.
I want to fight the best of them, and if I want to fight those two, I have to get myself in shape.
I'm not saying this is the final, but it's a big game for us in the World Cup.
The momentum is important.
If you keep doing well, you can get a good game.
"The most insane". The place is the head, the silence, Ireland, the shock, the defeat of the W Cup, the Shattered News, the Attic.
On the 28th, local fans watch a rugby World Cup match in Japan in Dublin, Ireland, showing their tough face.
In the local stronghold of Ireland, which lost to Japan in the World Cup of Rugby in Dublin, local fans who had been running to the pub since the morning of the 28th were silent about the unexpected defeat.
Public broadcasting RTE cannot hide its frustration that "the courageous Japanese are a stunning madman".
The game started in Ireland at 8 a.m. local time.
The pub in Dublin, the capital, co-owned by FB Carney, was crowded with fans even early in the morning.
I was pretty sure I would win the game before, but I was so overwhelmed at the end that I could hear a "no" shout.
When the whistle of the game ended, the store was silent.

The meeting of the government subcommittee to discuss the treatment of water at Tokyo Power Fukushima 1st nuclear power plant is scheduled for 27th afternoon, Tokyo City Port District.
The 27th government subcommittee to consider the increasing treatment of treated water at Fukushima I nuclear power plant presented the equipment and specific procedures for the disposal of Tokyo electricity, as a method of disposal, which is already being used in the country and abroad.
We're trying to stop the radioactive substances like triium, so we're trying to control the reputation damage, check the concentration of the substance, and detect anomalies before release.
The committee on the draft procedures presented at the meeting today said, "I want you to be clear about how long it takes". "It's different to release fisheries in Fukushima in a situation where they're not recovering, and to release them after they've recovered to some extent.
And then there was this whole idea of "the time frame of society should be taken into account".

But will you start a relationship and regret this hot moment?
Since Calum helped Ben, and Bobby Beal, who is in trouble, and Clay Milner Russell, and they've been going along slowly, I'm sure you'll think about it, and I'll tell Ben that I'm glad to see him feeling weak or nice lately, and maybe I'll go out with him.

And if the book is at a 9:1 ratio, then it's considered a gift from the entertainer to the book, and investors' opinions about the tax are on Twitter, and they've been retweeted over 30,000 times.
If the payout is 9:1, is there a gift tax?
I asked the tax collector, Anoto.
• First of all, corporations are not subject to gift tax
So, I'm going to tell you what the tax rate is, and I'm going to tell you what the tax rate is.
The business is not a private company, it is not subject to gift tax.
If the job is a nine-to-one ratio, the business will earn a million yen in sales and a hundred thousand yen in expenses.
This is a corporate tax.
Of course, you're already paying corporate taxes by filing a tax return like this.
And even if you're wondering about the distribution, you're not saying that the actual amount you're getting is not the amount you're supposed to get.
And I think you're declaring the amount you've received as sales.
And the gift is a gift that says, "I'll give you, I'll get you", and that's because you're both aware of the fact that if the person who gave you the gift doesn't recognize it, it's not a gift, even if it's personal.
If you're dealing with things that are obviously priced, like real estate sales, for tax avoidance purposes, at a price that's different from the actual market, it's a problem in calculating taxes.
But, as with this one, you can't have a third party decide what the taxable price is for what you've been trading without a dispute.
I'm sorry about the one yen payment.

The White House, the bulletproof, the panic.
White House officials on Thursday took to the streets to protest the impeachment pressure of the new Democratic Party, and those familiar with the issue said they had a "great panic" this week over the lack of plans to address the new reality that has emerged.
People close to the White House said they were "increasingly concerned, worried, worried, worried" about the atmosphere in the West Building, and the potential for whistleblowers to cause significant damage to the president and some of those around him.
He said, "I don't have much of myself in it".
The White House officials, not only do they have no clear plan for the situation, but the usual policies that the president has so far taken to conduct the debate are not applicable, and the allegations are so serious, they're still unsure how to proceed, and the official jokes, "It's not like it's going to be in the news next time".
And other people familiar with the controversy, who have been following the impeachment hearing for a long time, have described the alarming atmosphere in the White House as "a shock", as the president responds in a way that is not normally available, and increases the likelihood that he will be "out of control".
Another source said that during the impeachment hearing, the president's pressure was increasing daily, and that there were even close supporters who expected the president to act more "impulsively".
It has been fueled by growing concerns that Trump may take unpredictable actions or aggressive attacks by unexpected means, and concerns about the president and politics in an election year.
Trump has changed his hand to attack or defend himself, facing the greatest threat of his time, including reviving the strategy he found effective in Robert Moore's Russian investigation.
Trump has tried to dismiss the request from the Ukrainian president to cooperate in the investigation of his political enemies, to divert his attention from the activities of Democratic and Joe Biden presidential candidates, and to undermine the credibility of whistleblowers as motivated by party rivalry.
But many White House officials are enduring the ordeal of the Morer investigation, and this time they're starting to feel the difference, the people behind the investigation said.
The president, who is branded as a power, appeared to be attending a press conference on Wednesday, and someone familiar with the situation said.
Trump seemed to enjoy questions about Russian suspicion investigations, but he was not in the mood to answer questions about Ukraine.
Some of the people behind the allegations are aware that they had no direct knowledge of the controversial conversations between President Trump and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, and some are convinced that the allegations are a threat to the credibility of the alleged informants and can be mitigated.
And what's more, it's a common occurrence that a president is attacked, but there's a growing supporting force to defend that fact.
But a Republican strategist close to the White House says the basic support for the president is already very high, and that impeachment will have little effect on gaining new supporters.
Especially when impeachment interferes with legislation, and the news is a 24-hour monopoly, "There's no benefit in focusing on impeachment for the next four months".
Another source said that those who claimed that impeachment would help the president were not fully aware of how uncertain the president's response would be.
Concerned White House officials are seeking advice from their advisers on how to form a pro-government team.
According to the people who explained the basics of the plan, it's still in its early stages, but it's not clear how or when it will be implemented, like the strategic decision-making room.
But there is a perception that organizational legal strategy, communication strategy, and the publication of critical whistleblowing documents, and the momentum that their publication has given to Democratic impeachment, require a clear leader who can organize publicity offensively, the person said.
Sources familiar with the situation say that the lack of long-term strategic perspective is clearly evident, including that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Treasury Secretary Steven Munshin have said they cannot disclose documents 48 hours after Trump announced that he would not release notes on his phone call with the Ukrainian president.
The pressure is likely to be higher now than during the investigation of Robert Moller, who spoke almost silently only through the indictment. According to the people involved, the person who may be involved in the impeachment proceedings is the so-called Trump Outer Pitbull, former election chief.
But it's not accurate to suggest that he's going to be the leader of such an effort", Lewandowski told NBC News.
"I have done everything I can to support the president and the policies for the past five years, but I have never talked to the president or his people about joining the team to fight this false accusation", he said.
Trump's outside lawyer, Jay Seclough, is also involved in the impeachment process.
In an interview with NBC News, Seclough said, "We're handling the problem properly".
Emmett Flood, who was involved in the Clinton impeachment and led the White House until the end of the Morer investigation, left, and Pat Sipolon, the current White House counsel, lacks that experience, and the White House lacks lawyers who have experience in impeachment matters.
White House sources familiar with the strategy said that, in general, the people involved in hiring and building a strategy team are far from it, but they recognize that we need people who can be organized and who can lead the political struggle and all the efforts that everyone can do to respond.

Video maker Bandai Namcoart and Gozmaker Cospa are creating a brand new brand called Videsta, which combines tagging and creates anime-themed apparel and accessories.
From the one scene and the visual design of the animated package, the super cool T-shirts are in front and behind, and you're going to show them the picture!
The first is the one that I'm looking at.
In the previous edition, I picked up the first bullet item that was on the market.

The items that are motifs for the LD package have jackets, and they're decorated just like that!
The object that is the subject of the video cassette package is the storage cover and the content.

Debine Nunez has condemned the Democrats for demanding a "naked picture of Trump".
Congressman Devin Nunes, a Republican from California, seems to be reluctant to think that President Donald Trump will be investigated.
In a statement defending the president on Thursday, he condemned the Democrats for trying to get into the president's nude photographs.
House Intelligence Committee Republican senior member Nunes made the opening statement about the allegations that Trump had asked for an investigation into Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and his son.
The senator called the Ukrainian suspicions a "glotetic show" created by the left and its "media assets", and condemned the Democrats for wanting to see a nude photo of the president.
"It's the Democratic Special Committee that negotiated with people who appear to be Ukrainians to get a nude photo of Trump".
It's only natural for everyone to ask why the Democrats are so eager to impeach this president, and if they have the chance to do so in a year's time.
When Senator Nunes's reprimand was over, the senior political reporter at the Huff Post, Jennifer Bendley, decided to see if the Democratic candidate was looking for the truth.
So far, I've only answered the question of whether the Democratic member of the Connecticut House of Representatives, Jim Himes, and many other members of the House of Representatives, are telling the truth.
Mediat.com speculates that the nudist comments of Nunes were about "more obscure and unconfirmed details" that were allegedly written in the controversial Steel document.
It's a notorious report by former British intelligence officer Christopher Steel, which collected shocking allegations against Trump, and it refers to the alleged "feel tape" that Trump is showing in a Moscow hotel room watching prostitutes urinate.
Origami, wallet and real cards.
I'm going to send money, loan, insurance, investment, and I'm going to watch.
Origami Wallet is an app that allows you to transfer money and make payments through origami pay, and also through a network of financial institutions.
It's also a charging feature.
We're going to start a partnership with financial services like loans, investments, insurance.
So, you can use the financial functions of paying, moving, charging, borrowing, reproducing, and having, like, the origami wallet.
Origami Financial Services CEO, Jumi Mi-Shee, said, "We want to create new financial services that solve the challenges of the younger generation that have to live with all kinds of problems about money, such as pensions and low interest rates, and that we want to make services that are equally useful and enriching to people who have been alienated from finance, who have not benefited from the current system".
The benefits of Origami Wallet are that if you have an Origami ID, you can complete everything seamlessly from the application to the transaction, and you can get information in a timely manner.
And he explained that not only by deploying the origami app, but also by deploying it on the apps of our partners, we can make it a service that is available even if we don't have an origami app.
And when it comes to loans, I'm going to show you a feature that you can connect to when you're making payments and then pay back.
And when I needed money, I was going to do it all over the Origami app, from the application to the refund.
As a partner, I'm introducing the first life insurance and the first life insurance.
He said that both companies and the two companies would use their data and knowledge to launch life events insurance products.
We are going to start and expand the provision of financial services through registration with the necessary administrative institutions.
■ A new initiative for the effective use of data, Origami Technologies
On the same day, Origami announced that the company will launch a new business called Origami Technologies, which will help customers digitise their customer connections with Pay, the payment functionality that Origami provides, and support the effective use of data, including the data that the company has.
Origami recognizes that in origami network partnerships, such as payments, it is becoming more difficult to acquire structured data, such as sales, and unstructured data from real society, and to accumulate, process, and analyze data effectively.
And in this, we're supporting origami technologies with their payroll data, along with structured data held by their affiliates, and unstructured data acquisition and analysis.
We're working to help drive digital transformation, creating new business models that leverage data and digital technologies effectively.
Origami CEO Kanui Ieyasu said, "Now many companies are gathering data and building customer relationships", and he said, "The next step is how we use data to develop business models".
And in that, he said, "I want to combine the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data we've built with the data from the data we've built with the data we've built with the data from the data we've built with the data from the data we've been built with the data".
We'll be posting details of specific services in a sequential order.
And then, at Origami Conference 2019, we're going to talk about what Origami is going to do next, like delivering coupons to your phone when it rains, and providing convenience with mobile technology.
The compensation for misuse is still paid in full by Origami Pay, but it is defined in terms of use.
We also worked with the Regional Activation and Tourism Association to support the project.
The honorary chairman of the Japan Music Arts Exchange, who received the first class of the Korean Order of Merit, and the singer, who died in July this year at the age of 100, was honored by the ceremony on September 7 in Osaka's Aviná Osaka.
The people involved played the famous songs of the young man.
About 140 Japanese officials, including the Chairman of the General Federation of Osaka, Mr. Yong-kun, and the Chairman of the Japan Music and Arts Exchange Association, Mr. Pike-Bokuchi.
At the ceremony, the chairman of the board, Pikachu, was the first to speak.
The chairman of the pond said, "I still can't believe that the teacher is gone". He said, "I was so sad that, as I prepared for the 'Flowers' meeting, I was amazed at how wonderful and great Professor Chuo-chi was".
He also said that he was determined to "do something to expand the congregation".
After the silence, the Korean Society for Arts and Communication, the International Institute of Thought, was introduced by the director of the Taichung Institute, Koen Ji.
The potential for reducing emissions from renewable biofuels
In recent years, electric cars, Tesla trucks, and semiconductors have taken over the news, but the only thing that can fly through the air is the plane, which is supposed to be without access to renewable energy.
But a professor at the University of Alberta has developed a technology that makes renewable biofuels available as jet fuel.
Dr. David Bresler, a professor at the Alberta College of Agricultural and Environmental Sciences, started this project in 2003.
His lab is developing hydrocarbon fuels from fatty waste, like oil from restaurants, livestock rendering, and canora oil.
Unlike ethanol and other biofuels, this technology uses low-quality oils for production, with carbon emissions 85% lower than crude oil-based fuels, and uses other industrial waste in the production process.
This technology also works to replicate hydrocarbons that are found in crude oil-based fuels.
Dr. Bresler said, "What actually produced this technology in the first generation was the carbon dioxide molecule itself in diesel".
While biofuels are a new option, conventional biofuels tend to destabilize at low temperatures, causing serious problems for aircraft traveling at high altitudes.
"The problem with jet fuel is like a dilemma", Dr. Bresler said.
It's not as valuable as diesel, but it's a higher requirement.
Dr. Bresler's lab is currently looking at two options for jet biofuels.
The first is a low-risk approach, where we need to process hydrocarbons and biofuels differently and add hydrogen.
The second option is to continue to study the chemical reactions that we've already partially developed that keep the fuel stable even at low temperatures.
Dr. Bresler said about the second option, "We can also test it in a reactor to change the chemical reaction a little bit".
This option is risky.
In addition to the increased investment by airlines and the Canadian and US military in renewable options, Forge Hydrocarbons, a subsidiary of the University of Alberta, is working on producing.
"They predict that someday someone will impose a carbon tax", he said.
I want to make a bad case.
Forge is currently operating a test plant near the Edmonton Waste Management Center, and recently, he has received a $4 million investment from Lockheed Martin to help build a $25 million production facility in Sombra, Ontario.
The plant will produce about 19 million litres of biofuel annually.
Dr. Bresler says that the carbon reduction is about 85%, but aspects like fuel transportation and production are the reason why the reduction rate is not increasing.
"As an engineer", says Mr. Bresler.
My job is to make choices that go along with the decisions that I've been given, so that I can have multiple options.
I'm a student of the third grade of Shimaida Shinseng High School, and I'm a student of the Shimaida Shinseng High School, and I'm a student of the Shimaida Shinseng High School, and I'm a student of the Shimaida Shinseng High School, and I'm a student of the Shimaida Shimaida High School, and I'm a student of the Shimaida Shimaida High School, and I'm a student of the Shimaida Shimaida High School, and I'm a student of the Shimaida Shimaida High School, and I'm a student of the Shimaida Shimaida News.
I'm working on a local production.
Five students of the third year of Shima Shima High are working on a local curriculum on the theme of the Shima Shima Festival and the Shinkai Bridge, the tourist attractions and traditional activities of the Shima Shima region.
We're working on crowdfunding to raise the money for the production until October 15th, and we're looking at distributing it to local kindergartens and rehab facilities for free.
The main characters are: Fukuyama, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, Tsugumi Ohba, and Tsugumi Ohba, and Tsugumi Ohba, and Tsugumi Ohba, and Tsugumi Ohba, and Tsugumi Ohba, and the people are working on the project.
The five have been working on the project since last December, with the idea of "telling the people about the charm of the region".
The pictures used in the billboards are taken locally, or taken by the city council.
I also added a description of the history and sights behind the painting, which was near completion.
She said she wanted to make it fun, especially for the children, and she also hoped that other students would find new attractions in the area.
The target crowdfunding is 300,000 yen, and if the deadline is not reached, the total amount will be returned.
I'll look for details in "Obsessed".
High school entrance exam 2020: Hokkaido Public High School entrance exam, gender field of application eliminated (Rissam) - Yahoo! News
The Hokkaido Education Commission on September 26, 2019, published the guidance for the selection of students for the 2020 academic year (order and second year) at Hokkaido Higher School.
We will eliminate the gender gap from the form of the application, with a focus on transgender students whose minds and bodies are not compatible.
The date of the election.
The selection manual for students at the Taodi High School was compiled into a single book, including selection timetables, recruitment personnel, application qualifications, application procedures, application changes, academic tests, passing declarations, and other practical details and references.
The main focus of the project is the selection of general students, the selection of recommended students, the selection of students from the pathological higher education institutions that conduct coordinated, high-level education, and the selection of students for non-road applications.
Prior to the 2019 entrance exam, the entrance application had a gender section, but due to the need to take proper account of the diversity of sexual orientation and gender identity of individuals, the 2020 entrance exam will remove the gender section from the application form.
The general admissions test is five subjects: English, Mathematics, Social Sciences and English.
The English hearing test is included in the English test time.
Each class has a test time of 50 minutes.
So, we're going to take 45 minutes to answer each question, and then we're going to take five minutes to give the respondents attention and issues, and so on, right after the test starts.
And the points are 60 points for each subject.
The 2020 academic year schedule for the selection of students at the Hokkaido State Higher Secondary School is: General Selection Application Reception from January 21 to 24, 2020 at noon; Application Changes from January 29 to February 4 at 4 p.m.; Academic Tests from March 4 to March 4; Qualification Announcements from March 17 at 10 a.m.; Second Recruitment Application Reception from March 23 to March 24 at 4:30 p.m.; Second Recruitment Qualification Announcements from March 27 to March 27.
Selection by recommendation and coordination type, application acceptance from 21 to 24 January 2020 at noon, interview etc. on 13 February, confirmation of qualification notification until 20 February, and reapplication acceptance of those who were not confirmed by the selection of the recommended entrant will take place from 21 to 26 February at noon.
Boris Johnson's cabinet warns that if Brexit is overturned Britain will face riots like the one in Los Angeles.
If the results of the second referendum are overturned, there is a risk of "a violent uprising by the people" in this country, a senior minister said last night.
Senior officials in the Prime Minister's Office warned that Britain would face civil unrest on the scale of the yellow vest movement in France over economic inequality and the 1992 Los Angeles riots.
Johnson said he needed to "calm down" on the angry political language that was being used in the heated debate, but he insisted he would not stop using the word "defeat".
Despite the prime minister's appeal for calm, a minister told The Times: "Nothing like Jire Jon, the Yellow Vest Movement, or the 1992 Los Angeles riots has ever happened in this country".
The people don't think that riots will happen in this country because they never did.
There's already a model of the Yellow Vest movement, where they encrypt their cell phones and organize a demonstration, and then there's a few populist leaders who use their dirty hands to incite people.
In Los Angeles, in 1992, a riot broke out after a jury acquitted four white police officers who tried to beat up a black taxi driver, Rodney King.
This year, French anti-government protester Girlie Joanne, wearing a yellow vest, has been causing chaos and destruction in the city of Paris for more than six weeks.
The minister pointed to Johnson's warning in the House of Commons that if Britain fails to leave the EU, "the trust in our political system will be devastatingly broken".
"If 30 million people vote in a referendum and 66 percent vote to stay in the EU, 10 million people will be unhappy", the minister said.
Even if 99% of the voters are against leaving, 100,000 people who are very angry will not give up writing a letter to the House of Representatives.
It won't be long before thousands of people take to the streets.
A senior minister added that if the results of the second referendum were to override the first, there was a risk of "a violent uprising by the people" in the country.
Mr. Johnson wants a general election and a vote on Brexit.
Mr. Johnson is reportedly facing a House rebellion that wants him to lower his demands to leave the EU and instead compromise with the EU.
New Delhi BB B League opening day prayer for the win
The newly-created professional basketball star Alvilex BB made a must-win prayer for 27 days, more than a week before the opening of the B League.
The players and staff of the New York City Albilex Club held a prayer ceremony on the morning of the 27th in New York City.
Last season, New York won their first district title in the club's history.
But after the season, the scoring king, Davanté Gardner, moved to another team in the B-League.
This season, we're going to be hosting a new foreign player, Nick Perkins, who will be more than last season's district champions.
Captain Kwon-sao said: "It's important to increase the speed and strength of the defense that the head coach wants to improve the results of last season's midfield victory".
The opening match of the new season will be held on October 5 against Albark Tokyo in Awai.
Pakistan, the brother of a social media star, sentenced to life in prison for honor killing.
It takes a long time to execute, and the accused murderer is released on bail, and the memory of the case is fading, according to women's rights experts.
"It takes too long, and people forget", said women's rights activist and founder of Pakistan's first university's gender division, Farzana Bali, who added that even the most pressing case of Baloch took more than three years to solve.
Human rights groups say it's difficult to prove reliable data, but the Pakistani Human Rights Commission found at least 300 "honor killings" in 2018.
Many human rights defenders say the actual number of honor killings is much higher, because honor-based violence watchdogs estimate that Pakistan accounts for about a fifth of the 5,000 honor killings that occur worldwide each year.
The US$130 million for swine cholera in Shibuya Prefecture, and the September amendment.
The parliamentary operating committee on September 26 reported that the province would add 12 million yen to the September correction budget for the pig-cholera emergency response operation and 12 million yen for the decision-related expenses needed to acquire land for the JR Biomassine station upgrades.
It's proposed to the provincial assembly on the 27th.
This is the total accounting for the September Amendment Bill.
With the new outbreak of swine cholera in Yue-gu, the province is now expanding the sanitization points for livestock vehicles in Honshu-Western City to three other cities in the city of Hokkaido, Fujiwara City and Chiyoda Prefecture near Kanton.
The total cost of the project is 77.4 million yen.
In addition, to prevent the spread of the infection from wild boars, which are the main infection pathways, we will start measures to ensure that wild boars are not caught in areas outside the western part of the province and infected with swine cholera.
The cost of capturing and testing 1,560 head of prefecture in the eastern and central parts of the province will be 58,6 million yen.
In connection with the decision-making process for the overhaul of the Boomizhin Station, the costs of commissioning the verification evaluation of the planned acquisition site and the operating costs associated with the holding of the collection committee will be added.
According to the Office of the Prefectural Revenue Commission, the request for a ruling requesting the surrender of the unacquired land that the prefecture and the city of Biotsuchi went to on the 18th was accepted on the 19th.
The application papers will be presented in a vertical list at the Biomass City Hall on October 3, 17 and the decision to begin the decision process is expected to be made as soon as possible.
General Corporation Mayor Election 29th announcement No vote for eight years: YANGYANG newspaper Digital News
The general election of the company's mayor, which will be held on the 29th day of the term, will be announced.
Only the current incumbent, Okinawa Shōji () who has so far sought four elections, has declared his candidacy.
And there's no running, and the first vote-free public accounts in eight years are growing.
The city of Goma is promoting the city's reconstruction plan for recovery from the West Japan flood disaster (FY2019) and is working on the recovery and disaster prevention projects under tough financial conditions.
The population decline is also a major concern for the promotion of the surrounding areas and the tourism tourism.
The candidate will be accepted at the Municipal General Welfare Center in the city centre on 29th, from 8.30 am to 5.00 pm.
Voting will take place on October 6 at 7 a.m. and 6 p.m. at 35 polling stations across the city, with the same polling station opening at 7:30 a.m.
There are floods and disasters in India, in many parts of the world, caused by the long-term monsoon.
India's monsoon season has been raging for about a month, with unprecedented rainfall, building collapses, deaths, and crops beginning to decay.
Normally, the monsoon in northern India weakens in early September, but the average rainfall this month is 37 percent higher than usual.
According to experts at the Indian Meteorological Agency, if this continues for days, the monsoon will weaken at its lowest point in decades.
In many parts of India, unprecedented rain is still falling, and in Pune, western India, heavy rains on Wednesday and Thursday have brought down buildings, killing several people and causing a disaster.
The houses flooded, the residents got on their knees, and crossed the streets, usually only during the monsoon season.
It rained heavily in other cities like Kolkata, Lucknow, Hyderabad.
In the northern Uttarakhand state, heavy rains have caused massive damage to homes.
It was too late for the monsoon.
In many areas, water shortages were a risk for farmers to suffer drought.
Farmers don't like long monsoons.
This rainfall is not normal at this time of year.
A small farmer from Bhimtal, Uttarakhand, Pulakash Mehera said, "We are now producing cabbage, beans, endos, tomatoes, but the rain will decompose the vegetables".
And the effect of the slow, strong monsoon on consumers will also increase the price of tomatoes that cannot be used in Indian cuisine.
In cities like Delhi and Mumbai, it's usually 20 rupees per kilometer, 23 pence per pound, and it's sold for 80 rupees.
The festival is also at risk.
The next big festival is on October 8th in Dhasera, where Hindus install the huge comic book-style figure, the evil-laughing, grotesque Ravana, in the epic poem "Lamarayana".
To burn the ravina means that good has destroyed evil.
But since the dolls are made of paper, if the monsoon is long, the last laugh may be the raven.
He's a tough defensive player, a tough Yogami M.
J1Begalta Sendai conducted a 24-day non-public practice for the 28th day of the home Yokohama M Battle (Justa, 7 p.m.) from 24 to 4 days.
At Yokohama M, he lost 15 points in three recent league games, but the manager of the side, 45, said: "The players showed me a strong, battle-hardened practice".
Last season, he lost eight points in a game at home to Worst, and five points in the opponent's court.
We're still down 1-2 on the road this season.
Yokohama M, now in third place, has 48 points in the top tier of Thai football.
In addition to the strong forward players of FW Markos Junior with 13 points (26), FW Tekawa Gugyan with 10 points (7 assists), FW Tekawa Gugyan with 27 points (24), and the Japanese national team, DF中之輔 (24), the Brazilian DF Chiago Martins (24) with a J-finger CB competition, will also be expected.
The quarterback said, "There's a lot of offensive play, and there's a lot of fast-paced CBs, and I want to fight with confidence, not show off, but protect and flourish".
The first ever Imperial Cup was won by J2 Nagasaki, who lost 18 days later, and only eight league matches remain.
The commander said, "It was a sad loss.
I'm going to show you the results you've been working on, and you're going to show me the results you've been working on.
I'm not going to be here.
Exposure to a large amount of pesticides may increase the risk of heart disease and heart attack.
Recent studies have shown that working around high concentrations of pesticides can increase the risk of heart disease later on.
This is the result of more than 30 years of tracking of a group of Hawaiian-Americans.
Compared to a group of men who didn't work around pesticides, researchers found that those who were exposed to a large amount of pesticides had a 45 percent higher risk of heart disease and heart attack.
"What this study emphasizes is the importance of wearing personal protective equipment when exposed to pesticides at work, documenting exposure to pesticides at work, and reducing the standard risk factors for heart disease", says study co-author Dr. Beatrice Rodriguez.
Dr. Rodriguez is a professor in the Department of Geriatrics at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.
This is the result of a study of data from over 6,000 men living on Oahu who participated in the Quakini Honolulu Heart Program.
The researchers say that the study is only for Japanese men, so it may not be applicable to women or other races.
Because pesticides have a long half-life, their health effects may appear years after exposure.
And the study showed the biggest impact within 10 years of exposure.
"After 34 years of follow-up, exposure to pesticides at work is no longer relevant to the relationship between heart disease and heart attack", Dr. Rodriguez said in a press release.
This is probably because other factors associated with aging are more important, and it hides the possible link between pesticides and heart disease in later life.
Researchers found that exposure to low- and medium-concentration pesticides was not significantly linked to heart disease and heart attack.
I'm not sure what happened.
It was a turbulent week for Washington's political issues, with impeachment proceedings against President Donald Trump.
For the political beginner Volodymyr Zelensky, I wanted to avoid being swallowed up in a political scandal.
But what has been revealed so far about the Zelensky lamp phone problem, and does it have a wide-ranging impact on Zelensky?
At the beginning of the phone call, Trump told Zelensky that the United States was offering Ukraine a lot of advantages over other European countries.
The White House's published phone records are not word-for-word, but they describe in detail how Trump criticized Prime Minister Angela Merkel and other European leaders for focusing on conversation rather than concrete proposals.
Zelensky's response to Trump's 100 percent rather than 1000 percent objection is considered controversial.
Zelensky added that neither President Macron nor Merkel had given Ukraine sufficient support.
And this conversation inspired politicians, especially the Ukrainian opposition, to debate on social media.
Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko tweeted: "The support we have received from the EU is unprecedented".
Moreover, Poroshenko tweeted that he was grateful for the EU's support, including Russian sanctions and economic aid during the Russian invasion.
Ukrainian politician Victoria Voiticica has also expressed concern about whether "we can negotiate with Germany and France again".
Trump then called for military aid, asking Zelensky to investigate two things instead of one, the first of which was Joe Biden's son Hunter, and the second was an investigation into the Democratic National Committee's servers that were hacked, suggesting that Ukraine was involved in Democratic email hacking during the 2016 election.
It is unclear whether this will hinder European relations or set the tone for the French and German leaders.
I don't want to speak ill of anyone.
"We are grateful that the call logs have been released, and we thank everyone who has helped us", Zelensky said at the UN General Assembly in New York.
Zelensky is scheduled to meet with the leaders of Russia, Germany and France at the Normandy Four summit in October.
Ghana, two awards from international private airlines.
At the 40th International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) General Conference in Montreal, Canada, Ghana won two prestigious awards.
The safety award was given in recognition of Ghana's achievement of the highest score in Africa in aviation safety oversight, with a provisional implementation rate of 89.89%.
Prior to this, the ICAO had completed its coordinated verification investigation (ICVM) on April 3, 2019, according to the UN Aviation Safety Supervision Audit Report.
The safety award is the recognition that Ghana is in compliance with ICAO's standards and agreements on airport and domestic air safety.
These awards were created as part of the ICAO's Zero Country Launch Campaign.
In addition, 16 certificates were awarded for safety assessment, 17 certificates for safety assessment, and 17 certificates were awarded to ICAO participating countries with improved safety standards.
The recipients of the award were Joseph Kofi Ada, Ghana's aviation minister, Simon Alotti, Ghana's director of civil aviation, Ni Ai Koy Otou, the Ghanaian ambassador to Canada, and Yao Kwakwa, the managing director of Ghana Airport.
In his speech, President Olmyuya Benard Ariou of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) stressed the need to maintain air safety in participating countries.
The chairman said, "Even in this era of innovation, it is important to always remain aware that aviation safety and security and sustainability remain the most fundamental priorities".
Mr. Ada also said that this award is a complement to the industry's tireless efforts and patience, and a gift to Ghana's efforts.
He also said that "air travel has the potential to dramatically change our lives", and that the aviation industry has a huge future for developing the domestic economy.
There are social and economic benefits, but they're all about the security and security that we've achieved.

Trump appointed Peter Gayno as FEMA's chief of staff.
Acting Director of the United States Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Peter Gayno, smiled on April 3, 2019, at the testimony of the FEMA Budget Billing Trial for the 2020 fiscal year at the National Security Senate Committee in Capitol Hill, Washington, United States.
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - According to a White House announcement, President Donald Trump on Thursday appointed Peter Gayno as the chief of the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
FEMA Deputy Director Geino was the acting director of government disaster response, including hurricanes and volcanic fires.
The agency has been in the absence of a Senate-approved director since the resignation of former Secretary-General Block Long in March.
The Department of Homeland Security, the top agency of FEMA, had determined that Long had misused a government bus to travel between Washington and his home in North Carolina, and resigned.
Another candidate, Jeffrey Byard, was also recommended for the role, and was removed from the selection process earlier this month after a public inquiry into his involvement in a drunken riot.
Mr. Gaino's appointment as director was as expected.
The nomination will require the approval of the Senate majority.
Before becoming deputy director of FEMA in 2018, Mr. Gayno was on assignment at the Emergency Management Agency in Rhode Island and was a Navy veteran, the White House said.
CBS Los Angeles - Police shut down illegal marijuana-bapping operations in the San Gabriel Valley.
El Monte, CBSLA: Police shut down illegal marijuana-bapping activities in the San Gabriel Valley on Thursday.
After police issued a search warrant for the illegal sale of marijuana-based beep, the search began at 4:37 p.m. and a large container of butane honey oil was discovered in an office building in the 9600 block of Telster Street.
El Monte Police Deputy Christopher Kano said that the investigators also found equipment to fill the bay cart ridge.
"This is a very dangerous process", said Kano's deputy.
Kano police chief said he had previously been involved in drug investigations and that there was a possibility of a fire during the extraction process for oil used in beep products.
"The static electricity from clothes alone can cause fires, and it's concentrated, so it's not just a fire, it's an explosion", Kano said.
And if there were more than one container, there was a chance that it would explode and not just burn, but blow up the whole building.
A hazardous materials team was called to an empty office and seized illegal and dangerous materials.
The price of the seized goods and equipment was not immediately disclosed.
The investigators said they received an anonymous piece of information that led to a search warrant for the location of the illegal activity.
Investigators are still searching for the identity of the suspect in the illegal baep.
The police said that the office was empty, so they thought he had a store in the office.
As the investigation continues, the police, especially the recent news about the dangers of beeping, said they would like to prevent illegal beeping products from ever coming out.
Kano's deputy said, "It's a replacement that I bought without even knowing if it's real".
It's possible that the product is mixed with other harmful substances.
It could be very damaging to our communities and to our children, and that's why the police are always warning people not to go near it.
We had a six-magnitude earthquake during the concert.
I'm going to be a little bit more careful.
And we had a practical evacuation training in the Miyagi City Hall, assuming that there was an earthquake during the concert.
This is a yearly training.
On stage, the Miyazaki City Fire Department actually plays a performance, and it's supposed to be a six-magnitude earthquake during the song.
The 27-day training included about 300 preschoolers, community members, and hall staff.
And when the kids are playing,
(In the hall)
"It's an earthquake, it's an earthquake, it's happening.
After that, the fire was believed to have started, and the participants evacuated to the entrance.
We don't know when or where it's going to happen.
And the participants were training to raise awareness of disaster prevention.
The lost dress of Elizabeth I is on display at Hampton Court Palace.
It was made of the finest camel silk, woven with silk threads, and the luxurious embroidery of plants, animals, and butterflies was woven.
The curator of the historic Royal Palace's dress collection, Ellery Lynn, has decided that it's one thing.
This cloth, which Lin saw, was hung on the walls of a small church in a village, and it was placed there 100 years ago, and it was probably part of the clothes that Elizabeth I had lost from her dress dancing.
Three years after Lin accidentally discovered this lavish cloth used as the altar cloth of a church in Bacton, Herefordshire, Elizabeth's lost dress will be displayed next month at Hampton Court Palace, near the exact room that the Tudor queen may have worn over 450 years ago.
And what remains of the 16th-century dress is just another one, and it's one of the most important discoveries in the entire royal dress collection.
Although there is no conclusive evidence that Elizabeth had worn her sleeve, three years of research have increased the expert belief that the dress is not the same as the royal one.
The extremely expensive cloth, "silver threaded cloth", was legally available only to senior members of the royal family, but it also suggests that the "famous" quality of plants and floral embroidery, and later added reindeer, dogs, butterflies, fishermen, bears, and the previous owners were noble figures.
At the time the dress was made, it was probably the price of a Tudor mansion.
Furthermore, it is speculated that in the late 1590s of Elizabeth's reign, the Queen would have been increasingly threatened by other women in the palace, or would have been impatient with rivals wearing such luxurious clothes.
Lin said it was important to publish, so she asked her colleagues to come and see her.
And I was always so happy to see that dress and say, "That's great".
The long second life of a piece of dress that was cut and used as an altar cloth in the invisible Sacred Face Church in Bacton, may seem unexpected, but it's not that much.
Bacton, a village in Branch Parry, where Queen Elizabeth served as a lady-in-waiting throughout her long life, is said to have long been associated with Parry.
Although the dress dates from after 1590 when Parry died, experts believe it must have been presented to her family or church before her death in 1603.
The altar cloth, which has been spent over 1,000 hours of restoration, 400 of which were spent on very delicate hand seams using specially painted silk and a thin surgical needle, will be displayed next to the "Portrait of a Rainbow" by Elizabeth, one of the most acclaimed modern paintings ever loaned from the Hatfield House during the exhibition.
The only space that could hold some of the most expensive tapestries was the renovated greenhouse on Hampton Court, where most of the conservation work was done, and where Libby Thompson, who led the work, said, "I really respect the craftsmanship of the people who made it, because they're handling the historic plaster".
And when you see the embroidery on the face and back, you have a very great respect for the person who made it.
I've never seen such a sophisticated piece before.
The Missing Dresses exhibition of Elizabeth will be held at Hampton Court Palace from 12 October.
"The scope of the request was searched" a week after the missing girl, the Self-Defense Force withdrew the missing volunteer man from the U.T.Y. TV.
It's been a week since a junior high girl went missing in a campsite in the village of Daji, Yamada Prefecture.
The self-defense team has been searching for 28 days and has withdrawn.
The search for the first-year elementary school student, Mikayuki, in the city of Shida, in the prefecture of Chiba, began at 6 a.m. with about 240 people and police and self-defense forces.
But the village called for the self-defense force to withdraw, saying they had "done the search as required".
The Self-Defense Force spent 25 to four days in the middle of the dangerous areas, like the slopes of mountains and the slopes, and they put 650 men in, but they couldn't get a lead.

Police and fire departments will continue their search for 29 days from 6:30 a.m.
The first oral argument by Mr. Miyagi.
The first oral argument in the trial, in which voters demanded the election to be void, was opened and immediately closed at the Fukuoka High Court's Miyagi Branch, as the election to the Senate in July of this year was unconstitutional without a vote gap being corrected.
According to the complaint, the plaintiffs have declared the election void because the elections in July this year, when the number of voters per MP was the lowest in the country, compared to the lowest in Fukui Prefecture, one vote was worth only 0.71 votes in Miyagi Prefecture and 0.48 votes in Kagoshima Prefecture.
In the first oral argument of the 27th day of the Fukuoka High Court in Miyagi, the prosecutor claimed that "one vote for one was worth inequality and unconstitutional".
The defendant's provincial election commission demanded that the motion be dismissed, saying that "there is no significant inequality in the state where the unconstitutional issue arises, but it should be constitutional".
The verdict will be delivered on October 30.
Meetings with contact representatives.
(Left) Professor Xu Mi-yeon, lawyer Kang Xiao, and representative of the Chinese government.
On the 27th, a press conference was held at the Japan Foreign Missionary Association in the Thousand Tacoma area of Tokyo by the Korean Preschool Guards Contact Group for Child Care Freeing.
I met with three of the contact representatives, a lawyer from Kenseng-hwa, and a teacher from the Kenseng-Korean kindergarten.
The representatives of the country's 88 schools, including Korean schools, have been excluded from the exemption system, which will be implemented from October 1, and have called it "unreasonable discrimination".
The stock price of the stock dropped sharply in the morning, according to the Shichikō newspaper.
The average daily share price of the Tokyo stock market fell sharply on the morning of the 27th.
The US stock price was heavier the day before, and the drop was over 300 yen for a while, and it was down for about two weeks during the trading period.
The sales orders for semiconductors were also a factor in the decline.
The morning end value is 268 yen 25 pence, compared to the previous day's end value of 217,79 yen 99 pence.
The stock price index (TOPIX) is 25 to 75 points above 1597 to 52.
The New York market yesterday was alarmed by the political turmoil of the United States over the impeachment of President Trump, and the average of 30 Dow stocks fell and closed their trades.
The Tokyo market of the 27th day has taken on this trend.
Max, the world, the Shanghai Museum of the Child, open.
It's a popular typeface and a good one, for some reason, abroad.
Do you think anyone has a bad LINE stamp or a key holder?
The "Koko Museum", which has been a hot topic since opening in Yokohama and the kitchen, is also expanding abroad.
The Shanghai Museum of Chicken is open to the public in Shanghai and China for a limited period from October 2019 to January 2020.
SHANGHAI's stadium is the largest in history, at 703 square meters, larger than the Yokohama Stadium.
The content is like a national chicken museum, with a large square where tiny chickens pop out of huge objects, volcanoes, a beautiful and sparkling chicken-packed unstagenic area, an unintelligent area where you can see the world's chickens, and an interactive area where you can enjoy the game.
And it seems that people who have noticed this beauty before, and people who think, "What does it mean to be cool?"
You want to enjoy the world of Max-Chick-a-Woy, where you can look at, touch, photograph and play?

The world premiere of the latest truck giga is scheduled for the Tokyo Motor Show 2019.
Kisu-san automobiles will be releasing the latest model of the gigah, a large truck, for the first time in the world at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019, which will be held on the Tokyo Big Site from October 24 to November 4.
The flagship model, the gigah, of the new truck, is a new addition to the latest advanced safety equipment, and the new equipment for reducing fatigue for drivers.
It also helps with the safety of the road with pre-clash brakes that can detect pedestrians and bicycles, blind spot monitors that can help with right-hand-left-handed collision control and lane changes, and variable-speed LED headlamps.
It also helps reduce driver fatigue by providing full-speed, full-speed, multi-wave cruises and new hail-off cabs that follow the front wheels.
In addition, the vehicle operation and dynamic management system "MIMAMORI" also expanded the vehicle conditioning.
The safety equipment will also be monitored and operated safely.
And we're also going to be the world premiere of FL-IR, which is a show model of the future of logistics networks.
FL-IR focuses on the similarities between the ultrasonic conversations, behaviors, and connections, and queues, that we see in fish.
The exterior features a bio-design that gives the shark a more efficient robot image, a contrast between the organic form of the wind-breaking front-shrink cab and the rigid aero devices that cover it.
The interior uses a layer design that replaces the dashboard with manual and automatic driving modes.
The seats are in the center, comfortable to operate and comfortable to live in.
And the world premiere is the next generation of small delivery trucks, the Elf EV Walk Sruvan.
Zero emissions and low noise, of course, is what makes EVs possible, and it also makes it easier to work in a driving environment and work in a group.
The driver's seat is rotating to support the driver's movement inside the car.
It also has a large electronic mirror system that can be used to view the entire vehicle in 3D surroundings.
In addition, Japan will offer the first hybrid hybrid bus, Elgado, jointly developed by Japan, and a small truck, Elf, which has been significantly improved, with the latest diesel 4JZ1 engine, which is both fuel efficient and responsive to emissions regulations.
We also showcase the work support, "PREISM" and "Pleism", and the efforts to build natural gas vehicles through video and panel presentations.
In the family space, we have touch panels that you can see in videos how different trucks are used, and we have photo booths that you can use to be a truck driver.
Drone, we're on our way to the space station, we're catching it with a robotic arm.
The unmanned Aerial Vehicle 8 arrived at the International Space Station.
And the robot arm of the station is stretched out from the bottom left.
The International Space Station is successfully catching the eight-man crew, and they're applauding.
The unmanned supply aircraft "Too-Too" 8, a spacecraft from the International Space Station (JAXA) that carries supplies to an altitude of about 400 kilometers, arrived near the station 28 nights ago, and the astronauts who were staying there manipulated and captured the robot arm.
The refueling aircraft was launched on 25th from the Seeds Island Space Center in Kagoshima Prefecture and gradually advanced under the control of the JAXA Tsukuba Space Center.
And finally, we're going to fly at the same speed as the station, and we're going to lose the speed gap, and we're going to get close to about 10 meters.
It's a 17-foot-long robotic arm that's holding the power supply.
The supply machine is about 5 to 3 tons of supplies.
Once we've got it on the station, the pilots move the luggage.
He was involved in a third of all drug trafficking in the United States.
After the sun came up on Chicago's West Side, CBS News caught a rush hour of drug trafficking.
Brian McKnight of the DEA revealed what was going on around the clock.
Last year, nearly 800 people died of drug overdose in Chicago.
McKnight said that "probably 90 percent of the drugs that are traded in Chicago come from Mexico".
The DEA is focusing on Mexican drug kingpin El Mencho and Nemesio Cervantes.
Mexico-based DEA chief Matthew Donahue said, "Menzo is the top interrogator for the DEA and, in fact, the U.S. federal law enforcement".
The prize money for El Mencho is $10 million.
With Donahue's help, dozens of drug production sites in the El Mencho forest were uncovered.
El Mencho's drug cartel, the Harrisco Nueva Heclation, the CJNG, is involved in at least one third of the drugs being brought into the United States by land and sea.
According to the Justice Department, the cartel has been smuggling a large amount of cocaine, methane, fentanyl and heroin.
El Mencho has a $10 million bounty on his head.
Ironically, Mencho lived in California 30 years ago, but was arrested for drug trafficking and sent back to Mexico.
And that's where I started a violent drug cartel.
They have a huge amount of weapons, rocket launchers, 50 rounds.
Donahue said he actually owns his own special operations unit.
From the shooting down of a Mexican army helicopter that killed six people to his involvement in the public execution this summer, El Mencho has defended his empire with impunity.
There have been thousands of murders in recent years that have led to the drug cartel's crackdown.
According to the Mexican government, there are about 94 murders a day.
In Chicago, seized Mexican drugs are toxic, so they must be protected when they are handled.
At the manufacturing facility, the cocaine bags are marked with the smugglers' mark.
More than a third of them are believed to be from the El Mencho drug cartel.
Donahue said, "Menzo is involved in the flow of toxic substances that are taking the lives of virtually innocent women and children".
So when someone's child dies, it's "high probability", he said, that the drug was brought in from El Mencho's organization.
Last year, more than 67,000 Americans died from overdose.
He was sent to Osaka Tianjin Temple Zoo to breed and go to England, where he borrowed it for 10 years.
The male Koala Ark, which is loaned to the British Zoo for breeding, is 28 days old at the Tianjin Temple Zoo in Osaka.
The kids who write at the Koala Ark's sending party are 28 days away at Osaka's Tian'ang Temple Zoo.
The Tianwang Temple Zoo (Tananwang Temple District, Osaka) held a separate meeting of the only male Koala "Ark" in Osaka on 28th.
We're due to lend a 10-year lease to the British Zoo in mid-October for breeding, and it's unlikely to come back.
"Thank you". "How are you?"
About 600 visitors gathered in front of the lush Koala house of the Yucari greeted her.
Arch is 12.
The life expectancy of a coala under cultivation is 15 to 20 years, which is the average life expectancy in the "crowded" UK.
The head of the breeding group, Mr. Hibon Inaki, 40, cried out, "I can't stop raising the coala.
Sony, PlayStation 4 and Surprise News are coming out, and the PS4 game is going to be the same as it was before.
Sony has revealed the content of the PS4 exclusive The Last of Us Part 2.
As part of the latest State of Play announcement, Sony announced the February 2020 release date for the sequel to Last of Us.
Some of the intense video footage from this new action game was also revealed to fans.
More details are coming a few days after the big news of Rust of Us 2.
Sony and the Nut Dogs seem to be getting back to the way things were.
I've never seen much of the last part of the PS1 since Part 2 came out on multiple discs.
In a wonderful interview with Telegraph, Neil Drakman of Nut Dogs even announced that the sequel had evolved into one of the greatest games ever made.
"In a different way than the previous film, the story is grand and complex", Drakman said.
And I thought that to tell a story with so many characters, I needed to be that big.
I didn't plan to make the greatest game ever, but I evolved to that point.
"The user is excited about how much this story is going to unfold, and there are moments when they feel like this is the end, but they realize that it's actually the beginning, and all the other sections are starting".
The game was so big, it didn't fit into one Blu-ray disc, it became two discs.
And then, in the second part of the Last of Us, you get to see that when you open your desk, you have one or two bad Easter eggs.
I don't want to spoil this surprise, but the Easter eggs in the game have some of the most memorable nutdogs.
If we get the latest installment of Rust of As Part 2 on February 21, 2020, and it's only for PS4, we'll know more.
If you have a PS4, you can pick up the rest of the remastered PS Plus and get ready for the sequel.
Sony recently announced a free PS4 game for PlayStation Plus in October 2019, which includes the previously mentioned Nut Dogs.
MLB The Show 19 will be available to PS Plus members in October.
If you like Rust of As Remastered and want to book a sequel in advance, Sony has already announced multiple versions of the game, including a backpack of popular character Ellie and a replica of the bracelet and a special 12-inch version with a 12 inch figure.
The Canary Islands Travel Sales "Help" Council is trying to keep the residents alive.
With the aging and the decline in shops, the Canad Island community of Seok-ta-shi began to sell their products for 26 days.
In the first day of the trial, which lasted until December, the wagon car carrying daily supplies, cooking ingredients and food, went around Suzhou and Zhipu towns.
And there were more products that sold faster than expected, and people were saying, "It helps", and "it's fun to pick things".
The wagon had 110 items, including all-purpose groceries, city-designated garbage bags, and laundry detergent.
So that even the elderly could eat alone, the total of potato salad and pickles in packs was 100 yen and at an affordable price.
In the town hall, the residents lined up and sold salt and sugar.
The councilwoman, Shimi Min-Luan, said, "I never thought it would sell that much".
The wife of a man who is driving her husband to shop in the town of Nakedoku, Japan, says, "It's cheap and convenient. I don't know how long you can drive, and I want you to keep driving".
Users also received orders to pack coffee, not coffee cans, but coffee drops themselves.
The Council will consider the items that are in demand.
On Canberra, there is only one convenience store where you can buy daily items, and the council tried to sell them on the move to save the "shopping poor".
We'll be looking at whether to continue to run 20 town halls on the island once a month until December.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced that he has decided to provide additional $100 million in aid to the drought-affected population.
The cash support policy for drought-affected farmers will be extended and the existing farmers' compensation will be substantially revised to simplify.
Additional aid will add about $34 million to the drought-hit community aid agency, which will provide farmers with up to $3,000 in emergency assistance.
As part of the drought-affected region aid program, up to 13 municipalities will receive up to $100 million in drought relief funds to help them build infrastructure and address drought-affected areas.
In addition to this additional support, the government has already spent over $7 billion on drought relief.
Ronald Lee Haskell: Accused of murdering his ex-wife's family in Texas
Ronald Lee Haskell, 39, was convicted of murdering Stephen, Katie Staye, and four of their five children in Spring, Texas, in 2014.
Haskell broke into Stay's home on July 9, 2014, asking where his estranged wife, Melanie Haskell, was, officials said.
Melanie was gone, but her sister Katie Stacey and her family were there.
Haskell shot and killed Stephen Stay, 39, Katie Stay, 33, 13 and four-year-old sons, nine and seven-year-old daughters, the Harris County Sheriff's Office said.
Only one of our family, Cassidy Staye, who was 15 at the time, survived.
Authorities reported that Cassidy was seriously injured, but she recovered completely.
On Thursday, the jury unanimously rejected Ronald Lee Haskell's claim of innocence for the loss of his mind.
The jury was dismissed until Monday's sentencing hearing.
"If we make a choice that disappoints us, we will never forgive".
Did the young woman's cry, which shook her voice to anger, strike the leaders of the nations?
Global warming is going to get worse.
At the United Nations Climate Action Summit in New York, 16-year-old Swedish environmental activist Greta Tumbery spoke in a call for more action.
Boycotting classes and sitting in front of Congress was a catalyst for the worldwide school strike.
Young people who raised concerns and protests took part in a joint protest across the world, including Japan.
It's estimated that about four million people in more than 150 countries took part.
I marched in Osaka with a message board.
The threat of climate change is imminent.
The Paris Agreement, an international framework that will begin in 2020, aims to virtually zero global greenhouse gas emissions by the end of this century, and to reduce pre-industrial climate change temperatures to less than two degrees, or, if possible, to one to five degrees.
We're going to take action on the basis of each country, without any distinction between developed and developing countries.
But the unusual weather patterns that are associated with warming, such as high temperatures and heavy rain, are everywhere.
We need to do more to address the rapidly growing warming.
At the summit, which was called by UN Secretary-General Guterres to strengthen the sense of crisis, 77 countries have set a long-term goal of virtually zero by 50.
The other 70 countries have agreed to raise their targets.
On the other hand, apart from the United States, which has announced its withdrawal from the Paris Agreement, China and India have not made clear their new goals, and the slow pace of the emission countries has become a prominent feature.
There is also strong criticism of Japan's insistence on coal-fired power.
The government's long-term strategy is to set as early as possible a zero emission target for the second half of this century, but there's a huge gap between countries that are aiming for 50 years of zero.
Japan never had a chance to speak at the summit.
At an environmental meeting, Minister of Environment, Dr. Shizoku, who presented Japan's efforts to address climate change, said that "we should be fun, cool, and sexy".
I can't deny the appeal, but it's too weak compared to the girls' claims.
I'm not going to stop protesting against Gretha, who is now a symbol of the environmental movement.
The injuries that are beyond debate are nothing more than the "change of arguments" that you object to.
We must no longer delay in tackling global warming, and the international community must be united in our response to the common human crisis.
We have a problem with the country's efforts, and we don't want them to be effective enough.
There are a lot of young people and children behind Greta.
We're adults who should be acting to prevent that from happening.
And this is another step toward the quantum internet.
The U.S. Army's research has brought us one step closer to the quantum internet.
This Internet could provide military security, measurement and monitoring capabilities that were impossible for traditional networks.
According to the United States Army Combat Ability Development Center, a distributed quantum information center funded and operated by the Army Research Institute, researchers at Innsbruck University have achieved a record of quantum interaction transport between matter and light -- using fiber optic cables at a distance of 50 kilometers.
An entanglement is a relation between quantum entities such as quantum bits.
If two quantum bits are in an entangled state, and the measurement is done on one side, even if the other quantum bit is physically far away, the measurement results on the other side are affected.
"This distance is two digits larger than it was in the past, and it's a realistic distance to start building inter-city quantum networks", says Dr. Ben Ranion, an experimental physicist at the University of Innsbruck who has published his findings in the journal Nature Quantum Information.
Inter-urban quantum networks are networks of physical quantum bits that are entangled, even though they are at great distances.
The researchers say that the dispersion of this environment is absolutely essential for the establishment of the quantum internet.
"This is a big step toward a large-scale decentralized environment", says Dr. Sarah Gamble, deputy executive director of the Army Program to support the research.
And the entanglements in the fiber-crossing output are also good enough to meet a number of the requirements for some of the most difficult quantum networking applications.
The team started experimenting with calcium atoms captured by ion traps.
The researchers used laser beams to write quantum states on the ion and simultaneously stimulate it to release quantum information.
And so the quantum state of the atom and the photoparticle are entangled.
The challenge is to send the photons through fiber optic cables.
"The wavelength of the photons emitted from the calcium ion is 854 nanometers, and they're absorbed by the fiber optic cable immediately", says Dr. Raniong.
So the team of doctors first sent the light particles through nonlinear crystals that radiated a strong laser.
The wavelength of the photons, the optimal value for long-distance transmission -- which is the standard wavelength of current long-distance communication -- was converted to 1550 nanometers.
And then we sent this photon through a 50 kilometre long fiber optic cable.
The measurements showed that even though the wavelengths were changed and the wavelengths moved long distances, the atoms and the photons remained entangled.
"We used calcium atoms to capture high-quality clock quantum bits at the same time, because this experiment resulted in the creation of a network of entangled long-range atomic clocks.
Large-scale entangled clock networks are very important for the military in terms of precise positioning, navigation, and time applications", said another Army researcher, Dr. Frederick Fatemi, who co-led the program.
