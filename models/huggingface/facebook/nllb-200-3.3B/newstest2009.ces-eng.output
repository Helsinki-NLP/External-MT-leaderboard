The Prague Stock Exchange has plunged to a negative at the close of trading.
After the morning crash, the Prague Stock Exchange corrected its losses.
The transactions in ČEZ shares amounted to almost half of the normal daily trading.
The Prague stock market has continued its Monday slump since trading began on Tuesday, dropping nearly six percent.
This time, the reason for the decline is the Wall Street stock market crash.
This is also the market reaction to the outcome of the US House of Representatives' vote to reject the plan to stabilize the US financial sector.
The fall of Asian stocks
Asian stocks fell dramatically on Tuesday, although indexes eventually erased some of the losses during the day.
The Hang Seng Hong Kong stock exchange index lost almost 4 percent during trading, but later erased some of the losses and reduced the decline to about 2.5 percent.
Hang Seng China Enterprises, which tracks Chinese stocks on the Hong Kong stock exchange, fell 3.8 percent, with the markets in Shanghai closed.
The Sydney stock market lost more than five percent, but eventually the losses were reduced to 4.3 percent.
The Taiwan stock market, according to the Taiwan Stock Exchange, fell 3.6 percent.
"The timing of the US bailout is uncertain and will affect financial markets around the world", noted Hong Kong Monetary Authority Chief Joseph Yam.
Hong Kong, although part of China, has a separate monetary policy, independent of the Chinese central bank.
Hong Kong has interest rates on par with the United States.
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd says U.S. lawmakers should return to the table as soon as possible to approve the financial system bailout.
Otherwise, they say, the impact could be felt in other countries.
The bloodbath of American stocks
The U.S. House of Representatives on Monday rejected a plan to boost the financial system, which would have cost up to $700 billion.
The lawmakers ignored President George Bush's call to support the plan.
According to Bush, the plan would address the root causes of the financial crisis and help stabilize the entire economy.
U.S. stocks experienced a bloodbath Monday, and major stock indexes recorded their biggest plunge in over 20 years.
The Dow Jones fell nearly seven percent, the last time it fell that far in 1987.
The index was already down before the vote, but once it was revealed that the bill had failed in the House, the index was in free fall.
Congress has backed down: the U.S. government can pump $700 billion into the banks
The top leaders of the U.S. Congress and the administration of President George W. Bush have agreed to a broad-based bailout of the U.S. financial system.
The vote on it will be early next week.
U.S. lawmakers have made a breakthrough in talks to approve a $700 billion bailout for the U.S. financial system.
But it's not over yet.
Congress has to finalize some of the details of the agreement before it can publish the final version of the bill and vote on it.
The financial system bailout plan will be debated on the floor of the House of Representatives on Monday.
This was told to Reuters by the chairman of the House Banking and Financial Services Committee, Barney Frank, on Sunday.
The Senate is expected to vote on the plan as early as Wednesday, according to sources.
According to economists, the announcement that a bailout is coming should be the first major psychological factor for financial markets to recover.
But then there is the "sobriety" due to the complexity of the mechanisms that help markets to reach the ground.
The plan must be effective.
"We have made great progress.
We have resolved our differences over what the market stabilization package should look like", said Democrat Nancy Pelosi, speaking to Bloomberg.
She thinks the final vote could be on Sunday.
Representatives of the legislators met Sunday night with U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to finalize the government fund.
The central bank should buy back from the financial companies the unsold mortgage assets that are dragging financial firms into heavy losses and threatening the stability of the entire system.
"We are on the verge of a final agreement on a plan that will work and must also be effective in the market.
We have to continue with the recovery plan, but I think we're there", Paulson said.
Signal for Asian trading
The global financial crisis is having a major impact on stock markets, which are plunging.
According to Nevada Democratic Senator Harry Reid, lawmakers are trying to get a final deal in Congress by Sunday.
The move is intended to reassure investors about trading in Asian financial markets, which are the first in the time zone where a congressional decision could affect Monday's trading.
It is not clear when the bill will be voted on by both houses of Congress, or whether it can be tied up at the last minute.
Lawmakers hope to pass it in the next few days.
But the law is still going through a series of changes.
The total amount allocated to the scheme is to be divided into two parts.
The initial $350 billion is to be made available as soon as possible, as President George Bush has requested.
But Congress can block the release of the remaining amount if it feels the program is not fulfilling its function, in the order of the next $100 billion and then the final $350 billion.
Bush praised the progress in the negotiations
The president can veto this decision, but Congress can override his veto.
But despite these changes, the basic idea of the program, which was to raise funds to buy back bad mortgage securities whose value had plummeted because hundreds of thousands of Americans were unable to pay their mortgages, remained intact.
"We worked it all out.
The House of Representatives should be able to vote on the bill on Sunday and the Senate on Monday", said Republican Senator Judd Gregg.
President Bush is pleased with the progress of the negotiations.
His spokesman, Tony Fratto, said Bush was pleased with Saturday's progress and appreciated "the two-way effort to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy".
Limitations on the use of golden parachutes
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd, the lead negotiator, said lawmakers agreed on accountability for the money program, protecting taxpayers from losses, closing relief, timing the funding of the plan.
The new law also restricts the so-called golden parachutes for the corporate directors participating in the program and establishes a committee to oversee the fund.
He should be running the Treasury.
"We've worked very hard and we've made great progress toward an agreement that will work and will be useful to the market and to all Americans", Paulson said.
The plan also provides for help for homeowners who have repayment problems.
The government should negotiate new installments on the mortgages it buys, in order to reduce the monthly installment costs for borrowers and allow them to keep their homes.
- Psychological support
The plan proposed by Patria Finance's chief economist David Mark is a good idea, but it will be very difficult to implement.
'This is because it is not known by what mechanism and at what price the problematic assets will be bought back.
This will determine how the financial sector and the government will share the losses", Marek told iHNed.cz this week.
Whether the plan is approved now or early next week, Mark doesn't think it's that important.
"Much more important, this week, congressmen agree to support this plan and to sanction it as soon as possible.
The psychological significance of the agreement that there will be approval is the most important thing at the moment", Marek stressed.
A knife fight: MP3 players against cell phones.
We'll figure out how to pick
While almost every cell phone can play MP3 files, no MP3 player can make a phone call.
So it seems obvious that it's better to just buy a phone.
Still, there are good reasons for buying a portable record player.
The choice is entirely dependent on the use and requirements of the future owner.
It's hard to buy a high-end, high-priced gramophone to play the latest album, Maxim Turbulenc.
On the one hand, such musical products do not appear on LP discs and there is no objective qualitative reason for this.
But if you have art rock, jazz, or blues vinyl on your shelves, you probably have at least one of these.
It's the same with music on the road, which is compressed music, or, in simpler terms, MP3 music.
There are price and quality categories here too.
For some, spending $8,000 on a turntable may be unacceptable, just as a Pink Floyd fan might find it hard to buy a $20 headset from the market.
Two extremes, with plenty of room for everyone in between.
There's a wide range.
It also determines the battery life.
Some of the top music players can do a lot more than just play music, but what most cell phones can't do.
No modern device is as universal as the telephone.
Besides basic functions like calling and texting, it can play music and video, record both, has a better-or-worse-camera, and it may even be able to navigate.
And if you take into account smartphones and communicators, you'll have a small computer in your pocket.
It's a small miracle, because no refrigerator can grill and no television can photograph anything.
The universality of mobile has its disadvantages.
The more features you use on your phone, the sooner the indicator on the display will send you to the charger.
And playing music is one of the biggest energy drainers.
Few cell phones can play music for more than ten to twelve hours, most are much less.
In this regard, music players (especially the simplest ones) are considerably more powerful.
So expect to get a few hours of low-cost cell phone playback.
If you have to make occasional calls, get a spare charger at work - even for expensive devices.
You won't have this problem with MP3 players, even the worst ones, that last at least 9 hours of continuous operation on a single charge.
Another problem is the recording of music into a mobile phone.
Unfortunately, only a limited number of devices have a USB all-purpose connector, and not all of them can be directly connected to a computer without special software.
Of course, music can be recorded directly to a memory card, but few card readers can handle the miniature memory cards used in mobile phones without reducing the amount.
With the exception of the iPod, you don't need any special software.
Just load the device with music from a USB drive on a computer.
Most mobile phones and players will already have their own music library sorted by artist name, album name, genre or perhaps user rating.
Some devices display only a directory tree structure similar to Explorer in Windows and some can do both (river, Samsung, Sony, Cowon, smartphones with operating system).
Players are easier to use, mobiles are more efficient
When choosing a specific device, consider in particular the battery life, the memory capacity, the quality and type of the audio output and, of course, the comfort of the control.
If music is your backdrop and you listen to it every day for a short time on the tram, you can use any mobile phone that plays MP3s.
Which almost any mobile phone can do.
You don't have to pay much attention to the music formats of your phone or your music player.
MP3s will handle all of it, and the vast majority of the music that you'll get will be in that format.
It's one of the most widely used formats, and most other devices can handle music in WMA format.
Less common is AAC (the format used by Apple and its iPods).
Better mobile phones also make it possible to buy music online, for example.
Simply visit the mobile operator's (or other provider's) website and purchase the song or album.
This service in itself could be a valid argument for the purchase of a music mobile.
Unfortunately, the operators' offerings are pathetic and mostly limited to fast-paced radio hits.
The prices aren't the lowest either.
However, it is generally assumed that this way of selling music (whether via GSM, the Internet or wireless Internet) will dominate the music industry in the future.
Most people carry their phones with them all the time.
Whenever you feel like listening to something, you reach for your phone while your MP3 player is lying at home.
It depends on whether you also always carry headphones or at least a wired handsfree.
If not, you can use the built-in speaker that almost every phone has, but only the bare minimum of MP3 players.
Perhaps the greatest benefit of the music cell phone will be for many a price.
The cheapest ones are usually under three grand.
For three or four thousand crowns you can buy a very decent Walkman.
But mostly, you'll be limited to no output on a regular headset.
The best and most technically advanced phones, even with a 3.5 mm headphone jack, cost up to 15,000.
The advantage of the recorder is, among other things, ease of use.
The simplest - not necessarily the cheapest (see our selection) - players can be operated by anyone.
The minimal features, the similarity of the control with a previously common cassette player or perhaps a gramophone is obvious.
There's no collision in the form of a mistakenly-activated mobile Internet and a subsequent giant data bill.
What device to touch
Even the cheapest mobile phones (e.g. Vodafone 527) usually have a slot for removable memory cards (type M2, microSD, etc.).
Even with the purchase of the relevant card, you can fit in two thousand crowns.
But be careful.
For basic models, only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 GB are supported.
Only the most expensive ones can handle 8GB of memory.
If you already have a mobile phone and want to buy a cheap MP3 player, reach out to Cowboys, Creatives, Sony, Samsung, Emgetton or Iriver.
Depending on the capacity (max. 2 GB) you don't need to spend more than 1 100 CZK.
If you are a more demanding listener, you may want to use a specialized mobile phone - a walkmane (Sony Ericsson, some Nokia and Samsung).
These devices have separate MP3 buttons, and the user experience is similar to that of a separate MP3 player.
Next in line is Sony Ericsson, whose Walkman-series phones have identical user interfaces as the MP3 players sold separately.
The same service and in the same price range up to four thousand crowns, but with a larger memory capacity (up to 16 GB) and battery life (usually 15 hours, up to 35 hours at most), you will be taken by MP3 players from the brands mentioned above.
The first virtual operator will arrive in the Czech Republic this year.
Maybe you are .
The mobile market in the Czech Republic is quite developed and our operators offer virtually all the services as their Western European partners.
Still, we're missing something here - a virtual operator that would make the classic ones go cheap.
He may not be gone for long.
We have written many times on Mobil.cz that Czech operators are among the most expensive in Europe.
This was also confirmed by the CTA, which pointed out that the price of SMS in the Czech Republic is higher than in the rest of the Union.
After the European Commission's latest steps to regulate roaming charges, a paradox may emerge - for some customers of Czech mobile operators, SMS from abroad will be cheaper than at home.
How is it possible that prices in the Czech Republic are so high compared to Europe?
The answer is simple, there's no competition that really wants to fight.
It may seem paradoxical, but we have three mobile networks and a penetration rate of over 100 percent.
Mobile operators, on the other hand, like to play on the fact that the Czech market is extremely competitive.
The chairman of the Czech Telecommunications Authority (ČTÚ) Pavel Dvořák has often said that there is no place for another operator in the Czech Republic.
It is probably true that a traditional operator with its own network probably has little chance (after all, it would probably be difficult to find frequencies).
But there is another option - a virtual operator.
The entry of virtual operators into the mobile market brought significant price reductions, which the traditional operators had to accept.
And before the likes of Tesco Mobile and Virgin Mobile came on the market, the voices in the UK were very similar to the voices in the UK.
But it turns out that there is a place for these operators, and they can be really successful.
And we don't have to go too far to find examples.
In February of this year, we informed you about the launch of the virtual operator Mobilking in Poland.
In just six months, the operator managed to attract more than 100,000 customers and become the fifth largest operator in the country.
Mobilking is backed by the Penta financial group, which owns U:fona in the Czech Republic, among others.
The advantage of virtual operators is the ability to focus on a much more specific target group.
In order to operate effectively, they need far fewer customers than a traditional operator.
They do not entail the relatively high costs of building, operating and maintaining a mobile network.
In a world like this, virtual operators usually profile themselves as low-cost - offering cheap calls and SMS, but this is often balanced by a narrower range of services.
For example, Tesco Mobile in the UK offers SMS at at least half the price of its competitors.
But as the Mobilking case in Poland shows, it can be a good bet to target an untrained audience.
This operator is targeting men specifically.
"The right guys are choosing Mobilking - a carrier they like and trust", says David Seibertz, CEO of Mobile Entertainment Company, which operates the virtual carrier.
It's hard to say if a similar concept as in Poland could be applied here.
Vodafone spokesman Miroslav Čepický doubts this: 'The Czech market is relatively small for the segment approach on which most virtual operators are based.
Moreover, it is relatively saturated in terms of the range of services offered.'
In the Czech Republic, no chance, say the mobile operators
It seems almost certain that if there is a virtual mobile operator in the Czech Republic, it will not be Mobilking.
"We are talking about expanding this successful project, but the negotiations in the Czech Republic are not looking very promising.
Rather, Mobilking will be launched in other countries in our region", Jana Studničková, spokeswoman for the Penta financial group, said in a telephone interview with Mobil.cz.
It thus indirectly confirmed that the existing mobile operators in the Czech Republic were not in favour of this idea.
Rather, they are doing everything they can to prevent any potential competitor from emerging.
GTS Novera has been open about its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator for some time, as it wants to take another step towards becoming a real competitor of Telefónica O2 in the field of corporate customers.
'We are keen to be able to offer our customers not only fixed but also mobile telecommunications services.
The sooner the better.
We have repeatedly discussed this possibility with all Czech mobile operators.
We have already made progress with some of them", says Pavel Kaidl, the group's spokesman.
Maybe it's just a flash for a better time.
From unofficial information, we should expect to see the first virtual operator before the end of the year.
For now, its creation is accompanied by an impenetrable wall of silence.
'At the moment we do not think there is room for a full-fledged virtual operator on the Czech market.
The Czech market is very specific compared to other markets.
So far, we have not been approached by any entity with a complex and serious project in this area,' Vlastimil Sršň from Telefónica O2's press department told Mobil.cz.
Other operators also refer to the specificity of the Czech market.
T-Mobile spokeswoman Martina Kemrová adds in rare agreement with O2: "So far we have not seen any viable and mutually beneficial business project on which to build".
He adds: "It's unlikely that any virtual operator will appear on the T-Mobile network by the end of the year.
We would have to have a concrete agreement on the table at this point to be able to think in this short timeframe".
Vodafone is focusing on meeting the requirements of its own 3G licence.
Miroslav Čepický said: 'We are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators, especially in the area of cost sharing and infrastructure.
That's what we consider the most profitable from a customer's point of view.
Vodafone's main strategy in this area is to find a partner to build a shared network for high-speed mobile internet.'
Responsible authorities - with operators on hand
The Commission considers that the measure is compatible with the common market in so far as it is compatible with the internal market.
So why facilitate the entry of such a competitor?
The fact that operators can pull together when they need to is also evidenced by the debate surrounding the creation of the U:phone.
Perhaps the biggest push towards the CTU came with the emergence of U-phone from T-Mobile.
This is evidenced by publicly available information on the OCT website.
But now, U:fon is the perfect argument for not allowing a virtual operator.
Martina Kemr added: 'The competitive environment in the mobile market has been recently strengthened by the entry of the fourth mobile operator.
Given the nature of the mobile market in the Czech Republic, it is clear that the entry of another player would place high demands on it and, in particular, on its services.'
Given this approach of mobile operators, it is striking that the Czech regulators are completely uninterested.
It is not just the position of the CTU, which unfortunately in the Czech Republic - unlike the UK and other developed countries - does not have the power to interfere with competition.
These are the exclusive responsibility of the Competition Authority (the OOHS).
But he took his typical attitude to the whole issue.
'The entry of a virtual operator into the mobile market would be possible after the conclusion of a contract between the mobile operator and the virtual operator for the rental of the necessary infrastructure.
No such contract has been concluded so far, as the offer of potential interested parties was probably not sufficiently interesting for the traditional operators,' said Kristián Chalupa from the External Relations Department of the OHCHR in response to our inquiry.
The representatives of the operators are not surprised by such statements.
It is more than a duty for an authority which is supposed to represent consumers' interests and, among other things, to ensure that no one abuses his position on the market.
In particular, Kristián Chalupa adds: 'In foreign countries, where virtual operators are common, we can observe that their entry into the market has contributed to the reduction of prices for mobile telephone services.'
But apparently the pressure to have the market function properly and the price drop is not in the interests of the OOHS.
What is truly shocking about this case is the touching convergence of the three mobile operators, as reflected in their reactions.
The question of whether it's really just a coincidence is entirely self-evident.
Just as the exact same price of gasoline at gas stations is surely a matter of chance and fierce competition.
"The Authority has not found any evidence of anti-competitive conduct in this matter and therefore has no reason to intervene in any way.
None of the operators has a dominant position and therefore does not have correspondingly increased responsibility for its behaviour on the market.
The tools needed to open the mobile market to virtual operators are also likely to be lacking for the telecoms regulator", Chalupa said in his statement.
The interpretation of a dominant position is one of many points of dispute.
There is, of course, an analysis of the relevant markets by the OCTs, according to which telecommunications is a single market from a competition point of view.
Of course, none of the Czech operators has a dominant position on such a market.
However, some legal experts suggest that the creation of a virtual operator always requires the consent of the network operator.
And the mobile operator -- quite logically -- has a monopoly on its network.
So it's bound to be dominant in a certain segment.
Even if we reject this argument, it should at least be alarming for OOHS that the three mobile operators are behaving in a strikingly similar way.
However, the complaints of a number of interested parties (including GTS Novera) show that they face very similar obstacles when dealing with all operators.
The imposition of liability on the CTU is a fairly common trick in telecommunications, which the ODNI takes its hands off the matter.
We've met him on a number of similar occasions.
Unfortunately, until the recently adopted amendment to the Telecommunications Act, the extension of the CTU's powers to the area of competition in telecommunications had not succeeded in being enforced, although many experts had promised that this would improve the situation.
The OHS representatives must know this more than well, but their interests are clearly elsewhere.
It's the way it goes when no one's looking
However, the operation of pseudo-virtual operators, of which there are several in Czech mobile networks, remains unnoticed.
These are companies that publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services, but which are only partially public.
These are usually multi-level marketing companies.
The own mobile telephone services are offered by Amway, Bohemia Telecom, Starlife and many others.
The prices of these companies are usually only available to a select few.
The magic is that the company acts as a typical business customer to the operator, who orders a large number of SIM cards.
As a major customer, it receives special pricing (and other) offers.
The problem is that the commercial terms of all Czech mobile operators prohibit such resale.
"If the cases you are talking about were to occur, they could be breaches of contract terms that we would be dealing with and could result in termination of cooperation with the company", Martina Kemrová answered our question on this issue.
But it's very unlikely that this kind of activity would not have been passed on to the responsible people from the mobile operators.
Especially in the case of the three companies mentioned, thousands of customers could be affected.
None of the operators is preventing such a procedure.
The fact that these companies make substantial profits does not mean that they are threatened by their own official marketing, unlike the real virtual operators.
Miroslav Čepický points out the potential problems: "The law allows for such speculation, but only a negligible percentage of customers use the services of these companies.
Moreover, they must accept that the SIM card in their phone is not in their name and cannot be used fully as a normal mobile operator customer.'
But that's what should be the least bit weird.
In addition, it opens up another question for the OHS.
If mobile operators are turning a blind eye to a similar practice, why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator?
It should be added that the OHIM has a relatively strong authority to detect such activity and, if it does not wish to, it does not have to be satisfied with the explanation of the operators that they have no knowledge of such activity and that their business conditions prohibit it.
When we're not the most expensive
As has been mentioned several times in the text, the entry of virtual operators into the mobile market has led to a marked decrease in the price of services.
In practice, however, in all countries where virtual operators have emerged, the traditional operators have tried to prevent their emergence to a greater or lesser extent.
The arguments used by them were virtually identical - too small, too saturated market, quality of service problems, etc.
But in developed countries, it was at these moments that regulatory agencies stepped in, not to protect the interests of the mobile operators, but to protect the interests of their customers.
Whether through formal measures or informal pressure, they have succeeded in creating the first virtual operator and have been joined by others.
Unfortunately, the Czech regulatory authorities are throwing this whole thing around like a hot potato.
In our experience, we can't help but feel that a lack of clarity in the powers of the Commission is more than adequate in these cases.
But let's not throw the gun at the man.
If the behind-the-scenes information is correct and a virtual operator appears in our country soon, the Czech mobile market may be moving again.
If one of the operators has allowed the creation of a virtual mobile operator, the OHIM will hardly be able to remain indifferent to the rejection (discrimination) of other applicants.
And maybe we'll stop calling it "the other day" than the rest of Europe.
The new Czech anthem has four new versions.
Choose the Best
Listen to four renditions of the new version of the Czech national anthem.
On Sunday, Prime Minister Mirek Topolánek, on the occasion of the Czech Republic's National Day, officially released a new recording of the national anthem, Where Is My Home?
The anthem was newly recorded by the orchestra of the National Theatre under the direction of Jiří Bělohlávek.
There are four versions - with male or female solo singing, in choral presentation and instrumental version.
The song was sung by Kateřina Kněžínková and Adam Plachetka.
The authors of the adaptation of the anthem are Otakar Jeremáš and Jaroslav Krček.
You can listen to all four versions on the iHNed.cz server.
Bělohlávek considers the Czech national anthem to be one of the most beautiful hymns.
He had previously told Czech Radio that he had deliberately chosen singers with young representative voices who were distinct and popular to sing solo variants.
"From the beginning, I tried to make sure that both of them and the congregation had clear diction, that the text was well understood, that they were in agreement", he said.
The Czech national anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year.
The song "Kde domov můj" was first heard in 1834 on the stages of the Stavovsky Theatre in the original Czech play Fidlovačka by Josef Kajetan Tyla, supplemented by the music of František Škroupa.
It gained popularity and people spontaneously embraced it.
The first verse of the song became a natural part of the national anthem after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918.
It remained one of the seven state symbols even after the formation of the independent Czech Republic.
What is the "new" hymn
The Prague MHD is on a chip for the first time on Wednesday.
Wednesday, October 1, 2008 will go down in the history of the Prague Transport Company as the date when the first passengers will board the metro, tram and buses with an electronic ticket in their pocket instead of a paper ticket.
At this point, it's available to about 100,000 people who have an Opencard chip.
Passengers can buy a 30-day and 90-day and annual voucher (valid from 1 January 2009) and have it charged to their chip card at the infocenters and offices of the Transport Company at the Museum, Mostek, Nádraží Holešovice, Anděl, Roztyly, Letňany, Kobylisy, Rajská zahrada, Kačerov and Luka metro stations.
The tickets can be bought online from the website of the Transport Company www.dpp.cz.
Over 400 customers used the afternoon service.
Those who start using the Internet can forget about the ticket boxes at the subway stations, where they have to stand in long lines for paper tickets.
The voucher is purchased online and the Opencard is used to deposit it in one of the 13 branches of the Municipal Library.
"At these locations, a lounge with trained staff is available to passengers to help them with online shopping and also to charge their card with a coupon", said Martin Opatrný, spokesman for the project.
In addition to libraries, it will also be possible to download electronic Opencard vouchers from self-service machines installed in several subway halls.
What do these vending machines look like?
They are red, like the ticket markers, and passengers may have noticed them at the Roztyly, Budějovická, I. P. Pavlova, Florenc and Vltavská metro stations.
"There are five now in the city, but by the end of the year there should be eighty", added Careful.
The coupon checks the driver's seat.
The automated machines that start tomorrow are easy to operate.
All you have to do is insert an Opencard chip card into them, and the previously paid-up coupon will load itself onto the card.
Electronic coupons are valid from tomorrow not only in the capital but also in the surrounding area.
So in the commuter trains and bus lines with the number 300 to 499, which travel to the capital mainly the inhabitants of the central Bohemian municipalities.
'In the trains that are part of Prague's integrated transport system, the train attendants are equipped with ticket readers to check the validity of the tickets, both for the time and the zone,' explained ticket controller Filip Drápal from Ropid, the organisation that compiles Prague's public transport timetables.
Suburban buses have card readers built into the driver's cab.
When boarding, therefore, it is not only necessary to show the smart card to the driver, but also to attach the Opencard to a designated place on the side of the cash register.
This will allow the driver to check the validity of the coupons.
"If a passenger needs to check the validity of recorded vouchers, there is nothing easier than asking the driver for this information", Drápal added.
Passengers who do not use the suburban buses and who do not remember when their voucher expires can go back to the self-service machines where vouchers are loaded onto the card.
Here, the validity of their documents is displayed on the display of the machine.
Sudetenland wanted a referendum after the US
In 1945, the Sudeten Germans asked for the incorporation of Šumava into the United States.
It's from a letter that's in the South Bohemian Science Library.
If we can't be part of Germany or Austria, we want to live under the patronage of the United States of America.
It was with this desire that some groups of Sudeten Germans reportedly turned to the president of the United States in 1945.
This is apparent, among other things, from a letter that was preserved in a private archive and is now in the collections of the South Bohemian Scientific Library.
The Germans from Český Krumlov are asking in a letter to the American president not to allow the return of the "Shumava County" - seized by Hitler under the Munich Agreement - back to Czechoslovakia.
"We have understood the situation correctly and we want to be really sure in words that American troops are coming to German territory not as oppressors and enemies, but as liberators", the letter, signed "People who have the fate of the Shumawi at heart", reads.
Because the annexation of Czechoslovakia gives the Sudeten Germans - knowing the Czech national nature - only hope for brutality, ruthlessness, incomprehension, oppression and slavery, the authors of the letter ask the American president to take over the protectorate of Šumava for the present and eternal times.
"We cannot believe that you would, regardless of the opinion of a quarter of a million inhabitants, grant this territory to some foreign state which oppresses and excludes minorities and by no means contributes to the victory of the Allies", the letter says.
The reason why authors cannot sign is allegedly fear of the vengeful "Czech oppressors".
If the US president had doubts about the mindset of the Shumawi Germans, it would have been enough for him to hold a referendum in Shumawi County on whether its residents wanted to become part of the US or live under the patronage of the United States.
Although the letter's text may sound a bit naive in today's postwar history, some historians say it aptly reflects the expectations of the Sudeten Germans at the time.
Although the Czech Germans had at least a hint that they would be expelled from the republic, few of them even considered such a possibility.
Some expected the United States and Great Britain to negotiate some kind of autonomy for the Sudeten.
Others believed they would simply stay in Czechoslovakia.
This is confirmed by the famous Austrian journalist Gustav Chalupa, who was born in České Budějovice.
He was a German construction worker assigned to the Baltic Fleet during the war.
When he was captured by the British at the end of the war and placed in a prison camp in Holstein, dozens of other Czech Germans came to him to learn Czech.
"They believed that when they returned home, they would need the Czech language", Chalupa said.
According to him, none of the German prisoners living in Czechoslovakia before the war expected to be expelled from the republic on the basis of Beneš' decrees.
You don't think - you will pay!
The emotional campaign will attack the drivers
The most expensive event focused on road safety in Czech history.
That's the way to describe the emotional media campaign the Ministry of Transport is planning to launch on Wednesday.
The office of Minister Aleš Řebíček promises to discourage drivers from dangerous behaviour behind the wheel.
The $ 150 million campaign will be on TV, radio, movies, the Internet, and on the flyers.
It should discourage drivers from speeding and drinking.
And also to remind them to make a commitment before they leave.
It wants to appeal to the consciences of young drivers, motorists, pedestrians and, last but not least, professional drivers.
And what's in the spout?
Mostly human stories that attack the emotions.
And the "bloody" slogan of the campaign is a testament to that:
You don't think - you pay!
The word "don't think" is written in capital letters on the specimen.
And then in the blood pool is the word "you will pay".
It is a symbol of the fact that a person can pay with his life for a moment of inattention.
The viewers will be able to "scare" until 2010.
The Ministry was inspired by similar campaigns in Anglo-Saxon countries, where it is common to see images of drastic images of accident victims.
He promises to reduce the number of accidents and deaths on Czech roads.
The spots were prepared by Euro RSCG.
Sugar and whip for the driver
"The drivers are paid by the sugar and whips system.
The trick to them is that if they turn red, for example, it saves time.
A whip is a threat of a fine or an accident.
Drivers need to be reminded of the risks", says Martin Kořán, a traffic psychologist at Na Homolce Hospital.
That's why there's a need for press campaigns and especially negative advertising, says a psychologist.
He said that the signs that alert drivers to danger are no longer as effective.
"If a static warning sign is installed, it will probably soon blend with the surroundings and drive without the driver's attention", warned Korán.
Olmert would return almost all of the occupied territories in exchange for peace.
The interim Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has called for the return of virtually all of the territories occupied in 1967, including the West Bank, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, in exchange for peace with the Palestinians and Syria.
He did so in an interview published Monday in the Jediot Achronot.
"We must reach an agreement with the Palestinians, which means that almost all the (occupied) territories, if not all of them, will have to be returned", Olmert told the newspaper.
"We will keep a certain percentage of these territories, but we will have to give the Palestinians a similar percentage (of Israeli territory), because without that there will be no peace", he added.
He agreed that the eventual return would include East Jerusalem.
"Whoever wants security in Jerusalem and especially doesn't want to have his legs crossed by tractors or bulldozers, as happened to one of my best friends, will have to give up parts of Jerusalem", Olmert noted, referring to two attacks in the city in July, in which several people were killed and dozens injured.
According to the prime minister, "a special solution will have to be found for the Temple Mount, a sacred and historic site", which lies within the Old City.
"Whoever wants to maintain Israeli sovereignty over the entire city will have to integrate 270,000 Arabs.
It won't work", he stressed.
Departure from the Golan Heights
Olmert also spoke out in favour of Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which he said was an essential condition for a peace agreement with Syria.
But that would also require some effort on the part of Damascus.
"I am not proposing to make peace with Syria on the basis of leaving the Golan alone", he warned.
"The Syrians know well what they will have to give up to get the Golan.
They will have to give up their current relationship with Iran; they will have to give up their relationship with Hezbollah; they will have to give up their continued support for the terrorism of Hamas, Al-Qaeda and jihad in Iraq", he said.
Questions after the accident: are bus stewards illegal?
The law is unknown, walking on a long-distance bus is not allowed
In the wake of the tragic accident of a Student Agency bus near Padua, Italy, the question arose as to whether flight attendants and passengers could travel on the bus during its journey.
"If we want to strictly and formally comply with the law, the steward's activity is in contradiction with the law on road traffic", says Karel Hanzelka, a spokesman for the Ministry of Transport.
The accident that killed a 22-year-old flight attendant last week was apparently caused by a truck driver who ran a bus into the road.
At the time, the girl was unfortunately sitting next to the driver, in the least safe seat in the car, although she had two other seats reserved.
But a bus can crash or stop abruptly even when a steward is delivering coffee or a newspaper.
The issue is whether the bus has parking spaces according to the technical licence.
Unless the bus is approved, passengers must sit.
The buses of Student Agency have no places to stand; which was confirmed by the company's director Radim Jančura.
"We have discussed this with the Ministry and at first the movement of passengers was not allowed.
"We have to be able to use the toilet seat, and we have to be able to use the toilet seat", he said.
The steward's law is unknown
'There is no clear legal interpretation of the role of a steward - no legislation deals with this role.
However, neither does any legislation prohibit the provision of services by carriers.
The Road Transport Act only knows the term 'carrier' and does not define his rights and obligations", adds the less explicit spokesman Hanzelka.
Director of the Department of Road Vehicle Operation of the Ministry of Transport Josef Pokorný, on the contrary, believes that the law treats the problem sufficiently.
'It depends on whether the bus has a permitted parking space in the type approval.
That's the end of it", he says.
Buses are divided into urban buses with parking spaces and a maximum speed limit, intercity buses with parking spaces with a maximum speed limit and long-distance buses without parking spaces with a maximum speed limit and seats with safety belts.
Like an airplane, says the expert
BESIP traffic safety expert Jaroslav Hořín does not see the movement of stewards on board the bus as a major problem.
"There are not many dangers when you're driving smoothly, and the situation is comparable to a service in an airplane.
Even here, it's uncertain when the turbulence will come and the flight attendant may hit her head".
"If the bus breaks down, of course, the laws of physics apply.
Just like on a city bus or a streetcar.
Stewards' safety must be addressed by the carrier's internal regulations", he says, and also believes that the matter is unresolved from a legal point of view.
The anchor is willing to cancel the service
The Student Agency offers steward services as the only bus operator.
He employs two hundred of them.
The director doesn't consider their occupation risky even after the accident.
"But as soon as I realize that the steward's job is risky, I'll cancel it.
Coffee and newspapers are available to passengers upon boarding.
It would also save money", he says.
As a safety concern, the absence of stewards in his cars was justified by the director of Asiana Alexei Litvin, who operates a fraction of lines compared to SA.
"We don't have stewardesses, we've been against this from the beginning.
Sooner or later it will end in some fatal accident", he told Týden.cz less than a year ago.
There has been a great tragedy
A young stewardess from Plzeň who had worked for the company for two years died in an accident on a connecting line to Naples.
The Slovenian truck probably veered off the parking lane without using the sign and blocked the bus.
His driver tried to avoid a sharp maneuver, but he lost the right front part.
That the two places reserved for the rest of the stewards were sold out, Jančura refuses.
"These seats cannot be reserved on long-distance flights, they are blocked".
The firm's going to sue the truck driver.
With the compensation to the girl's family, the agency will not wait for the court to decide, but will also expect financial compensation from the guilty party.
Amendment of the law?
In the offing
The law that has been working on for over a year by a 30-member expert group of the Ministry of Transportation could clarify the movement of stewards on board the bus.
"No concrete conclusion was reached, however.
Buses don't solve much, but rather a points system, a maximum speed on the motorway and the use of mobile phones while driving", says expert Hórín.
"The Ministry of Transport does not consider the steward's activity to be a serious threat to the safety of passengers", concludes Hanzelk's spokesman, adding that the police and the occupational safety authorities are responsible for controlling bus safety.
The hope of Düsseldorf is Frankfurt
The big words in the WestLB board letter to the employees of this bank are not lacking.
The merger of the Dusseldorf-based bank with Deka-Bank in Frankfurt will create "the central institution of the financial group Saving for capital markets", reads the letter, which was made public on Monday.
According to the letter, WestLB will contribute to the transaction a 'set of competences' which will ensure long-term returns.
The Commission also notes that the Bank of Greece has not provided any evidence that the Bank of Greece has been able to obtain a loan from the Bank of Greece.
Such texts arise when the board wants to demonstrate the ability to act in a problematic period.
The unstable WestLB is still under considerable pressure.
Not only from the European Commission, but also from the Federal Office for the Supervision of Financial Services, whose message to the Land government in North Rhine-Westphalia that it is time to find a solution for the future is still fresh.
The connection between Deka-Bank, which customers know only for its investment funds, and WestLB, whatever it may be, has been discussed for some time, even on the Frankfurt side.
At the presentation of the half-yearly results of Deka-Bank's business at the end of August, the CEO Franz Waas said that he did not see any point in merging his Mainzer Landstraße bank with one of the Landesbanken, such as Helaba or WestLB.
However, the Board of Directors of Deka-Bank, which is represented by one half of the Landbank and the other by the Savings Bank, has entrusted the management board with the task of negotiating with WestLB about joint business activities.
This could be capital market transactions or part of them.
But the talks have only just begun, the financiers say.
Deka-Bank, which with its 3000 employees is one of the most important employers on the financial market in Frankfurt, is not mentioned for the first time in the context of consolidation in the savings sector.
In 2003, it seemed for a while that a merger of Deka-Bank with Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz and Helaba might take place.
This triad was nothing after all.
Shortly after the merger plans were made public, the Hesse government opposed the participation of Helaba.
Neither of the other two banking houses have merged.
The Landesbank Rheinland-Pfalz instead acquired the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg from Stuttgart.
Yet, speculation has repeatedly surfaced about Deka-Bank's connection to the Earth banks.
But recently, Günther Merl, chairman of Helaba's board, has reacted negatively to speculation about his financial house's connection with others.
However, it seems to be increasingly convinced that the convergence of the various banking houses of the public sector is necessary.
The merger of BayernLB with the Landesbank Baden-Württemberg could now be the first to be considered following the elections to the Landtag in Bavaria.
That's not good news for Helab.
If the pressure to merge increases, it will lose potential partners for such a merger.
In the south, only the second violin would play, even though the financial crisis is still far better than the banking houses in Munich and Stuttgart.
The merger with WestLB was blocked earlier this year by the Hessen-Thüringen Association of Savings and Investment Banks, which holds a 85% stake in Helab.
The Nord LB would therefore appear to be the most appropriate.
But geostrategic considerations of this kind are only one side of the problem.
On the other hand, there is the question of how much the business models of the institutions are aligned.
In June, Merl stated that the German Savings and Loan Association had not yet answered the crucial question of what business model should ensure the future competitiveness of the Landesbanks.
It could also end up in the liquidation of WestLB, which is certainly not what anyone in this institution wants.
That is why the board's letter says that they are seeking a "comprehensive solution" for the entire banking house.
Whether and how this will be linked to the interconnection of the individual files with Deka-Bank remains to be seen.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "Weekend with Italy".
Elena's first time, Luca's third or fourth.
But this time, Elena will be his girlfriend, and he says it'll be different.
Behind them, by the Kaiser five-liter barrel, stands a stronger beard and two hundred tourists at the Oktoberfest proves how deep tones can be produced by his throat.
Elena slaps Luca first and then kisses him.
They came to Verona from Bologna.
From here, from the bus station next to the Puerta Nuova, there are four buses leaving this evening at 11.45 marked "destinazione Monaco, festa della birra", expected arrival at 6.30.
Three buses are mainly Italian, one bus is exclusively Brazilian.
In one corner of the parking lot, these South Americans are already singing their national anthem, celebrating at night.
And this, says Marco Guarda, is not for Italy.
Marc, who wears a long coat with a faux fur lining and glasses with wide silver rings, owns the three buses.
He's been taking them to Oktoberfest for five years, and he's done three trips this year alone.
At night, there during the day, between the beer stalls, at 22:30 the return trip.
Staying overnight would be an unnecessary expense, Marco says.
The trip costs 75 euros including a welcome toast of Kaiser beer, brewed strictly according to the Bavarian law on beer purity, health insurance and a German-speaking guide - Marco was attending a language course in Frankfurt.
Buses leave at night, follow the motorway towards "Brennero".
Beer's not serving, not yet.
The bus quickly stops, the passengers fall asleep.
They're doing well, they'll need their strength.
It stops in Brixen and Holzkirchen, where it makes one more stop on highway number 8 just outside Munich, as do many other buses with Italian license plates.
When Marc's group finally arrives at the parking lot near Theresienwiese at 6:30 a.m., as scheduled, there are already about 50 other buses from all over Europe.
Elena, Luca and the others are gathering, Marco has a final speech, explaining the plan of attack.
First, put on the yellow hat.
It says "Oktoberfest" in left-handed scribble, next to the web address of Marc's travel agency: "conoscersiviaggiando.it".
Second: "When the beer tent door opens, run!" calls Marco into the morning air.
"Go!" Go and take seats in the back of the tent.
"Don't get in the way, don't get in the way, and don't all yellow hats on the same bench, spread out in space!"
The mass is 8 euros, 25 cents.
And don't forget to tip the workers.
"Show the squad that we're behaving.
As soon as you leave your posts, they're gone!"
Third: "Be here again tonight at exactly half past eleven!" Do you understand?
And up on the Wiesn, the beer tent area.
Along the way, one group member is putting yellow caps on trees, signs, and even the election poster of a major Bavarian party.
We must prepare for a retreat.
The second weekend of Oktoberfest is known as the "weekend with Italy".
Exact figures on the number of visitors are not available; there are reports of 50,000 people making their way across the Alps and entering the beer tents, and ten percent of all visitors this weekend are said to have come from Italy.
The Munich police will be reinforced by seven South Tyrolean police officers, and Italian volunteers will support the Bavarian Red Cross, which has a national statistic in which Italians rank ahead of the British (about 60 raids) and Austrians (about 80) with around 200 medical treatments.
The Hofbräu tent is especially popular among Italians.
Sleepless nights for the creditors of Hypo Real Estate
Just last week, the Federal Minister of Finance Peer Steinbrück stressed that the German banking system is relatively stable.
It is good that this politician used the word "relatively" and that he included in his argument the fact that the German banking sector will not be spared from the crisis.
Because it came in last weekend.
The real estate finance house Hypo Real Estate (HRE), which is tracked by the Dax Index, is getting several billion in loans from a consortium of German banks to protect it from market turbulence.
A person familiar with the situation told Reuters on Monday that the said loan assistance would go up to 35 billion euros.
Hypo Real Estate (HRE) will only have to pay interest on the amount actually used up.
He says the money comes from both private and public banks.
In the background, the losses of the Depfa subsidiary.
According to the newspaper report, this state financier refinanced the long-term projects for which he lent money in an extremely short time, which is now impossible due to the lack of confidence in the markets.
In the first half of 2008, the bank's reserves decreased by 95% to EUR 2,37 million and its equity ratio slightly decreased from 1,6% to 1,45%.
Current and net income from financial transactions was nil compared to the previous year, income from the increase in the value of receivables and certain securities and from the cancellation of the provisions for credit transactions fell by more than 70% to EUR 5 million.
Only the higher revenues from the compensation for the subsequent clearing costs of the restructuring of the former Depfa group and from the reimbursement of interest under the tax code and from the intermediation of trade for the group companies made the 16% decrease in revenues more moderate.
The former state financier burned himself after its privatisation in 1990 on mortgages for businessmen, which were then separated from the services portfolio and further managed by Aareal Bank.
As it was not profitable in the traditional state financing, Depfa then became more involved in infrastructure projects and in the financing of joint projects between private investors and the state (Private-Public-Partnership, PPP) and diversified internationally.
Hypo Real Estate now has to write off some of the value of its subsidiary, and these write-offs will have a "substantial material effect" on the group's profit and loss calculations, as some have been vaguely quoted.
The fact is, there will be no dividend.
It was already reduced by two thirds for 2007.
Hypo Real Estate has been a major financier of state and infrastructure projects since the takeover of Depot.
It depends more than other institutions on refinancing on the interbank market, as it has no customer deposits.
After the collapse of Lehman Brothers two weeks ago, the interbank lending pool has practically dried up because banks are trying to preserve liquidity.
Hypo Real Estate needs short-term funds for refinancing a part of Depfa's loan portfolio - approximately EUR 50 billion - each year.
According to Hypo Real Estate, the loan covers the group's financing needs for the foreseeable future and protects the company 'from the influence of international money markets which are currently largely inoperative'.
Other sources have said that this money will ensure refinancing until the end of 2009.
HRE's Chairman Georg Funke, on the other hand, stated that the Hypo Real Estate Group would not have to take advantage of the money markets in the foreseeable future.
The Commission notes that the restructuring plan of the Bank of Greece, which was submitted by the Commission on 27 July 2012, was based on the assumption that the Bank of Greece would be able to recover the aid granted to it.
That's what the bank's shareholders and creditors are hoping for.
But given the dynamics and unpredictability of the crisis, there's probably no certainty.
It is not even entirely excluded that the loan may not have to be fully drained.
However, the opposite cannot be excluded.
After the bank appears to be on the verge of bankruptcy late on Sunday afternoon, the rescue, however preliminary, cannot appease the passions.
The share price has fallen by 75 percent to 3.30 euros.
The bond market, on the other hand, held up well.
While the senior debt has remained virtually unchanged, the secondary bond market has been losing more.
This concerns mainly the bonds of the former subsidiary Württemberg Hypo and, logically, bonds with maturity after 2009.
Hypo-Real-Estate bonds initially seemed to be an alternative investment opportunity for speculators, but their stability, following the sharp aggravation of the banking crisis and the crisis of the institution itself, which brought them into the company by taking over Defa, has to be understood in terms of the stability of the international financial system.
As long as the issuing banks, governments and less-favoured commercial banks are willing to support the system, it is possible to expect the securities to be paid off at maturity.
But it could also happen, as almost no one now dares to hope, that the financial crisis will be overcome in the next 15 months.
However, in the face of news reports that have come in concurrent with this partial nationalization, the certainty-bound probability has now become a mere legitimate hope.
This is likely to set up a series of sleepless nights for long-term creditors in particular, as they decide whether to waive their obligations.
Short-term investors can use the threshold at least to create a transfer of losses from previous accounting periods to exchange rates of the later years for the purpose of future payment of capital gains tax.
Sylvana and the Secret of the Bento Box
When 16-year-old Sylvana Hiltrop is introduced on her first day of high school in Tachibana, the girls start to argue: the German is completely "kawaii"!
What does that mean?
Sylvana knows this word from her manga.
"First day in Japan.
Sir, I was nervous.
I was already hooked on the way to school.
I live in the Tokyo area, towards Kawasaki, and I'm 40 minutes by train from Tachibana High School.
I had to find my way by myself, but luckily I wasn't lost.
It seems that the beginning of the lessons in Tachibana is not as strict as in our home in Lower Saxony.
Students begin meeting after eight o'clock and twenty minutes before nine, a short session with the teacher, the 'home room' begins.
But before class started, I was supposed to introduce myself.
I'm not the kind of person who likes to speak in front of people, let alone a class of 40 students.
Since I didn't have a school uniform yet, I put on my host mother's old skirt, along with a blouse, blue knee boots, and black leather shoes.
So I stood in front of the bench, dressed like this, and tried to pronounce everything correctly: 'Sayónara Wo še Sylvana...' - My name is Sylvana, I come from Germany, and my birthday is in a week.
At that moment, I was very happy that I had started learning the language two years ago.
All 31 girls in the class were whispering and giggling and waving and I kept hearing the word 'kawaii'.
I've seen that in my manga.
It is part of the Japanese girls' basic vocabulary necessary for survival and means 'cute, sweet'.
Then I quickly sailed to my place.
The girl next to me smiled rather broadly, considering it an honor to have a foreign student sitting next to her.
The rest of the class was pretty quiet, but when the gong sounded, I was literally swamped.
They talked over each other and giggled and asked me questions about the possible and the impossible - and it's really hard to understand Japanese English.
And then, at recess, everybody unpacked their pants.
My hostess mom made me a lunch box, too, and that's different than the boring German snacks.
I had rice with herbs, small cloves, cucumber salad and seaweed, fruit and some kind of fish in tofu batter.
I don't know what I'm eating here in Japan.
These things look strange and taste quite new.
I'm sure everything is really good.
Well, except for the plum-laced plum, br!
Benta in Japanese schools is not just a lunch.
Sometimes, a girl will give a boy a homemade bento, which in this case is specially artfully made, hoping to get to know him better during a snack break.
I read about it in my manga comics.
I wonder if I'll see it here.
'Why Japan?' my friends asked me when I told them that I wanted to go to school in Tokyo for a year.
I always said:
'Cause I'm fascinated by it.
After all, for years, my favorite book has been manga.
And to understand these comics and their culture better, I started to learn a little bit of Japanese.
So it was perfectly clear to me that I would have to come here one day.
Because I have a weakness for tradition, customs and habits.
And they're highly valued here.
On the one hand, Japan is a country of the latest technology and trends, on the other, it is strict, disciplined and traditional.
And because everything is so well organized, I have never felt lost here, even though Tokyo is the largest city I have ever seen".
Even rats have feelings
When rats or cockroaches run away from danger, do they also feel fear?
Neuroscientist Joseph LeDoux believes that many animals have feelings too.
But how can we tell if they feel the same way when they behave in a way that is similar to our own?
For years, the online magazine Edge has featured contributions from well-known scientists.
SPIEGEL ONLINE presents a series of selected answers to the question "What do you believe to be true without being able to prove it?"
I believe that animals have feelings and other states of consciousness, without me or anyone else being able to prove it yet, when we can't even prove that other people have consciousness.
But in this case, at least, we can hope, because all human brains have the same basic configuration.
But as soon as we start to engage with a different species and open up questions of perception or consciousness in general, we enter a terrain of incompatibility because the hardware doesn't match.
When in danger, the rat does what many other animals do: It will pretend to be dead, run away, or attack.
Humans behave similarly, which some scientists have inferred to be a comparable subjective experience.
I don't believe that, though.
Two aspects of brain structure make it difficult to transfer our subjective experience to animal experience.
This is because the circuits associated with human consciousness almost always involve the lateral prefrontal cortex (due to its contribution to short-term memory and executive or managerial functions).
This vast area is significantly more developed in humans than in other primates, and seems to be completely absent in other creatures.
At least in those aspects of our consciousness that depend on the prefrontal cortex, between knowing who we are and the ability to plan and make decisions, there's reason to believe that humans are different even from other primates.
Another dramatic quirk could be hidden by the linguistic nature of man: because so much of his perception is tied to language, it is often said that consciousness depends on it.
In this case, we could rule out animals.
But even if consciousness did not matter in language, it would certainly be influenced by language, so animal consciousness, however constructed, would probably be different from most of our states of consciousness.
So it's hard to figure out what consciousness might look like in other animals.
When, as something internal and subjective, it cannot be measured or, because of the special hardware, analyzed on the basis of our own experience, then we face great problems in examining it.
Most of my discoveries relate to the content of conscious experience, but there is another aspect of consciousness that should be scientifically accessible.
It would be possible to study the processes in the animal mind regardless of their content, and that's exactly what's happening in studies of short-term memory in primates, especially in the visualization example.
But this approach, which was pioneered by Christof Koch and Francis Crick, focuses on neural correlates of consciousness rather than causal mechanisms: they may be identical, but they may not be either.
Interestingly, this approach also emphasizes the importance of the nefrontal cortex for visualization.
What does this mean for feelings?
I deduce that an emotional system, such as the fear system, is activated in the brain conscious of its own activity.
So what we refer to as "fear" is the mental state we find ourselves in when the activity of a defense system localized in the brain (or its consequences, such as bodily reactions) takes advantage of the operational memory.
And seen from this angle, sensation is closely associated with those areas of the cortex that are characteristic of primates, and especially humans.
And in connection with linguistic nature, there is a subtle gradation of perception, because we can use words and grammar to distinguish and categorize states, to assign them to others as well as to ourselves.
In contrast, Antonio Damasio, for example, believes that feelings arise from more primitive activities in the cortex and brainstem areas dedicated to bodily sensations, similar to Jaak Pankseep, who, however, focuses more on the brainstem.
And because this network hasn't changed much in the course of human evolution, it could easily be involved in the feelings experienced by many species.
I can't dispute that, theoretically, but I can't prove it.
Pankseep argues that what we see as fear in rats and humans is probably felt in both organisms in the same way: But how can we verify, Pankseep says, that rats and humans feel the same thing when they behave similarly?
The cockroach flees danger - does it feel fear?
In my view, mere similarity in behavior cannot prove a similarity in experience.
It's true that the neural comparison takes us further: rats and humans have similar brainstems, whereas cockroaches have no brain.
But is the brain stem responsible for the feelings?
And even if we could prove it in a human, how would we prove it in a rat?
I think rats and other mammals, maybe even cockroaches (who knows?) have feelings.
But I really don't know how to prove it.
And because their feelings are probably fundamentally different from ours (because human consciousness is based on special circuits and language), I'm looking more at emotional behavior than emotional perception in rats.
Anyway, in this case, we can expect to see progress at the neural level if we measure the same thing in rats and humans.
I'm not studying language and consciousness in the rat, nor am I studying feelings, because I don't know if they exist.
This may be considered shortsighted, but I prefer to move forward rather than repeatedly throw myself against the wall.
I'm a practical emotionalist.
UEFA President Platini: A grace period for Poland and Ukraine
Acting Prime Minister Ivan Vasyunyk said that the preparations will soon be directed directly by the President and the Prime Minister.
"The government sees the UEFA decision in Bordeaux as a proof of confidence in Ukraine and its ability to organise the EM together with Poland", Vasjunyk said.
"For our country, this is not amnesty.
The work has just begun and there is still much to be done in both countries".
In the early stages of the construction or rebuilding of stadiums, streets, hotels, and airports, both hosts stumble.
It is even possible that the number of ME stadiums will be reduced from eight to six.
"We can't waste any more time.
We must now work as quickly as possible", said Grigory Surkis, the president of the Ukrainian Union.
"UEFA will be watching us constantly".
An even more radical step was agreed in Poland.
The leadership of the Polish federation PZPN was removed by the National Olympic Committee after numerous scandals and replaced by an independent administrator Robert Zawłoki.
The committee met at the request of the Minister of Sport, Mirosław Drzewiecki.
There is "a serious risk that PZPN will not be able to act according to the rules", Drzewiecki told the Polish PAP news agency.
"We have written to UEFA President Michel Platini to assure him that this step will not harm the preparations for the 2012 World Cup".
Several teams from the first division were sentenced to forced relegation last season because of manipulations, eventually the start of the league had to be rushed.
The angry Dennis Quaid is backing up .
She wanted to promote a new movie, she talked about personal matters in an interview - and now she's having problems with her ex: Hollywood star Meg Ryan talked about her ex Dennis Quaid as a marriage-breaker.
He's furious and he's hitting back.
A delayed war of roses for ex-husbands Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid: seven years after their divorce, together, these two Hollywood actors are waging a bitter feud - in full view of the public.
In an interview with InStyle magazine last week, Meg Ryan spoke for the first time about the reasons for the breakdown of her marriage: "Dennis has been unfaithful to me for a long time, and it's been very painful".
She said she didn't know the extent of the fraud until after the divorce.
The inspiration for this mental strip was Ryan's PR work for her new film "The Women" - it tells the story of a broken marriage.
Dennis Quaid's reaction to his presentation as an unfaithful husband was stark: It's "crazy", the 54-year-old actor told the New York Daily News, that "Meg repeatedly re-lives the history of our relationship and re-enacts it".
Furthermore, it is "regrettable" that their 16-year-old son, Jack, is once again "publicly reminded of the pain and radical change that divorce is for every child".
While Ryan has been living alone since the divorce, Quaid is married again and recently became the father of twins.
He concludes his reflections on the subject of humiliation: "My life goes on anyway.
I consider myself fortunate to have a wonderful family who are doing well".
Airline and hotel prices fall
In the first half of 2008, air travel and accommodation in Europe were cheaper than in the previous year.
In Germany, flights were even up to 50 percent cheaper, according to a recent study.
Flights and hotel rooms are down again, according to a study by travel and financial services provider American Express.
The company analysed its data on bookings made in the first half of 2008 and, after rising prices in the first quarter, found a significant decrease in the second quarter.
After years of rising hotel prices, many places have already been offering lower rates.
From January to March, prices in 41 of the 48 European cities surveyed still increased by an average of 6.9% compared to 2007.
From April to June, however, prices were already 3.6 percent lower than in the previous year.
The trend was most pronounced in Paris and Rome, where travelers had to pay 30 to 37 percent less than in the previous year.
American Express blames the weak dollar for this trend, which has caused "a decline in the travel appetite of American tourists".
The decline in hotel prices was also more pronounced in financial centres than in industrial centres such as Hanover, Cologne or Stavanger.
In this Norwegian city, hotel prices rose by 26.3 percent, setting a European record.
Airfares also showed an upward trend in the first quarter:
The increase in the price of kerosene meant that passengers in Economy had to pay on average 7.1 percent more than in 2007, and that the cost of fuel for long-haul flights had risen by 29.2 percent.
From April to June, economy class prices fell by an average of 12.5 per cent compared with the previous quarter, but the changes in business and first class were less marked.
In Germany, prices fell even more sharply than in other European countries:
From January to March, they were up 11.9 percent, down 23.6 percent in the second quarter.
According to the study cited above, prices have fallen by as much as half for domestic German planes.
One reason for this price drop is the slowing down of economic growth, the company explains.
The demand in many segments of the air transport market is uncertain.
On the other hand, there is increased competitive pressure due to the Open Skies Agreement, which liberalised air traffic between the US and Europe.
The closure of unprofitable routes by airlines and the large number of airlines that went bankrupt in the first half of 2008 - 24 in Europe alone - are signs of the tense situation.
HSV defeated Gladbach 1-0
With one goal and simple methods, Hamburger SV is at the top of the table.
In Borussia, Luhukay has still not managed to put together a working XI.
Written by Kristoffer Klein - enlarge the unfinished landing for the representative Marko Marina.
This Gladbach player came in late and missed with a ball in the post.
His message was precisely worded and came from his mouth with conviction.
He just knew he was right.
"We need another goal", Hermann Rieger whispered in the hallway of the Hamburg Arena booth.
Not much was happening in the catacombs, the half-time break was over, and most people were back in their seats.
Rieger has been a physical therapist for HSV for nearly three decades and enjoys more respect than many of the actors of the day.
And so his plea was also heard at the proper place.
Assistant coach Cornelius Jol came in and raised his thumb to match.
Cornelius is the brother of Hamburg head coach Martin Jola.
His orders must have been something like this: here with the second goal!
There was no execution.
"Not everything was looked at properly today", later admitted Marcell Jansen.
Bastian Reinhardt would have wished it was more relaxed.
For 1:0 (1:0) the Hamburger owes the head of Mladena Petrić (11.) and the circumstances that the very weak Gladbaks could not harm the weak Hamburger.
"It was a dirty victory", Martin Jol summed it up.
Hamburger SV is celebrating 121 years of existence this Monday.
So on Saturday afternoon, the crowd celebrated themselves, the blue sky over the arena, and a live updated scoreboard on the video wall, featuring their team as the winner.
It's gonna be a birthday without a big party.
"We know how to evaluate it", said Marcell Jansen.
He suspects that the interim scoreboard symbolizes the league's unpredictability rather than its dominance of HSV.
The team, with the late arrival of new players - the Brazilians Nevese and Silva, the goalkeeper Petriće and the FC Bayern acquired Jansen - is slowly finding itself, but it is not yet able to shine.
"We need more feeling and more dribbling", Jol insisted.
After losing the vote
There's fear on Wall Street.
Early reports of the bailout's collapse caused the Dow Jones index to fall as much as 700 points.
It was the biggest one-day point loss in its history.
Later, Dow gained some weight.
At about 8:30 p.m., this most important global stock market barometer was down 5 percent to 10,579 units.
The Nasdaq technology exchange was down more than seven percent at 1,548 points.
The worst performing Dow at this point was American Express, which lost nearly 14 percent, and Bank of America, down about 12 percent.
None of the titles could be strengthened.
Goldman Sachs has lost almost 10 percent.
A few days ago, a major investor, Warren Buffett, had a stake in the company.
The rescue plan is to provide funds for the purchase of so-called bad mortgage bonds.
However, the full amount is not to be paid at once, but in several instalments.
In return, the State is to receive stock options of financial companies, which could be paid out in favourable market conditions, thus reducing the burden on the State budget.
European stock prices are falling sharply
Billions in aid to banks in Europe and the US do not relieve investors of doubts.
The share price of the large German bank Hypo Real Estate is strongly downward and is being pulled down by the Dax index.
The Dow Jones is losing money despite the government's planned bailout of the financial markets.
Spectacular exchange rate losses by Hypo Real Estate and Commerzbank have dragged the German stock index (Dax) deep into the red.
The shares of the Munich property financier lost up to three quarters of their value, Commerzbank lost more than 20 percent, despite the rescue action of the federal government and private banks.
Dax clearly slipped below the psychologically important 6,000-point mark and with a minus 3.7 percent, he scored 5,839.
Stock markets around the world went into a tailspin.
In New York, the trading day on Wall Street began with a significant loss.
Investors are concerned that the US government's $700 billion bailout may not be enough to revive financial markets.
The Dow has lost 334 points, or 3.3%, to 10,809.25 points in the first hour of trading.
The U.S. House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the bailout plan, and the Senate could take up the matter on October 1st.
Other European stock exchanges also moved in one direction: the FTSE index in London first lost 3.2 percent, the CAC-40 in Paris lost 2.9 percent.
In Asia, Japan's leading Nikkei index fell 1.26 percent to 11,743.61 after its first day of gains.
In Hong Kong, the Hang-Seng index was down 2.1 percent to 18,286.90 points.
In India, the leading Sensex index lost 506.43 points or 3.9 percent and ended trading at 12,595.75.
MDAX lost its share capital of Arcandor after the announcement of the capital increase.
Private bank Sal Oppenheim has subscribed 23 million new shares.
The travel and tourism group also announced that it would not sell its stake in Thomas Cook.
Dark matter affects the flight of space probes
For years, scientists have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon: Dark matter affects the speed of spacecraft during what is known as a swing-by maneuver.
Experts are concerned that Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity may not be entirely correct.
The space probe "Ulysses" flew through space for almost 18 years.
Now, due to the fuel lines that are about to freeze, she is in danger of dying from the cold.
For years, scientists have been puzzled by a mysterious phenomenon - gravitational pull anomalies.
A gravity kick is a spacecraft maneuver in which it gains momentum in the gravitational field of a celestial body, such as the Earth.
This can save the probes a lot of fuel.
The European-American Cassini-Huygens probe used this physics trick as did the solar probe Ulysses.
But what scientists have been saying for years in this case is astonishing: flying objects don't behave 100 percent as one would expect them to do according to the good old law of gravity.
Instead, there are irregularities in the rate.
The probes are suddenly accelerating or slowing down.
So far, physicists have been unable to explain this effect.
They named it gravitational force anomaly.
A number of experts fear that even Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, which describes the attraction of matter by the curvature of space, may not be entirely correct.
American physicist Stephen Adler, of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, continues to believe that Einstein was right, and he is trying to explain the gravitational anomaly by using the so-called dark matter that astronomers have discovered in the universe.
"This anomaly could be caused by dark matter that could also be found very close to Earth", he writes.
Space explorers have known about dark matter for only about a decade.
It is clearly a gravitational force, and its effect on other celestial bodies can be observed.
It is completely invisible, meaning that it does not emit or reflect any electromagnetic radiation, including visible light.
Scientists calculate that this dark matter makes up a good fifth of the total mass of the universe.
Kidnapped Tourists in Egypt Set Free
After ten days in the hands of their captors, the abducted tourists are free again in Egypt, according to the Italian foreign minister.
The Sudanese kidnappers demanded a ransom of several million euros.
Six of the kidnappers were killed in a gunfight before they were released.
Five Germans were kidnapped in the south of Egypt.
I hear the ransom is being negotiated.
Germans are repeatedly targeted by kidnappers.
WELT ONLINE brings you the most important cases.
European tourists stranded in the Sahara seem to be free.
It was reported by Egyptian state television, the Arab Al-Arabiya television station and Italian media.
Italian Foreign Minister Franco Frattini, reported by Italian television station Sky TG 24, confirmed the release: "Our fellow citizens and other hostages have been freed.
We are checking their health status", Frattini said.
According to Egyptian state television, five Germans, five Italians, and one Romanian, as well as their eight Egyptian escorts, are safe and sound.
All 19 participants of the desert expedition are apparently on their way to Cairo.
The background to the shooting before the hostages were released remains unclear: according to an Egyptian security official, the kidnappers were ready to end the kidnapping before the Sudanese army killed the six hostages by surprise.
"The problem has been solved.
They agreed to the ransom", the worker was quoted as saying.
He said it was "just about taking the hostage" when suddenly there was "this surprise".
On Sunday, Sudanese soldiers shot dead six kidnappers and captured two of them in the border area between Sudan, Chad and Egypt.
The kidnappers demanded a ransom of six million euros from Germany; the money was to be handed over by the German wife of one of the hostages.
The daily "El Masri El Jom" quoted one of the German mediators as saying that the release of the hostages is being delayed because the kidnappers are afraid for their safety.
According to this report, the kidnappers intended to release the female hostages after payment of a ransom.
The men were to be held until the kidnappers had a safe escape route.
The German Embassy in Cairo declined to comment on the report.
Abuse by Father "led to Suicide"
Several years of abuse by her stepfather led to the woman's suicide, according to the court.
After pleading guilty to eight counts of sexual harassment, 57-year-old Michael Trerise of Stithians, Cornwall, was sentenced to six years.
The Crown Court in Truro heard that he regularly bound his stepdaughter Stephanie Randle when she was between the ages of five and seven.
"I feel responsible for her death", Trerise wrote in his confession.
It was also stated in court that Ms Randle committed suicide at her home in Mutley, Plymouth on 1 April 2007 at the age of 34.
When she lived in Coventry as a child, Trerise had bound and blindfolded her and then sexually abused her while her mother worked in a pub.
Trerise divorced his wife in the 1980s and returned to Cornwall.
His stepdaughter went to Plymouth.
But it was reported in court that Miss Randle, who spent a significant part of her time volunteering for the National Trust, was haunted by the specter of abuse, which was committed on her twice a week.
Prosecutor Ramsey Quaife told the court in 2006 that friends had told Ms. Randle, who was also a keen surfer and cyclist, that she was "emotionally dead" and that she had "given up her life".
In April 2007, her real father, Terrance Randle, found her dead in her Plymouth apartment.
It's believed she suffocated with a plastic bag.
Randle confronted his daughter's stepfather, who wrote a confession that ended with the words: "I bound her and blindfolded her.
"I did not abuse her.
I feel responsible for her death".
Judge Christopher Elwen told Treris: "You are an extremely strange fetishist, and it must have been horrible for your victim, who was only seven years old.
"This unpleasant story ends with the victim taking his own life.
"Even more horrifying is the fact that if she hadn't, the case probably wouldn't have gone to trial at all".
"I would particularly like to emphasize the impact that Stephanie's parents have said your crime has had on their daughter over the years", he added.
"Obviously, she would have been a promising, successful, happy young woman".
The official who lost the data will be charged
The BBC has learned that a government official who left top secret documents on a train in June will be charged under the Official Secrets Act.
The man in question left two top secret documents on a train at Waterloo while he was temporarily assigned to the Ministry of Defence.
The documents were obtained by the BBC before being handed over to the police.
It's the least serious offense against the law and there's nothing to suggest criminal intent.
The BBC's defence correspondent Frank Gardner said such a move would come as a surprise to many in Whitehall.
"They probably thought it was something that was being handled internally between the ministry and the Cabinet Office", he said.
An employee who cannot be named is charged under Section 8.1 of the Act, which is a clause that deals with the protection of information.
The Crown recommended that the Metropolitan Police indict the officer on the basis of the highly sensitive nature of his work on the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The documents he forgot to include were classified analyses of al-Qaeda and possibly Iraqi security forces.
He was informed of the decision on Monday morning and was moved from his home to an undisclosed location.
The cooperative banks are facing B&B debt
British co-operative trusts may have to deal with more than £80 million in debt after the Bradford & Bingley bailout.
The government has provided £14 billion to protect the deposits of 2.6 million Bradford & Bingley clients.
The interest on this loan will be repaid to all firms that take client deposits, including 59 cooperative deposits.
The CEO of the Cooperative Savings Association (CSA) Adrian Coles said it was "disappointing" that savings banks and their members had to pay.
The $14 billion debt will eventually be paid off by bailing out the Bradford and Bingley mortgages.
But the interest that accrues in the meantime will be paid out each year by all 700 financial firms that take deposits from clients.
The Compensation Fund Cash Service Plan confirmed to the BBC that all 59 cooperative deposits are included in this figure.
It is humiliating that these institutions that have been thoughtful... now have to pay some bills to those institutions that were not so thoughtful.
Adrian Coles, BSA, and the
He said that each firm should pay in proportion to the deposits it held, and that the backers of that should pay about 18% of the price.
The Treasury estimates that the interest on the debt will rise to £450 million in 2009.
That means the bailiffs will have to find £81 million to pay back the interest from the first year.
Adrian Coles, the CEO of the Co-operative Savings Trade Association, told the BBC he believes this is unfair.
"It's humiliating that those institutions that were thoughtful during the housing boom now have to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were not nearly as thoughtful".
According to the BSA, no backup has been dropped since 1945.
"We will have to explore all aspects of this matter over the next few weeks to see what options are available to protect the cooperative reserves and their members from a bill that could be substantial", Cole added.
The interest due in 2009 covers the seven months from the end of September to the end of March this year.
In 2010, there will be interest to be paid for the entire year and it could be almost twice that.
As cooperative trusts are partnerships without shareholders, this account will eventually be paid by their members through higher fees or lower interest rates on their accounts.
Milk is going up five pence a litre.
People in Jersey may have to pay more for milk.
The Jersey Dairy has announced that they will increase the wholesale price of their milk by five pence a litre from Monday.
It's the second price hike this year, after the two-pence hike in February, and it comes on the heels of research done by a consulting firm.
Retailers should decide for themselves whether they want the price increases to be reflected in customer prices.
The last change in the wholesale price of Jersey milk before the February increase was in 2002.
Bail for Bangladesh's former prime minister rejected
A Bangladeshi court has denied former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Wajid's bail application, meaning that she could be arrested if she returns to her homeland.
Her lawyers said the court had refused to release her on bail on charges that she had extorted over 50 million taka ($729,700) from a businessman when she was prime minister.
The case is one of several corruption charges brought against her.
Khalid Zia, a longtime political rival of Sheikh Hasina, was released on bail earlier this month.
Sheikh Hasina is due to return to Bangladesh in the next few weeks, but her party, the Awami League, has demanded that the military-backed government in the country give her full freedom first.
Correspondents say that while she was released on parole to undergo medical treatment abroad, the terms of her release do not indicate whether she will remain free when she returns to Bangladesh.
Her lawyers say she's now appealing the Supreme Court's order against the High Court.
"Supreme Court denied Sheikh Hasina's bail request saying she doesn't need bail as she is under investigation released on honor declaration abroad", said her lawyer Rafique-ul Huq.
"We will appeal against the order of the Supreme Court".
Her lawyers argued that she needed bail to return from abroad to prepare for the December elections.
A high-ranking member of the People's League said that Sheikh Hasina is expected to return home after October 17.
She was detained last year after the military-backed interim government took power, but was released from prison in June to go abroad for medical treatment.
Both Sheikh Hasina and Khalid Zijaya deny all the charges against them.
Fear of polio vaccination in Afghanistan
According to the United Nations, nearly 200,000 children were not included in the recent mass polio vaccination campaign because of violence associated with the Taliban.
The UN ran vaccinations in six provinces last week.
However, she says that for security reasons, she was unable to reach the children in the southern parts of Helmand and Kandahar.
A UN spokesman said this was despite Taliban promises not to attack or impede thousands of vaccine workers.
BSkyB has lost a court case over ITV
BSkyB lost a court case to review a decision by the Competition Commission ordering it to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster ITV.
The Competition Tribunal ordered BSkyB to reduce its stake in ITV from 17,9% to 7,5%.
The Commission had previously stated that BSkyB's shareholding had distorted competition and given the company disproportionate influence over ITV.
BSB bought a stake in the deal in 2006, which consequently prevented NTL, now renamed Virgin Media, from buying ITV.
In April 2007, the Office for Fair Trading announced that the acquisition of a stake in ITV by BSkyB had raised doubts about ITV's independence and called on the Competition Commission to open an investigation.
Virgin's chairman Sir Richard Branson, the consumer organisation and the regulator Ofcom were all against the purchase.
BSkyB argued that the forced reduction of its shareholding in ITV was unreasonable and disproportionate as a solution - in particular because BSkyB had previously said that it was willing to surrender its voting rights.
A new investigation of the U.S. Attorneys' Affair
The U.S. Attorney General has appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the firing of nine U.S. attorneys in 2006.
It came at a time when the report on the affair, prepared by the Chief Inspector of the Ministry of Justice, was critical of the actions of government officials.
The report criticized White House officials, lawmakers and former Justice Secretary Albert Gonzales.
The investigation was prompted by concerns that the lawyers were removed for political reasons.
Special prosecutor Nora Dannehy will now investigate whether officials interviewed during the investigation lied to investigators with the intent to pervert justice.
Inspector General Glenn Fine said in a report: "Serious allegations including potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or explained".
Appointing a special prosecutor with the power to compel witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations.
It began when the U.S. Department of Justice removed nine U.S. attorneys from their positions in December 2006.
At the time, the Ministry said the lawyers were fired for poor performance.
However, it later emerged that the lawyers who were fired were not rated any worse than many of their colleagues, leading many observers to conclude that the firings were politically motivated.
Some of the lawyers were involved in the prosecution of high-ranking Republican lawmakers and senators, while others refused to investigate voter fraud charges against Democrats.
American lawyers investigate and prosecute court cases on behalf of the government.
They can be released at any time, but they cannot be removed for political reasons.
The then head of the Ministry of Justice, Minister Alberto Gonzales, came under fire for his dismissal and eventually resigned.
A number of other Justice Department officials also resigned.
The inspector general's report was highly critical of Gonzalez's role in the affair, saying that he bore "principal responsibility" for the firing, that he "abdicated" from his leadership position and was "remarkably uninvolved" in the proceedings.
Other officials, including former senior Bush adviser Karl Rove, were criticized for not cooperating with the investigation.
Meat Loaf's masterpiece is going to be awarded
Rock star Meat Loaf is getting one of the Q Awards for his epic anthem Bat Out Of Hell.
The singer, who will be attending the ceremony in London next weekend for his special gold award, said he was "honoured" by the recognition.
The song, which runs for nine minutes and fifty seconds, was the title track of Meat Loaf's 1977 hit album.
This year's nominees are led by Coldplay, who narrowly missed out in four categories.
Paul Rees, editor-in-chief of Q Magazine, said: "There are some songs that stand above such things as time and genre, and Bat Out Of Hell is certainly one of them".
The song, written by Jim Steinman, needed big vocals, which Meat Loaf provided.
It started with an instrumental section that lasted almost two minutes.
The song was released in the UK in 1979 as a single, peaking at number fifteen.
But Meat Loaf's album Bat Out Of Hell stayed on the charts for about nine years and sold over 40 million copies worldwide.
Meat Loaf - real name Marvin Lee Aday - has suffered health problems in recent years, including surgery in 2003 for an irregular heartbeat after collapsing on stage.
In 2007, acute laryngitis forced him to cancel concerts.
It turned out he had a cyst on his vocal cords.
A dark street, often forgotten and perhaps soon to be sold
New York City has thousands of roads, streets, highways, and other overland roads, some famous, others purely utilitarian.
But even many veteran taxi drivers and longtime locals have trouble finding Extra Place, mostly because they've never heard of it.
This little alley is in the East Village and it goes north from First Street -- without going to Second Street -- between Bowery and Second Avenue.
At about ten feet [10 m] wide and 40 feet [40 m] long, it is more like a dusty passageway than a traffic jam.
There are no street signs.
It's practically invisible in a standard atlas.
But he has a small following.
Take Avalon Bay, the developer of the newly built luxury First Street.
Extra Place wants to re-roof and create a cleaner walkway to the shops and boutiques that are set to open in the new buildings.
Other admirers include longtime neighbors who say they were enchanted by the narrow alley simply because it was one of the last remnants of the time before the block was gentrified.
But the city's Department of Conservation and Development, which has the street in its possession, has no interest in keeping it.
At a meeting of the community land committee, representatives of the city and the Avalon Bay Company drew up a plan for the developer to buy the street.
However, according to Suzan Stetzer, district manager of Community 3, the committee prefers the option of keeping the street in the hands of the city and has requested a new plan to be submitted next month.
"The city now owns very little land, and we would like Extra Place to remain in its possession", she said.
"Repair and management proposals could be made, which could be done by Avalon, but we also want to guarantee public access".
Avalon Bay announced a few months ago that it was going to re-pave the small street and set up seating areas, several of which would be used by the cafeteria whose interest in renting space the developer expects.
The idea that Avalon Bay could buy the street was first floated at a meeting this month.
Michele de Milly, Avalon Bay spokeswoman, said that while the company wants to use the street, it doesn't necessarily want to own it.
"The main purpose of Avalon Bay is to fix this deserted alley and make it a beautiful place for the public", she said, adding that the sale was proposed by the city.
Seth Donlin, a spokesman for the Bureau of Landscape Preservation, said the city was indeed interested in selling the street, noting that his office's job is to develop the property rather than manage it.
Compared to its more colorful neighbor, the Bowery, Extra Place has left a shallow trail of history.
Some people think that the street got its name in 1802 when Philip Minthorne's large farm was divided among several of his children and no one claimed that narrow strip of land.
The back door of CBGB, the punk rock landmark that closed in 2006, led to Extra Place, and the alley is perhaps best known as the backdrop of the cover photo for the Ramones' "Rocket to Russia" album.
"The place was amazing", says Danny Fields, Ramones manager, who took the photo in November 1976.
"It was full of garbage, torn clothes and pieces of barrels, posters, leaves and ropes".
Some locals, including bloggers writing about the gentrification of the East Village, oppose the idea of selling Extra Place, arguing that the piece of public property, however modest, should remain public.
Others consider Extra Place a rarity - a nearly unchanged piece of the city that should be left as it is.
Jeremiah Moss, who writes a blog called Jeremiah's Disappearing New York (subtitled "The Book of Lamentations: A Bitterly Nostalgic Look at a Dying City"), excerpted part of the Extra Place story from the Talk About the City column that appeared in The New Yorker in 1952.
The article's author, Brendan Gill, wrote: "Extra Place is a narrow cul-de-sac, dark even by day, and bordered by rusted iron warehouse doors and broken windows, where a week-old newspaper is shoved through the corners".
With a few exceptions, the alley looked exactly the same one night.
The rat ran across the dead end of the street near the door that once led to CBGB, the site of today's high-end clothing store.
There was graffiti on the wall, and next to the freshly discarded newspapers was an empty beer bottle.
A couple of passersby said he rarely thinks about the Extra Place, but suggested he could use a little rebellion.
On the other hand, Fields said that he thinks some people underestimate the appeal of the alley in its current state.
"The best years of my life", he said, "have been in dark, damp, disgusting places".
The bilingualism debate: the English language
In this issue of Focus on Education, Bruce Fuller and Lance T. Izumi will discuss the attitudes of candidates towards bilingual education.
Lance T. Izumi, a California academic and director of education at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy, is the co-author of "Worse Than You Think: Why the Middle Class Needs to Choose Schools".
Effectively reaching Hispanic voters is a tricky business.
Barack Obama's education agenda is just proving it.
The Obama campaign notes that "African-American and Hispanic students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students", which is true.
To combat such performance gaps, Obama's education agenda specifically promotes, among other things, "transitional bilingual education" for those who are just learning English.
The question for Barack Obama, however, remains whether his commitment to bilingual education, which emphasizes the use of languages other than English in the classroom, is stronger than his interest in narrowing the performance gap.
Take Sixth Street Prep, a charter elementary school in the East Los Angeles district.
The students at this school are overwhelmingly Hispanic from low-income families.
More than a third of the students, many of whom have only recently been admitted, are new to English.
Yet, in the 2008 state math tests, the incredible 100 percent of fourth graders made it to the top.
Almost as impressive, ninety-three percent of fourth-graders scored in the top tier of the state's English language and literature tests.
This incredible success was achieved by a different method than the one Obama prefers.
Sixth Street emphasizes control and practice, constant assessment of ability and an unforgiving approach.
Also, and this is something Obama should take note of, according to Linda Mikels, the Sixth Street principal, the school's approach to teaching English to those who are just learning is "full immersion".
Immersion in English emphasizes the almost exclusive use of English in teaching.
Miss Mikels, who is against bilingual education, told me, "We had a tremendous success with a brand-new student from Mexico - after 12 months, you would walk into a classroom and not know who it was".
"It works", she declared, "it works for us".
Would Obama take a school like Sixth Street Prep as a model for what other schools with large percentages of Hispanic and English learners should look like?
The school's performance should make the answer self-evident, but his own party's educational agenda (the National Education Association is a long-time advocate of bilingual education) and his own consistent support for bilingual education obscure Obama's prediction of the answer.
While Obama agrees that immigrants should learn English, he recently trivialized the issue when he said people should stop worrying about "English-only" laws.
Instead, he said, "You should make sure your children speak Spanish".
If Obama really wants to erase the performance gap, he should think carefully about the education models that work, rather than ridicule and trivialize them.
Oil drops sharply due to renewed economic concerns
Oil prices fell sharply on Monday amid concerns that even the US bailout plan might not revive the economy.
The price of oil futures fell in the morning trading on the New York Commodity Exchange by as much as 7 percent to $ 99.80 a barrel.
Since last Monday, prices have fallen by more than twenty dollars a barrel.
In the last two weeks, commodities markets have been rocked by financial turmoil on Wall Street and also by a pair of powerful hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
After reaching a high of $145.29 a barrel in July, prices fell to almost $90 a barrel earlier this month, only to be jolted by the huge uncertainty in financial markets.
Investors were gripped by anxiety again on Monday, even as the Congressional leadership announced that it had reached an agreement over the weekend on the largest bailout in history.
This report was overshadowed by fresh concerns that the financial crisis was far from over.
In the latest episode of the progressive decline, the government announced that Citigroup would be buying the banking division of Wachovia Corporation.
Meanwhile, the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments partially nationalised the European financial conglomerate Fortis.
Analysts at Barclays Capital said the frenzied weekend talks that led to the rescue plan "prove unable to revive market sentiment".
As the economic situation deteriorates, demand for commodities, including oil, is expected to decline.
"The outlook for global equity markets, interest rates and currency exchange rates has become highly uncertain", analysts at Deutsche Bank wrote in a note to investors.
"We believe that the commodities will not be able to escape the infection.
From a commodity perspective, our biggest concern is how far the American virus will spread to the rest of the world and especially to China".
The bank's analysts have lowered their expectations for next year, as oil consumption has fallen due to slower economic growth, and have cut their petrol price forecasts for 2009 by about 20%.
The wild ride in the second quarter broke the team record
After spending more time in the Jets' uniform than anyone else in the last eight seasons, defensive end Shaun Ellis thought he'd seen it all.
Then on Sunday, he watched the second quarter develop, as the Jets turned a scoreless game into a sleepy drive.
"I have never seen anything like it", said Ellis.
The second quarter began after the Jets and Arizona Cardinals had matched their exhausted play against the grim clouds above.
Then quarterback Brett Favre sent Laveranuese Coles to a 12-yard touchdown run, perfectly signaling an afternoon in which their budding partnership had moved on by miles.
Favre sent Coles off for two more touchdowns in the fourth quarter, including one where the cornerback went down, and another 10 seconds before halftime.
"It was nothing special", Favre said of all his passing to Coles.
"He's a hell of a player.
We communicated well, no matter what people thought".
While Favre and Coles were fighting, the defense attacked Cardinals quarterback Kurt Warner.
Cornerback Darelle Revis caught a pass from a stray and returned it 32 yards for a touchdown.
Safety Eric Smith has the next pass and he catches it.
Linebacker David Bowens forced Warner to fumble the ball.
The last throw of the ball, the fumble that Bowens forced, was perhaps the best ever.
The Cardinals got the ball 10 seconds to play, and after the Jets got the ball back, Jay Feely kicked a 20-yard field goal to give them a 34-0 lead.
That's the most the Jets have ever scored in a quarter.
Jets coach Eric Mangini, when asked to describe the madness, said, "Second quarter or third quarter?"
When told that both - the Jets allowed 21 unanswered points in the third quarter - Mangini said: "I can tell you that I enjoyed the second quarter much more than the third.
"Many points have been dropped in a short period of time".
The late Gebreselassie has broken his own world record
Haile Gebreselassie of Ethiopia once again showed why many consider him the greatest distance runner of all time, when he broke his own world record in the Berlin Marathon on Sunday, becoming the first person to run a 26.2-mile race in under two hours and four minutes.
His victory on a pleasantly flat track in 2:03:59 beat his previous time of 2:04:26 set last year in Berlin by 27 seconds.
Gebreselassie, 35, has set the 26th world record of his career, which is really incredibly broad - he has broken the world record or at least is the world champion at all distances from the metric mile to the marathon.
Last month, Gebreselassie missed the Beijing Olympic marathon because he feared - perhaps too much in retrospect - that the air pollution would exacerbate his asthma problems.
Instead, he promised to run in Berlin.
In almost perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the start, 55 degrees at the finish - Gebreselassie won Sunday with a lightning-fast average of 4 minutes and 43 seconds per mile.
As track runners like Gebreselassie and Paul Tergat of Kenya have focused on the longer track, the marathon record has dropped by more than two minutes in the past decade since Brazil's Ronaldo da Costa won in Berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998.
After Sunday's victory, Gebreselassie told reporters that he had a leg cramp two weeks ago and missed a week of training.
The break obviously energized him more than it sustained him.
"I'm so happy", Gebreselassie said to the reporters.
"Everything was perfect.
I started again a week ago and I was a little doubtful today, but everything was fine".
He was also criticized - especially in Kenya, East Africa's rival to Ethiopia - for allegedly over-planning his races, generally avoiding the world's top marathoners, relying on race drivers as if it were a race on a track, and setting world records over his sense of competition.
But this criticism can hardly diminish Gebreselassie's enormous running ability.
Maintained at the pace of the four Kenyans, Gebreselassie reached the half in a time of 1:02:04.
After the drivers had passed out, Gebreselassie was chased by two Kenyan elite runners, James Kwambai and Charles Kamathi.
With just under three miles to go, Gebreselassie finally caught and ran to Kwambai, who finished second in 2:05:36, improving his personal best by almost five minutes.
Kamathi finished third in a time of 2:07:48.
In the women's race, Irina Mikitenková, a native of Kazakhstan and now a citizen of Germany, finished the excellent year with the seventh fastest time in history of 2:19:19.
The record time of 2:15:25 is held by Paula Radcliff of Great Britain.
The 36-year-old Mikitenko surprisingly won the London Marathon last spring in a time of 2:24:14.
She missed the Beijing Games because of what was described as a back injury, but recovered to win in Berlin and in her third marathon ever, she improved her personal best by almost five minutes.
She ran the race with a clever, deliberate mind: She let four Ethiopian and Kenyan runners run a great leap and then caught up with them after about 18 1⁄2 miles.
Askale Tafa Magarsa of Ethiopia finished second in 2:21:31 and Helene Kiprop of Kenya finished third in 2:25:01.
Pride and the barriers of black life in a segregated city
Hidden among the sprawling amusement parks of Greater Orlando, miles from all the glitter, noise and vastness, lies a quiet town where the pride and the challenge of African-American life comes alive.
Eatonville, the first all-black town incorporated in the state and where Zora Neale Hurston spent her childhood, is not quite as simple as she described it in 1935: "a town of five lakes, three croquet courts, three hundred brown leather, three hundred swimmers, enough quayava, two schools, and no prison".
It's a pilgrimage site now.
Alice Walker, Toni Morrison and Ruby Dee have come to the annual Eatonville Zora! Festival to pay tribute to Hurston, the most celebrated female writer of the Harlem Renaissance.
The town she described remains a bystander, even though she made it a tourist stop by including it in a Florida travel guide created by the Federal Writers Project during the Depression.
It's still as independent, dignified, and private as it was in the 1930s, when Hurston wrote that rural blacks in Florida often resisted sharing their true feelings with the white man, who "knows so little about us that he doesn't know what he's missing".
Even in the year that Black presidential candidate, Senator Barack Obama, is calling for an open debate on race, many residents remain wary of outsiders' views.
"We pay great attention to how our story is told", says 59-year-old Hortense Jones, a lifelong resident and the oldest member of the parish in the city.
"It has to be right".
Eatonville has long been characterized as a paradox of triumph and effort.
It's both a historic model of black uplift, and a community of nearly 2,400 people where the poverty rate is twice the national average.
It's a center of literature, but it's also a shadowy example of Southern rural black culture - sometimes despised, sometimes lauded - that grew out of American slavery.
Not surprisingly, the natives are both proud and protective.
And the worry of the Eatonville idea really started with Zora, which is the only way the Hurstons are called here.
She introduced her hometown to the world through heartfelt, rhyming books like "Mules and Men" (1935) and "Their Eyes Were Watching God" (1937).
Five paragraphs of Florida's tourist guidebook have turned the town a little bit into Route 17, which leads through the often-overlooked center of Florida, a stage for black history and human drama.
With a big-drum burst into life and literature, Hurston introduced readers to the store of former Eatonville mayor Joe Clark, and then turned to more personal places.
"Left of the road", she wrote, "is a white-and-brown, modern, national school with well-kept yards and playgrounds, always looked after by Howard Miller, even though he can't read or write very well".
She also mentioned the widow Dash's new husband, writing that Lee Glenn "sells all kinds of drinks and anything that fits in a clock hotel".
So in just a few hundred words, Hurston linked Eatonville to self-government, but also to illiteracy, remarriage and sex.
This was clearly not a typical Fodor's publishing house.
It wasn't really a portrait that everyone would appreciate.
"Zora told it like it was", says 90-year-old Ella Dinkins, one of the Johnson girls Hurston immortalized by quoting men who sang dirty songs about their beauty.
"Some people didn't like it", she added.
Hurston is still remembered as a chipmunk who came back often after her family moved to Jacksonville, Florida.
Seventy-year-old Augustus Franklin recalls that most of the time she arrived in town, she arrived unannounced in a big Chevy, smoking and wearing pants in a city that still prides itself on its dress code.
Most of the people were fascinated, Franklin said, but many were squeamish.
"The people of the Dawn have always loved to see", said Franklin.
But, he added, rocking on a back porch chair overlooking Lake Sabelia, where Hurston was most likely baptized, "she never stayed too long".
When Hurston died in 1960, she was poor and her books were out of print.
It seemed that Eatonville had forgotten her along with the rest of the world.
Although she was once a literary star, a contemporary of Langston Hughes, and the only black woman at Barnard College in the 1920s, she was buried in an unmarked grave in Fort Pierce, Florida, where she had previously lived.
There were no major mourning ceremonies or large public readings at Eatonville.
"I don't think they understood her message or her meaning to the world", said Valerie Boyd, author of Hurston's 2003 biography, "Wrapped in Rainbows".
The change came in the 1980s.
Orange County officials wanted to make a five-lane highway through the city instead of Kennedy Boulevard, the local two-lane highway.
The Orlando eruption has already forced Interstate 4 through the western edge of the city.
The design came at a time when Eatonville was still recovering from a difficult period in history.
Forced integration, among other things, ended the relatively idyllic isolation of this community.
In the 1950's, the struggle for racial mixing brought hatred to the very edge of the community.
"At that time, a bunch of white boys, they came and threw oranges and things at people who were sitting on the side", Franklin said.
"We actually had a lady killed by it.
They threw a watermelon from the car".
Writing in The Orlando Sentinel in 1955, Hurston challenged the Supreme Court's demand for forced integration and declared its decision in Brown v. Board of Education to be "offensive rather than celebratory to my race".
Residents now claim that desegregation of schools, while positive in some areas, has reduced cohesion in Eatonville and undermined the courage of the local youth.
"Black kids were used to hugging - I remember it - you hugged your teacher in the morning, you hugged your teacher in the evening", said N.Y. Nathuri, the daughter of Ella Dinkins and executive director of the nonprofit group Preserve the Eatonville Community.
This lasted until the teachers and students came from the same place, she added.
"You don't hug your white teacher because your white teacher - I mean, there's a cultural barrier", Ms. Nathiri said.
Civil rights, however, helped to create space for many other Zora Neale Hurstons - black writers, actors and artists who, like her, rose above prejudice with a reckless self-confidence and quotes like "How can anyone deny themselves the pleasure of my presence!
I don't know what that means".
In 1975, Alice Walker reached Hurston's unmarked grave and began to fight for her reputation to be revived.
Five years later, a highly praised biography of Hurston by Robert E. Hemenway appeared on the shelves of bookstores, re-establishing her in the American canon.
The highway project arrived just as Eatonville's most famous daughter was re-discovering the lights of the ramp.
Her former neighbors, the Hurstons, now considered her a savior.
To show what could be done to destroy their highway, the community began planning the Hurston Festival in 1988.
Thousands of fans arrived for the inaugural event two years later, and each January many return to celebrate.
The state backed out of the highway project after several years.
"Those five streams of the highway have raised, you could say, exploded, real civic pride", Nathiriva said.
Boyd said it more simply, "Dawn saved Eatonville".
The victory over the highway project helped change the image of the city.
Out-of-towners like Rachelle Munson, a lawyer who started attending the local church in 1993, began to appear in greater numbers, and residents began to reevaluate the past.
Eatonville was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
A new single-story library (named after Hurston, of course) opened in 2006 on the newly paved and beautified Kennedy Boulevard.
Today, Eatonville remains a Florida anomaly: just six miles from downtown Orlando, it can sometimes seem like a back alley in the summer rain, as small as it was when it was founded with just 27 black families in the 1880s.
(Today, it is 90 percent black.)
Strangers who come to seek the story and meaning of Eatonville are still often treated with caution.
Most interviews require prior permission, and certain things - such as the murals in Eatonville's oldest church, painted by whites and depicting blacks in fields - are not allowed to be photographed.
Many in Eatonville, like Jones, a bold, confident teacher who loves the red meat, still fear that their isolated community will not be understood.
And as the Hurston festival grew, so did domestic pride.
Young people especially are eager to see Eatonville as Hurston saw her entire race: beautiful, troubled and so on, but no better, no worse and just as proud, creative, hardworking, foolish and diverse as other American races and ethnicities.
Franklin's nephew, 18-year-old Edwin Harvey, has a sincere love of the community in his voice as he plans to return to Eatonville after college to work in local government or the police, which he says would benefit from some help.
And even younger ones, such as the 11-year-old twins from Winter Park, Alondra and Alexia Kenon, seem to have learned to describe Eatonville correctly.
"Most people, just passing by, think, 'Hm, this town is nothing compared to the others,'" said Alondra Kenon recently after church on Sunday.
"But if you really stop and look at the history for a moment, it's a very nice town".
Here in New York , we all speak fluent financial
Nothing has changed at first glance.
If tourists in Manhattan stayed away from the newsstands and the giant TV screens in Times Square, they wouldn't realize they were in the middle of a storm.
They would never guess that in the glass beehive of offices above their heads, every day the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolize New York have the worst "bad day at the office" since the 1929 crash.
The messengers are still rattling metal carts down the sidewalks, carrying bagels of muffins to breakfast meetings.
Hispanics still move between the towers and wear, like human mules, fifty-fifty ironed shirts that hang from the railings on their backs.
Office rats are still waiting in line for their morning bagel at the street food stalls, and there's still no yellow cab available on weekdays between 4 and 7 p.m.
It didn't seem like a crisis at all, until, with all the talk about pessimism, I decided to open a savings account on a Thursday afternoon.
Even though I timed this assignment to take a late-afternoon nap at my local JP Morgan Chase branch, there were already about 20 people in line.
Not at the cash registers to pick up or deposit cash, but at the front desk, where senior clients order checkbooks, tourists ask directions to Macy's department store, and new customers open accounts.
Most of the people before me, as I learned from Starr, my "licensed personal banker", came for the same reason I did.
But unlike me, they've already withdrawn their savings from smaller banks in places they came from, like New Jersey, Pennsylvania, or Staten Island.
They have taken money from so-called thrives, money clubs, and those types of thrift shops that operate in only one state and claim to care for their customers like a family.
Fifteen such banks have quietly failed in the past year.
A few days ago, Washington Mutual, a bank with $327 billion in assets, went bankrupt, and as New Yorkers were heading home for the weekend on Friday night, another bank, Wachovia, with $440 billion in assets, was trying to find a bailout buyer.
The office workers and the businesses that stood before me, fearful of another collapse, were moving their cash to the bank that is perceived as a safe haven and that does most of the bailing on Wall Street.
Ordinary New Yorkers have learned a lot about finance in the last week.
Some woman at my local Chinese supermarket was on the phone talking to Lehman Borthers, that failed bank, and its emaciated top executive Dick Fuld with as much familiarity as if she were gossiping about a lazy colleague.
And Lyn, the uniformed, 50-something housekeeper of my apartment, changed the subject of our usual conversation - Brad, Angelina, or my food delivery.
After my visit to the bank, she said to me, "I have my savings in money market funds.
I've moved it, I won't risk it".
Muslim graves desecrated after Austrian right-wing crackdown
Heinz-Christian Strache, left, from the Austrian right-wing party of the Free and Filip Dewinter from the Belgian right-wing party of the Vlaams Belang, take part in a demonstration to present the organisation "Cities against Islamisation" in Antwerp on Thursday 17 January 2008.
They carry signs similar to road signs that depict mosques with a red line crossed out.
Police are accusing right-wing extremists of desecrating a Muslim cemetery in Austria on the same weekend that far-right parties made huge gains in the general election.
More than 90 graves in a cemetery in the town of Traun near Linz were badly desecrated sometime between Friday evening and this morning, and police believe it was an organized act.
The perpetrators sprayed some of the graves with Jewish symbols, such as the Star of David, but detectives believe it may have been an attempt to cover up the motives of extremists driven by hatred of Muslim immigrants.
It's unclear if this incident was connected in any way to the election.
A spokesman for the local Islamic community said they were "deeply shocked" by the reports of the desecration, which came as the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan was coming to an end.
Austria, meanwhile, is entering a soul-searching cycle after swinging to the right in yesterday's parliamentary elections.
Both far-right parties, which together won more than 30 percent of the vote, the Free Party and the Future Alliance of Austria, have waged a vehement anti-immigration campaign and some of their slogans have been condemned as xenophobic by critics.
Heinz-Christian Strache, the leader of the Free Party, which won over 18 percent of the vote, protested against headscarves and burqas in the campaign, and even expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be Islamic.
At his last meeting with the electors in Vienna, he spoke of a "European brotherhood" to prevent the rise of Islam.
Both parties are trying to ban the construction of mosques and minarets, arguing that they are political symbols of the ongoing Islamization of Austria and Europe.
Polls and analyses carried out immediately after the elections, which put the far right in the position of the strongest political bloc in the country, suggest that this change was caused primarily by young voters who are worried about their future in the European Union.
Gary Glitter is not allowed to go on a trip across the border.
Gary Glitter, a glam rock star convicted of child sexual abuse, has been banned from traveling to France and Spain.
Officials imposed this six-month ban on Glitter after he informed the monitoring authorities that he planned to travel through France to Spain.
Kent police were granted the travel ban last Thursday after they provided evidence to officials about Glitter's past convictions for child sexual abuse.
Glitter, whose real name is Paul Gadd, did not attend the hearing at Ashford Lower Criminal Court in Kent, but was represented by the lawyers of Corker Binning.
A spokesman for the Judiciary said: "On Thursday, September 25, at the Ashford Criminal Court, the Kent Police asked for an order preventing Mr. Paul Gadd from crossing the border into France and Spain until March 25.
Paul Gadd was not personally present".
Glitter, 64, informed authorities he wanted to travel abroad, as he has a record on the sex offender registry.
They have to notify the authorities if they want to travel abroad for more than three days.
He must also give the police a week's notice of his planned departure.
If he failed to inform the authorities, he could be sentenced to five years.
Kent police have announced that they will not be investigating individual cases of Glitter's possible travels around the county.
A spokesman for the Kent Police said: "The Kent Police will do whatever is necessary to protect children in this country or abroad.
From our point of view, it's easier to track someone who stays in Britain because we have extensive systems here that deal with potential threats more efficiently.
Protecting the people of Kent is a top priority for Kent Police and we are working diligently to monitor the behaviour of registered sex offenders to minimise any danger to the public".
Glitter returned to Britain last month after serving 27 months in a Vietnamese prison for molesting two girls aged 10 and 11.
When he was released, he flew to Bangkok, where he was to board a flight to London.
But he said he wasn't feeling well, and refused to fly to London.
Thai authorities refused to let him pass passport control and he eventually flew to Hong Kong.
Chinese authorities also refused to allow him to enter, and he flew back to Bangkok, where Thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to Britain.
On 22 August, he finally arrived at Heathrow Terminal 3 and remained there while his solicitor David Corker went to the Uxbridge Lower Criminal Court in west London and simultaneously successfully applied for a warrant from Scotland Yard requiring him to register as a sex offender.
Glitter was previously jailed for four months in the United Kingdom for possession of child pornography.
A source from the Home Office said Jacqui Smith, the Home Secretary, was relieved and happy that Glitter had been prevented from travelling to France and Spain.
"To capture the real character, I photograph the master behind the scenes".
No heels, no calls or costumes.
Only the essence of the great masters of flamenco, detached from the focus on the interpretation - only so I achieve the free expression of a man or a woman.
On the one hand, an artist.
On the other, a human.
The inseparable, if not the private, in those moments far from the public - then one can see the familiar gesture, the depth of the casually captured gaze or the passionate gesture of the hands that are carefree because they are not about to step on the stage.
The German Günther Bauer in "Flamenco-people" alternates the theatrical performance with singers, dancers and guitarists with that lesser known face of the masters.
With this intention, the photographer assembles a unique flamenco iconography from different backgrounds.
The exhibition, which is part of the Flamenco Photography Month (Mes de la Fotografía Flamenca) program, "reflects the ever-growing international importance of flamenco", says the author, explaining that the "Flamenco-people" "can be any people, but when you look at the photographs, you will see that they are not typical images of the artists on stage.
These people portrayed "on the street" are artists able to bring passion, sadness, joy... onto the stage and captivate the audience completely.
To capture the personality of these artists, it is not necessary to take a photograph on stage.
They carry their personality and character inside.
I was interested in creating a relaxed atmosphere that would allow me to capture the personality of the great flamenco.
Enchanted by the "Cante de las Minas" festival, Bauer began in 1997 a long journey of portraying flamenco singers, guitarists and dancers on the camera of the board.
They are portraits that, because of the choice of camera and material, resemble classic photography.
The use of different stylistic means is contrary to the classical basis of the film and lends it a contemporary spirit, an idea that, according to Bauer himself, mirrors flamenco: "Music with very traditional roots, but which never ceases to surprise and evolve".
What draws the audience is not the performance of the dance, the singing, or the play itself, but the personality and character of the artist.
The search for the moment in which we meet the most essential, the spirit that is revealed in the way we perceive, be and experience, this was and is the constant of the work presented during these days in the gallery El Fotómata.
This selection of almost seventy photographed artists is made up of famous flamenco figures such as Diego El Cigala, Chano Lobato, Cristina Hoyos, Enrique Morente, El Lebrijano, Antonio Canales and Vicente Amigo, among others.
The project has become a sort of anthology of flamenco and will soon be published in a book, which will include the exhibited portraits.
Two years ago, Bauer's passion for portraiture led him to the idea of doing a retrospective of the "SportART project".
Although their concept is different from that of the "Flamenco-people", the photographer admits that "to photograph people, to get to know them and to be able to enter their lives for a moment, whether long or short, is my passion.
I think the portrait is the most difficult genre in photography.
You meet or encounter people, personalities, who sometimes you don't even know, or they give you a few minutes to take a picture.
Despite such circumstances, as a photographer, I always try to realize my ideas".
The collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco, entitled "Flamenco-people", is on display in the El Fotómata Gallery in the street de la Mata 20, parallel to the Alameda de Hércules, and can be visited until 16 October.
Vargas Llosa admitted that the novel he's writing is "audacious"
It is set in an environment he is not familiar with, and tells of events unknown to him, but Mario Vargas Llosa is going to succeed in his new project - he is currently working on a novel whose protagonist is Roger Casemant, an Irish nationalist who lived for twenty years in the Congo and travelled in the Amazon.
The perennial favorite for the Nobel Prize in Literature, admitted yesterday at the Hay Festival Segovia that the project he is currently engaged in is "a boldness" and that "everything suggests that I shouldn't be writing" this novel.
"If I had my wits about me, I wouldn't do it, but I will do it and I believe I will finish it", concluded his speech at the festival of exchange of ideas, thoughts and words, which over four days saw hundreds of writers, historians and journalists and thousands of other people gather in the city of Aquatucta.
The author of the novel "The City and the Dogs" was one of the main characters of the third year of the festival of words and fulfilled expectations.
Vargas Llosa, who won the Hay Festival's prize for favorite writer - an old edition of Dickens' "Our mutual friend" - filled the Juan Bravo theater to the last.
With Felix Rome, who introduced him, he had a devoted audience before him, to whom the hour passed like water - the Peruvian with astonishing accuracy and a noteworthy dose of humor recalled how he had grown from an original "incredible adventure" to a "pleasure of a passionate reader" and "the power to live more than I have lived" a literary mission; how he supplies the "lack of inspiration" by writing "disciplinedly", carefully arranging, editing and rewriting the text; or how his writing was influenced by Alexandre Faulkner, Victor Hugo and Dumas and what "memorial images" are the basic backbone of his stories.
The Spanish-American novelist admitted that "there is no way" to determine whether or to what extent books can change lives, "but I refuse to believe that literature is just entertainment, a fleeting experience" - Vargas Llosa emphasized, saying that it "acted on people" and "tended to try to get out of line", and called on writers to "not succumb to frivolity" and "take responsibility" for their mission.
The weather is making the party in Pozoblanc a little less exciting - the spears are missing
The spear performance that closes the festival in Pozoblanc was canceled yesterday morning after the announcement of the performers that the surface of the square is not in good condition.
That's why the company, along with Fermín Bohórquez, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza and Leonardo Hernández, decided to cancel the bullfights.
Unfavorable weather conditions have plagued the festivities for a long time, with two of the three celebrations having been cancelled.
On Saturday, rain prevented the second scheduled bullfight.
During these, the formation of José Luis Moreno, Curro Díaz and Juan Bautista was supposed to face the bulls in the arena of Castilblanco.
But this was just a Friday night thing.
The winner was Daniel Luque, who cut off three ears and was rewarded for his dynamic and aesthetically-sounding performance by being carried on his shoulders.
That same afternoon, Alejandro Talavante exchanged two javelin wounds for a salute and an ear, which he got from the bare seats in the arena rather than the art of the bullfight.
Even worse was El Juli, who rode through the bullring of Los Llanos unsalted and unfated.
In the second round of the effort without a single breath, he earned a sharp criticism from most of the audience.
They passed a check in Alava in a van with 2,000 kilos of hashish .
Ten minutes to five.
The road inspection of Ertzaintza in the municipal district of Armiñón (Álava).
The officers stop two people in a van and they run away.
A shipment of more than two tons of hashish is unstoppable.
According to the report of the Department of the Interior of the Basque Government, the officers pursued and detained one of the persons in the van, a man of 38 years, who was identified as A. A. J.
The man in custody has been charged with drug trafficking and forging government documents.
The incident occurred when several members of the Transport Unit were conducting a road check on the N-1 in places where it crosses the border of the Armiñón city district.
They were about to stop the van for a check, but the driver disobeyed instructions, accelerated sharply, and drove off.
The authorities immediately began to pursue the vehicle, and when it came to a stop on the side of the road a few miles away, both passengers jumped out and fled into the forest.
The Ertzaint agents eventually caught up with one of them and confiscated 2,178 kilograms of hashish that the suspects were transporting, as revealed during a search of an Iveco Daily van.
The back of the vehicle was loaded with packets of hashish, which were then transported to other police departments for detailed expertise and weighing of the drugs.
In addition, the police found that the license plate was "forged" and did not match the information on the delivery documents, so the detainee was also accused of falsifying state documents.
The search continues for the second suspect, who, as mentioned, managed to escape, so that the origin of the seized drugs can finally be determined.
The arrested A. A. J., 28 years old, has been transferred to the police department to complete the necessary formalities before he can proceed with further investigation.
Actress Heather Locklear arrested for driving under the influence of drugs.
Actress Heather Locklear, the beloved Amanda of Melrose Place, was arrested this weekend in Santa Barbara, California, for driving under the influence of drugs.
A witness saw her perform unusual maneuvers while trying to get out of a parking lot in Montecito, a spokesman for the California Highway Patrol told People magazine.
The witness said that at about 4:30 p.m., Locklear "screwed the accelerator, slid back and forth in the noise, and tried to get out of the parking lot - overturning her sunglasses several times".
A witness who apparently didn't recognize the actress at first saw Locklear a moment later pulling over on a nearby highway and getting out of the vehicle.
The person also alerted the emergency services because "he feared for Locklear's life".
When a police patrol arrived, they found the actress inside a vehicle that had partially blocked the road.
"She appeared to be disoriented", and so the officers took her to a specialized drug and alcohol testing center.
A police spokesman said the actress cooperated and alcohol abuse was ruled out immediately, but "we believe Locklear was under the influence of some medication, which was apparent to the officers at first glance".
Locklear was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of an unspecified substance and taken into custody at around 7pm, although she was released a few hours later.
Two months ago, Locklear returned from a treatment clinic where she was recovering from anxiety and depression.
Llamazares urges the Andalusian IU to exercise its powers in the Silva case
The general director of the IU and United Left MP Gaspar Llamazares said today that the final decision in the case of the former Seville Youth and Sports Council member Francisco Manuela Silvy, who resigned last week after being accused of acting in favor of his family, will depend on the regional party association.
"I'm too federalist for that, it's up to the Andalusian organization to exercise its powers", Llamazares suggested in a speech to which the party will have to step in relation to a former Seville city council member.
However, the head of the IU insisted that "transparency" was absolutely necessary in the case of investigations into the illegal acts committed by Silva: "The IU has always fought for the maximum transparency in such matters".
He also stressed that the party has a "strict code of ethics for all public functions".
"Flower blood", the epic wager of Garcia
Inspired by Benito Pérez Galdós' Episodes from the National Past, José Luis Garci's film "Blood of May" (Sangre de mayo) recreates the famous Spanish uprising against the French - the most ambitious film in his filmography, with a budget of around 15 million euros.
In this way, the filmmaker wanted to "draw on the eloquence of the characters and the analysis of society" that he had always admired in the work of the famous novelist, he explained today, together with Quim Gutiérrez and Paula Echevarría, during the presentation of the film to a large team of interpreters.
Blood Flower with a running time of two and a half hours will be released in cinemas this Friday and in the future there are more than four hours of series for Telemadrid TV.
As a great admirer of the literary work of Galdós, José Luis Garci claims that by making this film he has fulfilled his "childhood dream", which he owes to Esperanza Aguirre, who commissioned him three years ago for the Autonomous Province of Madrid to film the bicentennial of Madrid on May 2, he accepted the offer with the fact that the plot would be based on Episodios del pasado nacional.
The 15 million budget, which was entirely contributed by the Madrid province, represents a "unique opportunity" for García to create an environment with backdrops and costumes that match the image of "a crumbling Spain that had been wrong in the leader it was worth fighting for - the struggle for independence under Ferdinand VII. led to the decline and backwardness of the country", he said.
The director regrets, however, that he cannot count on the financial support that was given to the films Ala triste (The Sad Wing) or Goya's Ghosts - almost twice the amount of La Sangre de flores (The Blood of Flowers) - so he could not shoot some scenes from a script signed at the same time by Horacio Valcárcel, with whom he works almost throughout his film career.
The director of the film Volver a empezar works as he is accustomed to - on the stage with actors with whom he usually rehearses before filming and who he does not cast because he finds it "humiliating" and also believes that "part of the director's job is to go to theatres and cinemas and find out what is going on in the craft he is involved in".
Many of the actors he has chosen for May's Blood have appeared in front of his camera several times, such as Miguel Rellán, Carlos Larrañaga or Fernando Guillén Cuervo.
Garcia, who has four Oscar nominations, one of which he won, believes that none of the three candidates representing Spain this year before the Hollywood Academy, the "July Blood", the "Seven Tables of the French Billiards" and the last one chosen, "Blind Sunflowers", represent the young generation of the Spanish film scene, but he claims that "they will appear".
Garci's not going to get any awards for this movie.
"At first you think you're working for what's next, but then you realize you're only working for the money, and you're willing to make one more movie", explains Garci, who has been directing for more than 30 years.
Isabel Bayón brings to life the spiritual legacy of the Sevillian dancer Tortola Valencia
The Seville flamenco dancer will pay tribute to another Seville dancer.
Carmen Tórtola Valencia, whose father was Catalan (Florenç Tórtola Ferrer) and mother was Andalusca (Georgina Valencia Valenzuela), was born in the district of Triana, and when she was three years old, they moved with their family to London.
She was a modern dancer and specialized in oriental dances.
She lived a passionate life, she was a pioneer of women's emancipation like Isadora Duncan, Virginia Woolf or Sarah Bernhardt.
She was a Buddhist and a vegetarian, and fought for the abolition of the corset, which prevented women from moving freely.
The life of this woman, influenced by the dance and aesthetic revolution of interwar Europe, was enriched by Isabelle Bayón.
"I wanted to work with Peppa Gamboa and she suggested this character to me - it seemed incredible".
According to the dancer, "it's not about telling her life, it's about capturing the soul.
The titles of her dances reminded me of the rhythms of flamenco.
So I think "butterfly dance" was a guajiro or "snake dance" was a tango.
Her dance was sensual and I was told that my dance was also in keeping with this aesthetic", he says.
The performance will feature two exceptional personalities: Miguel Veda, who will sing Isabella in one performance as in "La puerta abierta" (The Open Door), and the dance teacher Matilde Coral, who made an exception and agreed to collaborate with her former pupil.
"Matilde represents the elder Tortola, a mature character.
I'm happy that she accepted the offer to be part of my project, and it's a great honor for me".
The performance also features music and guitars by Jesús Torres and Paco Arriaga, with vocals by Miguel Ortega, el Pulga and Moi de Morón; drums by El Pájara, viola by Rafa El Viola and the collaboration of actor Juanfry Juárez, "who plays the role of the eternal guide of this kind of artist who are primadones with everything, and who are always in love with them".
The play also takes into account the life of this woman, who was in her time in such distant places as India, the United States or Russia, and also throughout Europe, because she usually stayed in London.
"I wanted to remember her because I think she was one of those women who had a huge influence at a certain time, but no one knows her today, and even less appreciates her work", says Bayón.
The show starts at 8.30 tonight at the Lope de Vega Theatre.
The book "The Diary of a Newly Married Man" concludes the triennial
The presentation of the first illustrated edition of the "Diary of the Newlyweds" in Saint Stephen's Church (New York), the place where Juan Ramón Jiménez married Zenobia in March 1916, is part of the programme coordinated by the Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia to celebrate the "Triennial of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" (2006-2008), organised to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the award of the Nobel Prize in Literature and the anniversary of their death.
The "Triennale of Zenobia and Juan Ramón" is drawing to a close with a new edition of this work, an international congress to be held in New York, the renovation of the Nobel Museum House, and the traveling exhibition "Juan Ramón Jiménez: A Ray of Sunshine", which opened in May of this year and, after touring various Andalusian provinces, is scheduled to move to New York in time for the congress.
The Cultural Council of the Autonomous Government of Andalusia has also ordered eight hundred copies of "Diary of a Newly Married Man", edited by Pedro Tabernero and illustrated by Jacob Pérez-Encis, to continue spreading awareness about the personality and work of one of the most prominent Andalusian poets.
America without Paul Newman doesn't like itself so much anymore.
"Sometimes God makes perfect people.
Paul Newman was one of them".
These are the words of actress Sally Field, who worked with him on "No Evil Intention" and, under the weight of knowing that Newman is gone, reveals her unhappy vision of an abandoned American cinema and of America as a whole.
Look how long it took them to get an Oscar.
And that he'd been retired since 2007.
And that he was known to be gravely ill.
He was a big man to everyone, though.
"Sometimes what you feel can't be expressed in any way, and I've lost a great friend", Robert Redford said in tears, "my life and my country were better because of him".
No one was afraid of being ridiculous or exaggerating.
The father of cinema and the nation died in a particularly dark time of fear of terrorists and financial markets, a time when American self-esteem is at its lowest, when the world is desperately searching for reasons to be proud.
When times are tough and people lack virtue and there are only a few people worth admiring, you don't have to be Luis Cernuda to love Paul Newman.
For all of them, he embodied an almost Platonic ideal of beauty and truth.
He was an official opponent of Richard Nixon and a fighter for both lost and won cases, from a drug addiction charity founded in honor of his firstborn son who died of an overdose to his own brand of homemade food and organic foods.
A true treasure for a country that has fought hard to break free from a suicidal food culture.
A storm of admiration has swept Hollywood, regardless of nationality or citizenship.
The last James Bond, the Englishman Daniel Craig, stated that not one man died, but an era.
Another Englishman, Oscar winner Sam Mendes, said that working with Newman was the pinnacle of his career.
The bad boy from Australia, Russell Crowe, has dared to name Newman as his greatest source of inspiration.
"That fox has set a pretty high bar for all of us", says George Clooney, perhaps one of the few men in this day and age who has the courage to try to live the life of Paul Newman - a life of integrity and a serious private life away from the cameras.
That's not always easy, sometimes not even possible, in today's media jungle.
But fortunately, that's the kind of people they are, and Paul Newman is their role model.
He was divorced once, and since then he's been married for 50 years to Joanne Woodward, to whom he's been faithful, though he's had more than enough opportunities not to be.
"Why would I go out for a hamburger when I have a steak at home?" he liked to joke.
May he be proud in heaven to have a consensus among his daughters and admirers on earth - not a common thing in America.
It is said that "of all the great roles he played, he was most proud of his role as a devoted husband, loving father, willing grandfather, and self-sacrificing philanthropist".
The Unfinished Games of the Madrid Olympics
Yes, many of us long for the Olympics to be held in Madrid, and after the failure of 2012, it will be possible in 2016.
But I ask, are we ready?
If we're going to go by yesterday's race, I say no!
It was touted as the perfect race, and in my judgment, it was the worst I'd ever been on.
Such a load of crap that if it came to an evaluation and I was the probationary, it would be clearly inadequate.
But let's take a look at it from the beginning, one thing at a time.
The nonsense starts with picking up a race number, which makes you have to leave early.
I don't think it's a bad idea, but if you're going to go there, give them everything (including a chip to prevent the runway from overcrowding).
No, you won't.
Here, you had to pick up a number (the first nonsense, going there just for that) and (after making the proper front) - what a surprise! - they only had a size S shirt (the second nonsense, because I need a size XL).
Where do we live?
Is it because of the crisis that they decided to buy only small T-shirts because they are less fabric and cheaper?
Well, those are small details compared to what happened on race day.
Besides having to go very early to get the chip and the line on it lasting over 15 minutes, he had to drop off the bag there.
The wait time was over 35 minutes, which is at a race where 11,000 people are expected, which is incomprehensible.
So, as you might expect, the race had started and we hadn't unloaded our bags yet, and when we did, the pickup was much worse.
The wait was further extended by 40 minutes of rain, which led to a general riot and attack on the cabin.
I believe 500 of us will have bronchitis tomorrow, and some, like me, will not get the right timing in the evaluation of the results because of the chip they gave me, which I assume did not record my start time correctly.
Of course, if someone asked me about a perfect race, I wouldn't have thought of this one.
So I guess we'll just have to dream about a well-prepared Olympic city.
Microsoft is looking for a (virtual) receptionist
At the MIT Technology Conference, Microsoft demonstrated further developments in a new system for image recognition and human interaction in the form of artificial intelligence - not very intelligent, but capable of performing basic tasks such as hailing a taxi (or in Microsoft's case, a messenger that would move around the company's premises) and perceiving what it hears in conversation.
With a camera and a system that recognizes faces and shapes, these receptionists can determine how many people are in a room, who they are - even remembering what they are wearing - and listen to and understand key words in their conversations.
They also know how to classify the audience by conversation group.
In the demonstration video, the receptionist notices the third person and understands that he is not part of the group talking to him and that he is not an employee of the company.
He asks her if she's seeing someone, and he tells her he'll be with her in a moment.
All without the blue screen of death.
That's wonderful.
But of course, that's the music of the future.
Now the company has more important things to do, like a new version of the Windows operating system.
There's been a lot of talk this week about Microsoft changing its strategy.
Windows 7 will be lighter and will not have as many associated programs.
Steve Ballmer found that if computers had only the bare essentials, unencumbered by commercial redundancy, they would be five times more powerful -- man, Steve, they'd be cheaper.
Discovery is like thunder, considering Microsoft is adding new features and "extras" to Windows version by version.
A change of course would be a merit.
He's right, the operating system is slowly losing its importance, and so is the software.
When Google Chrome came online, I became one of those people who subscribed to the theory that it was Google's first step to compete with Windows.
Many have rightly pointed out that the browser is not an operating system.
The operating system will always be necessary because it's the necessary layer for communication between the hardware and the software.
It has the same function as your wife or your husband when you have something to say to the mother.
That's right, yeah.
It never goes away, but you have to think of the death of the operating system not as an absolute truth, but as a relative truth.
What Ballmer said this week supports that idea.
People are paying less and less attention to the operating system and more attention to the web browser.
The computer turns on to start Firefox or Explorer or Chrome, and we spend more time on the Internet every day than we do in the windows.
What's half the applications that go with the system?
Less is more.
And Windows 7 has to be smaller, much smaller than Vista.
Less heavy, less loaded, less complex.
Microsoft is now interested in offering its services online and finally becoming an alternative to Google.
They desperately need it, and here's a little example.
This is a picture I took in a Microsoft employee lounge in Redmond earlier this month.
There was a poster on the beverage machine asking them to use their search tools: "Your Search. Our Future".
In 2006, an independent study showed that 66% of Microsoft employees used Google to search the Internet.
Last week, by the way, we confirmed the delay of the new version of Windows Mobile 7.
It's not coming at the beginning of 2009, but at the end, so let's start in 2010.
I'm sure Microsoft will try to bring Windows 7 and Windows Mobile 7 together.
The phone is becoming more and more like a computer.
Since Android and iPhone are already on the market, they'll have to pay dearly for the delay.
The Fabuleux Marcel
Pablo Picasso wore it on the Côte d'Azur, Leonardo di Caprio in a glowing one in Edward Zwick's Blood Diamond, as did Al Pacino in Francis Ford Coppola's Godfather, and it's part of the uniform of the muscular gay community.
And if we want to delve into the list of his life roles, we can dive right into the image of a typical muscular, pointy-nosed man who lifts the bar in a traveling circus.
Basically, it's nothing more than a typical cotton man's underbelly, sleeveless and snug.
English speakers call it a 'tank', but le Fabuleux Marcel of Brussels stands out above all the others.
Firstly, for his nickname - although he is known colloquially as 'Marcel' - which has a sporting connection, because, as legend has it, he was named after boxer Marcelo Cerdanu, a lover of singer Edith Piaf.
'Marcel' stands out from the rest in its high-quality cotton, unisex cut, distinctive label and the (almost imperceptible) Belgian flag, which the most emblematic models of the mammals wear as a neck detail.
And be careful, because the Belgian company doesn't specialize in tank tops.
They also make college sweaters, retro boxer shorts, cashmere sweaters, cotton pants, navy shirts, kids' suits, mini shorts...
Thoughtful pieces for comfortable underwear.
Although it's a shame they're just underwear.
They're too beautiful.
"I want to be a young mother, I don't care who the father is".
Her great similarity to her sister did not prevent her from developing her own personality.
Monica Cruz, though small in stature, is a woman of life.
The Cruz sisters are taking their new fashion venture very seriously.
For Monica, it means more than just some pretty, famous girl lending her name.
In Paris, she attended a promotional event held by Mango in its new headquarters, as well as the announcement of the less important fashion awards sponsored by the Spanish firm.
She's warm and shy, and she'll get you close.
Tell us what you're doing in Paris.
I'm here to present the new collection that my sister Penelope and I designed for Mango for this fall-winter season, and I'm also attending the second annual Mango Fashion Awards and the Valentine's Day dinner at the Opera.
So it was a challenging, but also an exciting day.
What is the basis of your new collection for Mango, for whom you've been working for four seasons?
My sister and I love movies from the '50s and '60s, and we drew a lot of inspiration from them.
I also love to walk around town and watch women walk around in their clothes, and combine and layer their clothes, and I do that a lot.
You're a dancer, an actress, a designer, a very versatile woman, aren't you?
I think so, but in the end, everything is connected and there's a lot of connections.
I mean, I was starting to like clothes, and I just kept wanting to go to my grandmother's, and go through my aunt's closets and look at her clothes.
That was awesome, almost better than going to the fair.
Then, when I became a dancer, I always tried to be careful about what I wore.
You know, we dancers are built on how we're set up to feel good in our classes and our rehearsals when we look in the mirror.
And as an actress, when they give you a costume, that's when you really get into the character.
So everything is connected, but with great respect for designers and professionalism.
You just turned 30 and you had a breakdown?
No, you can't.
I feel better than I've ever felt, and I'm thirty.
I find that a woman is ready, she has experience and enjoys life with fewer mistakes.
I'm not scared of the biological clock.
From childhood, I have done what I wanted to do, and that has given me great inner happiness.
So are you thinking about being a mother or not?
Of course, I know I'm going to be a mother because my body demands it, and besides, I want to be a young mom, and I don't want to miss it.
As far as my dad is concerned, I'm not worried about that.
But I know one thing for sure, I will make my child experience happiness and I will raise him with great love.
As for the movie, you're about to see a few premieres of movies you made last year.
It is, and I'm looking forward to seeing it in theaters.
I come from the theater world, and I'm very impatient and restless, and I want everything now, and of course, that's not possible.
I look forward to the premieres of "La ultima hora" and "En busca de la tumba de Cristo" and I'm going to be a very good one.
I'll see how you like them.
You had your premiere on the observation deck a few days ago alongside Naomi Campbell, is that correct?
Well, don't say that then.
It's not like I'm gonna go stand on the pier like a model.
I just got a call from Naomi Campbell, who I've known for a long time, and she invited me to London to do a benefit show for her organization Women for a Better Life, and the clothes that we showed -- I even picked two of our collection for Mango -- went on sale, and the proceeds were donated to this Naomi NGO.
People don't know that Naomi has such a good heart.
There's a lot of things said about her, and I know her, and I can tell you that a lot of them aren't true.
Besides, I'll stick to the good he's involved in.
She asked me to do a charity show, but if she asks me to do a stand, I'll do it.
For the sake of the women of the Third World, I will do whatever it takes.
Drivers repeatedly caught with alcohol in their blood will have to install an "alcolock"
The Department of the Interior requires that a driver with three administrative penalties for drunk driving must install a system in his car that prevents him from starting the car while drunk or if he is not breathing.
The proposal was announced in June this year and is now included in the annual report of the Office of the Prosecutor General, which states that it is a pilot project that will last for one year.
The aim is to put drivers back behind the wheel, so drivers will also have to undergo a course of traffic re-education.
The experience will be shared by the National Transport Safety Authority, the Directorate-General for Transport (DGT) and the Foundation of the Technological Institute for Automobile Safety (FITSA).
Statistics show that between 30 and 75 percent of drivers charged with more than one DUI will re-enter the DUI.
Alcolock should prevent this, as it is a system attached to the vehicle that measures the level of alcohol in the exhaled air and prevents the car from starting if the driver does not breathe before or if a higher than permitted alcohol concentration is recorded.
It costs more than €1,000 and would have to be paid by the offender.
A study carried out in the USA in 2007 showed that, in the first year of implementation, the number of overtaking was reduced by 65% in vehicles equipped with this device.
In Spain, it is estimated that 115 lives could be saved each year.
The measure is limited to administrative sanctions for two reasons: to address this behaviour before it becomes a criminal offence.
And to facilitate its implementation, since the legal adjustment can be done in the usual way, the necessary adjustment of the penal provisions requires a change of the law.
The device is not yet available on the Spanish market in any commercial version, although it has already been installed on a trial basis in some industrial and public utility vehicles.
The Congress of Deputies will vote tomorrow on a proposal by the PSOE (Spanish Socialist Workers' Party) which recommends installing this system in school buses, as is the case in France.
In Mexico and without the "peeptoes"
At exactly 5.40pm, as scheduled, the Spanish Air Force plane carrying the Prince and Princess of Asturias landed in the Presidential hangar at Benita Juárez Airport in Mexico City.
The sun had just set, but its rays had not yet been able to close their eyes to see the newlyweds emerge from the plane.
Under the stairs was the Spanish ambassador and other officials.
A few hours ago, I was on the street asking a cab driver if he knew that the Spanish prince and princess were coming for a state visit.
- Yeah, that's great, it's not gonna be easy to get to the airport to pick up people... she's from here or what...
- No, no, sir, she's Spanish, but she's lived here for a few years.
- Yeah, that's what I mean.
But the Mexican press knows who the Prince and Princess of Asturias are and how important their visit is.
Many people are waiting in the airport hangar, just off the red carpet and the military cordon, which is made up of 27 Marines ready to fire a salvo.
The prince appears with a smile on his lips in a dark blue dress and the princess, very modestly dressed and with pink hair, does not have her usual "peeptoes", apparently she has been informed that a storm is threatening in D. F.
Before entering the hall where the official delegation is waiting, they smile at the photographers and casually interrupt them.
At the door of their hotel, one of the four largest in the city, they are greeted by a distinguished Mexican television reporter.
Best subsidised fashion price
There is perhaps no place in the world more suitable for fashion awards than Paris and perhaps no designer more distinguished and more well-liked than Valentino.
Mango has just announced the second annual El Botón-Mango Fashion Awards to give international exposure to new fashion talents.
The prize is endowed with a grant of EUR 300 000.
Belgian Sandrina Fasoli, the winner of the first year, was looking at her designs yesterday in the Manga exhibition at 54 Haussmann Boulevard in Paris and almost wept with emotion.
Sure, it's the company's second largest store in Europe and it just opened on 1335 square meters.
The largest is in London.
A series of events, coupled with a desire to thank designer Valentin for taking over the jury chair, led to a lavish dinner at the Paris Opera Garnier.
The chair table, solemnly decorated by Mango, looked even more magnificent next to the most distinguished works of Chagall.
Heartbroken and with a muted expression over the recent death of her brother, Naty donned the brand's dress and the breathable ELAH jewelry, and, suspended from her son, Luís, a nearly six-foot-tall elegant man, she accompanied Valentina to the head of the table at a dinner in his honor.
Andik, the boss and owner of Mango, took the welcome and as a true gentleman, he and Baron Rothschild were left without jackets, for they both offered them to two ladies.
Monica Cruizou, who arrived at the store in hand-made trousers and a shirt, and dressed up in a long black sexy dress for dinner, took a night walk through the Opera accompanied by Goya Toledova, showed us the ballet rehearsal room, and, recalling other times, grabbed one of the sticks and gestured "grand plié".
Inés Sastre did not stay long to tour the adjacent buildings of the palace, but before leaving, she showed us pictures of her son in her cell phone.
The next morning we were able to enjoy the presence of Oliver Martinez - another young man on a motorcycle - and John Travolta, who arrived at the Intercontinental Hotel in Paris with his own sheets and towels and had asked in advance that no perfume be used in his rooms.
The stars under the starry Parisian sky.
Oh, there, that's the life.
1001 - number of stress tests
Not 1,000, but 1,000 plus one way to forget the chaos and frenzy of everyday life.
And to make matters worse, they're all in one book that will be brought to bookstores on September 30th.
The alarm clock chimes every morning at 7 o'clock as a punishment, but it is even worse to imagine oneself being consumed by the rushed rhythm that contemporary life brings.
The office is called tension and the computer is called back pain.
Stress is the disease of the 21st century.
But there is no one, no two, way to combat daily exhaustion and to disengage from the world of work.
No, that number is not greater than 1001 and not less than 1001.
Beyond yoga poses, classic massages, and spa treatments, Susannah Marriott has assembled a whole "menu" of options in the pages of her book, tailored to each individual's taste and time capabilities.
The stress-relieving book is called "1001 Ways to Relax" and, thanks to Pearson Alhambra and DK Publishing, it will bring peace to the bookstore.
If anyone thinks that it is impossible to achieve peace of mind in such areas as work or personal relationships, the "Handbook" refutes this view.
In addition, it offers other ways to be in contact with nature or 100% natural recipes that contribute to relaxation.
If your adrenaline is no longer flowing, and stress has become a problem, it is time to sit down on the couch, turn off the lights, and concentrate on your reading.
Speaking in Your Sleep
Some children talk at night.
I don't mean the ones that wake up and tell us something that happened the day before, but the ones that talk while they sleep.
When it happens for the first time, it might scare you, but it's actually meaningless.
It's a harmless sleep disorder called somniloquio.
It's quite common, especially in children and adolescents.
I'm sure some of you have heard him talk in his sleep.
This phenomenon may occur very sporadically (for example, once in a lifetime with high fevers) or with greater regularity (every day, once a week, once every few months...), the next day the child does not remember anything.
There's no one reason that would explain her attack.
It is often associated with other sleep disorders, such as nightmares, night-time rabies, nocturnal enuresis (night wetting), or somnambulism, but not necessarily.
As mentioned earlier, it can often be accompanied by very high fevers, stressful or exasperating situations.
In any case, it's a little-studied phenomenon.
The intensity with which it appears varies as well.
A child may speak in a calm voice, say individual words, whisper, or the opposite (screams, cries, long speeches, etc.).
In cases where it is strong, it would be appropriate to observe the child and consult a professional to see if there is a problem that is causing great anxiety and manifesting in this way.
We said it's a benign disorder, so it's not treated unless it's combined with another sleep disorder that can be treated (such as when it's associated with apnea syndrome or with chronic stress).
But we can do so by keeping in mind some very simple precautions, such as:
Try not to disturb the child too much before he goes to bed.
So seek out quiet games and avoid scary or somewhat violent TV programs or series.
For very nervous children and those who are hard to get along with, relaxation techniques can be used to help them gain a measure of inner calm.
It will help the baby sleep better.
If you experience somnolence, try to remain calm.
Remind yourself that they are harmless to the child and that the next day he will remember nothing of what happened.
Helpful Counsel
Don't be him.
It's useless because he's not conscious and you're interrupting his sleep.
Even if he talks, he sleeps, and therefore rests.
Remember that if you notice that he seems to be very anxious in a succession of occasions, it would be a good idea to seek advice or to find out what is causing the child to be so anxious.
If he is able to understand what you are saying (which is not usually the case), avoid the temptation to question him and extract information from him.
It won't do any good, because when he's asleep, he's not conscious enough to organize his thoughts.
Moreover, you may hear what he says but you do not know what he is dreaming and why he is saying it, so be very careful how you interpret the information and draw your conclusions.
Never tell a child that you can ask him his secrets at night.
Not even for fun.
It's a very anxious situation.
Don't worry, it's nothing bad, it's just an episode that lasts only a few minutes.
Illhaeusern... at last
Illhaeusern has finally found a way to win again after a long period of weight loss.
Without playing a particularly big match, the yellow-blacks created more chances and managed to turn one of them into a winner.
The game was not very fast during this encounter, in which the attackers were barely making progress.
After the first attempt of the captain of the Kauffmann guests, who shot from a distance just a hair of the railway, Illhaeusern began to have a slight advantage and first Fonderflick from a distance, then Hirne by air, Romain on a long leg or Diebold gradually came to startle the defense of Dannemarie.
The opponent, on the other hand, has built a defensive wall in the middle of the field, leaving only the agile Riahi on the attack.
The start of the second half proved decisive, firstly thanks to two chances from Dannemarie, Riahi and Temporale, and then after the opening goal for Illhaeusern, which was taken care of by Marais, who was well positioned to handle the ball bounced after Diebold's previous attempt (53').
But the goalkeeper Illhaeusernu was not happy for long, and after about twelve minutes he was forced to return to the dressing room, leaving his teammates in a state of weakness.
However, Dannemarie was unable to take advantage of this and the Illhaeusern eleven, who only slightly withdrew to "shake" the defense, did not cause any major problems, except for the very last seconds of the match, when the ball passed very close to the log after a great confusion.
Sarkozy goes to the rescue of angry fishermen
Before leaving for the United States, Nicolas Sarkozy will take a ride through the Bretagne.
To face the demonstration of the fishermen's forces, who had severely disrupted access to several Breton and Normandy ports on Monday, the French President decided to go to the port of Guilvinec in Finistère on Tuesday morning to meet their representatives.
The latter promised to be received "in a constructive spirit", and hope that he will "come with concrete proposals".
The presidential visit comes at the same time as the general meeting of the "crisis committee" created by Breton fishermen to obtain measures against the sharp rise in oil prices, which reached a peak exceeding an average of 1.14 euros per liter.
According to the spokesman for the Elysée, David Martinon, the President "will discuss with them the solutions that can be envisaged to help their companies regain competitiveness and better secure the conditions of employment and pay for seafarers".
Nicolas Sarkozy is expected by fishermen with relentlessness.
On Tuesday morning, they carried out an operation "hélésidée" (operation of slow moving vehicles) in the departments of Morbihan and Calvados, causing a nearly 10km gridlock.
The recreational port of Quiberon was also blocked, but the connections to Belle-île were not interrupted.
A filtration dam has been activated on the Kiberón peninsula.
The sailors showed their determination on Monday, when, just before dawn, they burned tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots of the ports of Brest and Lorient, while demonstrations were held in Concarneau and Saint-Brieuc.
The movement spread to other ports on the Atlantic coast and the English Channel, such as Sables d'Olonne in the Vendée, where trawlers remained in port, or Le Havre, where some twenty vessels blocked the traffic of merchant ships.
Fishermen from Turballe and Croisico in the Loire-Atlantique region stopped a blockade of an important Total refinery in Donges during the evening.
The Boulogne-sur-Mer people decided to wait until Wednesday's meeting at the Ministry before they could take action.
In Guilvinec, the "crisis committee" is to decide on Tuesday how to continue on the path it has started and on its participation in the upcoming meeting at the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries in Paris.
But some Breton fishermen do not want to be represented by the heads of the fisheries department, who have not supported their movement.
"The strike will continue" because "the fishermen will not leave anything" and "they do not want to come to Paris", said Liliane Cariou, president of the fishing department of Lorient.
Professional fishermen who do not pay the oil tax currently pay around 50 cents a litre, but they believe that the profitability threshold of the vessel is only reached when the oil is below 0.30 euro a litre.
Paul Newman the great
The unforgettable star of "Butch Cassidy and the Kid" died of cancer at the age of 83 at his home in Connecticut.
Hillary and Bill Clinton, Nicolas Sarkozy, George Clooney, Julia Roberts, Robert Redford and Sam Mendes all paid tribute to the movie legend and politically engaged actor Paul Newman, who died at the age of 83.
Embraer maintains its 2008 delivery forecasts
The Brazilian aircraft manufacturer is counting on 215 aircraft to be delivered this year, despite the threat of a recession looming over the world economy.
Embraer, the world's fourth aircraft manufacturer, maintains its 2008 delivery forecast of 215 delivered aircraft, its president, Fredrico Fleury Curado, has confirmed.
In the first half of the year, the manufacturer delivered 97 aircraft.
The Brazilian manufacturer has high hopes for the Chinese market, especially considering the range of its aircraft from 30 to 120 seats.
To date, Embraer has delivered 41 machines to Chinese customers over a span of eight years.
AIG is said to be considering a divestment of 15% of its assets
American International Group, which has been overwhelmed by the U.S. Treasury, is considering selling more than 15 percent of its assets to pay off $85 billion in collateral, reports the Sunday edition of the Financial Times.
AIG is prepared to explore the sale of most of its non-life activities internationally and its pension activities in the United States, the daily said, citing sources close to the talks.
AIG's board of directors met on Sunday evening to discuss the possible handover, according to the FT.
No confirmatory statement could be obtained from AIG.
The assets to be divested by AIG include its subsidiary International Lease Financial Corp., its 59% stake in the reinsurer Transatlantic Holdings, as well as its real estate portfolio and private equity investments, adds FT.
No final decision has yet been taken on these transfers, the FT continues.
AIG needs to raise cash quickly to pay off an $85 billion loan from the Federal Reserve Bank at the risk of the US authorities confiscating 80% of its capital, while diluting the existing shareholder ratio.
Analysis of the historic meeting of the Morning Meeting
The New York Stock Exchange recorded a historic decline on Monday after the House of Representatives rejected Paulson's plan to save the banks: Dow Jones lost 6.98%, an unprecedented loss approaching 800 points, and Nasdaq 9.14%.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) dropped 777.68 points to 10,365.45 points.
The biggest point drop in its history to date (of 684.81 points) was recorded on September 17, 2001, the day trading resumed after the September 11 terrorist attacks.
The technology-dominated Nasdaq index fell by 199.61 points to 1 983.73 points, according to final data after the close of trading, and the Standard & Poor's 500 index fell by 8.81% (i.e. 106.85 points) to 1 106.55 points.
With a downturn since the beginning of the session, Wall Street has literally collapsed after the House of Representatives unexpectedly rejected a plan to rescue the banks, a plan that was supposed to allow the markets to regain some stability.
By a vote of 228 to 205, the House of Representatives refused to provide Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson with the funds he had requested.
Nearly two out of three Republicans rejected his plan.
"It's a bad signal to the market that Congress is not able to pass a plan", said FTN Financial's Lindsey Piegza.
'It shows how much the market was counting on this plan,' she added, expressing concern that the project adopted in a few days might have come 'too late'.
"If this project is indeed doomed . . . , the relay will be immediately passed on to the Fed and other central banks to help ease the crisis, further solidifying credit conditions", warned Brian Bethune, chief economist at Global Insight.
And emphasizing the urgency of the situation, Piegza noted that in the United States "every new day brings the collapse of a financial institution".
After the Washington Mutual collapse on Friday, the authorities organized a buyout of Wachovia's banking operations with its rival, Citigroup.
In Europe, the crisis has taken a sudden turn and has called for immediate intervention on behalf of banks in the UK, Benelux, Iceland and Germany, indicating that markets are dealing "not just with the American crisis but with a global crisis", added an analyst from FTN Financial.
The bond market is up.
The 10-year cash receipts are down to 3,632% from 3,827% on Friday night, the 30-year yield is down to 4,161% from 4,357% the day before.
Obama won by points in the first televised duel
The first debate between the two candidates on Friday was followed by a second debate at the White House, which was to determine who won, John McCain or Barack Obama.
The campaign leaders of the Republican and Democratic parties were not surprised when they both announced their victory in a televised duel that was watched by a third of American families.
Political analyst David Gergen believes that John McCain's performance, as decent as it was, was not "brilliant" enough to allow him to stop, five weeks before the presidential election, a decline in the polls.
Gallup, whose poll released Saturday credits Obama with a five-point lead (49% to 44% for McCain), believes the Democrat is the winner of the duel.
Among the undecided voters who matter most, Obama is the winner for 39% of those polled, while, according to the CBS poll, 25% attribute the victory to McCain.
Obama should be able to confirm his lead on Thursday by the expected good performance of his running mate, Joseph Biden, during his first and only public debate with his opponent, Sarah Palin.
"It would be a mistake to underestimate her.
She's talented", Bill Clinton said over the weekend.
McCain, 70, consistently touted his undeniable foreign policy expertise while emphasizing his opponent's "naivety" on the issues that were at the heart of the first encounter.
"Senator Obama does not seem to understand that"... was the repeated charge.
"I don't think Senator Obama has the experience and knowledge to be president", he assured me.
That's the offensive spirit in which the Republican TV spots have been aired since yesterday.
Obama, on the other hand, emphasized that it represents the future.
He kept his head on straight and proved himself to be concise and precise.
He praised his ability to make the right decisions and restore the good name of the United States to the world.
"McCain still doesn't understand, while Obama does", responded a Democratic spot this weekend, blasting the Republican for not considering the impact of the crisis on "the average American".
"In the 90 minutes of debate, John McCain had a lot to say about me, but nothing about you", Obama said yesterday to 20,000 people gathered at a North Carolina rally in the pouring rain.
He didn't even use words like "middle class" or "working class". Financial decline clearly benefits Obama, who Americans see as more likely to rescue the economy from the brink.
"Next week could be a decisive turning point", the influential Democratic senator Charles Schumer predicted yesterday.
Democratic Rep. Rahm Emanuel, a former member of the Clinton administration, compared Obama's "economic foresight" to that of Bill Clinton during the 1998 financial crisis.
For the Democratic candidate, the current disaster is "the final verdict of eight years of bad economic policies, as implemented by George Bush and supported by Senator McCain".
The Illinois senator reaffirmed that despite Wall Street's unexpected leaps he should be able to cut taxes for 95% of Americans, and also noted that achieving eventual energy independence for the country by promoting renewable energy sources is his number one priority, along with the establishment of a health insurance system.
McCain, on the other hand, plans to build a park with 45 nuclear power plants by 2030.
Both candidates have carefully avoided questions about the $700 billion bailout package passed by Congress last night, which is deeply unpopular.
"Did you notice that there were some elections in Minsk?"
Young people and opponents of the regime demonstrated on the main square of the Belarusian capital on Sunday evening to reject the results of the parliamentary elections in advance.
Several hundred Belarusians gathered on the main square in Minsk on Sunday evening, immediately after the polls closed, to protest against the irregularity of the parliamentary elections.
Although no results have been announced yet, many young people have come to demonstrate against the regime of President Lukashenko: "dictator, demisi".
Some admit that they did not vote. "What's the point", says one youth, "if they can do whatever they want with my vote anyway".
He does not believe that this regime, which has been friendly to foreign observers in order to resume negotiations with the European Union, would be prepared to make a turn towards democracy.
Sanctions, including visa bans on 40 Belarusian heads of state and the freezing of certain assets, could be lifted if the elections are deemed clean by observers.
The opposition says it wasn't.
"We were kept away from the election commissions and our observers were not allowed to participate in the vote count", complained Yuri Potemkin, spokesman for the Union of Democratic Forces, a diverse grouping of twelve parties.
"It's a cosmetic change", emphasizes Alexander Milinkievich, a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential election and a leading figure in the pro-European movement, "because it's who counts the votes, and in our case it's the executive.
If any opposition MPs get into Parliament, it will be by appointment, not by election.
But their entry into Parliament can mean a place on television, regional meetings and bills".
The opposition therefore feels obliged to participate in the political process, because 'dialogue with the European Union must be started.
If our economy, deeply indebted to Russia, is hit by a crisis and we don't reform, we risk becoming a protectorate of Russia.
But we want to be independent".
The opposition fears that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has been monitoring the election, will declare the election valid.
It stresses that the turnout seems to be too high and that the general introduction of early voting (26% of voters in Minsk) has opened the way to all possible manipulation.
"What, did you notice that there were some elections?" asked Social Democratic leader Alexander Kozulin, one of the last two political prisoners to be released in August this year.
"Not a foot in the polling booth.
And in the parliament, there will be a maximum of five opposition members, those who are most in line with the regime".
The night silence has returned to October Square.
On television, President Lukashenko and members of the Central Election Commission congratulate him on his success.
Interview - Blood that is Safe Again
Héma-Québec celebrated its tenth anniversary yesterday, and its president, Dr. Francine Décary, was rightly delighted, as Héma-Québec has become one of the most reliable and efficient blood suppliers in the world.
Above all, he has regained the public's trust, which was badly shaken by the contaminated blood scandal of the 1980s and 1990s.
As is well-known, the national blood bank administered by the Canadian Red Cross Transfusion Board was contaminated with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the hepatitis C virus during the 1980's.
In view of this drama and the outcry of the public, in February 1994 the Canadian government launched a public inquiry, presided over by Judge Horace Krever, to explain the circumstances that led to such a tragedy and to formulate recommendations to ensure that such a disaster never happened again.
While Judge Krever was delaying the report, some provinces started a committee to plan a new blood management system in Canada.
In Quebec, the Gélineau Committee took over this role.
According to the report by Gélineau and Krever, two suppliers were established in Canada: Héma-Québec, to supply Quebec, and the Canadian Blood Company to supply all provinces and both territories.
"When Héma-Québec started its activities in 1998, only 38% of people had confidence in the Québec blood system", recalls Dr. Décary.
"The situation was dismal.
"We have been working on this issue for a number of years, and we have been working on it for a number of years", he says, adding with pride that by the beginning of 2008, almost 94% of the Quebec population had trusted Héma-Québec.
However, Dr. Décary does not overlook the fact that "trust is a very fragile thing".
Since its founding on 28 September 1998, Héma-Québec has applied the precautionary principle.
"We were seeing a lot of cases of human-type mad cow disease in Europe at the time, a new variant of the disease called Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease", says the woman who has been running the company since its inception in 1998.
"And we didn't know if this disease could be spread through blood.
We therefore relied on one of the basic recommendations of the Krever and Gélineau report, namely that in the event of unknown and potentially serious disease, in this case Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, characterised by brain degeneration inevitably leading to death, exclusionary measures should be taken.
So in April 1999 we refused blood from people who had been in the United Kingdom for more than a month since 1980.
Then, a few years ago, it was safely proven that the disease is transmitted through blood.
So this episode showed us that the precautionary principle made sense".
In 1999, a more accurate technique for detecting HIV came on the market: nucleic acid (NAT) tests, which detect the presence of the virus itself in donor blood, rather than the presence of antibodies on which previous tests were based.
NAT has helped to shorten the silent period between the moment a patient is infected and the moment our techniques can detect the first viruses in the blood, she explains.
We've managed to shorten that period to less than a week.
We have substantially reduced the risk that some donors could be infected without us knowing and without us being able to detect it.
These improvements have made it possible to significantly reduce the risk of acquiring AIDS through blood transfusion.
The risk of receiving blood contaminated with HIV is now one in 12 million.
"In other words, this means that 12 million blood products will need to be distributed before someone becomes infected with HIV.
Since Héma-Québec distributes 400,000 to 500,000 blood products annually, it will take 24 years before the first case of HIV transmission via a blood product is reported.
I believe that today we can receive or prescribe the blood transfusion needed to heal without any fear", says the head of Héma-Québec.
"The challenge for the next decade is to keep our products safe.
We never know what pathogenic element might be in the system.
Just last year, the chikungunya virus, which is transmitted through the blood by insect bites, was discovered on the island of Réunion.
"We must always be vigilant", continues Dr. Décary, stressing that in addition to a safe supply, Héma-Québec must also be able to count on sufficient supplies.
"The needs are growing because the population is aging.
Because of more aggressive cancer treatment, patients often need a new dose of red blood cells or platelets.
The ageing of the population also has implications for the blood donor network, which on average consists of only 3% of eligible Quebecers".
Any healthy person at least 18 years of age, meeting the eligibility criteria, but can donate blood only once every 56 days, that is, six times a year.
On average, 14 percent of people who donate blood are rejected because they have AIDS or malaria, for example, and if they've visited a country where mud fever is rampant, they're excluded for a year.
"With that 3%, we can maintain a level that meets the needs of hospitals.
Deficiencies are very rare.
However, the donors in the network should be replenished in proportion to their age and their inability to donate blood.
But getting people to donate blood is a challenge, especially when it comes to keeping people motivated to become regular donors.
Life is so unrestrained today that we rarely find an hour to donate blood", laments Francine Décary.
With an annual budget of $297 million, Héma-Québec supplies not only blood products but also human tissue, such as bone grafts, heart valves, eyeballs, and skin, which is used almost exclusively for major burns.
The tissue is analyzed, processed and frozen before being stored at Héma-Québec, which also operates the only public cord blood bank in Québec.
The umbilical cord, previously considered biomedical waste, is filled with blood rich in stem cells that can be used to treat serious diseases, such as leukemia.
"A few weeks ago, we celebrated the deposit of our thousandth cord blood sample into the bank, and we anticipate receiving over a thousand a year.
Early next year, we should start offering them for transplants", says Dr. Décary, who describes the cord blood collection program as very popular.
"Some moms are disappointed that they don't have access to it", because Héma-Québec doesn't have enough funds to offer this complex and expensive program to all Quebec hospitals.
Football - Impact in the semifinals
Impact Montréal qualified for the USL First Division knockout round in the second and decisive quarterfinal match, thanks to a 3-1 victory (4:3 is the goal balance after both matches) over the Sounders from Seattle.
Midfielder Antonio Ribeiro scored the game-winning goal in the 90th minute.
After a defenseless first half, backs David Testo and Rocco Plancentino have put up the two remaining goals for Montreal.
Roger Levesque was the only one who could deal with Matt Jordan for the Sounders.
Let's remember that on Friday, in the first of two quarterfinal games, the Impact suffered a 2-1 defeat at the Starfire Complex in Tukwila, a suburb of Seattle.
The Impact will be facing off against the Vancouver Whitecaps in the semifinals.
On Saturday night in Minnesota, the Thunder tied the home game 3-1 and won 4-3, but the Whitecaps still advanced to the semifinals with a 5-4 record.
The Impact are set to face the Whitecaps on Friday and Sunday, but details of the series will be confirmed today.
The short - Kovalev 's winning goal
The Canadiens' first offensive trio is ready to begin the season.
A team of Alex Kovalev, Tomáš Plekance and Andrej Kostićin, last night at the Centre Bell, led the attack to a 3-2 victory for the Canadiens in the singles.
Kosticin, the biggest star of the match, scored, Plekanec had two assists and Kovalev had one assist in this fourth win in a three-way tie over six preliminary matches.
Kovalev secured the victory by scoring a single goal in the individual heats.
"I'm not ready yet", the Russian warned.
"I need one more game to feel good".
"He tried to do too much in the first quarter", noted Guy Carbonneau.
"But I think he appreciated the end of the game.
He got a big hand.
Charest is betting north.
The Prime Minister does not rule out calling an early election by the end of the year
Right after the Liberal Party convention, Jean Charest moved to Jean-Talon, Quebec, where the new health minister, Yves Bolduc (left), is running in today's by-election.
"Departing the last of our great northern borders": that is the long-term ambition that Jean Charest presented yesterday in a visually striking way at the end of the Quebec Liberal Party convention in Lévis, without giving any details.
During his talk, pictures were projected behind him in a kind of screen mill.
Three huge screens were running a loop with spectacular images of hydroelectric dams, mines, Quebec from Google Maps, maps, and so on.
Generous funds, like in the pre-election period.
At a press conference, the Prime Minister refused to rule out calling an early election in the autumn, even though he noted that he had a very busy schedule.
The "North Plan" is the fourth dimension of the "vision" that the Prime Minister has in mind for Quebec, a vision of a "new economic space" that includes a labour agreement with France, a Canada-Europe agreement and an agreement with Ontario.
Despite the opening of the North - the Northern Territory at the 49th parallel - being frequently mentioned by the Prime Minister in his recent statements, it has never been the subject of a presentation.
The Prime Minister, however, limited himself to explaining why the North is a "jewel of great potential", but did not give a timetable, the amount of investment, or a clear priority in future projects.
Mr Nanevös mentioned several approaches to points which could be further developed: in particular, hydroelectricity, forestry, but above all the mining sector, encouraged by the growth of rapidly developing countries and the renewal of public infrastructure.
According to Charest's count, the north contains "nickel, zinc, copper, platinum, gold, silver, iron, titanium, and even diamonds".
This is a territory twice the size of France, and it's in Quebec.
And it's not just with us, it's in us", he stressed, as if to show that he was invoking a certain national founding myth.
Quebec was built largely in relation to the North, the Premier pointed out: the gold rush in Abitibi, the engineering of Quebec, James Bay.
"It's ours, it's our future", he added after theatrically pausing to look at the huge map behind him.
The North, 70% of Quebec's territory, includes the part of Labrador that Quebec has always claimed, the premier said at a press conference.
"This is a traditional stance that has been repeated by all previous governments.
There is one boundary line, which has long been unconventional, and if the opportunity arises, I will take that position again on behalf of the government", he indicated.
Otherwise, "we also need to rethink our vision of the North in the context of climate change", he said, referring to the north-west passage that will open up all year round as a result of the melting of the glaciers.
In this new geopolitical context, the Prime Minister believes that taking over territory becomes a duty.
What about the people of the land, the indigenous peoples and the Inuit?
The Prime Minister said that the Quebec government would be very attentive to them and that the project would benefit them, especially the young.
Two former ministers from two different parties, Pierre Corbeil and Michel Létourneau (a former Pexista MP from Ungava), have already started negotiations with some thirty communities.
The Commission's work was initiated by an interministerial committee chaired by Mr Benoît Pelletier, with an important position held by Ms Julie Boulet (Law and Natural Resources).
The Prime Minister is not ruling out a big meeting, "not necessarily a summit", but a time when "a common vision will be set forth".
The development of the North should be in line with the principles of sustainable development.
The North Plan will be "co-designed, structured and environmentally friendly", he promised.
Jean Charest described this "vision" as continuing the vision of the liberal prime ministers who preceded him.
"Like the liberals before us, we have changed our minds to turn challenges into new opportunities for growth and development".
This was one of the recurring themes of the weekend, which began on Friday with a cocktail celebrating the 50th anniversary of Jean Lesage's ascension to the party's leadership.
One of the resolutions passed proposes to rename the Beauharnois headquarters the Adélard-Godbout Dam.
"From Godboute, who founded Hydro-Québec, to Lesage, who led the Quiet Revolution and the nationalisation of hydroelectricity, to Bourasso, who created the James Bay, our party has been able to shape the future", declared Jean Charest.
At the press conference, he referred to another authority, this time a conservative, namely the "Roads to the North" programme of John Diefenbaker, prime minister from 1957 to 1963.
When it came to the Eastmain1a-Ruper dam, Charest stressed that it was scheduled to start up in 2012.
"I'm saying this between us, but I plan to be there", he told his member base, to a standing ovation.
The same Prime Minister who said in April that there would be no elections in 2008, and no doubt not in 2009, has not ruled out the possibility of calling elections in the autumn of this year, which the law allows him to do.
However, he stressed that his schedule is packed, especially with the Federal Council's mission to China and the Quebec-New York summit.
The weekend convention gave the Liberal leader a platform for some nationalist resolutions, notably some "efforts to change the constitution", which went very smoothly: the PLQ (Liberal Party of Quebec) demands in particular that the "specificity of Quebec" be recognized in the Constitution.
It also wants Quebec to appoint some of the members of the Canadian Broadcasting Council, who would have veto power over decisions taken in Quebec.
The opposition was skeptical of the Northern Plan in its main features.
PQ leader Pauline Marois again brought up the Northern Quebec Development Policy that the Landry government launched in 2001.
She said that when the Liberal government came to power in 2003, it abandoned the policy.
If she had, "we would have been further along today", Marois said, alongside her candidate in Jean-Talon (where the elections are held today), Françoise Mercure.
The ADQ said they'd support the North Plan in government.
"We hope it will not be a mere theatre", explained Sébastien Proulx, the leader of the delegation representing Maria Dumont, who is returning from holiday today.
Letters - Countries that Have Been Deprived
It was Vic Toews, the former Minister of Justice (ó irony) in Harper's cabinet, who last summer dared to say that Louise Arbour was a "disgrace" to Canada.
To disparage a woman who has fought tirelessly for justice and who deserves all our admiration, says a lot about the Prime Minister's entourage and Stephen Harper himself.
We are dealing with a government which is the only Western country not to have repatriated a citizen of its own who was detained in Guantanamo Bay.
A government that ignores the fact that at the time of the alleged acts, Omar Khadr was a young teenager.
The only government that, despite Canada's signature to the Geneva Convention, denies its word and leaves a child soldier to rot in inhuman conditions.
The only one that relies on a travesty of justice to determine the guilt of the accused.
It should be noted that UNICEF, Amnesty International and especially the Canadian Bar Association are advocating for the repatriation of Omar Khadr so that he can receive a fair trial in Canada.
The same government is turning a blind eye to torture: it cares little that this young man is next psychologically destroyed, no doubt permanently, after so many years of torture.
We don't realize it, but we are witnessing the creeping erosion of our rights, our freedoms and our "democracy", words that Harper speaks so much about and which come out of his mouth so empty.
The time has come when there is no longer any morality: it is possible to torture a Canadian citizen, to mistreat him, to imprison him at the whim of the head of a minority government (as will be the case after October 14...).
Many voters believe they will find salvation in a party that preaches Virtue, Law and Order: they do not see that this government has renounced what constituted the reputation and dignity of our country.
The shame, Mr. Towes, is in this renunciation, and nowhere else.
Opinions - Orwellian discourse by Barrick Gold
In its September 17 issue, Le Devoir published a letter from Patrick J. Garver, executive vice president of the Canadian mining company Barrick Gold.
With Orwellian logic, he confirms that the world's largest gold producer has launched a lawsuit against three authors and a poor small publishing house for libel in an attempt to provoke a "transparent public debate" and demands six million.
If it's true that judges are independent and impartial, they don't judge truth, especially in cases of defamation, but the law.
Not surprisingly, Garver completely ignores this fundamental distinction.
Or is the best way for Barrick Gold to conduct public debate to bankrupt anyone who dares to take the opposite position?
Whatever the outcome of the trial, the authors and publishers of Noir Canada will be forced to spend a considerable sum to prepare themselves to defend and fight in a very unequal battle with an army of lawyers backed by the almost limitless pockets of the mining community.
The tactics in these unresolved battles often consist in ruining the defendants in order to promote a settlement that will silence the other party and, in addition, will scare anyone who dares to pursue the matter.
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public debate, it should have presented its view of the whole thing to the public.
Contrary to what happens in several countries where Barrick Gold operates, in Canada, the debate is normally about the exchange of ideas, not the whipping.
So what the mining companies had to do was open up their books, open up their documentation, and start a real debate through newspapers, media, publications and funding independent scientific teams that could shed some light on the whole thing.
But Barrick Gold seems to have no faith in public opinion and has been quietly rejecting petitions and letters of support for the authors of Noir Canada.
Perhaps Garver could explain how he can demand "public debate" while at the same time disdaining the opinions of the public?
It seems that in the vice president's world, that word means only the fat-paid lawyers, not all Canadians; that's a pretty narrow definition of the term.
In a democracy, even the most violent people have a say.
Barrick Gold doesn't understand - or doesn't want to understand - that the public who supports Noir Canada authors and publishers do so primarily because they reject the brutal ways of the mining community.
The public is ready to hear Barrick and consider the matter, but on the basis of a civilized exchange of arguments, not in what many perceive as a prosecution in which the defendant is to be gagged (in its prosecution of "public debate", Barrick, by the way, has just issued an official appeal to the authors of Noir Canada to officially inform them that they should stop using the term...).
Barring Garver's surreal speech, the prosecution of Barrick Gold is a direct attack on the university's freedom of inquiry and the pursuit of truth, which is essential to any democratic society.
Overall, it denies the right to cite credible sources and to debate the facts and interpretations that constitute the very basis of intellectual activity.
If in a country like Canada, it is impossible to study and discuss topics that are not to the liking of the rich corporations of this world without being subjected to repeated prosecution, who else can do it?
If Barrick Gold really wanted a public and transparent debate, it could have been created by following the scientific standards that Noir Canada's authors enjoy.
He has a right to an answer.
The university environment that we belong to has long been able to manage debate and disagreement and resolve conflict.
Barrick Gold's exaggerated lawsuit clearly shows that despite what it claims, it has no desire to have a transparent debate.
It's a loss to the academic world, as well as to the public debate in Canada, and it's time for governments to put in place measures to curb this type of unwarranted prosecution.
Wall Street bailouts - Democrats and Republicans agree
The Bush administration and congressional leaders, both Republican and Democratic, finally agreed yesterday to the largest economic rescue plan since the Great Depression of the 1930s.
A new version of the $700 billion plan to contain the financial crisis that has been plaguing Wall Street for months has yet to be approved by both houses of Congress.
In particular, it provides for: better control by elected representatives over its application, new mechanisms to ensure the recovery of public money deposited, new measures to capture the number of houses seized for non-repayment and also the right to monitor the level of wages paid to executives saved by companies.
U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Republican leader Judd Gregg announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday, after a two-day negotiating marathon.
"We have made great progress and have reached an agreement that will be effective in the markets", declared Bush administration official Henry Paulson.
"Everything was done to keep the real economy and ordinary Americans safe from the crisis that is happening on Wall Street", the Democrat explained.
"This is the crucial point: if we don't do this, the trauma, the chaos and the disruption to the daily lives of Americans will be immense", Republican Judd Gregg declared.
In the last few hours, the negotiations have been running at full speed for fear of the effect that another failure would have on investor sentiment.
The specified time limit was the opening of the markets this morning.
Both presidential candidates were later called to negotiate, and both expressed their preference for an agreement, but they did not neglect to express their dissatisfaction with the need to resort to such an extreme solution.
Democratic Senator Barack Obama has credited the agreement with adding some measures, notably one aimed at allowing homeowners to keep their homes, and a measure on the pay of executives of state-bailed companies.
"When we ask taxpayers to take special measures because of the irresponsibility of some people, there is no point in congratulating ourselves.
But these measures are necessary", he explained on television.
His Republican opponent, John McCain, asked by another station whether he would vote for the proposed plan, replied, "I'd like to see the details, but I hope I will".
"The rough outlines I've read [suggest] that this is something we're all going to have to digest and move on to.
"It is simply unacceptable to choose to be inactive", he said.
The goal of the $700 billion plan is to use taxpayer money to buy up the bad loans and risky and unsellable assets of American financial institutions.
The plan comes after 14 months of crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble, which first led to the collapse of subprime mortgages, then spread to other, more widespread forms of credit (PCAA), and resulted in cash freezes and the dissolution of banks and financial institutions.
The failure of the first draft of the agreement last week is the fault of the Republican members of the House.
Since Democrats have agreed that some "toxic" assets of troubled companies will only be guaranteed by the government, not redeemed, the belief that the impasse is inevitable has been perpetuated.
In an effort to reconcile the conflicting views in Congress, a provision was added that the government would be able to introduce new fees to help it recover its deposit if it had to absorb losses for five years as a result of the program.
The new plan calls for an initial deposit of $250 billion, with the possibility of adding another $100 billion if the president deems it necessary.
The $350 billion in additional funding is due to be approved by Congress in a new vote.
In exchange for its help, Washington will receive shares in the salvaged companies, which will pay dividends if it makes a profit and which it can sell back when it's all gone.
The Federal Government will be able to delay foreclosure proceedings on the properties associated with the loans covered by the plan, as well as set limits on the amount of assessments and compensation paid to executives of affected companies.
The plan's backers would like to put it to a vote in the House of Representatives today and the Senate on Wednesday.
Despite all the efforts, it's not yet certain that their plan will have the green light.
Because yesterday, there were still voices against this project in both the Republican and Democratic camps.
"It's clear that Washington is not listening", said Scott Garrett, a Republican on the House Finance Committee, addressing voters.
"Yes, we have a serious financial problem.
Yes, there are solutions.
Making money off of the taxpayers is not the answer".
Democratic Representative Brad Sherman, the moderator of a group of congressmen dubbed the "Skeptics Committee", presents the whole thing differently, but comes to the same conclusion.
"Four hundred esteemed economics professors, including three Nobel laureates, have written to us: we ask Congress to take its time and consider carefully what course to take", he said yesterday.
At the same time, Europe was once again being told that this crisis was a world crisis.
After the extraordinary meeting, the three Benelux countries announced the partial nationalization of the Fortis banking group for EUR 11.2 billion (USD 16.3 billion).
The intervention of the Belgian, Dutch and Luxembourg governments became necessary after the French bank BNP Paribas announced that it was withdrawing from its bid to buy its rival, which has been on the verge of collapse since losing €2 billion (USD 2.9 billion) in the wake of the US mortgage crisis.
Fortis employs 85,000 people and is one of the 20 largest banks in Europe and one of the 10 largest insurance companies.
"We will not lose this money", Dutch Finance Minister Wouter Bos declared yesterday.
"In return, we get voting rights in the bank and influence.
And that is what caretakers and households can appreciate in these uncertain times".
On the other side of the Channel, the British government has yet to begin to nationalise another bank hit by the financial crisis.
According to the British press, the government was to take over all existing loans from Bradford and Bringley, of which more than 41 billion (US$75.5 billion) were loans for property purchases.
According to yesterday's announcement, the Spanish bank Santander is buying out branches and accounts of British bank clients.
Bradford and Bringley will be the second bank, after Northern Rock, that the British government has had to nationalize since the financial crisis began.
Paul Newman (1925-2008) - Death of a socially committed icon
His azure-eyed beauty has long been his trump card, others say his weakness.
Has this American actor with a charming smile gotten over his narcissism?
Yes and no.
The shyness, sensitivity and enduring talent that he possessed also kept him away from the power category that breeds true stars.
Yet, what a long-distance runner he was!
Paul Newman died Friday at the age of 83 at his ranch in Connecticut from lung cancer and remains one of the last icons of the bold years of American cinema.
Less grandiose than Brando, to whom he was similar and long a rival on the screen, Newman was a more cautious actor, certainly fragile, but also an apostle of freedom and the breakdown of dramatic conventions.
Mixed blood often produces beautiful children.
Born in Ohio in 1925, his father was a German Jew and his mother was of Hungarian descent.
From these European roots, one of the famous faces of the American dream was born.
Without the egos, which is the last sign of quality.
Because in him, this whole country was in love with a self-made man, a veteran of the war in the Pacific, wounded in battle, who in the early 1950s studied acting at Yale, then attended the Actor's Studio in New York and celebrated triumphs in theater, television and soon in film.
The same civil rights activist was also a race car driver, a runner-up in the 1979 24 Hours of Le Mans, and a sex symbol, despite having been a model partner of actress Joanne Woodward since 1958.
With it, too, go the shadowy places of this hidden, discreet, socially engaged star, allergic to the noise of show business itself, which will forever remain somewhat mysterious.
A decent man, in the noblest sense of the word.
The departure of Paul Newman this weekend has left movie lovers dizzy as his big roles compete on the black screen of remembrance.
He's followed by more than half a century of the ever-changing American seventh art.
The charming cowboy from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), the young man who rejects his sensual wife (Elizabeth Taylor) in A Streetcar Named Desire, a 1958 Tennessee Williams adaptation, is reborn.
From a more recent past, we recall his sensitive Mr. Bridge, troubled in his old age by a marriage that failed to meet all expectations.
So many more Paul Newmans have gone down in history.
Boxer Rocky Graziano, the bullied, violent, unforgettable delinquent from Robert Wise's Somebody Up There Likes Me, a role intended for James Dean, taken over after his death, which in 1956 brought Newman into the limelight.
The sympathetic gangster in the absolutely great The Sting, the Oscar for Best Picture in 1973.
The bitter and vindictive pool player in Robert Ross's brilliant The Hustler (1961), the same character he plays in Martin Scorsese's The Color of Money, which earns him his only Oscar nomination in 1987 out of seven.
This face of the wandering ages, it was he.
And him again.
His career has been marked by a series of eras.
He is best known to young audiences for his role as Reggie Dunlop, a non-traditional hockey coach, in the cult film Slap Shot George Roye Hill (1977).
Fans saw him again in 1994 in The Coen Brothers' Hudsucker Proxy.
He closed his career with the role of the Irish mob godfather in Sam Mendes' Road to Perdition in 2003.
Unlike some movie legends who left the industry relatively soon, Newman stayed in the business for a long time, even though he decried Hollywood for its pomp, ostentation and concessions.
French filmmaker Bertrand Tavernier, not without humour, considered it "a living challenge to underplay", judging that in his performances he had pushed too hard on the saw.
For the beautiful Paul Newman, whose roles came as a delicacy, the profession was not always so tender.
But he played first lovers less often than outsiders: neurotics, alcoholics, bums, and hopelessness, whose decay and rebellion were reflected in his perfect features.
As a director, Newman revealed a little-known side of his shy sensibility.
His 1968 film Rachel, Rachel (based on the novel by Canadian Margaret Laurence), starring his wife Joanne Woodward, gives a sensitive portrait of a woman full of melancholy.
To his son Scott, who he lost to an overdose, he dedicated the 1984 film Harry and Son, a work of shame and sorrow.
In a tribute to Newman yesterday, his great friend and former comrade Robert Redford (their co-star in The Sting and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid) sadly declared, "His presence has made my life and this country better".
Generosity, love of life, these are the main qualities of a dead actor.
Leaving behind his legendary career, also leaves a great fighter for civil rights, ecology, independent film, and the decline of Hollywood.
We were used to seeing his likeness on bottles of vinegar, on sauces, on biscuits and other foods, which might have seemed rather distasteful, although at first it was a gag.
However, the profits from the sale went into his Foundation for Troubled Childhood's account.
So, rather than be lulled by fame, Newman engaged in society until the last moment.
He left a letter to his five daughters, which included these words: "Your father was forever and to the end grateful to his lucky planet.
It was an honor to be here".
And we were honored to follow the career of such a visionary and generous American artist.
And besides, after all, a model citizen.
What was produced in the Zuschlag & Co. Factory?
Soon, on October 8, the trial will begin in the criminal case against János Zuschlag and his associates.
The politician and his associates are charged with fraud, perpetrated by a long-standing and systematic criminal organisation, which has caused extreme damage, in addition to other offences, including forgery of documents.
According to the prosecutor's office, they used the money received in public tenders for their own purposes and often documented the completion of tasks with fictitious invoices.
The money from the state and local governments - a total of approximately 65 million forints - went partly to the treasury of the Fiatal Baloldal organization, partly to the pockets of individuals.
The method also reported by the investigating authority was that the money received in public tenders was collected on the basis of invoices for which there was no real consideration and the commitments undertaken by the association were never received.
According to the prosecution, a large portion of the invoices were fake.
The forms for these invoices were from the Josefváros market, the round stamp was made in Kiskunhalasi.
The names of the companies to be used for the invoices were decided, among other things, on the ring road along the northern shore of Balaton, which was sent by István Ladose to János Zuschlag.
According to his statement, the first named was supposed to look for pensions and restaurants.
In these he requested accounts for his consumption, the model of which was then used to produce invoices submitted in the context of public tenders drawn up by, inter alia, the Ministry of Youth and Sport, the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, and the Municipality of the Capital.
The invoices were mostly issued by István Lados and his associate András Őrim, who, according to our information, wrote the reports most often needed to obtain subsidies.
During his "study tour", Lados had a look at a cellar.
According to two invoices issued by Zuschlag and its associates in 2003, the hotel catered for a 90-strong group from the Insurance Pont group.
But the company executive said that this number of people would not have been able to fit into the facility all at once.
Similarly, the invoices issued in the summer of 2002 by the Jobb Jövőért Foundation, later the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért, were full of formal and substantive errors.
The guesthouse in Badacsonytomaji had only three rooms, and no more than ten people could sleep there in one night, yet the bill listed one hundred and thirty guests.
However, the imaginative compilers of the forms went too far when they referred to the company Pigal s. r. o., which also provides hospitality services, and whose accounts, according to the information provided to the public prosecutor's office, did not even include documents bearing the names of Jobb Jövőért and Hoppá.
The company's CEO, Győző Farkas, told hvg.hu that when he was summoned to the prosecutor's office and shown the invoices, he knew immediately that the documents were fake.
"The name of our company and our tax number were on the stamp in the wrong place".
He added that apart from the formalities, the fact that they accommodated 100 people according to the invoice did not agree, as they only have 11 rooms, which do not have such a large capacity.
Plus, the bill also listed the food, and their restaurant has been out of business for a long time.
The eager invoice makers were not convinced that the well-known Budapest travel agency only organised international trips, and they foolishly listed the cash-on-delivery invoice as a service for arranging a trip to Hungary, which was also not in line with the company's billing practice.
Moreover, as it emerged during the investigation, VAT was also mentioned in the document, even though the organisation of trips to countries outside the European Union was exempt from VAT.
Four documents issued to the Jobb Jövőért Foundation by Hotel Révfülöp s. r. o. did not agree, inter alia, to the amount of VAT, since the company's activities were not subject to the 25% VAT rate but to the 15% VAT rate, and the staff of the hotel issued only printed invoices, but the invoice was handwritten.
Moreover, the 'issuers' distorted the invoice, for example by indicating that one company, as revealed by the public prosecutor's office, carried out road freight transport activities which were not carried out by the company originally established as investment consultancy.
The fact that the invoices issued to the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért Foundation and the XXI. Századi Kulturális Egyesület and Biztos Pont associations were false was also due to formal discrepancies - the incorrect invoice format and the incorrect stamp.
As in the case of Ravenna k. s. or the Kunfehértó Sports Camp, whose representatives denied that they had issued the invoices.
For example, the forgers did not even notice that HIB s. r. o. from Nyíregyháza was in liquidation at the time (2001) when the group from Fiatal Városért was feeding at its premises, which is why, according to our information, the liquidation commissioner of the company also denied that he had issued the paper.
They were making the invoices deliberately.
The second group of invoicers are those who knew they were to issue a fictitious invoice.
The Esély Budapestért foundation has issued bills for approximately four million forints to the Harmadik Évezredért foundation at the request of Fiatal Baloldal - Ifjú Szocialisták.
The head of Collab s.r.o. was allegedly coerced into issuing a fictitious account by one of the defendants, Ludovic Györfi.
Zuschlag and his associates were also cooperating with Biogate s.r.o., currently in liquidation, which in 2003 had invoiced the Jobb Jövőért Foundation and the Atlasz and Vörösfenyő associations for approximately HUF 5 million, which was not followed by any real economic activity.
Nor was there any movement of money, because the invoices created were later cancelled, which the organizations had forgotten to mention in their documents.
The next group of invoicing companies includes those that had ties to the defendants.
For example, Ivan Kubatov was the representative of the Ukrainian manager of Delta Trió s.r.o., a company dealing with fuel and motor vehicles, based in Budapest, but which is not listed on the company's website.
The company issued several invoices for the sale of computer equipment in October, November and December 2005 for a total value of approximately HUF 18 million.
According to the information obtained during the investigation, these invoices were bought by the Kiskunhalas company Cash Investment s. r. o., which had been in liquidation since 14 September 2005.
The manager of this company was a man from Romania, to whom documents related to the same company were handed over by Iván Kubatov between 2002 and 2005.
As we know, during the investigation Kubatov admitted that he had issued invoices on behalf of the company to Atlasz, Hoppá and the Együtt and Harmadik Évezredért foundations and had himself received their consideration.
Expressly at the request of Ivan Kubatov, Fa-Bani Jos Faipari s.r.o. and Jos-Investment k.s. were founded by Romanian masons.
But in fact, none of the firms were operating, according to the defendant, because they were not given jobs.
However, the undertakings were in his favour, since, at the request of his co-accused lawyer, Zsolt Szente, who also drew up the articles of incorporation, he issued invoices on behalf of the undertakings to the associations Atlasz and Y-Generation, which were affiliated to Zuschlag.
On behalf of Investment, Delta Trió, Fa-Bani Jos, Jos Investment and Linaxtrade, Kubatov has issued 15 invoices to organisations totalling HUF 14,2 million.
The prosecutor's office estimated that Kubatov had gotten 10% of the amounts listed on invoices and VAT.
The man also used Szi-Beri k.t. to issue fictitious invoices, this time for a tendering procedure for Biztos Pont.
Y-Generáció and Szövetség and Modern Magyarországért submitted their bids in January 2006 to the public competition of the Mihálye Táncsicse Foundation (TMA), a public benefit organization of the Socialist Party.
They received 500 000 forints each, but they did not use the sums to achieve the objectives set out in the proposals.
To conceal this, TMA submitted five fictitious invoices from Works Team Ltd.
These invoices were found during a home search in Árpád Kemecsei's office at the Ministry of Education.
During the trial, some of the defendants will probably describe the process of invoicing, as they have done at the prosecutor's office.
What might be interesting is if the main defendant, János Zuschlag, decides to reveal himself.
His testimony so far is not very detailed, and despite his promises to give a full account on several occasions, he has not done so.
The question is whether it's in his interest - in exchange for paying a large part of the damage, fifty million forints, maybe the socialists have made a deal with him and Zusi will take it on himself.
He may have been offended, since his requests for a reduction in the terms of his detention, namely that he be placed under house arrest, have so far remained unheard.
While perpetrators of economic crimes, who have caused far greater damage that has not yet been repaired, can walk around freely or at least wait for the end of the proceedings against them in their homes, he does not have that option.
The psychology of triumph: why do we spend more money?
At auctions, customers are willing to spend more money, overvalue the goods.
The neurological and economic underpinnings of this well-known - and seemingly irrational - behavior have been uncovered by researchers from the departments of neurology and economics at New York University.
According to their study, published in the journal Science, people don't want to be left behind in an eBay auction-type competition, so they're willing to pay a premium.
Research has used experimental auction to try to map the pattern of this "game" in the nervous system.
One group of volunteers bet, the other group participated in a random auction, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine active areas of the subjects' brains.
In both games, the participants could win money, but in the auction game, where the important element is to beat the other side, the whole under the cerebral cortex, called the striatum, began to function intensively when the loser lost.
This area of the brain plays a role in the "self-reward" mechanism of the nervous system, among many other functions.
The price increase can therefore be explained by the researchers' desire to avoid a sharp reaction of the striata.
To support their theory, members of the research team of economists conducted a cross-sectional financial survey.
Three groups bid against one partner under different conditions.
The control group was simply told what the real value of the product was, and they made bets.
Additionally, the other members of the group were promised that if they came out victorious, they would receive an additional $15 in reward.
The third group received $15 before the auction, but if they lost, they lost that money too.
The difference between the two groups was that one group was emphasized as winning and the other as losing.
But the members of the "loser" group were willing to go higher than the control and "winner" group, which confirms the neurologists' hypothesis.
"These results cannot be deduced from any pre-existing economic theory.
They have hitherto explained the phenomena observed in auctions of triumph and risk-averse joy.
It was only when neurological imaging techniques helped us resolve the discrepancy between the two theories that we now arrived at a third explanation", said Andrew Schotter, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business.
Hepatitis: When Should You See a Doctor?
About half a billion people worldwide suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C infection, and in Hungary this chronic liver disease is listed as a leading cause of death.
The number of domestic cases of hepatitis infection is estimated at 100,000, but only 7,000 of these are treated, the reason being that the sick often do not know that they are infected.
Hepatitis is the collective term for infectious liver damage caused by various viruses.
The symptoms are similar, with inflammation of the liver and jaundice being the most common, but the causes and the illness they cause are different.
Hepatitis viruses are spread in two main ways, depending on the source: hepatitis A and E through the digestive system (e. g. through contaminated food, water), hepatitis B, C, D and other viruses through blood and body fluids (sperm, vaginal secretions, saliva).
Travellers should in any case be protected by vaccination against virus A and B, there is no vaccine against virus C.
The symptoms of hepatitis A appear two to three weeks after ingesting an infected food, usually accompanied by nausea, weakness, abdominal problems, and vomiting.
Then, jaundice, lightened stools, and darkened urine form on the skin and whites of the eyes, and the treatment may take two to three weeks.
Each year, a million people worldwide die from the more serious forms of this disease, liver cancer and cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B.
The main reason is that only about one in ten of those infected are estimated to be medicated.
Hepatitis C can also have very serious consequences: if left untreated, it can lead to liver cirrhosis or liver cancer.
Most people with the disease are unaware of their illness, and the pathogen is secretly destroying liver cells, so that in many cases the first symptoms do not appear for 20 to 30 years.
Therefore, early prevention, regular surveillance, is very important.
Three groups have a much higher than average incidence of the disease: people who received blood transfusions before 1991, drug users, and people with tattoos.
Currently, the estimated global number of individuals infected with chronic hepatitis C virus is 200 million.
As the disease can be detected by routine laboratory tests, a person should consult his or her doctor if he or she experiences any symptoms of unknown origin.
If detected early, the disease is treatable, the virus can be removed from the body, and thus prevent infection and cancer.
30 September is World Hepatitis Day, which was first celebrated globally by organizations representing patients in 2004.
It aims to draw attention to chronic hepatitis caused by these viruses, the causes of its development and the importance of early detection of the disease.
Who believes in God, doesn't it hurt so much?
Recent research suggests that belief in God acts as a kind of analgesic that may have eased the death of Catholic martyrs.
Scientists at Oxford University conducted an interesting experiment to see how belief in God affects a person's perception of pain, reports Britain's Telegraph newspaper.
In a rather bizarre study, 12 Catholics and an equal number of atheists were subjected to electric shocks while they all looked at a painting of the Virgin Mary.
According to the results, the Catholic faithful were able to eliminate much of the pain.
The technology that probes the human brain has also shown that Catholics have been able to activate the part of their brain responsible for regulating pain.
The research is the first in a series of studies involving academics as well as scientists, philosophers and theologians from various parts of the university.
The test was done precisely by attaching a sparkler to the left arm of the subject, which gave electric shocks.
The researchers asked the subjects to look closely at two paintings: a 17th-century Sassoferrat's Madonna of Mary and a 15th-century painting of Leonardo da Vinci's Lady with the Rosette.
The authors of the study hoped that the sight of the Virgin Mary would induce a state of piety in the faithful, whereas da Vinci's painting was chosen because it did not differ much from the first and seemed to them to have a calming effect.
The subjects spent half an hour in an MRI scanner, during which time they received 20 electric shocks in four consecutive sessions, while separately viewing images with religious or general themes.
Catholics reported that they felt "safe" at the sight of the Virgin Mary, as if they were "cared for" and "calmed down, filled with peace".
When they saw a religious painting, they reportedly felt 12 percent less pain than when they saw Leonardo's work.
Psychologist Miguel Farias, who also participated in the study, believes that any powerful image can have a similar effect on atheists, provided the right one is found.
"We had to find an image that they would see very positively, from the mother's or the father's point of view", the psychologist said.
Anglican bishop Tom Wright welcomed the results.
"Practice of faith should change and in many cases will change our personality", Wright added.
After such great results, it's only a question of what effect it would have on the pain regulation of the faithful if they were shown some Madonna by Leonardo or a painter of similar calibre.
Would a view of the Virgin Mary's quality produce even better results?
You are what you share
On its tenth birthday, Google can claim that people can find it in their pocket at least as well as they can find it in the sky; they know where they've been on vacation, what kind of medical examinations they're taking, and what they're interested in.
But according to Eric Schmidt, one of the company's executives, that's still not enough.
But as for the skeptics, who parallel the Orwellian dark vision, they are not clear about the very nature of Web 2.0.
Eric Schmidt recently told the Financial Times that Google's main goal is to collect even more personal data about users, which is necessary for the Google founders to stick to their original intention, which was: "Let's organize all the information in the world!"
According to a Google representative, after ten years of global work, the company is just beginning to be able to work with all the information.
Asked what he would be doing in five years, Schmidt said he would like Google to be able to answer questions like "what should I do tomorrow?" or "what kind of job would I be good for?" - questions that are seemingly simple, but that software won't be able to answer until it knows enough about users.
Not all Internet users are aware that the exact words searched are captured during an Internet search, as well as the IP address from which the search was made and the pages to which the interested party was redirected.
For example, Personalized Search, launched two years ago, allows users to keep a record of their browsing history, to look back at what they've searched for and clicked on, and in the long run, to generate results that are more personalised - the same logic will be used by Recommendations, which will offer products and services based on the preferences that have been previously mentioned and stored.
What if my data is used against me, what if someone looks at what I do? - users who are afraid of Google's data monopoly ask.
In most cases, the scope of the potential power represented by the company is what is terrifying, and the backlash does not evoke guilt, fear of punishment, desire for freedom or even rebellion against power in Internet users.
It is, however, a well-established fact that all search terms are not only captured but may also be disclosed to a third party in justified cases, in which case the privacy rights of Internet users are not protected.
Perhaps the most well-known recent example was the coordinated action against Brazilian pedophiles, during which Google provided the Brazilian government with information that allowed the identification of pedophiles from the Orkut community pages created through it.
But Internet users worried about privacy rights were given a reprieve in May when the company, along with the electronic rights organization EFF, successfully proved its case against the FBI: Google must not be forced by any future article of the Constitution to provide any information secretly requested by the FBI.
(In the same time period, the federal government successfully recovered nearly 50,000 web addresses and 1,000 search terms it had obtained with the help of the years-old Child Protection Act, but was unable to obtain individual user search lists, or complete lists of websites and keywords, spanning a two-month period.)
The view of Google is so contradictory: it is whipped by those who fear the release of their personal data because they feel that their private sphere and private life will be damaged by using Google's services, and they revolt against it like they do with multinational corporations with a conservative image.
And yet the American geek culture and its wild offshoot, gathering around itself computer enthusiasts, activists and users, appearing in many countries, sees in it a new generation of big business, "corporation that now is bustling", unlike its rival Microsoft, considered to be the conqueror of the world because of Windows, however both are fighting for the same goals.
This may be because Google, unlike Microsoft, does not require its users to provide an identification code or ask them to pay for its applications; the open, free and always fresh source of information and software packages seem much more accessible, youthful, cooler than the practice of official software.
But it may also be because geeks understand the very problematic relationship between the internet and individual rights that has brought about one of the most talked about keywords of recent years: web 2.0.
Because Web 2.0 is about nothing but collaboration, about intentionally leaving traces behind and using the communication channels that we have, and although the scope of it is different for everyone, the essence is the same: we show up.
The average young person can have a profile on several community sites, from Facebook to Xangu, which can be linked to other services, such as Twitter or the music-tracking application last.fm, which can be linked to navigation systems such as FriendFeed or Blip.fm, and a blog where the latest photo galleries of his stored on Flickr or Picasa will be automatically discovered.
But there are plenty of examples where it shines through: a friend in the morning can easily figure out who her drunken boyfriend was with by looking at a flood of photos of mutual friends, or a company can fire an employee just for expressing an honest opinion about top management on its blog: one thing is for sure, the concept of privacy has been completely overhauled today.
The one who lives an online life is made up of what he shows off, so we could define the basic thesis behind the behavior of today's youth.
And anyone who wants to keep something secret or at least avoid Google's monopoly has a chance (starting with Scroogl, which uses Google's search engine but intentionally leaves no traces).
A small number of people, for example, deliberately don't register to community sites so they can't be found. Google's online applications, from text editors to photo editors to news portals, can be replaced by alternative versions that aren't connected to giant server parks and don't provide us with the highest quality profile possible.
Public opinion is waiting in the wings for Google to show its teeth.
With a current value of $156 billion, the company is worth more than IBM ($140 billion), Intel ($124 billion), or Coca Cola ($110 billion), the AdWords/AdSense advertising platforms threaten the investment of advertising agencies, and the services being introduced at an ever-accelerating pace are seriously making life miserable not only for Microsoft but for many other software designers.
But critical observers also find counter-points that are disturbing: for example, the top management completely rejected the protests of employees after doubling the fee for the company's nursery school, and the company's management considered that the daily meals for employees were too expensive, all of which are lost in the fact that Google bowed to the Chinese government in 2006 and, under their agreement, suppressed any discovery that was contrary to good taste or the interests of the Chinese regime.
One of the company's internal rules is that it never advertises new services until they are ready to be used, but it is certain that the expected problems of the coming months and years may take the world to new places: while some believe that Google's project of scanning and archiving books and magazines is taking on such a scale that the company will soon have to deal with the US Supreme Court, others are afraid of its Health system, in which we can compile a complete health profile with previous searches, doctors and problems.
The fact that Google is building a genetic database can also serve as a good starting point for the next generation of science fiction writers, Cory Doctorow's famous novel "Scroogled" describes with Orwellian reminiscences a future in which you can get a good approximation of a person using only data from Google.
The double murderer from Ozd was helped by two teenagers to clear his tracks
Two teenagers were questioned by police in the case of double murder in Ozd, and according to reasonable suspicions, they helped to remove the traces of this crime, said a spokesman for the Supreme Police Directorate of the County of Borsod on Tuesday.
The individuals involved in the activities they were suspected of have confessed and are currently charged with aiding and abetting a criminal offence.
Both juveniles, according to MTI, two girls, are wanted in the wild.
Aiding and abetting is punishable by up to five years in prison.
The suspect in the double murder in Oświęcim, a 23-year-old local man, was taken into custody on Sunday.
He's a suspect in a crime of premeditated multiple homicide for motive.
During the investigation, it was revealed that a 23-year-old young man owed a 53-year-old man a larger sum.
The suspect did not want to pay his debt, so he lured his creditor to a shop in Ozd last Wednesday, where he killed first a man and then his 9-year-old daughter.
According to the information of the MTI, the young man was preparing to commit the crime in advance, as evidenced by the fact that he committed the murder with a weapon hidden at the crime scene.
The weapon and the circumstances of its use are being investigated by the police with the involvement of experts.
The Warsaw Stock Exchange has made an offer to buy the Prague Stock Exchange.
Two hundred million euros - approximately five billion Czech crowns - was offered by the Warsaw Stock Exchange for the purchase of a 100 percent stake in the Prague Stock Exchange.
Ludwik Sobolewski, chairman of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, confirmed the offer made by the Polish side, even though the Czechs had previously excluded the Warsaw Stock Exchange from the circle of potential new owners of the Prague Stock Exchange.
The reason is the fact that the Warsaw Stock Exchange is owned by the state.
99% of the shares are held by the Polish state, which wants to sell 60% of the securities in a few months.
As the Czech economic daily E15 reports, the Polish bid represents the highest amount ever offered to a bidder on the Prague Stock Exchange.
According to Czech newspapers, bids have already been submitted by the Vienna Stock Exchange, the transatlantic stock exchange Nasdaq, the New York Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Börse.
The head of the Prague Stock Exchange, Petr Koblic, last week said that the Warsaw Stock Exchange would be the worst new owner of all prospective owners, and did not rule out that this could lead to the demise of the Prague Stock Exchange in the future.
Stock market experts estimate the value of the Prague Stock Exchange at $5 billion to $10 billion.
According to the shareholders' agreement, approximately 90% of the shares could be sold.
The largest owner of the Prague Stock Exchange is the investment bank Patria Finance with approximately 25%, followed by Česká spořitelna with 14,7% and Tiger Holding Four S. a. r. l. with 13,5%.
The financial crisis from the perspective of European sheets
In their comments on Tuesday on the deepening international financial crisis, leading European newspapers have already referred to "a second 9/11".
The global financial disaster is the fault of the American president, blamed on La Repubblica, who has failed to even get his own party to support the rapidly-reaping bill that aims to remedy this desperate situation...
Instead of a new Pearl Harbor, which reminded billionaire investor Warren Buffett, we could talk more about a second 9/11.
Also, part of the Madrid press sees the culprit in Washington.
El Mundo believes that the lack of political leadership has brought the world economy to the brink of collapse.
The danger of the collapse of the American financial system is growing, and the whole world will eventually pay for it.
While Bush's plan was not perfect, after the congressional vote, there is a danger that Washington will not offer a political instrument to resolve the crisis.
The world economy is in tatters - at the very moment when one of the greatest transformations in the history of capitalism is taking place.
The threat can no longer be ignored, points out the Geneva daily Tages-Anzeiger.
States can still throw a lifeline to a struggling money institution and taxpayers can save it from bankruptcy.
But if more banks collapse like dominoes, then neither the money nor the improvisations will be enough.
In the long term, the Member States of the European Union need to move beyond their national egoism and consolidate control over fragmented financial markets.
On Monday alone, the emerging financial institutions received more than 100 billion euros, reports Vienna's Der Standard, which points to growing concerns that European taxpayers, like the Americans, will have to dig deep into their pockets to solve the crisis.
The European Union has not yet seriously addressed the crisis that is sweeping the old continent like a tsunami.
The "rescuers" may not have to hand out hundreds of billions of euros, but it would be good if they were firm in determining when it is reasonable to use taxpayers' money to prevent even greater damage.
A smart car simulates the flight of a bumblebee
What better way to develop collision-avoidance technologies than by imitating the obstacle detectors found in the natural world?
Like the bees.
The original strategic idea for this startling project, unveiled at Japan's CEATEC, was given to Nissan engineers by the bees, to build a new generation of collision avoidance systems.
In collaboration with the University of Tokyo, Nissan has designed a biomimetic robotic driving system, the BR23C, a robotic mini-car that is equipped with the characteristics of bees, with the ultimate goal of helping to create a system that can eliminate all collisions.
"During flight, each bee creates its own oval-shaped personal space, which is actually very similar to our safety protective envelope", explained Kazuhiro Doi, the brand's general manager for technology PR and R&D, at the exhibition.
The important role of the compound eyes is that they allow bees to see in all directions at more than 300 degrees of vision.
To replicate the function of the compound eye, engineers used the idea of a laser rangefinder.
It identifies obstacles up to 2 m in front of the BR23C in a 180° field of view, calculates their distance and sends a signal to the on-board microprocessor which is immediately converted into a collision avoidance operation.
The obstacle is captured for a fraction of a second, after which the robotic car begins to imitate the bee's movements and, by turning the wheels to the extent necessary to avoid a collision, immediately changes direction.
Unlike any existing system, this maneuver is entirely instinctive.
"If it were not, the robot car would not be able to react quickly enough to avoid obstacles", explains Toshiyuki Ando, head of the Mobility Lab and the robot car project.
They must react instinctively and immediately, as this technology fits into the most vulnerable and innermost layer of the safety shield, within which a collision is currently considered inevitable.
The whole process has to mirror what the bee is doing to avoid other bees.
This process can't take more than the blink of an eye.
But unlike bees, this movement cannot be up, down, or angular, it can only be two-dimensional, and only in the direction that the wheels can turn.
Instead of the endless possibilities offered to the bees in avoiding, only the rotational, acceleration and deceleration of the robot car was applied.
BR23C uses lithium-polymer batteries, which are lighter and have a higher energy density, meaning they have a longer life span than lithium-ion variants.
Ando says instinctive, intelligent reactions are important, not the ability to process, much less store, data.
This mechanism must process and respond to only a few incoming signals per second.
It doesn't need to store and react to them using intuitive logic based on data from previous maneuvers, so it only uses a memory of a few kilobytes at a time.
It doesn't need gigabytes or megabytes of memory.
This is the first step in developing an immediate avoidance technology that Nissan estimates could be in production within a decade.
Another application may be to connect the unit to a GPS satellite navigation system, which, after avoiding obstacles in the road, would take the motorist to the final destination specified.
Damn dear baby already has a name
The bill for a $700 billion rescue package, to be split into several installments, aimed at buying back the banks' subprime loans, is already in writing.
Half the amount will be used in the first round.
After further negotiations that ended after midnight U.S. Eastern time on Saturday, congressional representatives reached agreement in days of debate on a $700 billion bailout package, Reuters reported.
"We have made significant progress", announced Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, who said the only thing left to do was to write a deal.
The compromise on the package was also supported by both presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain.
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said of the compromise result: "The program will work and be effective, but further action is needed".
The paper version of the package was released before the Asian markets opened on Sunday at 8pm Washington time (i.e. Monday at 2am Central European time), but did not cause any significant upswing on the stock exchanges.
The bill, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which is to establish the program will be voted on Monday first by the House of Representatives, then by the Senate.
President George W. Bush spoke with Pelosi Saturday night, after which news of the deal was welcomed at the White House as well.
"We are pleased with the progress made last night and greatly appreciate the efforts of both sides to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy", said White House spokesman Tony Fratto.
The program is different from the original proposal of the Bush administration, which was to spend $700 billion in one go to buy back bad mortgage-backed securities.
Now, it is possible to spend up to half of the $700 billion in the first round, with $250 billion to be spent immediately after Congress is expected to decide on the matter on Monday, with the Treasury Department buying mortgage-backed securities that are rated as subprime, and the fate of the remaining $100 billion then resting on the president's decision.
The program will be overseen by a special committee, which will include the chairman of the Federal Reserve.
The second half of the $700 billion budget is contingent on further Congressional action.
The Ministry of Finance can apply a combined tactic within the meaning of the law: it can simultaneously buy back sub-standard loans, mortgages and securities backed by mortgages, or other "poisonous" loans.
The purchase can be done through auctions or directly, the competent officials of the ministry said.
The legal provision will allow the companies concerned to participate in an insurance scheme whereby the Ministry of Finance will provide them with a guarantee for the funds constituting a cause for concern, in return for which the company will pay a price corresponding to the expected losses.
As Henry Paulson said, the act provides the necessary resources to spend up to $700 billion to meet the urgent requirements of the U.S. financial system, whether it's buying large amounts of bad assets, insuring them, or preventing systemic risk associated with the collapse of one of the big money institutions.
"We will take the necessary steps to be ready to implement the law as soon as it is signed", he added.
The bankers who are in trouble and waiting for government help can count on the government to cut their severance pay - which in overseas slang is simply called "the golden parachute".
Their payment will be limited in certain cases only, and these limits will depend on the type of assistance provided by the Ministry.
The restriction basically means that if the department buys through the auction, a tax surcharge will be imposed on the gold pads unless the failed bank directors are sent straight to retirement.
In the case of direct repurchase of subprime loans, the government will aggressively intervene to ensure that the money for management is not overspent.
It should be added that the existing contracts for gold parachutes will not be changed, the restriction only concerns new contracts, which is intended to be an additional incentive to participate in the programme.
"This is the first time in American history that a statutory limitation on CEO compensation will be in effect", said the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Democrat Barney Frank.
In addition, the State will have a right to acquire a stake in the banks participating in the scheme, thereby reducing the risk for taxpayers, since once the economy and, with it, the rescued bank, is back on its feet, they can profit from the transaction.
The plan calls for the president to submit a bill to Congress within the next five years, setting out how taxpayers can recover the expected losses from the financial sector.
Of course, there were also voices of doubt on both sides of the issue.
"This is not what the American people asked for, because this is not what taxpayer dollars will protect", said Rep. Darrell Issa, Republican from California.
His Democratic colleague from Ohio, Mary Kaptur, said the passage of the provision was pushed by the very people responsible for the Wall Street crash.
Industrial prices continued to rise
Domestic sales prices in the industry increased by 0,1% in August 2008 compared to the previous month and by 12,9% compared to August 2007, the Central Statistical Office reported.
Industry export sales prices were 1,1% higher than in July 2008 and decreased by 3,9% year on year.

Domestic sales prices in the industry increased only slightly, by 0.1 percent, compared with the previous month.
Domestic sales prices in manufacturing industries also increased slightly by 0.1% compared to July.
The largest price increases were in the leather and footwear sector in August 2008 (2,8%) mainly due to the monthly price increases of 4,6% in the manufacture of leather and footwear and 2,5% in the manufacture of footwear.
The higher price level of plastic and chemical raw materials caused a significant monthly increase in prices in the chemical materials and products manufacturing sector (1.6%).
Prices fell in the oil processing industry (1.4%), in the electrical machinery industry (0.9%) and, to a minimum, in the woodworking industry (0.1%).
Prices in the papermaking and publishing and printing industries remained unchanged.
In other manufacturing sectors, we have measured price increases in the range of 0.2 to 0.9 percent.
In the electricity, gas and water generation and distribution sector, which has a large weight in domestic industrial sales, prices rose by 0,3% in August, mainly as a continuing effect of the officially established gas price increase from 1 July.
In a 12-month comparison of domestic sales by manufacturing industry, prices increased most in the petroleum processing industry (32.4 per cent).
The metalworking industry saw a price increase of 13.2% and the food, beverage and tobacco industry, which is the most important, saw a price increase of 11%.
The price decrease was recorded in the textile and textile products industry (2.5%) and in the electrical machinery and equipment industry (0.3%).
In the other manufacturing sectors, the rate of price growth ranged between 0.6% and 9.1%.
Overall, manufacturing prices rose by 10.2 percent over the past year.
Prices in the electricity, gas and water production and distribution sectors exceeded those of the previous year by 18,7%.
In terms of a breakdown by sector, the highest monthly price increase (0.7%) in August was seen in the sectors involved in the production of tangible assets.
In the consumer goods sectors, prices increased by 0.3%, while in the energy and manufacturing sectors, prices were unchanged from the previous month.
The largest price increase compared with the same month of the previous year was observed in August 2008 in the energy-producing and further-processing sectors (16.8%).
In the consumer goods sectors, we recorded a 6.8% increase in prices, while in the tangible assets sectors, a 1.4% decrease.
The export sales prices of industrial products measured in forints increased by 1.1% in August compared with the previous month, and decreased by 3.9% in the 12-month comparison.
Our domestic currency depreciated against the euro by 1.7 percent, against the dollar by 7.1 percent, against the euro by 7.5 percent and against the dollar by 15.9 percent in one month compared to August 2007.
Next year, you can go to the United States without a visa?
According to Kinga Göncz, there is great hope that around January 12th the US-Hungarian visa-free travel agreement will come into force, the foreign minister spoke about this in Chicago before the leaders of the local Hungarian community.
In her view, "almost everything now depends on the timely establishment of an electronic system of authorisation or control of travel overseas".
The new system will not include a permit for entry, but tourists will have to register before leaving.
The Hungarian Foreign Minister is in Washington for talks.
He'll meet with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, who will present the Grand Cross of the Order of the Star of Hungary and hold talks with foreign policy advisors to Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama and Republican John McCain.
Barack Obama and McCain are for a bank bailout
Barack Obama and John McCain, the two major party presidential candidates, unanimously confirmed their support for the government's $700 billion bailout package, but there are also politicians who are calling for the resignation of the Treasury Secretary.
After days of marathon negotiations between Congress and the administration, the announcement was made early Sunday morning: a basic agreement on a bailout package for the banks had been reached.
The financial package, which aims to reshape Wall Street's crisis and freeze the credit market, has become a central issue in the presidential campaign.
Both Obama and McCain are unanimously calling themselves the better candidates to lead the country out of the economic crisis.
The latest polls show that as economic issues have come to the fore, Obama has regained some of the lead and the lead McCain had secured after the Republican convention with the nomination of Sarah Palin as vice president has been lost.
Obama told a pre-election rally in Detroit on Sunday that he hoped the $700 billion package would pass quickly through Congress.
He stressed that the proposal contains passages on consumer protection, which he also supports.
"We must act now, responsibly (...) your jobs, your savings, the whole industrial sector, the stability of the whole economy is in danger", he told a crowd of 35,000.
He didn't miss an opportunity to call McCain's ideas about economics outdated.
McCain explained in an interview with ABC television: "It's going to be a little bit uncomfortable for everybody . . . but doing nothing is simply not the way to go".
As the Republican senator pointed out, the bill calls for the creation of a committee to oversee the Treasury Secretary and the reduction of severance pay for top officials he has insisted on.
Obama told CBS that McCain had no substantial role in the negotiations, but was in daily contact with the secretary.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Sunday that the House of Representatives will likely vote on the bill as early as Monday.
Overview of the press in the German-speaking area
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within it have become more self-confident - so analyzes the weak result of the CSU in Bavaria Der Spiegel.
The Haiders are ready to rule Austria to prevent a Red-Black coalition.
The Spiegel (spiegel.de) is the official newspaper of the German Federal Republic.
In an online edition of a left-wing German news magazine, Franz Walter, in his article entitled "The Bavarian Revolution Eats Its Fathers", discusses the causes of the CSU's dramatic defeat.
According to a well-known political scientist, the erosion of the CSU began long before the sad Beckstein-Huber duo took office.
The Christian Socialists have been restoring Bavaria for decades - and now these modern citizens are turning away from them.
The change of the seasons is a problem for the whole of Christian democracy, and therefore for Angela Merkel.
The debate was not entirely surprising to the CSU, but on Saturday it ended a process that had been possible to predict for almost exactly ten years: the undisputed hegemony of one state party had ended.
Ten years ago, in 1998, CSU had fallen to 47.7 percent, the first time since the 1950s that it had fallen below the 50 percent mark.
This was repeated three years ago in the Bundestag elections in 2005, in the so often remembered Stoiber period.
The reason is the modernization that CSU has been consistently implementing in this country, which is eating away at its parents.
The social scientists have been predicting this for 40 years, but the pace has been very wrong, and secularisation, educational outcomes, the settlement of Germans from the east and north in the developing regions of Bavaria, could not have been without consequences for the loyalty of the CSU voters.
Modernization is associated with an increase in opportunity, which has its visible political implications.
The right-wing camp is intact, only the voters within it have become more self-reliant, critical, opinionated.
It is also clear that in recent weeks CSU has moved away from the traditional layers of society: professionals, tradesmen, people with a high school diploma and a university degree.
That's already reduced CSU support to under 40 percent.
The President of the Republic shall be elected by the President of the Republic from among the members of the General Assembly.
In an article entitled "Who, with whom? Party leaders are reluctant to discuss coalition issues", the conservative Vienna daily addresses the confused internal political situation that has emerged as a result of the Austrian elections.
The SPÖ wishes to negotiate with the ÖVP.
The ÖVP shall prevent the SPÖ from interfering in its internal affairs.
The BÖZ seems open to all negotiations, the Greens do not want to negotiate a coalition yet.
The elections are over, now it's all about the coalition; in the debate on public television, the party leaders didn't look too closely at their cards.
SPÖ President Werner Faymann confirmed that he wanted to negotiate with the ÖVP.
And the WFP wants to show that cooperation between both sides is certainly possible - in some of the Länder and in the social partnership it exists.
Faymann left open the question of whether he could envisage a coalition with Wilhelm Molter, the current chairman of the ÖVP, as vice-chancellor.
As he put it, the Schüssel-Molterer course was overruled in every case.
A repeat of this course is out of the question.
Molterer responded to the red offers with caution.
As he said, cooperation would certainly not be successful if Faymann tried to interfere in the internal affairs of the ÖVP.
Whether his party will choose the opposition or join a coalition is still completely open in the party, these questions must be discussed decisively within the ÖVP.
The chairman of the BZÖ, Jörg Haider, once again seemed open to all directions.
"To prevent a red-and-black coalition, we are ready to take on government responsibility", Haider said.
Járóková: We need to break the cycle of poverty and segregation
The European Equality Summit, hosted this year by France, the current presidency of the European Union, began in Paris today.
Lívia Járóková, MEP for the European People's Party and Fidesz, was one of the main speakers of the debate in her message to the plenary, drawing attention to segregation in schools as one of the most serious injustices affecting Roma children and also the most serious obstacle to their implementation.
The summit was opened, on behalf of the French Presidency, by Xavier Bertrand, French Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and Vladimir Spidla, European Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities.
The negotiations brought together representatives of governments, the European social partners, the most important European rights organisations and civil society organisations active in the field of equal opportunities.
According to the press office of the Fidesz MEPs' group, Járóková pointed out that apart from discrimination in the recruitment of labour, Roma were excluded from the European labour market mainly because of their low level of education.
"The vast majority of young Roma do not have a secondary education and, due to the poor quality of basic education, only a small fraction of them can achieve a higher level of education".
Ms Járóková also stressed that education, as a fundamental human right, has a key role in the implementation of other human rights.
Investing in early education for Roma children can boost the economies of the EU Member States.
According to the MEP, there is a need to raise awareness of these connections among the widest circles - among Roma and non-Roma children.
The earlier a Roma student starts school, the better his chances are of becoming a productive member of the labour market; through income and consumption taxes, they contribute to the national budget.
'The Roma need to be guaranteed the right to quality education and the removal of their poor quality and segregated education is a right of their citizenship in the European Union', emphasised Lívia Járóková.
The MEPs also stressed the need for a coherent European Union with a focus on the goal and action to accelerate the process of desegregation of schools immediately, and that the proper observance of existing and planned anti-discrimination regulations was of paramount importance.
"The vicious circle of poverty, segregation and unemployment must be broken, Roma children must be given the opportunities offered by the democratic space, so that they can participate in the future of Europe as full citizens", Járóková demanded.
The European Summit on Equal Opportunities, held annually since last year's Berlin meeting, is a guarantee for everyone of the objective of providing an independent forum for the attainment of the objectives of equality and the elimination of discrimination, set at both European and national level.
CSU: temporary grace
The fate of the two Huber-Beckstein will be decided by the end of October.
Despite the shameful electoral debacle, no heads have yet fallen, the debate on personal issues has been postponed by the leaders of the Bavarian CSU.
Party chairman Erwin Huber and state premier Günther Beckstein can still remain in their seats, the question is how long this grace will last.
The fate of the tandem, which suffered a catastrophic 17% loss of votes, will be decided by the party's extraordinary congress this last weekend in October.
The members of the much-criticized duo have made it clear that they will not be sticking to their posts.
They tried to calm the angry members of the faction and the base, who, due to the loss of an absolute majority, demanded the "Bavarian tsunami" to draw personal consequences.
Five years ago, under the leadership of Edmund Stoiber, the Christian Social Union won 60.7 percent, but now, a year after the coup against Stoiber, it has only 43.4 percent.
The CSU, producing 18% of Germany's GDP, has been the autocrat of Bavaria for 46 years.
The conservatives still hold high positions in the southern state, which is crucial to the Hungarian economy, but in the future they will be forced to form a coalition.
One of the first signs of the reorganisation within the party is the fact that the member of the narrow intelligence team who will start the exploratory negotiations on a possible coalition of the Munich government with the liberal FDP, or the right-wing group Free Voters, will also be the vice-president and Federal Minister of Agriculture Horst Seehofer, who is considered to be a possible successor to Huber.
It is ironic that Gabriele Pauliová was elected to the parliament on the Free Voters' ticket, whose performance against Stoiber was used by the Huber-Beckstein duo to carry out a coup, but then they made a mercilessly short process with the ambitious municipal politician.
CSU leaders are now focusing all their energies on how to stabilize Beckstein.
In the transitional period, Stoiber will also have an active role, who until now has been spinning the threads from behind, the former provincial premier and former chairman of the CSU called 28 September the most painful day of his political career.
On Monday, Huber made some sharp remarks about the CDU, saying that they deserved much more support from the sister party.
Other CSU politicians interpreted the defeat as a warning to the CDU and Angela Merkel.
After the Bundestag elections in September 2009, Merkel will not be able to become chancellor unless the CSU, which played a major role in the 2005 national success, somehow gets its feet together.
According to Merkel, who has been hard pressed to hide her disappointment because of the fiasco, the loss of CSU positions will not have a negative impact on the Berlin grand coalition.
Which is, of course, relative: treating the wounded CSU won't be easier and the crisis of the Social Democrats continues.
The SPD's 18.6% in Bavaria is the weakest result since 1946.
- I'm not sure.
No opposition MPs were elected to the Belarusian parliament in Sunday's elections.
This can be explained, according to Russian observers, by the welfare and stability prevailing in the country led by Alexander Lukashenko, but according to the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) by the illegalities that occurred during the counting of votes.
The OSCE, which sent 450 observers from 43 countries, did not recognize the election.
Although the 110-member legislature of the country of 10 million has been without opposition for well over a decade, the opposition grouping under the name of United Democratic Forces (ODS) had seriously hoped before yesterday's elections that Lukashenko, who was allowed to renew his presidential mandate for a fourth time after the constitutional change in the disputed elections in 2006, would this time "allow" several opposition MPs to appear in parliament.
The ODS also dropped the previously considered boycott.
The background to the opposition's expectation was that Belarus, increasingly economically dependent on Russia - which has borrowed to mitigate the impact of Russia's steadily increasingly expensive natural gas imports and has also helped to get the pipeline company Beltransgaz, which owns the country, into Russian hands - would like to improve relations with the European Union, where the Belarusian political establishment, which has been judged to be anti-democratic, has denied entry to Lukashenko and other high-level politicians.
The release earlier pointed out that the OSCE's assessment of the pre-election campaign had focused on the positive developments rather than the shortcomings - for example, the ban on candidacy for one third of the opposition candidates.
Monday's OSCE flash report also had reservations about the campaign, during which opposition candidates were virtually unable to appear in the press, especially since the opposition could not be present at the vote counting.
At the same time, the opposition says, there is an improvement in the political system: political prisoners have been released and Minsk is willing to engage in minor confrontations with Moscow, while continuing to refuse to recognize Georgia's breakaway South Ossetia and Abkhazia, even though Russia, with which Belarus forms a paper-based union state, has considered these two territories independent for a month.
"We have taken two steps forward and one step back, but the most important thing is that the dialogue between Belarus and the EU has begun", Alexander Milinkevich told our newspaper.
According to the opposition presidential candidate in 2006, it is desirable that this remains the case, even though she "was too afraid to let the insignificant parliament of the only opposition member go".
Looking at the results, the opposition is not planning protests, but is trying to deliver its message to voters about the need for economic reforms.
"Of course, we have a lot of problems with this, we have to print opposition papers in Russia, the distribution is hindered by local authorities, but I see that the change is supported by more and more people, even among the elderly", said Milinkevich, pointing out that Lukashenka's regime, which considers the creation of social security as its greatest achievement, is not considered correct even by the most officially supported layer of pensioners.
"Due to the country's debt and growing trade deficit, it is only a matter of time before the 'silent graveyard' of social security collapses", Milinkevich said.
Unlike the opposition politicians, Russian observers rated the election as democratic.
The head of the CIS mission, Sergei Lebedev, told Russia's RIA Novosti news agency that "people don't believe in words, but in deeds", so the absence of opposition is nothing but proof of the maturity of Belarusian voters.
Brunetta: "From now on, breakfast before work"
This is the first time in the history of Chigi Palace that a revolving door has been introduced for staff arrivals and departures.
But as of today, this new policy will be effective against people who are sneaky, people who get injected and then go for coffee during business hours.
The new anti-lazy law was announced today by the Minister of Public Administration, Renato Brunetta, and the Secretary General of the Presidential Council, Maureto Masi.
'Round doors', says Brunetta, 'are a tool for better work, more efficiency, more presence and more services' says the Minister.
"Now a new era of accountability and transparency is opening up.
This is reformism", Brunetta stresses.
We'll complete the installation in all the Council Presidency buildings at Chigi Palace.
For Masi, "the choice of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic point of view".
There were no objections from the employees, the Secretary-General assures: "It was a joint approach with the employees and the cooperation of all".
In short, no more breakfast on the job; no more coffee and croissants.
Brunetta smiles and says, "there's nothing better than a good cappuccino at seven in the morning".
During a conference at the Higher School of Public Administration
In Rome, the minister finally announces that in three months, the absence of public employees due to illness has decreased by 50%, that is, 60,000 more people a year at work".
He adds that it is necessary to make the Italian public administration more efficient
"its payroll dynamics  explains the Minister  has doubled over the last 8-10 years relative to the private sector and is far higher than the rate of inflation".
Meanwhile, thousands of public servants have gathered to reject the norms of Brunetto's decree in accordance with a request backed by Codacons.
"While the Minister of Public Administration today presents figures on reduced absenteeism due to illness, the Consumer Protection Association says the nation of 'lazy workers' is growing.
In Italy we have thousands of productive and decent public servants who have gathered to declare war on the illegitimate norms contained in the decree".
The Taru will protest, in particular, against the exclusion of sick leave allowances, which depends on the activity; the extension of the period in which the sick person can be checked, the time frame for the control visits, and other standards included in the new ministerial provisions.
The European Commission has recently published a report on the impact of the European Union on the environment.
Every day in Italy, 2,500 work accidents occur, three people die and 27 are permanently disabled.
Inail figures confirm that in 2007 we have about 1,200 deaths from work-related accidents.
These figures reflect the severity of the event, which remains one of the leading causes of death, causing almost twice as many deaths as homicides.
To bring this dramatic problem to the attention of the institutions, the social and information media, Anmil is celebrating the 58th National Day of Work Accident Victims in all Italian regions today, on the second Sunday in October.
"The disturbing data disseminated by Anmilia and the same tragic news of these days confirm how important the issue of occupational safety is", confirms the President of the Republic Giorgio Napolitano in a message sent to the President of Anmilia, the National Association for the Disabled and Disabled at Work, Pietro Mercandelli.
The Head of State expresses his deep admiration for the continuous collective effort to ensure safety in the workplace, to protect injured workers, to help the families of the victims and to involve public opinion".
"Naturally, an outraged 'dost' has been raised, frankly shared in the face of tragedies whose scale has caused media uproar and public participation, but daily reality offers us dramatic cases again, even if they are repeated in their dynamics".
Napolitano is not one to hide that 'there is certainly a resource problem here: it is crucial to invest in training and awareness.
The numerous initiatives promoted in the field of education are particularly important in order to give young people who are facing the world of work a clearer awareness.
It is necessary to draw attention to this phenomenon, not to give up because of its disturbing social gravity, to apply and improve legislative norms.
The Chamber's President, Gianfranco Fini, stressed that 'deaths resulting from work accidents create an absolutely critical social situation, offend the conscience of each of us and force all institutions to make a convincing effort to bring this situation to an end'.
"As for the data on accidents at work, they seem to show some positive turn, but this does not deny that the number of deaths due to accidents at work is as alarming as it is", remarked again Anmilu President Pietro Mercandelli.
"We don't want this 'effort to reduce' to lead to less attention, because the moment attention stops, tragedy breaks out.
"We believe that, in general, too little is being done to stop the problem of accidents, and there are many activities that can have an impact on the problem.
It is necessary, in our opinion, to increase controls and inspections, but also to intervene more strongly in the training of workers, starting from school age", emphasised Mr Mercandelli.
'Further efforts are needed' he added 'in terms of communication and public participation.
But above all, there is a need for a greater sense of responsibility on the part of employers towards a phenomenon which represents an exceptional social phenomenon . . ".
Mercandelli concluded by saying that this was a progressive degeneration of the level of entitlement to compensation for labour victims and the 'withdrawal of supporting care' to which the system had been subjected in recent years.
"The aim is to give back the worker's insurance guarantee", he added, "because the fate of those who harm themselves must not depend on spontaneity or the occasional gift of the legislator".
MP3 players, the charges, put your hearing at risk.
Listening to loud music for long periods and using portable music players like MP3 players can cause permanent hearing damage.
According to a communication published today by the European Commission, which in an official report circulated in Brussels quotes the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Health Risks that have recently emerged and been identified (Csrseri) by the European Commission, the European Commission has published a report on the health risks of the European Union's food supply.
"From this scientific opinion, we read in footnotes, it follows that 5-10% of those who listen to music for at least five years with portable music devices, for more than an hour a day a week, and who keep the device on a high volume, are at risk of permanent hearing loss".
"I am concerned that so many young people who frequently use portable music devices and mobile phones at high acoustic levels may unknowingly damage their hearing in an irreparable way", admits Meglena Kuneva.
'Scientific evidence  continues  shows a clear risk and a need to react quickly.
The most important thing is that we need to stimulate consumers and get this information out there.
We must continue to re-examine existing control systems in the light of this scientific finding, so that they become fully effective and keep pace with new technology.'
Brussels has asked the Independent Scientific Committee to examine this problem in view of the high use of portable musical instruments and the increasing number of young people exposed to noise of this origin.
'The scientists  concluded the Eu  Executive Officer confirm that there is cause for concern and the European Commission will now examine, together with the other members and parties who raised the issue, what measures could possibly be put in place to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise caused by portable musical instruments and similar devices.'
There is already a European safety standard that limits the noise level of portable musical instruments to 100 dB, but there are growing concerns about hearing damage that may be caused by excessive exposure to similar forms of noise.
It is very possible to limit these damages by finding solutions such as reducing the level and duration of exposure.
The Scientific Committee of the European Communities believes that users of portable musical instruments, if they use loud music (more than 89 decibels) for only five hours a week, exceed the current limits corresponding to the maximum noise level allowed in the workplace.
Those who listen to music in such conditions for long periods of time risk permanent hearing loss after five years.
This problem is thought to affect 5-10% of users of such devices and may affect between 2.5 and 10 million people in the EU.
Rome, Alemanno leaves free-throw to the Commission on the Future of the Capital
We start today, we close in March, we have sums in June.
This is the calendar given by Campidogli to the staff of the "Commission for the Future of the City of Rome", which met this morning at its new headquarters behind the Baths of Caracalla.
In six months, President Antonio Marzano and 49 other members of the commission will compile a manual for Rome.
Once the doors are closed in March, Giunta and the City Council will evaluate the analyses and projects so that in June they can present a strategic plan for Rome with the "official stamp" of Campidoglio and his councillor Gianni Alemanna.
'The Commission is completely independent and all political, social and cultural ideas are included in it.  wants to emphasise Alemanno  It will have to secure proposals for the development of Rome, which will ultimately be used by the political arbiters, which remain the Giunta e Municipali.
It's not a change of function, but simply a matter of finding a place to work on a big project for Rome.
The work will be completed in March and then disbanded, because this institution must have a precise timetable.
In June, the mayor announced, "We will present a strategic plan and build on the work done by the Commission for the Future of Rome".
To those who accuse the Commission of being useless because its opinions will not be binding, Alemanno replies: 'It all depends on the work the Commission is able to do and the quality of their proposals.
If they are as good as the Attali Commission's proposals, and I'm sure they are in Rome, their contribution will be decisive.
Too often, politics is blamed on the everyday problems and the emergencies that arise from time to time.
We, on the other hand, want to look further and further, in a deeper perspective, to work seriously on the development of Rome and its future.
The Mayor of Rome also wants to emphasise that 'this Commission is neither a useless undertaking nor a bluff: it is completely free, it will not cost the citizens of Rome a single euro, and it serves to reflect and to involve the best intelligence the capital has'.
For Alemanna, in essence, "we need to have a strategic blueprint as a starting point, neither definitive nor fixed, in order to allow our city to rise authentically to the level it urgently needs and to think with a united spirit about its future".
The future, he said, "will not be confined to the current municipal boundaries, but will look much further" not only in terms of the future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital, but "will also include the role that Rome can and must play as the capital of Europe and the Mediterranean".
Obama, the first anti-American president, and now we know why.
One famous American president wrote that it was important to him to remain independent: "Barack Obama will be the next anti-American president".
The first was Jimmy Carter, who, by his decisions, decimated the US economy and maintained relations (as he does today as a private citizen) with the enemy Islam".
The attacks against Obama are escalating as the election date approaches.
A woman from Miami wrote on the Web: "This man is full of ambition.
But he has the audacity to think that Obama will be elected to the highest office in a nation that has had two governors and five black senators!"
In fact, these attacks don't say much; they're clearly racially motivated attacks, and they don't answer the question of voters: Will he be a good president? And then we have the polls; everybody says Obama will win, and with a big lead.
Even so, there are those who act from the heart and not from the brain.
A newspaper in Mississippi, deep in the southern United States, wrote a comment: "For once in the voting booth, we know who the American patriot will vote for".
It brings to light a side of the American mind that has remained hidden until the very last moment.
Say what you want, but in the end, we'll take care of who gets ticked off, Obama or McCain".
There are people who swear that if Obama wins, we'll leave America.
These are things that have never been said before, seemingly almost certain to be the success of the black candidate.
But despite all these considerations for the Democrats, the main weapon is George Bush.
1,500 people were asked, "What mistakes did Bush make during his term?" 89 percent said, "Iraq".
America is changing.
In Vietnam, this nation lost 50,000 soldiers and sent them home with a kick in the ass.
4,500 soldiers lost their lives in Iraq, and the Americans weren't forced to pack up.
And yet Iraq became Bush's weakness for most.
Whoever takes over for Georgie W will have a huge task ahead of them.
The collapse of the US economy has been felt by journalists, too: the newspaper is in a period of investigation, and many blame the Internet, the "killer" of the print media.
The Pew Research Center asked 500 journalists about the state of their profession and their expectations for the future.
Well, today, almost all journalists are pessimistic about their future.
However, the respondents did not openly say that they had less concerns about credibility.
They don't feel isolated like they used to.
The problem for American journalists is money, the money.
For these journalists, the crisis of 2008 is the crisis of a broken economic model.
Besides, the cuts made in the newsroom, the room where the editors work to put the paper together, are a huge problem.
This is a problem that, according to the journalists interviewed, needs to be solved if we are to fundamentally change the way traditional journalism is understood by the general public.
American journalism is permeated by a clear but complex pessimism.
Six out of 10 print media journalists and senior executives believe that journalism is being mismanaged on a national scale.
In the local area, the executive group is at 65%.
Printed against broadcast.
It's not hard for a journalist to see where the web is going.
The larger publishing houses are making their way to the Internet, which many view as the "killer" of print.
The "economic pressure" that journalists point to has increased by as much as 79 percent.
Five hundred of the journalists surveyed admitted that they turn to technology in the hope that it will "do something good" for their work.
The biggest gap in American journalism is between those who run the newsrooms, that is, the executives, and the reporters who work for them.
56% of national leaders are confident their reporters share their values, while at the local level the value drops to 23%.
This is for someone with a "certain job".
The national figure of executives who think they're going to lose their jobs in three years is 47%.
As for journalists, they're up to 30%.
As for the "sure work" of staffing America, it's still the order of the day.
Only 13% of journalists work on contract.
In a nation as vast as the United States, with three hundred million people and thousands of newspapers, magazines, radio, TV and Internet, employers often offer what they want, and so it's a take-it-or-leave-it question.
The executives almost always get paid a hefty salary, and the editor can make up to ten thousand dollars a month, in addition to pension and insurance payments.
As for the holidays, the argument is complicated: a certain number of days after the first year, a certain number of days after the third year, and up to 15 days after a certain number of years.
But American journalists, by their own admission, get sick a lot in the course of a year.
It's just a matter of the climate.
Unipol: the court in Rome, Danilo Coppola is in Grutaferrata
The president of the second criminal court of Rome, Carmelo Rinaudo, has decided to reject the application of the real estate entrepreneur Daniel Coppola, who asked to be moved from his home in Grottaferrata to an apartment in Rome.
Coppola is being investigated for bankruptcy in connection with the bidding on the sale of Unipol-Bnl.
During his own trial, he was released last week from house arrest, which was changed to a forced permanent residence in Grottaferrata.
His lawyers, Michele Gentiloni and Gaetano Pecorella, asked that the real estate entrepreneur be allowed to change his residence from a rural town to the capital.
However, according to the court, this transfer (against which the PM had spoken) would have allowed him to influence his company and to obtain the evidence against him.
The Elite in Danger
This was demonstrated a few days ago when the House of Representatives voted against the $700 billion bailout proposed by the White House: a large number of Americans were more interested in punishing Wall Street than in saving the economy.
As yesterday's New York Times reported, the current crisis is dividing the Republican Party, increasingly divided between its old East Coast soul, more moderate, sympathetic to the federal institutions and business community, and its new soul, conservative, hostile to Washington and the financial world, strong in the Midwest and South.
The soul who arrogantly expressed the vote I spoke of at the beginning...
But this is just one example of the changes, the big changes that the current economic earthquake is already showing: not only in the United States, but in the whole West and maybe not just here.
In the United States and Europe, this crisis seems to be acting as an accelerator of long-in-cubation phenomena that are consolidating in a new climate and finally coming to light.
The first of these phenomena is reactualization, an extraordinary market revival, a dual category of State power in relation to a certain re-nationalization of the economy.
The crisis is indeed a crisis of banking and financial institutions, which of course have strong ties abroad, but in which the budgets of people and families living in one country, in one state, are most heavily involved.
And that also created a political problem for those who run it: that is, how to respond to the grievances and protests of people and families who are, among other things, voters.
In short, the crisis appears to be economically global, but politically almost exclusively national.
Political internationalism seems to be largely out of the picture or to have little to add: the clearest proof of this is the European Union, which is divided as always between different interests and different national strategies and which is unable to decide on a common political line.
And so they're all waiting for the government of each individual country to step in, to rescue, to revive the market, to set new rules and, most importantly, to allocate funds: at the moment when we get into a pinch, only the states have the economic means, the amount of financial resources, to be able to try and put things right.
And they also have the necessary means and the authority to use them: two resources of immense value, under certain circumstances, that no market and no international organization could ever have in a similar way.
This new emphasis on the national state is in line with the growing importance of recent economic developments, which tend to attribute to a factor closely related to it: territorial affiliation.
Paradoxically, in fact, while we believed that we had entered the realm of the more and more sophisticated, immaterial technology, while we believed that global finance was destined to rule the world, we suddenly realized that our future would have to be increasingly confronted with such immaterial things as water, grain, oil.
All things, anyone would say, can be transported from one place on earth to another, but they are, in any case, absolutely bound to a limited space, a territory.
So whoever becomes their ruler has a lot more cards on his sleeve than whoever doesn't and whoever has the misfortune of living in a place with no grain, no oil, and no water.
I'm getting to the second novelty, but it's a bad omen.
When you talk about territory, state, government, you're inevitably talking about politics, which is leadership.
In view of the economic crisis, two convergent phenomena appear to be emerging.
On the one hand, the realization that there is an objective need for authoritarian leadership, a demand for someone who can take the lead.
On the other hand, a wave of discrediting of the existing leadership, especially the economic one, which proved equally unconventional and full of dark places.
And together with that something even deeper and in some ways disturbing: the discredit, the impatience, the sense of incompetence and the absence that the entire ruling class in more and more Western countries is trying to control.
It seems that the belief is spreading more and more among the masses of the population that their actions are the same as the ideas of the still popular elite, their way of feeling and being, their culture in the true sense of the word, that the elite has already outlived its time and is indifferent to the opinions of the majority.
The demand for leadership is simply a subterranean one-branch movement, but the powerful movement to remove the ruling classes and the traditional political order is manifested in sudden electoral "wings" or unexpected shifts in collective mood in the last and most recent period, from the conservative rise in Austria-Bavoria to the fall of the Labour Party in Britain, to the revolt of the American congressmen against Bush (and perhaps the victory of the right in Italy has something to do with it).
We have the impression that the traditional elites, their parties, their programmes, but also their ceremonies, their newspapers, their accredited intelligentsia, someone would say their format, have increasingly more problems to understand, that is to represent, what, not from today, is being created in the deep layers of Western societies and that the economic crisis is again strengthening, growing, potentially too strong.
Before that, it would be an exaggeration to talk about a permanent "mass uprising".
But we certainly can't say that it means keeping our eyes wide open.
Super glue to walk on the walls
Defy the laws of gravity with super glue and walk on walls as Spider-Man in the future.
This is the subject of various American research centers, and now a team of four institutes has come very close to it.
Scientists have managed to keep a 100-pound body glued to a vertical wall with a sticker only one inch [2.5 cm] square.
The American journal Science has published the findings of researchers from the University of Dayton, Akron, the Georgia Institute of Technology, and the Air Force Research Laboratory.
The material that the team has invented is a development of existing materials that use a special structure of carbon called carbon dwarf tubes.
"The base of the adhesive can be thought of as a series of tubes laid out like an orderly pile of spaghetti", explains Zhong Lin Wang of the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta.
The researchers drew inspiration from the gecko's feet, covered with microscopic hairs that allow the animal to make a perfect grip.
Tests on various materials, such as glass, Teflon and glass paper, have shown that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the legs of these reptiles and "just snap off the wall", explains Liming Dai, a researcher at the University of Dayton's College of Engineering.
"This material could be useful as a temporary adhesive", adds Liming Dai.
Perhaps to walk on walls like Spider-Man? Perhaps, but researchers are thinking of far less fascinating uses as a connection of electrical devices, because dwarf carbon tubes are conductors of heat and electricity.
Other applications could be in aerospace engineering .
No superheroes as of yet.
 The University of California, Berkeley, is also researching a new adhesive.
In an article in the journal American Chemical Society, California scientists have demonstrated a glue formed from micro-fibers like hair that self-cleans from dust by moving over the surface to maintain perfect adhesion.
Medication: never with juice
Watch out for grapefruit, orange and apple juice.
If you take these drinks, which are consumed mainly in the summer, because they're refreshing and full of vitamins, along with some life-saving medications, their consumption changes the potency or decreases the potency with serious health consequences.
To highlight the risks of juices, both fresh and raw, combined with certain medications, David Bailey, a professor at the University of Western Ontario, London, at the 263rd National Meeting of the American Chemical Society in Philadelphia, now raises a new alarm: One glass of grapefruit, orange, and apple juice can reduce the absorption of certain lifesaving drugs, cancel their beneficial effects, and put patients' health at risk.
Grapefruit juice has already been accused of being responsible for increasing to toxic levels the effects of certain antiarrhythmic drugs, antibiotics, anxiolytics, antihistamines, and neurological drugs.
THE MEDICAL AGENCY in Italy itself announced this in a newsletter two years ago, urging doctors and patients not to underestimate the dangers of this mixture and to be careful about what they drink if they take medicines such as Diazepam or Metadone.
Experts also say that orange and apple juices contain substances that can be used to suppress medication.
A long list of effects toned down by grapefruit and other juices.
Hence the challenge of Michele Carruby, Director of the Department of Pharmacology at the State University of Milan: 'Such findings are usually reported immediately to the various international and national pharmaceutical agencies, which eventually arrange and exchange information instructions for medicines.
So always read the labels of the medicines you buy and if you see anything unclear, don't worry, ask your doctor or pharmacist for clarification", stressed an expert for ANSA.
The Nobel Prize in Economics is awarded to Paul Krugman
The Nobel Prize was awarded to American Paul Krugman for his studies of commercial models and the localization of economic activity.
Krugman is a 55-year-old New Kenean who teaches at Princeton University and is a well-known editor for the New York Times.
Krugman is one of the most important critics of the Bush administration's foreign, economic and political policies.
A few months after the September 11 attacks, in the days leading up to the collapse of Enron, Krugman predicted in a commentary in the New York Times that the second event would be, in terms of its consequences for the history of the United States, far more important than the first.
A prediction that has caused much controversy and which has been criticized for years, but which has proven accurate.
"I am surprised and shocked by the speed with which collapses like Enron and Worldcom have disappeared from public view", Krugman said in late 2002.
According to Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, Executive Board of the European Central Bank, Krugman is "an economist of great stature" but also a "populariser who has a very aggressive style, especially critical of the excesses of the Bush administration's liberal approach".
Open Office, we have the third edition of the "anti-Microsoft" package.
It's the day of Open Office.org 3.0, an open source, custom-made package that's going to reach a growing number of users, from the home to the office, from professionals to the public administration, as a free alternative to the more familiar Microsoft Office.
After about a year of work by volunteers, controlled by SUN Microsystems, the new Open Office is now available to the general public with various innovations: to the welcome screen and the revised and improved opening window, there are added other, far more significant, such as compatibility for the operating system Apple Mac OS X and support for the new ODF (Open Document Format) 1.2, the latest standard version of ISO.
Emphasis is also placed on collaboration with Office 2007, Open Office is able to open the document even with the new Microsoft extension (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx).
Of interest are the special features of some models, such as the ability to reduce the size of a PowerPoint presentation, useful for e.g. electronic transmission, or the ability to transfer a PDF file to a graphic design model and retain the original appearance of the page.
From this perspective, we can create "PDF hybrids" that resemble typical Adobe graphics and have the properties of a spreadsheet or word processor.
Collaboration is an element that has received many improvements within application programs: in Excel it is possible to work together between different users and avoid conflicts on changes, in the text program each collaborator is assigned one color to the comments to be more clear identification in the revision phase.
Some companies are also working on bringing some of the Open Office features to the web (on the cloud), and should have a final result in the coming weeks.
The Italian version can be downloaded from http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html, it was added to the English version, which is on the mirror since Friday.
In addition to Windows and Mac OS, the package is also available for the Linux operating system.
The installation CD can also be sent to your home or workplace on request.
And if the theme of free of charge can be a trigger for expansion in households, it is precisely in the commercial area that the Open Office package is betting a lot, and it can already count on a variety of projects implemented in public administration and schools.
And there is no shortage of training, consultancy and support services ideal for SMEs, which could open up business prospects.
Open Office consists of five main models: Writer, for video writing, replacing Word; Calc, a spreadsheet processor that aims to replace Excel; Impress, for PowerPoint-like presentations; Dbase, as in the case of the more famous Access, a program that allows you to work on databases; and Draw, finally, a graphics model.
The target for 2008 is 5 million downloads, and considering that we're almost at 3.6 million downloads today, with the new release it's possible that this number could be surpassed.
Kohl's test was positive, too. It's his fourth case of doping.
A new positive in the last Tour de France: the Austrian Bernhard Kohl, of the Gerolsteiner team, third in the classification and winner of the best rider's jersey.
The report was cited by the pages of the daily L'Equipe.
The 26-year-old Kohl is the fourth rider to test positive for Ceru, the third-generation Epo, after Italians Riccardo Ricco and Leonardo Piepoli and Gerolsteiner's German Stefan Schumacher.
The results of the blood samples from Kohl's are consistent with those from the Losanna and Chatenay-Malabry labs in recent weeks.
If the control analyses confirm positive for Ceru, the Austrian will lose his third place in the Tour and face a stipulated two-year disqualification.
The report of the positive test of Kohl for Epo of the third generation is confirmed by the head of the French anti-doping agency Pierre Bordry, who told the Associated Press that he had already informed the Austrian government authorities of the result.
The 26-year-old Austrian placed second behind Spain's Carlos Sastr and America's Cadel Evans, and won the best climber's pointed jersey.
Immigration: is italy also racist?
Italy "as a country of emigrants has only in the last house transformed itself into a preferred destination for immigrants" who are received with resistance.
Is this turning a beautiful country into a nation of racists? asks a long New York Times article, which devoted this article to the debate on racism in Italy, starting with the case of young Abdul William Guibre, originally from Burkina Faso, who was killed last month in Milan for stealing a box of cookies.
This case highlights what the New York Times calls the "Northern Paradox": the northern regions are at the same time those that register "more integration and more jobs", but also "the strongest anti-immigrant sentiment in the country and the strongest support for the Northern League".
To confirm the growing tension between Italy and immigrants, the NYT cites cases of intolerance from Milan, Parma, Rome, Ciampina and Castel Volturna.
More than that.
Also, new legislation demanded by Legos to curb immigration and facilitate the expulsion of illegal immigrants is cited as an example of the changing climate in Italy.
A trend emphasized by both the Pope and the President of the Republic: "Giorgio Napolitano, after meeting Benedict XVI in the Quirinal, asked the state and the church to work together to defeat racism".
Students are victims of expensive rent - up to 900 euros per room
The market for college student rentals is not in crisis.
According to the latest research by Sunia, the union for tenants, renting a single room for a student can cost up to 900 euros in Milan, 700 in Florence, 650 in Naples, 600 in Rome.
"Jev has already reached the point where whole classes of students have lost the right to study due to the overall exorbitant prices their families would have to bear", explains Sunia's head of studies Laura Mariani, "in this city, the high demand from students has distorted the market in such a way that it has triggered a price-increase process that has spread to residents as well".
In most cases, the lease offers contain several infractions: free-standing, unregistered contracts, without a limited lease, with associated sub-leases.
Sunji needs an exceptional intervention to regulate prices through tax revisions.
If we look at the details of the research, we see that in Milan, in the Brianza area, the need for a single bed is about 450 euros, for a single-bed room from a minimum of 650 (the Bande Nere area) through a medium value of 800 (the Lambiate, Udine and Fiera areas) to a maximum of 900 (the Vittoria area).
In Florence, a single bed costs an average of 350 to 400 euros, a room about 700.
In Bologna, where students are concentrated in the zones near the university, the cost of a bed in a double room is 250/280 euros, and in a single room it is 370 to 500 euros.
In Rome, in the central university areas (San Lorenzo, piazza Bologna) they want about 600 euros for a single-bed room, 450 beds in a double-bed.
The prices are somewhat lower (€ 550 for a single bed) in areas close to other universities (Ostiense and Cinecittà).
The only way to save is to move to the peripheral areas: 300 euros per bed and 450 euros for a single room in the Prenestina, Centocelle and other areas.
In Naples, the bed costs 300/450 euros, the room costs between 400 and 600 euros, with the highest prices in the Policlinico, Vomero and Colli Aminei zones.
In Bari, they charge 250/350 euros for a bed, at least 350 for a single room.
In smaller cities, prices are definitely lower, but they have a greater impact on the economy of the citizens.
In cities like Perugia, where rent is the most common phenomenon for students from countries outside the European Union, another anomaly is finally being noted: an increase of about 25-30% in the fee they charge for international students, compared to Italian students.
Farewell to the old cinema Paradiso, the city is demolishing the historic halls
The historic movie theaters are closing in favor of the Multiplex.
"A city without a cinema is like a blind man, like a face without eyes".
The film, presented by director Giuseppe Tornator, successfully documents what is happening in the big Italian urban centres as well as in the rural towns.
The process of the reduction of cinemas, the birth of large multi-screen cinema in the suburbs and the subsequent demise of single-screen cinema in the city centre, is one of those events that seems inevitable and irreversible, but also has all the hallmarks of a true cultural crime.
Often, historical places filled with memories disappear, "it's like losing a friend, an acquaintance with whom we shared a journey and a lot of emotions", says the director of the New Cinema Paradiso, a film which won the Tornator Oscar and the Grand Jury Prize at Cannes 20 years ago, and which told the story of a village cinema and the sadness of a way of life that cinema had lost forever.
The figures obtained by the ANECE, the main association of operators, speak for themselves: in the last five years 316 traditional type cinemas have closed their doors, with the highest billing going to the most important cinemas: 10 fewer in Florence, 9 in Milan, Naples, Bologna and Rome, 6 fewer in Turin, 5 in Palermo.
Among the regions most affected by closures, Emilia-Romagna is in first place with 82 cinema halls lost, followed by Tuscany (44) and Lombardy (41).
And as proof that the rise of multiplexes is the first to cause them to disappear, these three Italian regions have recorded the highest number of new multiplex cinemas: 195 more in Lombardy in the last five years, 81 more in both Tuscany and Emilia-Romagna.
'The Italian approach has developed irrationally', says Paolo Protti, President of Anecu, 'it is useful to create new structures, but it would be necessary to guarantee that the existing ones will survive, because when one cinema in a city closes, not all its visitors are willing to move to a multiplex.
Not to mention the lack of funding for the fund for the operators: the previous state debt is around 10 million euros.
From a moral and ethical point of view, it's a disgrace that the government doesn't respect existing laws.
Between 16 and 18 million euro per year would be needed to support the sector.
The case of Bologna is interesting, the first Italian city to have a problem with closures and to have decided to find a way out by signing a protocol between the municipality and Anec, the first of its kind in Italy to protect and promote small cinemas both in the historic centre and in the suburbs.
Among the planned standards are tax relief measures for operators and mobility benefits for the public: spectators will be able to drive to the restricted traffic zone and will have special prices for stopping and in some car parks.
'I like this initiative' says Giuseppe Tornatore, 'and I hope other cities will follow Bologna's example by introducing other measures.
But what is certain is that in order to counter the great power of multiplex, traditional theaters need to improve the quality of sound and video, because today's audiences are more demanding.
Defending the traditional cinema is a topic that has always been important: the closing of the Super Cinema in Bagheri, the place of my childhood and adolescence, was the spark that convinced me to found the "New Cinema Paradiso", which I had been thinking about for 10 years.
I've lived in Rome for 25 years, and when I walk past the Rialtes or Quirinale on the Rue Nazionale, where I shared so much emotion, so as not to have to look at the black dust signs, I turn the other way.
Political connections with the 'ndrangheta mafia group, Mayor Gioie Tauro in prison
"The mayor of Gioia Tauro was willing to rig the municipal elections to suit the interests of the Piromalli mafia".
The charges that the Directorate against the Mafia in Calabria has brought against the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Gioia, Giorgio Dal Torrione and Rosario Schiavone, and the Mayor of Rosarno, Carlo Martelli, who was arrested this morning for collaborating with the Mafia.
Also in the chain is Gioacchino Piromalli, the old mediator between the clan and the public administration, and his grandson, the lawyer, the boss's namesake, already accused of committing crimes of a mafia nature, sentenced to 10 million euros.
"They ignored all legal and moral norms as well as common sense", writes the prosecutor, after two local governments expressed their willingness to pay for consultations with Piromalli's lawyer.
"This would allow the Mafia group, "the lower magistrates, "to officially enter the city offices and facilitate already enormous possibilities of control and management of the public administration".
The president of the Calabria Regional Commission, Agazio Loiero, makes no secret of the fact that "secret agreements between local institutions and the organized criminal underworld are numerous in his region: "There are areas where the concentration of the mafia is stronger than in others, where secret agreements are inevitable.
But we also have many local politicians who resist the oppression of the 'ndranghetas, heroes who are still untouched".
The arrests this morning follow the arrests last July, in which police showed that the Piromalli mafia group had been hit once and for all.
Since late April last year - the Gioii Tauro City Council has been dissolved since 1991, due to the alleged links between organized crime and the local government - local politicians have been removed from office in the municipal government.
Giorgio Dal Torrione, chairman of the Christian Democrats, who, at the moment of dissolution, was elected head of the centre-right coalition after a close election in May.
He cried out over the scandal when the Prefecture ordered the dissolution of the city council.
He called the then Deputy Minister of the Interior, Marco Minniti, to account, accusing him of plotting for political reasons, but the judges in the arrest warrant signed this morning explain that the Mafia group even went so far as to request a change in the A3 highway project.
Further questioning ordered against Dal Torrione, writes the public prosecutor, revealed "a willingness to shift the claims of a businessman, a representative of some larger group very close, as is commonly known, to Piromallim and to adapt the elections of the public administration to the interests of the mafia group".
When energy is born from waves, the big ones come into play.
It's an infinite pool that covers over 70% of the Earth's surface and is now being explored by the world's major energy companies.
The waves, the currents, the tides, the ebbs are new sources of inexhaustible energy, caught in the eye of giants like Chevron, who are now trying to get their hands on these sources.
The possibility of generating energy from the sea's movements has been studied for more than a century, and research intensified in the 1970s in the wake of the first oil crisis.
When the price of oil fell in the 1980's, the idea of using marine energy was dropped, but now environmental organizations and new oil price increases have given the sector a new impetus.
The World Energy Council (WEC) in London in 2007 said that about 15 percent of the world's electricity consumption could be covered by the use of the movement of the waves of the sea.
That would be twice the amount of energy that is currently produced in nuclear power plants.
Plus, there are tides and currents.
The giants are attacking.
The company that invested in marine energy was Enersis, which in 2005 agreed to build a facility in northern Portugal.
When the plan was announced, it seemed like a huge, revolutionary move.
After two years of betting on marine energy, more and more companies are betting on marine energy rather than traditional energy.
"Chevron is studying ocean energy technology", a spokesman for a company linked to the U.S. oil giant told the Wall Street Journal, "and is considering a partnership with us".
The cooperation we're considering involves getting the U.S. Energy Commission's permits necessary to launch a project to harness marine energy in Alaska.
We cannot ignore this signal, especially when we consider that Alaska is where the US continues to drill for oil, and where President Bush recently announced plans for new drilling.
Besides Chevron, Verdant Power Inc. of New York and Ocean Power of New Jersey are tracking the trail of marine energy, and the sums invested so far, although not detailed, are seen by observers as showing growing interest.
Technology that needs to be developed.
Experts speak of a technology that is still in its infancy, because the environmental impact of harnessing marine energy is unknown.
For now, the installations in Portugal and some in Scotland are small and do not appear to be causing any major problems to the ecosystem.
But to produce more energy, we need to use technologies with a greater impact on the environment.
The methods are different: Ocean Power, for example, uses a system of buoys that are interconnected.
The force of the waves that move the buoys up and down is converted by means of cylinders and cylinders into hydraulic pressure inside the buoys.
Pressure spins the turbine, which supplies power to the generator.
Power is being fed to the shore by undersea cables.
There are currently four such facilities in the design phase, which are only awaiting federal approval, and some of the energy could be used for military purposes.
In contrast, Verdant Power already generates power for the shopping mall and parking lot using six offshore turbines in New York's East River.
The movement of water during the ebb and flow of the tide causes turbines to turn, and this turbulent motion powers the generator.
Verdant said they have a long list of clients waiting for the necessary permits to use the energy.
By the waves, by the tide, by the tide.
Of particular interest at this time is the potential of tidal currents, say at the Electric Power Research Institute.
Although it is a non-contiguous factor, the tides are more predictable than the wind, the sun or the waves, and therefore more reliable as a source of energy.
It is in tidal energy that states like New York, Maine and Alaska, along with other coastal states, have already invested $7.5 million in 2008 and are forecasting investments of up to $35 million for 2009.
