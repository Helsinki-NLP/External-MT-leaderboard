This not only confirms the well-known theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils cannot indicate, such as color or three-dimensional structure.
Scientists believe that the fur of this species is brownish-brown above and grey or yellow/orange below.
The discovery also provides insight into the evolution of bird feathers.
"Since dinosaur feathers do not have well-developed fur bodies, they are called tubular feathers, but they do have other features of feathers - silk and fur - so researchers suggest that the tubular feathers may be a later evolutionary development with these other features".
The structure of the feathers suggests that the feathers were not used for flight but for controlling body temperature or for show. The researchers suggested that, although this was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen represented a mature set of feathers rather than silk.
The researchers suggest that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows adult bird feathers and not the feathers of a chicken.

When a small group of organisms (small numbers) are separated from the main population (such as when they move across a mountain or a river, or to an island so far from where they originated that they have difficulty returning), the group of organisms will often be aware that they are in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptive abilities to become a more powerful competitor than they were before.
The original population is completely unchanged, they need adaptation as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, they begin to look less and less like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
This process is called species formation, which means the creation of a new species. The formation of a new species is an inevitable and extremely important consequence of evolution.

The rhinoceros is the top carnivore in its age, so it's not afraid of anything, except other rhinoceroses.
Its long jaws are attached to over 70 razor-sharp teeth and a set of extra teeth in its mouth, meaning that nothing can escape in its path.
We don't know for sure, but it may have a pointy tongue. Its diet includes turtles, big fish, other mosasaurs and it may even be a carnivore.

Minority cultures often disappear without leaving any valid historical evidence and without being recognized as a distinct civilization.
During the Revolutionary War, the original thirteen states formed a loose central government - only Congress was the sole member - modeled on the Articles of Confederation.
Parliament has no power to impose taxes, and since it has no national executive or judicial body, it has to rely on the authority of the states, which are often uncooperative, to enforce all decisions.
It also has no authority to amend the customs laws or the tax code between the states.
The charter required consensus from all states before it could be amended, and states downplayed central government to the point where state representatives were frequently absent.

For example, the most common still photography format in the world is 35mm, the film size that was prevalent before the end of the analog film era.
still being produced today but more importantly the frame rate inherited from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The 35 mm format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm high, which is somewhat confusing.
Therefore, the frame ratio for this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., APS formats) are equivalent to or close to this frame rate.
The rule of thirds is often ridiculed and abused as a simple guide that creates dynamics while still being used as a way to measure the order of a photograph.
According to this rule, the most useful location for the subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts vertically and horizontally (see examples).

n the past thousand years,Christianity has been the link between European nations,although there are still differences in language and customs.
Its unlimited power affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the core teachings of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty and that church endowments exist for that purpose.

During these times, fierce warfare occurred between many battles between nobles for the throne.
Third Dynasty was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands dying just to claim the throne in the great palace of Tian An.
There are many political and social implications such as the use of the metric system, the transition from monarchy to republic, nationalism and the belief that the country belongs to the people rather than to a ruler.
After the Revolution, the professions were opened to all men, helping the most ambitious to succeed.
This is also true for the military as military rankings are based on merit rather than rank.
The French Revolution also inspired many of the oppressed working class in many other countries, urging them to rise up.
Muhammad was deeply interested in these matters beyond the worldly life. He often went to a cave called Hira "on Mount Noor" ((light) to meditate.
The Hira Movement has survived the passage of time and has preserved a vivid image of the spiritual trend left by Muhammad.
Situated on top of one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, this cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
actually, it's not easy to find even if you know it exists. once in the cave it's completely isolated.
nothing but the sky high in the clouds, the mountains surrounding the ridges.A little world known and heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the seven wonders of the world that still stands today.

Giza, or the "Tombs of Giza" in Egypt's Valley of the Tombs, features many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many shrines, and statues of the Great Master.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the chiefs and relatives of Khufu's family.

Up means you should start at the top of the scale and push the scale up, and down means you should start at the slider (where your hand holds the scale) and drag the scale down.
Up tends to produce a softer sound, while down tends to produce a stronger and more assertive sound.
Feel free to mark them, but remember that printed arrows have musical meanings, so respect them.

on the carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd screaming and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the carriage windows.
Then one of the crowd waved the head of a royal soldier killed in the Palace of Versailles in front of the frightened Queen.
The war costs of US imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial government to pay for most of their expenses and interest on the floating bonds in the name of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the super profits from the exploitation of the Filipino people for a long time became the main source of income for US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar organization, you must understand the context that led to its birth.
The era in which these events took place is often referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history in the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
The Medieval Period occurs after the Medieval Period the Cyclic Period and before the Late Medieval Period, which conventionally ends around 1500.

Most explanations of technological decision-making have two ideas in common: technological development itself follows a path of its own, is not influenced by culture and politics, and technology has an "influence" opposite to existing societies, rather than conditional societies.
For example, one might say that motorized cars inevitably lead to the development of the road.
However, the national road network is not economically viable for a few cars, so new production methods are developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Car ownership has also led to an increase in traffic accidents, leading to new medical techniques to repair injuries to the body.
Romance had a major factor in cultural decision, derived from authors such as Goethe, Fichte and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography was embedded in individuals and over time customs and cultures associated with that area developed and these combined with social status were still better than dictatorial laws imposed.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was once considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It is famous for being the epicenter of the flourishing that began around 400 BC and lasted until about 1100 AD.
The city's status declined in the 12th century, largely because the Crusaders gave away gifts such as silk and spices that were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
At this time, the title of Fashion Capital was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th-11th and 14th centuries.

However, due to the delay in communication channels, the style in the West may be 25 to 30 years behind.
n the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style.n the result of the Crusades, one of the most important developments of the time was the people starting to use knots.

Self-supply agriculture is a simple system, usually only organic fertilizer, using stored seeds of native plant varieties that are compatible with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers followed a form of self-sufficient agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Culture brings together like-minded individuals who feel ostracized by social norms and helps them to feel like they belong.
A subculture may differ due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of its members.

Members of a cultural group often express their relationship through the use of distinctive styles and symbols such as fashion, eating habits, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite a few unfortunate cases of children involving neglect, unhappiness, or deliberate abuse, the lack of social contact coming from the caregiver as the child grows.
Some wild children have been held by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of this child is due to the parent's rejection of the severely mentally or physically impaired child.
Two years ago, a child who was a stray was abused.
Others are thought to be raised by animals; others are thought to be solitary in the wild.
When raised entirely by nonhuman animals, feral children exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to the animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference to humans.
While project-based learning makes learning easier and more fun, the Scaffolding education method goes one step further.

The teacher can be real or virtual, in other words, the teacher is a form of the teacher but as a little virtual assistant in Microsoft Office.
The Virtual Scaffolds method is embedded in the software and is intended to ask questions, remind, and explain processes that may challenge students to solve problems on their own.
Children are placed in substitute care for various reasons, ranging from indifference to abuse or even coercion.
No child deserves to grow up in an environment that is not nurtured, cared for and educated, which they are experiencing.
We found the nursery system to be a safe place for these children.
Our foster care system needs to provide safe housing, dedicated caregivers, stable educational environments, and reliable health care.
The warm room is supposed to provide the essentials that your previous home couldn't provide.
Internet combines elements of both public and private communication.
The unique characteristics of the Internet lead to many new aspects of how to use and approach contentment.
For example, academic and sociological factors are proposed as important drivers for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
Self-adhesion and Continuous Relativity were also seen as new motivating directions according to Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they conducted an investigation of your reading responses to online sites.
The use of video cameras has led to important discoveries in interpreting fleeting expressions, which are movements that occur within milliseconds of the face.
Especially, it is believed that one can detect someone lying by correctly interpreting a very small expression.
Oliver Sacks, in his speech to the president, shows how people who cannot understand speech because of brain damage can accurately judge honesty.
He even suggested that these abilities to interpret human behavior might also be present in other animals such as domestic dogs.
20th century studies have shown that there are two groups of genetic variants: diver and diver.
The mutation adds a new genetic variant and selection removes it from the expression variant group.
The split and re-merger goes on and on between the two groups throughout each generation.
In the desert, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans to meet the demand for essential amino acids from available plant sources.
Plus, failure to do so will lead to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The quickest sources of plant protein would be the proteins in leaves and stems, but they're hard for primates like us to digest unless they're cooked.
In contrast, animal feed (currants, termites, eggs) is not only easy to digest, but also provides abundant amounts of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
After all, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the protein problem in a way similar to how chimpanzees do in the prairies today.
Sleeping interference is the deliberate process of waking a person up during their normal sleep time and falling back to sleep a short time later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a nearly silent alarm clock to help you wake up without being completely awake.

Biotemporal choices include drinking lots of water (such as filter water or tea, known as urine) before bedtime that will make us wake up to urinate.
Peace of mind is the opposite of stress, which is the stress of body and mind.
The less stress, the more positive life force there is. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.

Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but is expanded by the compassionate path of Buddhism and many Indian Yoga techniques.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle.It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation and the path of love.
According to Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy is awakened through yoga poses, breathing exercises, spells and visualization.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Germany was a common enemy during WWII, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. At the end of WWII, conflict over systems, processes and cultures caused the two countries to split again.
In the two years after the war ended, the former allies were enemies and the Cold War began.
It's supposed to last for the next 40 years and be fought in real terms, by proxy troops, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba and many other places.

However, these plans collapsed almost overnight, as over 800,000 Soviet Red Army troops marched into and formed the Belarus and Ukraine fronts after invading eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Proliferation Treaty and other international treaties, both parallel and multilateral.
The use of ships to transport goods is the most efficient way at present to transport large numbers of people and goods by sea.
The traditional task of the navy is to ensure the maintenance of the nation's manpower and cargo capacity, while, at the same time, interfering with the movement of enemy manpower and cargo.
One of the most notable recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The United States tried to transport supplies and troops along the Atlantic to help the United Kingdom.
The German Navy also used U-boats to try to stop this flow.

Goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began keeping these animals for easy access to milk, hair, meat, and skin.
Goats were often raised as herds to roam the hills or other grazing areas, mostly led by children or teenagers, similar to sheep herding. These herd herding methods are still used today.
The coach was built in England in the early 16th century.
Though the wagon tracks consisted of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horse to pull at a faster speed and load a larger load than would be possible on the rough roads of everyday life.

This became the norm, but the iron made the fast horse wheel more damaged.
"The wooden wheel was finally replaced by the iron wheel. In 1767 the first all-iron railway was launched".
The earliest known form of transport was walking, with humans beginning to walk two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (i.e. upright man).
Their ancestor, the Australopithecus, did not have the ability to walk upright.
Characteristics of the bipedal species are found in the fossil Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs from seven million years ago.

This is similar to treating symptoms in many cases, but if we don't want a temporary solution, we need to find the root cause of the problem and how to neutralize it.
Clearly, the world has changed so much with human advancement in science and technology, and the problems are also exacerbated by overpopulation and the endless lifestyles of humans.
After being passed by Parliament on 4 July, the handwritten manuscript signed by Speaker John Hancock and Minister Charles Thomson was sent to John Dunlap's print shop a few buildings away.
Of the 150 to 200 prints that were created overnight, what is now known as the Dunlap Print.
The first reading of this document was by John Nixon at Independence Hall on July 8.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6, he read it to his troops in New York on July 9. A copy was sent to London on August 10.
Dunlap 25 is believed to be the oldest surviving copy of this document. The original handwritten copy is no longer extant.

Many people don't think these animals are dinosaurs because they have feathers and they can fly.
Though birds have a lot in common with dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws, they lay eggs and walk on their hind legs like T-Rexes.
Almost all computers we use today are based on converting information encoded in binary form.

Poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are often insufficient to make an immediate diagnosis.
The clearest sign of organ poisoning is probably the presence of an open container of toxic medicines or household chemicals.
Check the label for specific emergency instructions for specific toxins.
bọ is the official name for this group of insects.
The term stems from an ancient familiarity with bed bugs, a highly adaptable insect species that parasitizes humans.
Both bloodsuckers and bed bugs are late-breeders, adapted to living in a nest or living on a host.
United States, there are currently about 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurodegenerative disease in young and middle-aged people.
Polycystic fibrosisaffects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
The study found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that adopting a child is not in their best interests or in the child's.
The couple decided to plan an adoption.
In the adoption agreement, the biological parents terminate the rights of the parents so that another couple can raise their child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through scientific methods. This method has actually led to most scientific research.

Naturalists and philosophers focus on classical texts and especially the Latin Bible.
accept Aristotle's view of all matters pertaining to science, including psychology.
As the understanding of Greece declined, the West found itself cut off from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many of the rhythms observed in psychology and behavior often depend heavily on the presence of the endogenous cycle and the production of these rhythms through the biological clock.
The cyclic rhythm, not simply the responses to external cyclic signals, has been recorded for most living things, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator and will continue the cycle time running freely even without external influence.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the most convincing pieces of evidence that DNA is a type of genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, or viruses, to implant their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two experiments to mark the DNA sequence inside the placenta with a radioactive phosphorus compound or the placenta's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Genetic mutation can cause a variety of effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genome, and whether the affected cell is a stem cell.
Only mutations in the bacterial cell line can be passed on to the offspring, whereas mutations elsewhere can kill cells or cause cancer.

Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, and visiting parks and researching ecosystem information.
One example is to visit, photograph, and learn about the Borneo locusts.
Everyday morning, people drive from small towns to work and they pass others who are going to the exact place they just left to work.
In a powered car system, everyone is connected to and supported by a car system.
sciences now believe that this huge carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of the stable state that has helped humans evolve for the last two million years.
Everyone is involved in society and they use transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about these transportation systems.
In the developed world, you rarely hear the same level of complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems cause complaints, why do they make frequent mistakes? Are transport engineers not qualified? Or is there some more fundamental reason for this?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and how they interact with each other.
,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within the appropriate range; thus traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent and can be expressed mathematically in general terms.
To better simulate traffic flow, relationships between three key characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly, and their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and search for food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings back along their body.
They can hide in small places to escape predators.
Today, the only species of midges that cannot fold their wings are the finches and the hedgehogs.

The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It has eight times the water volume of the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, at times as wide as six miles.
20% of the water that flows from the rivers on this planet to the ocean comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 mi) long and is fed by thousands of smaller rivers.

The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed at the works of their ancestors that were still there thousands of years later.
Vatican City has a population of about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the least populous.
Vatican City uses Italian in its legal and official communications.
Italian is used as a daily language by those working at the state while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.
Vatican City is a Roman Catholic city.

Aristoteles theorized that all things are made from the combination of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, wind, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he theorized that they transition into new matter to form what we see.
Alloy is basically a mixture of two or more metals.Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like gold and silver.
You can also have alloys that contain small amounts of nonmetallic elements like carbon.

Sadly, as new writing methods began to appear, the pencil gradually lost its place and became less and less used.
Today, people write messages on a computer screen, never to touch a pencil again.
You can only wonder what this keyboard will look like when something new comes along.
Fisiologically, a fission bomb uses energy to combine atoms with more protons and neutrons.
like pushing a heavy truck up a hill, breaking it down again and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning that they tend to break up with little or no effect.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the mantle.
The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the left side and about 100 kilometers thick on the Moon's shrouded surface.
It is thinner below the maria and thicker at higher elevations.
There may be more basin impact on the adjacent ridge because the crust is thinner. The lava flows more easily from the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what makes people pay attention or attract them.
These theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that are absorbed from the outside as they grow up.
These theories look at what motivates some people to do what they want to do and what factors in the environment make them do or not do certain things.
Maslow's Tower of Fury and Hertzberg's Two-Factor Theory are two of the most popular theories.
generally speaking, there are two behaviors that can arise when a manager starts to lead ex-colleagues. the first is to try to maintain a close relationship.
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, applying disciplines, evaluating performance, delegating responsibility, and keeping people working responsibly.
someone will turn out to be a completely different person and feel they have to change everything the team is doing and doing on their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This action sometimes leads to a rift between the leader and the other team members.
Teamworking remotely has to meet the same quality standards as traditional teamwork, but there are still small differences.
Members of virtual groups often act as the point of contact for the real group members close to them.
They often have more autonomy than the regular members because their teams may meet on different time frames, which may not be sympathetic to their local management.
The presence of a real invisible team (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a special component of the virtual team.

Why does an organization have to go through the time-consuming process of establishing an educational institution? One goal for putting organized learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently throughout the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be fostered.
So the process of the organization working together to overcome some obstacle can lead to a new process of innovation to serve the needs of the customer.
Before an organisation can innovate, leadership needs to create a culture of innovation as well as sharing knowledge and exploration across the whole group.
Angel (2006) defines Continuous method as a method used to help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical method for investigating cognition. So it narrows down the scope of the study and makes it much more accurate.
The relationship between brain disease and treatment supports scientists in their research.
Long time we've known that different types of brain damage, trauma, disease, and tumor affect behavior and cause alterations in certain neuronal functions.
The development of new technologies has allowed us to observe and study structures and processes in the brain that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material to build simulations that help us understand the processes of the brain.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) is of great significance in the science fiction industry, AI also shapes an extremely important branch of computer science, processing behaviors, being capable of learning and sensing and simulating intelligence in machines.
Artificial Intelligence research involves creating machines that automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer diagnoses and customer questions, as well as handwriting, voice and facial recognition.
These have become their own rules, focused on providing solutions to practical problems in life.
AI systems are now commonly used in the economic, medical, engineering and military fields, as well as in many home computer applications and video game software.
